B00164KYV4|1.0|OMG...You'd think that with so many big names in this movie, that it would surley be a great movie...but OMG...my wife fell asleep on the couch, and I was stubborn enough to try and get through it...but it was everything I could do to not fall asleep.  Boring, Boring, Boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B001TH7GT6|4.0|These connectors are a little pricey but they have a nice heft and seem well constructed.  I used them to connect a standard DVD player (Toshiba) to a 32-inch Sony Bravia HDTV, and we get a terrific image from standard-def DVDs.  Is it due to this cable? I cannot say.  But we're satisfied.

0312370849|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and it was very interesting that I have never heard of the French rounding up all those people and own there own orders killing all those children. It also so sad how people try to ignore that this horrible time in history happened.
B002ZE43Z2|2.0|I bought this movie because I really like the Terminator series and wanted to see what that they have done with the storyline.  I was supremely disappointed.  While there are some good special effects, they are primarily composed of motorcycle and truck chase scenes that quickly become monotonous.   The storyline is dull and unimaginative, so much so that it's easy to stop paying attention and loose focus in the midst of one spectacular explosion after another.  It would have been nice if there was a strong story and the action sequences served to further the story, but sadly this is simply a special effects movie without a good plot.  At the end, once you realize it's finally over you're left wondering, \\"what just happened?\\"  They clearly left the door open for another Terminator movie, but this one was so bad that I have no anticipation to see the next chapter.  What a waste of money.

B002VPE1AM|3.0|Cameron and Jackson and lots of Hollywood people are really learning fast how to ride the new special effects bicycle and the effects in this movie, especially in 3D, are just astounding.  What cannot possibly be, is.  What cannot possibly happen, does.    For that reason alone I recommend the movie.  It was a very fun ride.  You will slap away bugs that never were, walk among beautifully rendered plant life, and swim in water that will make you wish you could just stop the movie for a few minutes and take some pictures.  But there isn't time between dodging rounds from weapons not yet invented and staring mouth-wide-open at the six-legged horse things and Banshees.    The special effects almost overcome the fatally flawed story line.  The movie has been done with more or less telling effect in Dances with Wolves, Pocahontas, and Fern Gully, among others (the bulldozer/rain forest scene is totally gratuitous, a two-minute afterthought that doesn't give the audience credit for understanding that Cameron is taking us through territory we know well).    In fact, this movie is a perfect example of why directors and producers need to leave the story-telling to story-tellers, in most cases.  Imagine how astonishing it would be to remake Frank Herbert's Dune with this new power to render whole worlds demonstrated in Avatar.  Imagine the battle of Gettysburg made of whole cloth, a canvas with 200,000 soldiers, 20,000 calvary, 250 cannon, and the assault on the third day rendered from perspectives other than a shaky helicopter that evokes Viet Nam more than 1863.    I credit Cameron for his vision and his new toys.  But even his \\"horses\\" look like Sioux spirit horse art right down to their brightly dotted manes.  So, yeehaw for the special effects and realism beyond comprehension, and yawn for the story.  We will have to wait a few more years for everyone to get the mechanicals down pat and then we should start to see some real UNREAL movies that really will blow our socks off on every level.     Oh, and it was cool to see Sigourney's body double.  She brings sci-fi cred to movies on the edge of reality and worked well in this piece.  Predictable but nice to see again.
B000UR9QGW|4.0|I purchased this movie, one of my all time favorites, in great anticipation of adding it to my blu Ray collection. Pretty disappointed that when I received it, the packaging looked all shriveled up and worn, as if it had sat outside overnight in a rainstorm and then someone tried to salvage it with a blow drier. Kind of lousy that anyone would even try to pass this item off to someone as a \\"new\\" purchase. Extremely disappointed.

However, 14 alternate titles to some of the books in the collection were also published, making a \\"complete\\" set 102 books. And some books were republished late in the series by other publishers. If you collected every single variation of the books, there are about 125 books in the set, although most people probably consider 88 or 102 to be a complete collection.

006135323X|4.0|This was sort of a like a Gladwell book with random studies and statistics.<br /><br />Definitely interesting and worthy of a read - especially if you want to know what makes people tick.
B000W91RUG|5.0|When I first heard of this series, I simply ignored it for the title.  After all, when I think of television and a title with \\"Big Bang\\" in it, I think tasteless sex jokes and slutty female characters.  Thanks, but there's too much of that already.<br /><br />The thing is, I received recommendations from several places, including online friends and bloggers who are very discriminating in their tastes.  I still held out even when one of my favorite authors gave it a rave review.<br /><br />Then I went to San Diego Comic Con in 2009.  I was between conference rooms and decided to wait out through a few panels before the one I wanted took place.  When they announced the panel for The Big Bang Theory, a tickle of memory came to me and I realized I had never even tried to check out the series, but lucky me, there was a preview of the first two seasons that the crowd around me started cheering madly over.<br /><br />I sat patiently and waited while the lights dimmed.  When it was over, I was still fighting to laugh out loud over the amazing clips I'd seen.  If this show was anything as good as those scenes, I've been a fool for avoiding it for so long.<br /><br />I've since bought the first season and will own the second soon.  I'm DVR-ing the third season so I don't get ahead of myself and can honestly say this series is in a class above all others.  I love these characters, love the comedy and cannot wait to see what has been happening while I was wasting my time on other series in other channels.<br /><br />I recommend this show for anyone who loves to laugh and loves to see what an extreme sport it truly is to be intelligent to a fault.<br /><br />'nuff said!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000W91RUG The Big Bang Theory: The Complete First Season]]

B002VPE1AM|1.0|First off this movie isnt even a product yet, So why waste your time typeing GO BLOG or something about your life. 2nd This movie isnt even good in 3D! if you didnt see it in 3D, you obviously wasted 2 hours and 40 min of your life. Its 5 stars for visuals but thats about it.     This movie is like Pocahontas Meets World of Warcraft Meets Last Samurai meets Dances with wolves. This movie was only made for freaking cameron to express his views on the military (Which he clearly hates) How humans are \\"Apparently\\" destroying the earth (freaking activist i hate CAMERON) the only great movie he has ever done is T2. Aliens 1 and 2 where ok. Titanic was crap and not only that Cameron recycled his composer for Titanic and used the same guy (James Horner for this one) I was not impressed by the very weak story in this film. I would rather watch Disney's Pochontas which had BETTER music and a better story. infact PIXAR ANY movie has better then this crap. Save your self $15.00 in IMAX 3D and go watch something else like UP or Star Trek or Sherlock Holmes. The only reason I saw this is my mom took me to see it.     I wasted my life on this movie you shouldnt either. the Story blew.      However, one thing i will Nod to James is he created this entire universe from scratch kudos for that. This isnt cinema this is ripping off people and makeing Cameron a Titanic 2.
B002YP4EPG|4.0|Well in Aug 2009 I started to get excited about this new release from Steve which was due later in the year! You see I had just booked my ticket to see one of my favourite musicians live in the Shepherd's Bush Arena in London in November. The only other time I had seen Steve live was in the National Stadium Dublin in 1972 with a then mainly unknown little band called Genesis!! (believe it or not Genesis were playing support to Lindisfarne on that tour...incredible when I think back on it now?) Anyway the London gig was just amazing!! Steve was in top form and playing brilliantly. He played a good few tasters from the \\"Out Of The Tunnel's Mouth\\" and I was impressed. I purcased my copy at the gig and over the next few days I began the the the pleasureable journey of \\"digesting\\" the new album....    I have been a Genesis fan since \\"Nursery Crime\\" which was Steve's first album with the band. From that time on I loved his guitar playing and to this day I would look upon him as being one of the greatest and most innovative guitarists and musicians of the last 4 decades. Most of his albums have been brilliant and  \\"Out Of The Tunnel's Mouth\\" is no exception.    The album is different to what i would have expected after his last two rock albums \\"Wild Orchids\\" and it's predesessor \\"To Watch The Storms\\". These were both masterful works and surpassed anything he had done up until then. With \\"OOTTM\\" he has kept things much simpler and made(by his own admission)a more personal album.  Yes of course it is great and is unmistakably Steve Hackett!! Like many of his recordings it is also very varied with plenty of surprises. On \\"Emerald And Ash\\" which is one of the most beautiful songs he has ever written there are reminiscences of Genesis with some lovely lyrical imagery. \\"Fire on the moon\\" \\"Sleepers and \\"Nomads\\" are in the same style and are very dreamy. There is exceptoinal playing and production throughout with Steve shining on electric and acoustic guitar. Some of his best guitar work ever has to be on \\"Still Waters\\" I even hear echoes of \\"Supper's Ready\\" in \\"Sleepers\\"!..? Thanks Steve!for some more incredible music....
B0000009SG|5.0|I've been a FZ fan since I was in 8th grade.  I originally bought Overnight Sensation on 8-track when I was a high school senior, back in '73, and literally played it to death.  Which wasn't too touch when you consider how flaky 8-tracks were.  I replaced it with a quadraphonic 8-track version in '76 and bought it again on vinyl when I bought my Technics Quartz SL10 turntable in '79.  I copied it onto a series of cassettes until I finally got it on CD in '88.  I've purchased it on CD 3 times since then, but somehow the CDs end up missing.  As I write this, a new one is waiting in my \\"Cart\\" for me to finalize the transaction.<br /><br />Just for fun I've read some of the negative reviews of this album, which seem to have been written by joyless pseudo intellectual douches.  Just the type of person the late Mr. Z targeted...  NOT!!!!!  I've found this album to be the ideal introductory album for bringing new-found fans into the fold.  It's tame enough for younger teens to sample and enjoy, though Dyna-Mo Hum could perceived as be a bit too raunchy, there's still no actual \\"profanity\\" on the album.  It's amazing to see someone who has grown up under the prevalence of rap, hear I'm The Slime for the first time and identify Frank's brilliant pre-rap \\"rap\\".<br /><br />IMHO there's not really a bad song on the whole album, though I still have my reservations about Montana.  It's a solid album and I have thoroughly enjoyed listening to it for 36 years, and counting.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|Would you believe I'd never seen this movie till this year?  Yep, it's true.    Anyway, Dirty Dancing is a relatively simple story, with quite a few scenes where there is no dialogue, and many scenes of practicing for a dance or really dancing.  The cast is not fantastic but perfectly decent, and this is a very watchable and enjoyable flick for a rainy afternoon or an evening at home.  Patrick Swayze truly was a great dancer with a marvelous body, may he rest in peace.  Jennifer Grey made a good partner for him as Baby, the girl from a well-off family who falls for a guy who came from the streets.  It's a familiar plot, but it is pulled off well here.
B000089RV6|5.0|Simply stated, this is one of the greatest rock albums ever produced.  Buy it.
B002VPE1AM|4.0|At the time of writing this, Avatar has made over $1 Billion worldwide. An amazing feat and yet it all seems to ring a little hollow. More on that sentiment shortly as I focus on the praise it would be foolish to deny this film for it's technical achievments. This is a finely crafted form and function altering film. There's 3-D a la Beowulf, A Christmas Story, Toy Story and then there's the immersion that is present in lush detail in almost every scene in Avatar. Blades of grass, altitudes and subtleties abound.   The 'green' message here is obviously present in an anti-industry plot that puts the viewer square inside the minds of the Na'vi, the tribal race that makes every effort to protect the lush planet from mining of rare minerals by humans. The human component is big-business, seeming to expand on the technology visualized in 'Aliens'.   Every aspect of these cultures is breezed into the viewers eyes and rotated for picture perfect clarity. It's almost a shame that the 3-D thrill wears off after the initial exposure to the mechanism so tightly wound into the thrill of what is on the screen. If any scenes from the latter part of the film were the first exposure, jaws would drop. The subtle introduction to the 3-D effect is quite effective nonetheless and Avatar succeeds on these merits. Breaking the plot down is an entirely different animal. Although Avatar is, put simply, a no-expense spared revisioning of Ferngully, there were serious messages on glaring display that may tend to mar this film if it is to be reflected on beyond the 'cool' factor.   Avatar, the word itself means, in computer games, a character or persona of a player with a graphical representation. In the Massively Multiple Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG), an Avatar grows and becomes a separate networked character complete with online relationships, attainments and abilities beyond normal human endeavor. Jake Sully, the main character in Avatar, is in a wheelchair and as times goes by, his Avatar's involvement with the Na'vi serves to weaken his physical state even further, showing weight loss, scruffy hair and unkept beard. SPOILER TO FOLLOW: In short, the obvious message here is as technology caters to the furthering of experience from the human body, the less the human body is needed. When Jake Sully eventually depletes his wheelchair bound human body, gathering enough strength in his Na'vi Avatar, he leaves the human body to die so he can exist solely in the Avatar. There are even comments later on about the human Jake's neglect of hygiene. With a story so closely linked to the MMORPG social settings catering more to a virtual social realm, forsaking real social settings, the message ultimately makes Avatar a hidden downer of a film. Despite the visual enjoyment and the obvious graphical talent on display here, it's unfortunate that Avatar doesn't make the virtual reality trumping reality message a bit more cryptic.
B002VECMAY|5.0|I was not a fan of Jason Reitman's last film, the over-hyped \\"Juno,\\" but I thought I'd enjoy \\"Up in the Air\\" based on the cast and premise.  Indeed, \\"Up in the Air\\" is far superior to the self-conscious \\"Juno;\\" in fact, it's one of the best dramedies in recent years.  The perfectly cast George Clooney plays Ryan Bingham, who works for an Omaha-based company that fires people for other companies.  He terminates employees all over the country, so he spends most of his times \\"up in the air\\" travelling to different cities.  For him, traveling isn't just a job - it's a lifestyle - and he remains firmly rootless, which means avoiding relationships as well.  Eventually, he meets a beautiful fellow frequent flyer (Vera Farmiga) with whom he develops a \\"no strings\\" relationship.  They meet up whenever they happen to be in the same city for business.  Bingham is forced to examine his life, though, when his company threatens to pull him off the road and then saddles him for his final trips with a young newcomer (Anna Kendrick).<br /><br />\\"Up in the Air\\" is a timely movie that taps into the apprehension so many people currently have about possibly being fired, and it speaks to the death knell of the concept of people working for the same company their entire lives.  The air of chilly detachment the movie invokes captures this post-9/11 era of financial uncertainty, with Bingham the model of professional and emotional detachment.  The movie manages to be darkly funny, perhaps because so much of it strikes a chord, often in a painful way.  Incidentally, if the segments of people being fired often seem real, it's because Reitman put ads in newspapers recruiting people who had recently been laid off and claimed that it was for a documentary.  He filmed them discussing their experiences and then asked them to re-enact their firing!<br /><br />Reitman wrote each part with the current cast in mind, and the actors really deliver.  Clooney's brand of sexy aloofness is ideal for the role, and Farmiga has never been better as his equally chilly \\"girlfriend.\\"  The two have been racking up award nominations, including the Golden Globes and Screen Actors Guild Awards.  I wasn't very familiar with Anna Kendrick previously, but she is also very good as the young somewhat shrill hotshot who is paired with Clooney.  She also has received numerous award nominations and is considered a lock for an Oscar nomination.  Ultimate credit for the movie, though, goes to Reitman, who has shown tremendous growth since \\"Juno.\\"  His direction is amazing and the script, adapted from a 2001 novel by Walter Kirn, is easily the best of the year; I particularly admire how it refuses to take the easy way out.  The only thing I didn't like about the film is the sometimes twee soundtrack which sometime undercuts the drama of the situations.  Otherwise, \\"Up in the Air\\" signals the maturation of a major directing talent.ga has never been better as his equally chilly \\"girlfriend.\\"  The two have been racking up award nominations, including the Golden Globes and Screen Actors Guild Awards.

B00192IV0O|1.0|enough with this auto tuned electronic boom boom terrible horrible whatever. worst album of 2009, that's all i have to say. skip this, buy Elephunk or Monkey Bussines!!!
B001I82RVS|5.0|There are definitely a lot of people who do not enjoy the extremely satirized depiction of violence in this movie.  However, I personally prefer movies that are honest with themselves regarding the level of fantasy they are aiming to achieve.     This movie's completely unrealistic in terms of gore, violence, characters, and setting. There are even some holes in the plot. But it's still an exceptional movie because it aims to do things that weren't been done before, and it does so in a very innovative manner.
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|I just finished the second season of this series, which I did not catch while it was in first runs on TV.  The snappy dialogue and quirky characters continue to amuse and surprise as we watch Lorelai and Chris almost get back together.  Rory becomes more of a friend to Paris but less of a girlfriend to poor Dean in favor of tough guy Jess, Sookie and Jackson finally hook up, Luke remains Lor's best pal, and Taylor Doose still drives everybody crazy while Kirk is...well, oddball Kirk.  And then there's that minstrel.  And Rory's funny friend Lane, whom I feel sorry for because of her too-strict mother.    Anticipating the third season.

B002H3F7F6|4.0|First, before listening to this cd, make certain that it is either a dark winter afternoon or a dark winter night.  Light a few candles.  And, if you don't read the entire liner booklet, take a nice, long look at the photos.    Now you are ready to listen to \\"If On A Winter's Night\\".  :)    I thoroughly enjoyed this cd, even though it is not like any other I have ever had.  The music is haunting and beautiful, the lyrics at once familiar and not, and Sting's vocals sing the words with soul.    Perfect for on a winter's night.    (But personally, and this has nothing at all to do with the cd, I really wish that Sting would get rid of the beard...)
B001QWBM62|5.0|I'm a classical musician (clarinet).  This is much better than any other recording device I have ever tried...the quality is just as good (if not better) than professional recordings made using the microphones in our symphony hall.  Worth the money!!!
B002SVBDYQ|2.0|I absolutely love the Twilight Soundtrack....the movie No. The soundtrack was bought for me before I was TAKEN the movie, this I must confess, is really what made it watchable for me. So, please tell me what HAPPENED on the New Moon Soundtrack?? (The movie is not my concern!) It's just OK. There are just enough good songs to keep it from being (BLEH). And what is THE MEADOW? Its uninspiring, and forgettable. If this is what the Score has to offer then I think I'll pass. Saviors on this album include (but not limited too) Bon Iver, Sea Wolf, Band of Skulls, The Killers, Thom Yorke. Muse doesn't makes this list; neither does that \\"grow\\" on you whiny Death Cab for Cutie song...yes, I get it, everything ends. Let's be fair, if the movie is barely passing the music should AT LEAST BE AWESOME! (Don't worry KS, ur awesome & no one blames u, ur just working with what u've got.)
B002UPA4ZY|5.0|Of course I love Andrea Bocelli and have most of his CD's. I have a collection of six Christmas CD's that I play during the holidays but this holiday there was only one that was played over and over. \\"My Christmas\\". I am still not tired of listening to it. I think Andrea and Foster had a blast making this CD. I really enjoyed the duet's and the pairing of Andrea with the children and the Muppets. If you saw the special, you can see the fun. My favorite selections are \\"The Lord's Prayer\\"; \\"Angels We Have Heard on High\\"; 'Adeste Fidelis'; and \\"Cantique De Noël\\". The entire CD is wonderful. If you enjoy listening to Bocelli, you can't miss with this CD.
B002QGUFWE|5.0|I almost gave this album a lower rating because of the ridiculous editing of curse words, but the songs are soooo great, I had to let it go.  Lady Gaga seems more free to follow her muse on this cd than she did on 'The Fame,' and the results are just awesome.  The album has the same power pop as its predecessor, but it also has tracks that evoke vintage Madonna, Queen, and ABBA.  I love every song, and there seem to be no throwaway tracks.  Brilliant!

0307716988|4.0|This is a really easy to read book. Very matter of fact and as it's written by Michael Jackson himself it is a real joy. It's a very nice looking book as well and  I particularly  like the way his signature is  on one of the front pages so you feel as though he has actually signed it for the reader.  It's delightful.  It is interesting how the reader has the opportunity to 'hear' Michael Jackson's version and intepretation of various events, which is  markedly different from the tabloid press and various writers. If you have already read  books about Michael Jackson, you will recognise  some of the events mentioned in the book. The reader gets an insight into Michael Jackson's interpretation of the world rather than the tabloids' interpretation of Michael Jackson's world.
0399215980|1.0|We own several of Eric Carle's books. \\"[[ASIN:0805087184 Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?: 40th Anniversary Edition (Brown Bear and Friends)]]\\" was one of our son's favorites. We would read it every day. We received \\"[[ASIN:0399215980 Do You Want to Be My Friend?]]\\" as a gift. The book itself is small, which can be great for little readers or a disappointment to those who expect a larger book like \\"[[ASIN:0399247459 The Very Hungry Caterpillar: board book & CD]]\\". The illustrations are what you would expect from Eric Carle. The book's message, however, compelled me to write this review.     The book's story tells of a mouse who happens upon tails belonging to different animals asking if they would like to be his friend. Each animal simply tells the mouse, \\"No\\", followed by a description of a significant difference between the animal's tail and the mouse's. Finally the mouse asks another mouse who also has a small gray tail just like the mouse. The mouse responds, \\"Yes\\". We interpreted the message as one of intolerance, discrimination, and bigotry. Perhaps someone can discern a different message. Certainly the story can be seen as representative of certain aspects of reality. We just don't find the story appropriate for the age of the intended audience and would not choose this book for our early readers.
B0015HOFZI|4.0|Pros: Simple to install and set up, and very easy to use for basic recording/transferring of vinyl to digital files on computer. Sound quality (played back on my i-pod) is excellent, and the software will substantially reduce extraneous noise (pops, crackles, etc.) from the album. A Wizard on the software takes you through the process step by step the first time through and from then on it's a breeze. I have not hooked up the turntable to my stereo yet, being content at present to focus on transferring songs to i-tunes.     Cons: Software is poor at detecting tracks, and although you can go through and change this after the fact, it is difficult to do (and there is not much in the way of help through instruction manuals, which have become a thing of the past).  As a result, I just record track by track - not a huge disadvantage in my mind because I tend not to want to record the entire album, and only am interested in recording certain songs anyway.  When I do want to record an entire album, however, this is a big inconvenience.      Also, when connecting to the computer via the USB cable, it is impossible to hear the sound on the computer during the recording process, requiring the user to listen very closely to the faint sound emanating from the record album / stylus.  Despite what you may read on other posts,this is not easily correctable by changing the default sound card for playback on Control Panel of the computer (which you will need to do anyway or you will no longer be able to hear anything, e.g., i-tunes, or your computer) or by checking the \\"monitor recording level\\" box on the software.  Note the following from the Sony website:    \\"If the turntable is connected to the computer via USB using the Sonic Foundry® Sound Forge® LE software, you will not be able to hear any music during the recording. This is normal operation. In order to listen to the music while recording, use the audio connecting cord to output (analog) to a sound card on the computer oruse an external receiver with an audio input.\\"    OK, but darn inconvenient since the USB cable offers the simplest means of connecting the turntable to the computer.    Summary: I am quite pleased overall with the turntable despite the drawbacks noted.  It is great to recapture all the songs from vinyl that I have not listened to in years!

B000WMFZNS|5.0|Watching this most inspiring Golden Globe winning epic movie is sublime. This is the confession of a producer's more or less aging son.  Everyone should submit at least once, for it will sweep you away in scenarios of unparalleled feeling, magnitude, forcefulness, and technical movie making mastery.  Yet, what is most interesting apart from the almost flawless artistry of the project, is its double transformative historical reality.  Then, in its 11th Century context, the struggles between the competing poles of Christianity with its richness and power craven aristocratic advocates versus the evolved, indigenous, Islamic society, cruelly forged the wrenching transformation of Spain and much of Europe. Those fierce battles purged a dual richness of culture whose amputation still haunts and deprives Europe of a great possible ecumenism. We see every day the dogmatic legacy of a millenieum of internicine conflict.  It's emulation is animated her in \\"El Cid\\". What is equally dramatic is the role the making of this movie, centuries later, had in transforming the image and economy of Spain again in the 60s when Spain was marketed and perceived in its utter cliche form as a culture of castanets, flamenco gypsies and, bull fighting.  With the making of El Cid, Spain's image changed profoundly.  So powerful was the influence of the movies' production on tourism, commerce, and diplomatic relationships, that the pall of Axis ally that hung over the Franco Regime was virtually erased and again a paradigm shift occurred.  There are so many levels the magnificent Weinstein remastered DVD package offers to a critical viewer.  It is hard not to focus on the artistic brilliance of the all real production and its gargantuan management but, in another viewing, ponder the political influence this project had in its time reveals whole other exercise in critical awareness to move the repeat viewer.

He follows that with a revealing survey of anatomical & biologic structures common in worms, fish, birds, tetrapods, & humans and how they progressed along the way. Anybody who thinks that homo sapiens are \\"special\\", \\"unique\\", or the apex of creation should reconsider that assumption. Forget decending from apes, we come from fish!   Well written & easily understood for the biology-challenged among us.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|I thought I knew a lot about nutrition and the food that I eat, but there were some things in this documentary that surprised even me.  I think one of the most eye opening things about it was in the beginning where they show aisles and aisles of supermarket space all filled with a seemingly endless variety of foods.  But as the movie continues you come to find out that there are very few different ingredients in all of these foods, a high percentage of it is corn, soy and chemicals.  After watching it, I looked at the labels in my local grocery store and was amazed at how true that is.<br /><br />The one argument in favor of processed foods in my mind was that there's more of a variety than the whole natural foods that my family normally eats.  Sometimes it's hard to be creative without resorting to processed ingredients, but maybe that's just laziness on my part.  After watching this and seeing not only the origin of some of the foods we eat, but the social and environmental implications of foods we purchase, I can see that it's worth it in so many ways to go out of my way to buy only whole, unprocessed foods.  The extra money spent on organic is well spent.  We need to start voicing our opinions with what we spend our money on because according to this film, that's the only voice we have.<br /><br />Coincidentally, I just finished reading a techno-thriller novel [[ASIN:0525951571 Freedom (TM)]] that has parts that tie into this same subject, people taking back the right to a clean and safe food supply.  The book is fiction, but maybe not so far \\"out there\\" as I thought while reading it.
006088732X|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and can not wait to read the others in the series. I would have to say that I related a little to all of the girls in this book. Even Alison who disappears. All of the girls are best friends until Alison vanishes and they drift apart from each other. I related to this-not in the whole friend missing part-but with being in school and putting up with all of the drama and not talking to a certain friend for a while or getting a whole new clique and starting over.<br />Spencer was the girl who always seemed to get the attention of her sisters boyfriends, and they wanted her too. I can related to Spencer, Not that I had an older sister, or any sister at all, but of being young and seeing all of the older hot guys.<br />Aria is the girl who has the \\"thing\\" with her English teacher. I really enjoyed her part of the story. I had a huge crush on the boys gym teacher at my school. I thought he was, and still is sexy! :)<br />Emily had the crush on the new girl at school. I can't related to this part of the story, but I know how it was being confused and not sure on what to do.<br />With Hanna I can truly relate to her. She is the bigger girl in school who goes to drastic measures to lose weight. But I do know what it was like being a little bigger than some girls in my school and not feeling as pretty as I should have. I still feel this way sometimes, and I am sure other's can relate to this.<br />I even related to Alison, the friend who likes to be in control and order others around. My fiance would probably say I am still like that. :)<br />I really liked this book, I finished it in a day. I found myself feeling sorry for some of the girls and just in shock of some of the others.
B0029O08WA|1.0|[[ASIN:B0029O08WA The Twilight Saga: New Moon Soundtrack]]  Disappointing New Moon Soundtrack, January 10, 2010   By  Robert J. Niemic     Review of \\"The Twilight Saga: New Moon Soundtrack\\"   Not too much is worth listening to on the \\"New Moon Soundtrack\\" (by various artists) album. The only super rock track is \\"Meet Me on the Equinox\\" by the very versatile Death Cab for Cutie. This track has been widely released already for radio/Web channel play, MP3-download, and as a music video. The video is on the \\"New Moon Soundtrack Deluxe Version\\" (CD & DVD), along with not much else extra -- unless you're interested in a recording of an interview with Death Cab for Cutie.     Surprisingly, the second best song on the \\"New Moon Soundtrack\\" is the soft piano track called \\"New Moon (the Meadow)\\" performed by Alexandre Desplat. What's surprising is that I'm predominantly a fan of Alternative Rock & Rock music. It's an indication of how mediocre the other tracks are, if I prefer the soft piano piece to nearly all others. The Desplat-composed melody is an original score work for the movie. Reportedly, Desplat is a \\"new French composer.\\" He's the composer of the movie's score, which, FYI, as a whole is no where nearly as good as the song \\"New Moon (the Meadow).\\"     I'm disappointed in The Killers' track, \\"A White Demon Love Song.\\" Although not completely without merit, I find it's moody and basically lackluster, even though I'm a super fan of The Killers. This track fits the melancholy theme of the whole album. Even the remix track by the super, new group Muse is low key; I'd rate this my third favorite song. Tied for third is \\"Hearing Damage\\" by Thom Yorke, which was very effectively used with visuals in the film.     If I had to rate the quality of some of the other tracks, I'd list the following (in no particular order) as worthy of at least one listening: \\"Monsters\\" by Hurricane Bells. \\"Friends\\" by Band Of Skulls, \\"Rosyln\\" by Bon Iver & St. Vincent, and \\"The Violet Hour\\" bySea Wolf.     The New Moon movie by the way is fantastic--just about as good as Twilight.
B002UXRZS0|5.0|I have many of Jamie Olivers books, and this one is nicely different. I so appreciate how he changes his types of books but keeps his style of inventive yet practical recipes. Very good addition to my cookbook library.
0446567337|5.0|I absolutely loved the book.After the first section I didnt expect any of what followed to happen, which made it that more interesting.    The books about love so strong, even through pain and heartache your still willing to do whatever it takes to make that person happy.
B000ZELISO|5.0|Continues to be a series of highest quality and production values.  Although this one is more of a cliff-hanger than the previous ones, it was to be expected, since there is only one book (and two movies) left to complete the series.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|this is a really good movie. I have watched all 3 ice ages. I like them all
B00005OCMR|5.0|Very Good Movie, if your a computer geek like me you should like this movie.

B0006AAS5G|5.0|I have owned a Rolex Sub for the past 20 years and it has been an excellent watch.  I wanted a watch which I could wear for everyday and save the Rolex.  The Invicta Speedway looked like the perfect stand-in.  When it arrived I was impressed at the packaging.    The weight of the watch was perfect.  It has a feeling of quality.  The band was easy to size and certainly has weight.  In fact I like it better than the Rolex.  To replace the band on the Sub is around $500, I could purchase 5 of these watches for that.   The dials are easy to set and it keeps better time than the Rolex.  This is to be expected with quartz compared to an automatic movement.  I doubt you could find a better value than this Invicta.  I plan to order others in the future.
B0001KL5DA|5.0|This is by far the greatest series ever! It is very true to the profession and realistic.
1439157383|3.0|This is all I have to say: The book was great, marvelous, very interesting, till she ruined it in the last 20 pages. The end was out of the blue, farfetched, a disapoinment. I would have given it a 5 stars rate but the end ruined the book for me.
B0028RXXFC|4.0|HBO seems to have a golden touch. The majority of their shows are brilliantly done. Rome is no exception. It is, without a doubt, one of their finest shows produced to date. It's a shame production values brought the show to a halt after only two seasons, but a one million per episode is a tad outrageous.    This box-set is a great one. The quality put into the design of the packaging is great, it shows some genuine creativity and is nicely compact. The packaging is also where my one and only complaint about this set lays. The way the discs lay inside the casing down right sucks. They aren't held on nubs like regular packaging, rather in a 50/50 open-closed cardboard slot. By that I mean there is a full circle space for the blu-ray to sit in and half of the top is covered, so there is half of the top of the disc exposed. There is a small slit cut-out on each circle for you to get a finger underneath and pull the disc out. It's a real struggle to get the discs out of there the first few times because it's very form fitting and you have to pull fairly hard to get them out. This causes other problems too, as I was pulling out the last disc of season two a piece of the cardboard ring holding the disc in-place got ripped and when I pulled the disc out a piece sticking up scratched my brand-new disc. Qualms aside, this package offers quite it's fair share of quality. The whole season, a dozen subtitle languages, half a dozen dubbed languages, commentary on every episode. The picture quality is good for blu-ray, that will also depend on your home theatre, but all in all I found it to be just good. Not outstanding.
B000BNI99K|5.0|I always put music on my terrific Bose radio before I go to sleep. In the past I'd listen to carley simon, michael buble, frank and many others so I could go to sleep.

B002L5GQGY|5.0|I've only been aware of Joe for about 3 years but I own everything I could find from him. I watch the dvd at home and listen to his music at work. I love to listen to all the versions of his songs and love them all. He seems to simplify and soften them over time. Joe's guitar doesn't scream at me it sings to me and involves me like few others. I have my tickets for Seattle in March and am counting down the days. I have many music dvds and this is my favorite.
0805091742|4.0|Every once in awhile a book comes along that changes how you think about things, and makes you more effective in many areas of your life.<br /><br />This is one of those books.<br /><br />The book has some weaknesses, which have been alluded to by other reviewers. The anecdotal information, and studies, are laid on thick. The book could have skipped these, and been more concise, and given more concrete guidance for the creation of check lists.<br /><br />That said, the books strengths FAR outweigh its weaknesses. I have tested the content of this book by creating checklists for tasks at work, and I have found that I am much more competent and less likely to miss things when I take the time to a) draw up a checklist, and b) make sure I follow it.<br /><br />The book is written in an incredibly popular and accessible style that makes it easy reading. It is very convincing, and is a must read for anyone who has responsibilities to manage... and who doesn't?<br /><br />I particularly found the stories about lives saved inspiring.<br /><br />I was so taken by the ideas in the book I have started applying them in my everyday life. Interestingly enough, the ideas in this book most helped me in the area of parenting.<br /><br />I believe in yell-free/spank-free discipline when raising kids; and with three kids under the age of 6 it can be a big challenge putting this conviction into practice.<br /><br />Using my two favorite books on the subject [[ASIN:1889140244 1-2-3 Magic for Christian Parents: Effective Discipline for Children 2-12]] and [[ASIN:0879737301 Parenting With Grace: Catholic Parent's Guide to Raising Almost Perfect Kids]]I designed a checklist to follow whenever there was a discipline issue in the house.<br /><br />I then posted the checklist up high where the adults can see it in the rooms in the house we are around the kids (the living room, the bed rooms, the bathroom etc.)<br /><br />Then I informed all the adults in the house, including grandma, that thechecklist was up. My wife and I were on-board already as we have read the books and agree with the philosophy, but Grandma sometimes struggles with living in our house with the kids and responding to the challenges they sometimes pose.<br /><br />Once the checklist was up the adults talked and we agreed to intervene when any adult veered off the checklist when addressing a behavior problem. The intervention was just to get the adult in question's attention and say \\"checklist.\\" That's it.<br /><br />This was two weeks ago.<br /><br />Result: MUCH happier kids. I mean night and day happier. Much calmer parents and grandparent. MUCH more effective discipline. I am talking about HUGE improvements here.<br /><br />My conclusion? Just reading the books on parenting and believing in the system and philosophy they outline is NOT enough to implement changes effectively in the household. Checklists are the tool that actually works.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
1416550542|5.0|The story is magnificently written- this book will make you want to keep reading until the end! Loved it!
B002RSDW80|5.0|My wife and I thoughly enjoyed this movie.  Meryl Streep's Julia Child was outstanding.  Could watch this again.
B002LC8HF0|5.0|I love the way Brandon Sanderson is able to draw small, seemingly insignificant details from the earier books to explain the odd happenings that are being caused by Ruin.  The whole book is a series of twists and turns that you'll never see coming, and the revelations that the cast of characters has just draw you deeper and deeper into the story. It's a truely magnificent book.
0812973992|3.0|I bought this book after Amazon named it the best book of 2009.  I found this a very difficult book to get through -- especially the first two-thirds of it.  Having said that, I'm glad I persevered.    So many people making so many tragic choices!  It wasn't pleasant reading, and it was pretty frustrating and depressing for long stretches.  There were a few bright spots though.  Let me just talk about a few of the characters that I found most compelling, without giving too much away.    Corrigan is a priest, but his faith in God is twisted and pretty toxic.  He never seems to understand God's extravagant love, grace, and mercy.  I was pulling for him to realize how much God loves him, but I don't think he got there.  There is a lot about Corrigan to admire though.  He took care of the lowest of the low -- strung out prostitutes -- but it felt more like they were dragging him down, rather than him lifting them up.  Still, there is good food for thought in Corrigan's story.  What does faith in action look like?    Gloria is an educated, African American woman, who lost three sons in Vietnam.  There is a lot to respect and love about Gloria.  She takes in two young girls after their mother dies in a car accident.  The little girls, it seemed, were doomed to repeat the mistakes of their prostitute mother and grandmother.  But Gloria rescues them from all of that.  We get the satisfaction of seeing that she really did change the trajectory those girls were on.  She saved them.  In a tangential storyline, Gloria befriends a woman from a Park Avenue penthouse who was deeply depressed by the loss of her own son in Vietnam.  In a way, Gloria saves her too.  It begs the question, does anybody in your life need to be rescued today?    In the final one-third of the book, I think we see evidence of the power of love and kindness.  It's the end that makes it a worthwhile read.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|It's A Wonderful Life.  Thats says it all.  A timeless classic.  The extras were fun and informative to watch.
B000ZELISO|5.0|This movie is really best on Blu-Ray. I never thought that I'd see a difference, bit it is so clear and crisp!
B002GYI9C4|5.0|The untrusting young street rat Vin immediately draws you into the story.  You are able to watch that young tomboy grow into a beautiful young woman and find both herself and her true love during the war against the most dangerous man the world has ever seen. It's a story that I won't soon forget.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|From the first page till the last, I stopped only to let the dog out and grab a kleenex. I was totally absorbed by the characters. I was happy that a more classic love story was set in current times. It showed that chilvery and forever love might still possible in this immediate gratification world.
B000P0J024|5.0|If you like Tom Petty, George Harrison, Roy Orbison, Bob Dylan and/or Jeff Lynne (ELO) then you would probably like this.  I found it fresh and entertaining - a bunch of really talented people just enjoying themselves.  The DVD captures it well too.  Buy it!
B0006IIPIK|4.0|The film is a gumbo mix of adventures that resemble a 1940's War Film, Star Trek, Indiana Jones and Wizard of Oz.  There is much action and adventure for a light plot, but the stars, Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie give the weak plot a boost and the cinematography is beyond reproach.<br /><br />Kerry Conran is the director and writer -  this is his first film. The retro touches of old brands like Double Bubble Gum and Coca Cola gave it a nostalgic touch.  The hero is Joe Sullivan \\"Sky Captain\\" (Jude Law) who is a pilot.  His former flame, Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltro) comes back into his life.  She makes a deal with him for a story in her newspaper.<br /><br />The mystery and plot surround a group of missing scientists and recent robot attacks on New York City.  There is an intricate scheme that may cause the end of the world.  It involves a spacecraft that will send two of each earth species into space - a Noah's Arc Star Liner of sorts.<br /><br />The beauty of the film makes the simple plot watchable.  Gorgeous visuals and special effects give a simple nostalgic effect.  You often think the stars resemble the likes of Clark Gable, Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacal, Veronica Lake depending on the scenes.  There are smart lines that remind you of the era of Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon and their tin can space ships.  The movie is done mostly in burnished browns with light color showing through.  Facial close-ups must have camera filters and lighting is perfect.  It is clearly mostly computer generated, but well done art and creativity throughout.<br /><br />For a adventure filled action film, with retro touches, and top stars, this is a good pick.
B002JMLMKE|5.0|The book was exactly as described - if not better! The book was absolutely flawless. I'd be challenged to go to a retail store and find a book in as good of condition as this book was sold and shipped to me. The price and the turn-around was fantastic!
B002PMV9FG|4.0|I am trying to decide between the three different DVD versions of HBP and I need help.  I prefer full screen movies at home but I love special features of course.  I don't have Blu Ray so that does not need to come into play.  Any advice?
B0026P3G12|5.0|This is how a song should be sung by someone who has a beautiful voice to sing it with. Miss Boyle is the singer for all ages. Best vocals I have heard for a very long time. Love it.
B002N3GD2Q|4.0|This is a beautifully packaged, thoughtful, box set; among the best things the Doors Music Company/Bright Midnight Archives have released. Sound quality and performances are excellent. If you've got the cash and are a huge fan of The Doors, this is THE starting point for the live material. If not, I suggest [[ASIN:B0011U8NZ2 Live in Pittsburgh 1970]].    Ask yourself, do you really want to hear 4 versions of Roadhouse Blues and the other Doors' standards? Of course you do if you are a huge fan, I'm just saying. Solid versions of Peace Frog, Maggie M'Gill, and the abbreviated version of Wild Child all make this release memorable. Celebration of the Lizard is worth mentioning as well, just a bit different than what we've heard before.
6305907145|1.0|This movie made me IRATE.  MP is one of my favorite Austen novels, but this movie was horrendous.  I agree that you might like it if you haven't read the book, but if you HAVE read the book, get ready to get really pissed off.  I don't know if I would call myself an \\"Austen Purist\\"--I LOVE the 2007 Persuasion despite its liberties.  I feel the changes they made in that one were fairly minor and added to the story.  They did NOT, however change the characters.  In this MP, the only thing they kept the same about the characters were their names.  The reason I love Jane Austen is that I love her characters.  And Fanny Price is my favorite of all.  I take great offense to how much her character was completely rewritten for the movie.  Edmund?  Same thing.  And honestly, I can't handle how they changed Sir Thomas either.  His character is completely unlike the Sir Thomas in the book.<br /><br />Whose idea was this?  They should be forced to...well...I don't know.  Sit through something really enraging.  Because that's what just happened to me.

B000005YZM|5.0|For those that love the blend of Baroque sounds with psychedelic pop of the late 60's, this is the perfect album for you. Amazing that this album isn't more known. Thanks to Amazon for helping me find this hidden gem. Though \\"Time of the Season\\" is their big hit on this album, there is a whole lot more great songs here. There are no fillers on this cd. My favorites include Care of Cell 44, Maybe After He's Gone, Brief Candles, Friends of Mine, A Rose For Emily, and my favorite being \\"Hung Up On a Dream.\\" Other great albums I think you would like include anything from the Beatles' Rubber Soul, Revolver, Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band, Magical Mystery Tour, The Beatles, and Abbey, Beach Boys' Pet Sounds, Moody Blues' Days of Future Passed, Pink Floyd's The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, Saucerful of Secrets, and Atom Heart Mother, Bee Gees' Odessa, Camels' The Snow Goose, King Crimsons' In the Court of the Crimson King, The Kinks' Village Green Preservation of Society Koyaanisqatsy (see Mp3 downloads) From The Yearning To Burst The Perpetual Circle,  And Procol Harum's A Whiter Shade of Pale. Any suggestions for other great hidden gems would be appreciated.
B002T9H2LA|1.0|Maybe its me cause I never got the whole &#34;QT is a film genius&#34; thing to begin with, but still I didn't anticipate this film being as bad as it turned out to be. I love war movies, so I was willing to watch it with an open mind. But worse than the unnecessarily graphic violence (albeit brief), is that this movie is over bloated with long scenes of dialogue that don't move the story along--they just have you hitting the fast forward on your remote. If I had seen this in the theater I would have walked out fed up waiting for something to happen. When action does take place Tarentino knows what he's doing, but you have to sit thru long periods where it just seems he wants you to see what a 'cutting edge' film maker he is before anything happens. Brad Pitt wasn't as bad as I thought despite his silly forced 'Tennesse' accent and the woman who plays 'Shosanna' and owns the Cinema where the final scene takes place, is alluring and tragic. So as a film I'd say this is a 'stinker' but as a 'War film' I'd say this movie is a complete 'flop' not worthy of purchase or a second viewing ever again.
B002QH2NUA|5.0|This beats all PM other live dvd's, Rock show comes in very close. Not only you get 2 cd's but also a dvd for a very low price. The concert is very bright almost like being there, And a lot less face's of fans like the last few live concerts, the show keeps moving along song after song. only mama knows really cooks along with some other new stuff. At 67 this guy still rocks almost 3hr long with no breaks. A must have dvd.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|This is the most riveting mini series I've ever watched.  Definitely worth it, and only 20 bucks!!!
0060899220|3.0|I'm not going to bother going over the details of this book. Lots of others have done that very well here. I will say, in case you missed this along the way, that this book is 'adult' only material. If you don't want to read crude words and activities, hear about minorities and women being harassed, etc. Skip this. Trust me it won't ruin your life not to read it. Also, if reading about some filthy kitchens and mishandling of food will put you off ever eating out again, skip this book. Personally I can't tolerate crudity very much. I did read all of this book however, for several reasons. And I sometimes laughed out loud while doing it.  First of all -- This guy loves food. This love oozes off the pages. I kept reading.   Next -- Anthony Bourdain is obviously an adrenalin junkie. Reading Kitchen Confidential is like watching a train wreck that never quite happens. You keep waiting for the author to either get back on the rails or fly off completely. I felt a bit voyeuristic at times, so mesmerized was I to see what awful thing would happen next.  Finally -- Bourdain is honest about himself and his life. He admits his mistakes, his self centeredness, and the many opportunities he wasted. He also doesn't pretend that in the end those mistakes didn't matter. He's honest, occasionally uncomfortably so.  Perhaps what endeared the book to me was his admission near the end that he is not a 3 star chef, he couldn't be one if he wanted to, and he's OK with that. After the endless parade of over-inflated egos one sees on TV, this was refreshing. Thanks for being honest, chef.
0439023491|5.0|Catching Fire not only does justice to the first book in this trilogy, The Hunger Games, but it might even give book one a run for it's money! Suzanne Collins definitely does not disappoint with this action-packed, heart-wrenching, horrifying yet uplifting accompanyment to the already-amazing first book. I cannot wait for the third and final book in this installment!
B001N26GFC|2.0|Going into Happy-Go-Lucky, I wanted to like it.  The premise sounded interesting -- a relentlessly positive person facing life and perhaps overcoming less than positive moments.  Oh, what a let down.  Truth be told, Happy-Go-Lucky is the story of a daffy woman who we never really get to know -- a woman who laughs (at times inappropriately) at almost everything, including physical pain.  In fact, she can't bring herself to answer a straight question without giggling and coming up with some whimsical nonsense line looking to draw a laugh, avoid the question, or both.  Through all of this, she remains an ultimately irritating enigma, keeping from the audience any clue about what makes her tick, why she can't seem to take anything seriously (including the feelings of others), and why she does oddly dangerous and inappropriate things (like striking up a conversation with a brooding homeless man in the dark of night in a secluded spot -- and sticking around even after he acts in ways that might reasonably be perceived as threatening).<br /><br />In all of her laughter, the main character seems so incapable of listening to other people or reading their feelings that she laughs off signs that her driving instructor has significant mental problems and might be developing a threatening interest in her.  When he finally blows his lid and does something that would make any sensible person call the police -- if not for her sake, then for the sake of others who might follow -- she ultimately laughs it off while paddling down life's highway, oblivious, it seems, to real human interaction and the need for some grain of seriousness to make all the laughter have any worth at all.
0307276902|5.0|I enjoyed this book tremendously. It doesn't bother me one bit that this turned out to be a fiction book.  He was swept up in the marketing of it all.  It doesn't matter to me.  If you want a great read, this is one.  A friend of mine started to read it and had to stop because he was having flashback dreams to his own \\"drug\\" days.  It's got great characters and a great imagination. Mostly it's incredibly well written.  I love James Frey!
0385737947|4.0|For me, this book started out a little slow. The reader is (intentionally) confused along with the protagonist for the first bit of the story, and I know I felt a little frusterated. But once the story started falling into place I was hooked! The characters are diverse and interesting and the plot is quite unique! Although it didn't start out as a page-turner it morphed into one and about halfway through I found it difficult to put down. Having finished it I'm definitely looking forward to the series continuing!
B001FB55I0|2.0|I am glad that I did not waste money on this film (got it from Redbox - free night's rental).  The story line was confusing.  The film didn't really explain (unless I drifted off during the explanation) how the main characters got to the past or present or whatever time they were in.  The main character was in the movie with his father who was just a teenager at one point.  I'm not sure if the son traveled to the past or if the father was in the future.      I don't know what kind of scardy cats watched this film and wrote reviews, but I didn't think the robots were scary/creepy at all.  The plot was so predictable that you couldn't possibly be scared because you knew what was going to happen already.      Anyway, it is something to watch on a cold night, especially if you want to complete the series.  Although, I don't think any of the original characters are in there.  One of the robots at the end did look like Arnold (a well built Arnold lol), but it wasn't long before he was reduced to his metal skeleton.    My advice, save your money and rent it for $1 or wait 'til its on cable.
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|This movie has great graphics & was a lot of fun to watch on our big screen TV. My son is 3 & he loves it! My husband & I also like to watch it because it is a really cute movie for kids @ christmas-time.
0439023483|5.0|I love love love this book! The story is so unique and horrifying and yet Collins manages to focus on the characters' good aspects to provide an overall theme of hope and bravery. For me, this story was a page-turner from beginning to end. Great, strong characters, a fantastic all-powerful villain, and heart-stopping conflict all make up this wonderful book. I highly recommend it!
B002WDL534|2.0|The picture vinyl itself is gorgeous, but it doesn't come with any of the items mentioned in the product description.  The plastic jacket came split open from shipping.  The record was made using a digital master, and the clean version at that.  It pains me to hear Lady G refer to herself as a \\"free bit.\\"      Product had a lot of potential but I am definitely a disappointed customer.
B001HZK8FO|5.0|Holding back tears and not feeling the incredible emotional highs and lows is impossible! A must watch for the hopeless romantic and the one they love. If you have ever loved and lost you will find a strong connection with this movie.
B002NXSRX4|5.0|Hollywood is turning out decent movies this year, hollywood blockbuster films are filled with fun, action, entertaining pictures.  I like how the storyline went, and especially the two main characters.  Good stuff.
1439175640|3.0|I saw this cookbook in a bookstore and promptly purchased it off amazon that evening. I have since made several items in the cookbook and have enjoyed most of them (although, surprisingly not the cupcakes. Mine turned out dry. I'll keep trying though). The brownies I've tried have been spectacular and they did not last long at all.       I really only have two complaints: First, none of the pictures line up. There are several pictures of treats, but you won't find them on the same page (or even near the same page) as the recipe. So if you see a picture you like, you have to scramble to find the recipe. Not a big deal, but slightly annoying. My second, and most significant, complaint is that the recipes repeat themselves! Page 91 and 97- same vanilla cupcake/vanilla birthday cake recipe. Page 92 and 98 same Devil's food cake recipe and another Devil's food on 104 that's only slightly different. 108/112 same chocolate cake recipe. And on and on. Sometimes the recipe is named with an icing (i.e., Devil's Food cake with Seven Minute Icing) and the icing is on a different page as well. I suppose I could see giving variations on the same page (i.e., \\"to make cupcakes do this:\\" \\"to make a 3 layer cake do this\\") but I don't understand why they decided to list the same recipes multiple times. I think that's in poor taste and it definitely discourages me from buying another Magnolia Bakery cookbook. If they ran out of recipes in one, why would I purchase a second one?
B002T9H2L0|2.0|This movie is strange! I expected high on quentin's new one. But I don't like it so much.    Con:  1. The story totally wrong! The world war II didn't be ended in the movie theatre.  2. It's too bloody.  3. The screenplay is not reasonable.    Good:  1. The actors are great  2. The photography is good
B001GCUO4S|2.0|....Those are the words of a whiny, obnoxious brat on any given family road trip, but on this road trip, \\"The Final Destination\\" limps along on three flat tires and out of gas. Really it's just \\"Final Destination\\" 4, but they added a The in front of the title to set it apart from the original 3, for which the original 3 must be grateful. Actually they should have stopped at #2 with it's appocalyptic highway crash from hell(the first premonition) and the hilariously gruesome finale with a dismembered barbequed leg complete with tennis shoe landing on a family picnic table. Number 3 was ok with its rollercoaster disaster and there were some imaginative \\"deaths\\"-the nail gun scene was perfectly timed for suspense.   The first movie was very good and while some may argue it was the best, I still prefer #2 as the best of the bunch.    Now comes the latest in the franchise and \\"The Final Destination\\" fails on all counts-The characters and the actors playing them are boring-the \\"deaths\\" are surprisingly tame and even lame. The budget on this installment must have been pretty small because most of the gore is missing which is unusual since this series usually is pretty graphic with its guts and gore. Maybe most of the budget was consumed by the 3-D effects but you know they also squandered this too when the best 3-D effect is a popped champagne cork. And wearing those crappy cardboard glasses is no joy either.    So as far as I'm concerned, I'll take the whiny, obnoxious brat-anyone else can have the movie. Nah, not really, I'll avoid both.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle CD is wonderful.  I enjoy it again and again.  I enjoyed the insert, and was delighted to find printed lyrics.  What did surprise me was Silent Night was on this otherwise not holiday CD.  She did it very well though.
B0002IQEHI|5.0|A classic by the measure of any yardstick!  A plot that challenges the mind's ability through the actors/actress talents and elicits the emotional responses based upon a word, phrse, body language, etc.        It stands head and shoulders above today's movies, because it does not need the profanity, or the \\"shootem-up\\" or high-dollar digital effects so prevalent in today's lost graveyard of failures.
B001FE4I6C|5.0|Just Wow...this book had me choked up till the end....I watched the Movie and enjoyed it till I read the book.....I almost feel bad now for Eastwoods version of the book....I've never been Prouder of South Africa....the Springboks and Madiba
B000067J24|5.0|A whimsical and passionate love story centered around Brazilian cooking and music, this movie will delight romance fans. This movie never made it big in the box office but will be one of my favorites for all time, primarily due to the light hearted comedy, exotic cooking and romantic music.
0786868724|4.0|Once again, Mitch Albom has written a book that encourages me to look at life from a different perspective. I'm not delighted with some of the theological implications of this one though, so it gets four rather than five stars. Nonetheless, this short and simple (yet also profound) book is worth reading.
B0015GDVTU|1.0|Whoever dredged up the concept for this movie must either be desperate or sick, or both.  The thought of receiving frequent letters from your dead partner over the space of a year after his death is a slap in the face for grief, common sense and mental health.  That a reviewer (someone from 'Westwood One' - who the heck are they ?) endorsement on the front cover of the Blu-Ray is quoted as describing this as 'The best romantic comedy in a very long time' defies belief ! If I had been able to see that sole 'official' review on the case I would never have made the purchase.  Remember, if they can only get a positive review for publicity from someone/somewhere you've never heard of, caveat emptor applies. BEWARE !    This movie is neither romantic nor remotely funny.  The Amazon official review warns you to have tissues on standby - they are not for tears, rather your stomach contents as you wade your way through this tasteless and unfunny film.  Did it even have a theatrical release ?  I'd be surprised, as in my opinion, it doesn't even deserve a straight to DVD release.     There seems little point in commenting on the acting as the script and concept are so repugnant you don't even notice the actors that much.    Not only was this tasteless it was also extremely boring.  How this could be described as a romantic comedy is beyond my comprehension.  How others can swoon over it is also beyond my understanding, as this film trawls the bottom-of-the-genuinely-tasteless barrel.    One star, as you cannot leave less - although I would sincerely like to !
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This is a fantastic miniseries.    My only complaint would be the (to my mind) excessive use of dutched camera angles to represent worry, stress, loneliness, or danger.  Basically, at times it seems anything negative or worrisome gets a dutched camera.    The acting is exceptional and the production values are very high.  It's an inspiring and intriguing film that makes you want to go out and read more about the Founding and the Founders.    As far as content goes: there's a brief and fairly distant view of male genitals in the first disc while a British tax officer is being stripped, tarred, feathered, and run out of town on a rail.  There's a prolonged view of nude breasts in the final disc during a surgical operation.  Neither is remotely sexual, and both are shown to increase the feeling of exposure and vulnerability of the characters portrayed, as well as the harsh reality of life at the time.  There is very little violence, but while aboard ship headed to France there is a scene of a soldier's leg being amputated and of course the aforementioned surgery as well.    My wife and I enjoyed this production so much that we chose to give this series to family members as a gift.
B000QXDED6|5.0|Amazing movie in every way.  It is by far one of my all time favourites.  Gerard Butler is a fabulous Leonidas.
B000ZECQ08|5.0|My wife loved the extras on the second disc. She loves seeing how things were done or created. She especially loved the stars learning how other things are done within a movie, like how the editor, or special effects people create what we see. there was also a interesting bio about the writer J K Rowlings and how she grew up.
0385523904|5.0|I saw Ms. Demick speak at Asia Society on January 7, 2010.  I purchased the book, started reading it that night, and stayed up past midnight to finish it the next evening.  This an extraordinary work and I could not put it down.  I have a graduate degree in East Asian History and have read several books on North Korea, but I can say I learned a lot of new things from this one.  There are several other good books on North Korea but I think this book is the most moving and offers the best psychological perspective.    Ms. Demick skillfully weaves together stories of six North Korean refugees into a narrative which portrays life in North Korea from WWII to the present.  She tells us about real people, each of whom is different, and helps us understand the interior psychological reality of life inside this closed society.  Her descriptions of places, events, and emotions are beautifully crafted and you feel like you are there. As I read the book I felt sad about the terrible conditions under which people live, and also came out with a much better understanding of the motivations of people in North Korea.      These points that the author made are particularly interesting:  - In the 1950's conditions in North Korea were actually better than in China, and some people moved across the border from China to Korea.  - While banning Christianity the regime actually borrowed from it, e.g. referring to the leaders as \\"father,\\" their savior.  - Like cult members it is very hard for many people to abandon the world view of the regime, even after they leave.  - The most shattering thing to people who break with the regime is the discovery that the outside world, especially China and South Korea, are not living in the same state of misery.    - While still opposing capitalism ideologically, some people, especially women in their 50's, started to practice a form of it just to survive.    I highly recommend this book.

B000ENWKN8|3.0|I've been a zombie fan from day one and love almost everything he's done music and movies, but this album just didn't do it for me.  I don't really know why if its john 5 or his new singing style.  This album lacks his hellbilly scream entirely.  I like the laid back old school look on the album though.  There are some good licks on some of the tracks, but for the most part its pretty bland.  I'd have to say my fav song on the album is Let It All Bleed Out but even that one isn't up to par with past stuff.  My least fav is of course that rediculous Foxy Foxy.   Aside from this not being a very good one from him I would still give him an overall rating of a 4 check out astro-creep 2000 even though that is WZ its amazing, or of course hellbilly deluxe.  I hope his new one is just as great as that one was for a lot of kids.  It would be a shame to name it hellbilly deluxe 2 and not be as good or like this album.
0316154687|3.0|Allow me to go on record:  I am a David Searis fan, a fellow North Carolinian who has greater appreciation for his occasional local references and nuances.  That said, it is out of respect for his other work that I rate this one a three-star lesson in mediocrity.  Certainly, his self-effacing humor and his ability to find a story in even the most mundane shine through.  But 83 pages designated as \\"The Smoking Section,\\" a tome dedicated to David's cigarette cessation experience, was tiresome.  It read like a smoker's quit diary, and it lacked his usual insight into human behavior.  Other people usually are not as impressed with our addiction stories as we are with our own, and such is the case here. Maybe by now he has put cigarettes behind him, and the reader will not have to endure the withdrawal.

B002VECM6I|4.0|January 10th, 2010<br /><br />If you have a soul in you, then this movie should be able to stir it. Starring a 17-year old black kid that's in and out of foster homes, who's never really given a chance, a very considerate white woman comes into his life and changes it completely. She (Sandra Bullock) gives him a new chance at life with her family and he starts to turn things around...<br /><br />It's about 25% football and 75% emotion.<br /><br />A good watch, that sorta drags towards the end.<br /><br />Nice for the older bulk of the family to enjoy. Has some language and brief drug use towards the end of the movie.<br /><br />Watch it when it comes out to DVD!<br /><br />4.25 stars.
0385504225|5.0|Definitely the clearest in Dan Brown's theme of a spirituality all can embrace with optimism about the possibility of melding a world peace based on understanding of a common thread between religious zealots that distort the great spiritual message of each tradition, all in a compelling page to page turner that I was sorry was over.  Hope he continues in this vein.   The criticism of others that Langdon is short sighted is earned by his refusal to be open to a spiritual reality outside the confines of science, just because he can't prove it.  A must read.
0385341008|5.0|Recommended by friends, I purchased this book awhile ago and discovered it yesterday as I was dusting my stack of \\"to-read\\" books. Once I picked it up I couldn't put it down. Delightful, charming, witty, and historical interesting, this book gives you a glimpse into several lives as they recover from and relive the German occupation. I hated to see it end.
B003102JDM|5.0|The Coen Brothers have had an unbelievably productive and impressive career thus far: not all of their movies have been superb, to be sure, but they've made an incredible mark on American film-making and have produced multiple films that will no doubt be heralded as classics. And although it did not receive the attention or box-office sales as some of their other works, \\"A Serious Man\\" is among the Coen's best. It is the best film I saw in 2009, and as far as I'm concerned should be heralded as a new American classic.    \\"A Serious Man\\" is an existential drama (with trademark Coen elements of dark humor) whose plot is difficult to describe. Its ties to the Book of Job cannot be ignored, but to say it is simply a retelling of that story is somewhat reductive. It is also a story about religion, certainly, but even that doesn't capture this film's scope. It isn't about Judaism, or Christianity, or any God in particular -- it is about why the things that happen in our life happen, and to what extent we can even know or understand or influence these events. \\"A Serious Man\\" is about life and its contradictions. Its characters are in an endless state of flux, oscillating between certainty and uncertainty, faith and skepticism, knowledge and ignorance, and even life and death. It is about chaos, fate, inevitability. The protagonist, Larry Gopnik (an incredible Oscar-worthy performance by Michael Stuhlbarg) is a fantastic character study of a tragic hero, and everyman who wants nothing more than to understand others and to be understood himself. He longs to understand his place in the world, in the universe, in God's plan, and is eternally frustrated by his shortsightedness and inability to do so. Why are all of these bad things happening to Larry? Are they consequences of his actions, a punishment from God, or simply bad luck? Does anything we do in this life matter? And what does it mean to be a \\"serious\\" man, anyway? Larry seeks out the moral guidance of rabbis throughoutthe film, who seem to be as lost and clueless as he is. Though the rabbis we meet throughout the film are increasingly older and allegedly \\"wiser\\" (whatever that means), they offer fewer and fewer answers.    As is generally the case with the Coens, the film looks beautiful. The cinematography and direction are impeccable, and the plows slowly but meaningfully forward to its brilliant, pitch-perfect climax. The subtle but excellent score by Carter Burwell aids greatly, capturing feelings of longing, confusion, and inevitability which drive the film to its tragic end. All of the acting performances, mostly by essentially unknown players, are superb. I have to give special commendation to Fred Melamed's Sy Ableman, who has to truly be one of the funniest, most whacked character the Coens have imagined (which, given their repertoire of zany personalities, is quite a statement). And the use of Jefferson Airplane's \\"Somebody to Love,\\" which lyrically and thematically ties in perfectly to the film's themes and ideas is nothing short of inspired.    \\"A Serious Man\\" is a film like no other, and is right up there with the Coens' best. In many ways it is their deepest, most mature film, loaded with existential crises and philosophical conundrums. It is a beautiful film to watch, a powerful, moving one to endure, and will leave you thinking about it for a long time to come. An absolute masterpiece.
B000E1MTZE|1.0|I bought this product for a friend's son for XMAS. It is advertised as  HD DVD. It would not work on their HD dvd player or on their brand new gaming computer dvd player.

B000ATQYT2|5.0|May think this is just another re-make of the \\"classic Christmas Carol\\", but it is not!  Perfect \\"feel good\\" movie with humorous dialogue for young and older viewers, bouncy up-beat music, easy to follow story, and a few reasonably scary parts (ghost of christmas future).  This movie has been around for a few years as my kids grew up with it - all of my children have a copy of this movie ages 13, 21, and 26, I am gift giving it to all the younger children in my life now i.e. ages 5 thru 10, and I watch this movie numerous times during the hectic Christmas season - I of course being a whopping 46.  This is a movie that truly spans generations, perfect as a gift or an easy way to enjoy some quality time with your family.
078401213X|1.0|I liked the music score with the cinematography-- the composer did a good job. Otherwise, there is not a lot to recommend this film. It was shallow and pretentious-- I guess it is a film director's idea of what mathematicians think about. I could have spent my time washing dishes and found more meaning than I did in this film.
B001TKMAGW|4.0|This is the album that started it all, from the thunder and rain to Tony Iommi's infamous tri-tone riff. Black Sabbath's first release is the standard that all heavy metal listeners shall bow down to!!This deluxe edition is a must for serious Sab fans everwhere. Disc.1 is the \\"basic\\" album from the beginning to the end with 'WICKED WORLD being subbed for \\"EVIL WOMEN\\". The sound quality is the best I have ever heard, including that of the \\"BLACK BOX\\" and other several imports. Dont be fooled by other reveiws, this is the one to buy if you want a remaster.Disc.2 starts with the formentioned \\"WICKED WORLD\\"and then gets into the rarities with instrimentals and songs with different lyrics and minor changes in playing styles.The sound quality for this disc is surprisingly good considering they are 40 yr old demos.Go ahead fork out the extra cabbage,turn off your lights,crank the volume and find out you are the chosen one!! Oh No Please God help me!!!!
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I'm running a Core 2 Quad (Q8300 2.5GHz) in my old Sony Viao case.  The old CPU cooler was very similar to this unit but wouldn't fit with the new motherboard.  I tried the Intel cooler that came with my chip but it was not very efficient and the cheap mounting hardware left much to be desired.    This unit is not easy to cram into your case.  You also need to install a backing plate underneath the motherboard so you'll have to pull the mb out to install unless you building the system.      Having said that, if you follow directions the heat sink is securely mounted and boy does this thing ever cool!  My CPU temps idle in the 29 - 32C range and seldom exceed 45C.    If things get too warm for you you can add a second fan for push-pull of air over the large (huge??)heat exchanger.    This unit is a 9 on a scale of 10 for function but only a 3 on ease of installation.  But the pain of installing it is a sound investment in system longevity and performance!

1416955070|2.0|It's not often I come across a book with a plot as transparent as City of Bones. Clare seems to draw from a traditions of young adult and contemporary fantasy alike, with little altered to speak to her own creativity. While reading City of Bones I found myself waiting for the events and revelations I knew would happen, as opposed to enjoying the \\"plot twists\\" as they came along. This is not to say that the novel is entirely lacking in entertainment value, but the best audience for City of Bones is someone just stepping into the genre; the novel serves as a kind of \\"Cliff's Notes\\" for contemporary YA fantasy.

B002GJT4XW|5.0|In today's BD/DVD  world where everything has extended, added, edited,director's cut... this movie is actually an improvement on what is already a very entertaining movie. There are additional scenes that actually add to the story. Those of us that have read all the books often get a bit caught up in the differences between the books and the movie. The additional footage fills in a bit of what was missing.    The additional footage will be of interest to those that would like the movie to come closer to the book, and will add a little help understanding the details for those who have yet to read them.    In addition to the added content, the BluRay version is a superior visual and audio presentation. I already had the first, older BluRay edition and was instantly impressed with the video quality of the new release. I don't know what they did different but the new BDs are superior to the disks that cane in the BD \\"trunk\\" set that came out a little over a year ago.     The added (non-movie) features are entertaining also. I especially like the deleted scenes and the interviews with the main characters.     If you are a HP fan, you will love this release. If you aren't yet, you just may become a big HP fan!
B001MYIXAC|5.0|Let The Right One In is the other vampire/love story film that came out in 2008 next to Twilight. While I'm probably one of the only men over the age of 18 that didn't HATE Twilight I CAN say that it being a Vampire/romance story is where the similarity ends. Twilight was fun teen-angst junk food. Let the Right One In is a masterpiece of filmmaking.<br /><br />Let the Right One In is about the relationship between 12 year old outcast Oskar, who's regularly bullied at school and dreams of revenge, and Eli a vampire living next door who befriends Oskar and teaches him how to defend himself. While the characters are younger their story is much more mature than any other vampire relationship in cinema (or television for that matter).The performances of Kare Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson as these two leads are a wonder to behold, even more so since they were both only 12 when they made this film.<br /><br />I also love the atmosphere of movie. There's music and special effects but they're used sparingly with the camera work to create a very normal looking town as the film's setting. There are a few jump-out moments but they're handled so off-handedly that you almost don't realise what you're seeing until it's already happened.<br /><br />While the film was adapted by the book's author John Ajvide Lindqvist, it omits alot of exposition of the novel focusing mostly on the friendship of Oskar and Lina. You won't have things spelled out for you (especially with the supporting characters), there's no real vampire lore or how Eli's survived for over 200 years with her 'guardian', and there's no inner monologue to explain what the characters are thinking. Personally I think this was a brilliant move on the filmmaker's part letting the audience think for themselves and letting the camera work and actor's performances do most of the storytelling.<br /><br />One thing alot of people complained about on the DVD was the subtitles. When the film was released on DVD it left out the theater-translated english subtitles. They've now rereleased the DVD with the theater subtitles. While I didn't find the subtitles on the original release to be that bad, I now own BOTH DVD's and will say that the theater translation is the preferable one. Just look on the back of the DVD case to make sure it says English (theatrical) under the subtitles heading (though I think that's the only version being sold now so you should be safe).<br /><br />Let the Right One In is a must see movie, not just for vampire fans but for film buffs in general. It's got great acting, terrific directing and setting. In short it's filmmaking at it's very best!tles. They've now rereleased the DVD with the theater subtitles.

B002GJT4YQ|5.0|I first bought the Sorcerers Stone BluRay collectors edition. After watching it I immediately went back to the store and bought \\"Chamber\\" in the collector edition. Its is worth every penny to me!     In today's BD/DVD world where everything has extended, added, edited, special  features, director's cuts etc... this movie is actually an improvement on what is already a very entertaining movie. There are additional scenes that actually add to the story. Those of us that have read all the books often get a bit caught up in the differences between the books and the movie. The additional footage fills in a bit of what was missing.    The additional footage will be of interest to those that would like the movie to come closer to the book, and will add a little help understanding the details for those who have yet to read them.    In addition to the added content, the BluRay version is a superior visual and audio presentation. I already had the first, older BluRay edition and was instantly impressed with the video quality of the new release. I don't know what they did different but the new BDs are superior to the disks that cane in the BD \\"trunk\\" set that came out a little over a year ago.    The added (non-movie) features are entertaining also. I especially like the deleted scenes and the interviews with the main characters, but found all of the added features and the included book to be interesting and add to the experience.    If you are a HP fan, you will love the collectors editions. If you aren't yet, you just may become a big HP fan! I can't wait for the rest of the series to come out in collectors editions!
B000085RTX|5.0|I bought this for my son for Christmas.  He showed it to me on a different site, but the price was much better on Amazon.  I received it in great condition and in plenty of time for Christmas.    He absolutely loves it and plays it all the time.
B0026P3G12|5.0|A must for any music lover.  This album simply has no flaws from the selection of songs to the arrangements and of course Susan's performance.  Outstanding.
0394873742|5.0|What a wonderful book! Our 16 month-old grandson is fascinated by Richard Scarry's wonderful characters and is in awe of them in this book that's almost as tall as he is!!  It is a busy book packed with illustrations that a youngster (and his parents and grandparents) will spend hours looking at!
B002GJT4YQ|4.0|I bought this for my girlfriend who is a total Harry Potter fan. We watched this together and I was immediately struck by the sound design, which is superior to the previous blu-ray release. The video transfer is exceptional as well, as good or better than the previous release. The extra scenes in the extended edition were interesting and did not take away from the film. In fact, I thought they provided more depth and I found myself enjoying the film more than previous viewings. It's nice that you are given the option of choosing between the two versions of the film. The other added benefit of this ultimate edition release is the documentary. The second part of the documentary is fantastic and more than what I was expecting. Excellent release and well worth the cost!
B002PMV9FG|5.0|I purchased this as a gift.  My son was very excited and told me that he wanted me to get this for him.  Glad I did not disappoint.  He loves these films and books.
B001JNNDE2|5.0|Compared to the DVD, the blu-ray yields better definition, which means more accurate colors, greater detail, is more three dimensional, and the sound design is far more balanced. It's not leaps and bounds above the DVD transfer, but it certainly is better. Plus, I don't have to contend with that double sided DVD trying to determine which side is widescreen and which is crappy pan & scan(full screen). Luckyyyy!
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|This was so enjoyable to watch. This will certainly be considered the best yet and a collectors item. Blu Ray video and audio unbelievable! Heath Ledger's best performance! I would not wait to long purchase this one. On another note. Amazon is just as great!

That changes though in the second part which is included in the Chamber of Secrets release. That section of the documentary is fantastic and more than what I was expecting. Excellent release and well worth the cost!
B001U9BRNE|5.0|I could not wait to watch this collection of great songs and performers. The video and audio was outstanding. I viewed this on a Sony BDP-S1 blu ray player that has no DTS-Master audio, but it was still incredible sounding. Certainly a five star rating.

B000IHYY52|1.0|I was looking forward to this blu-ray music, but was disappointed in the overall variety of the music. There were one or two at best selections that I really enjoyed, but would not recommend.
B00004STPT|5.0|The shipping was prompt and the item was just as described. I like the way Amazon lists all of the tracks on each CD. This soundtrack has great epic music, and I would definitely recommend it. I will buy from Amazon again.
B000PC0U1W|5.0|V for Vendetta, blu ray with Natalie Portman, is a must see in blu ray. I liked the regular dvd so much that I could not wait for the Blu ray version to come out. Gave my friend the regular dvd version. Video and audio, and effects were outstanding. Add this one to your collection.
B002FRNCG0|5.0|I don't think I've ever found an album where I love EVERY SINGLE SONG, but this new Paramore album is amazing. I can't fast forward or skip any of the songs. I just can't bring myself to miss any of them. My favorite songs are The Only Exception and Feeling Sorry. They have an awesome sound and Hayley Williams is pretty much the most kick ass female rock singer nowadays.

B001B1UO6W|5.0|On September 9th, 2008, MGM & Fox Home Entertainment finally released the much anticipated special edition of the 1988 horror movie, Child's Play. This edition boasted an all-new transfer with bright vibrant eye-poping colors. It's presented in it's original 1.85:1 aspect ratio. The previous version on DVD was 4x3 full-screen, so this is a much improved transfer. The audio has also been remastered with a newly remixed 5.1 soundtrack. This edition also features brand new bonus materials. The first is 2 newly recorded commentary tracks. The first is from Catherine Hicks, Kevin Yagher & Alex Vincent. The second features David Kirschner & Don Mancini. In my opinion the second track is the better of the two. David & Don have great chemistry together, this track gives alot of behind the scenes information. It also features various featurettes on the films production. MGM & Fox have put together a wonderful package for fans of this horror classic. Highly recommended!!!
B001EAWME2|4.0|A sorority house becomes home base for a mentally disturbed murderer around the holidays, unknown to its few remaining inhabitants. Deaths naturally ensue and disrupt the girls' already troubled lives, while the local police lieutenant does his best to unravel the mystery and make Christmas safe again in the college town.<br /><br />The late Bob Clark's OTHER Christmas movie, 1974's \\"Black Christmas\\", has been credited for being the inspiration for films such as Halloween, When a Stranger Calls, and the like, with its girl-stalking madman and ominous phone calls, but this one has an ending unlike those we usually see in such films.  It's the kind of ending you love or you hate, but very unique to be sure. The ensemble cast is fantastic, with Romeo and Juliet's Olivia Hussey as the star sorority girl, Keir Dullea as her troubled musician boyfriend, Margot Kidder as a sorority sister with a wild streak, Andrea Martin as another sister of the row, and John Saxon as determined Lt. Fuller. I wouldn't call \\"Black Christmas\\" a gory film, but it's still got some really disturbing deaths in it. The plot is clearly not very complicated, but the details given to the events can certainly make it seem more intense. Over all, a very satisfying film if you are able to like the unexpected ending, and much better than the recent remake, which I can't even remember anymore, despite having some of my favorite girls in the cast.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray release for \\"Black Christmas\\" has been panned quite a bit already. There are no commentaries and the audio for the surround sound is said to be out of synch (not sure since I watched it in mono). Plus, there are complaints about a grainy picture, but for a film like this, that's to be expected. Over all, it looks good and there are still some nice extras, despite not having a commentary. Both an English and a French trailer for the film are included, as well as a nice, short featurette and a post rerelease Q&A session. Also included are found clips with alternate audio (2 of them) and interviews with three of the film's stars, Hussey, Kidder, and Art Hindle (who played boyfriend to one of the sorority sisters). If you're a fan of this film, the Blu-Ray is still well worth getting, and if you've never seen it, be sure to check it out for a genuinely creepy killer and a very different holiday viewing experience!h alternate audio (2 of them) and interviews with three of the film's stars, Hussey, Kidder, and Art Hindle (who played boyfriend to one of the sorority sisters).

0307341550|3.0|WOW!  into the first 2 pages I knew I was in for a terrific read..the writing exciting, compelling.   Flynn is an artist with a very keen eye; her story full of rich descriptions and observations.  She doesn't miss a trick, creating a fascinating sense of time and place, interesting characters, and a protagonist, Camille, neurotic yet intelligent and witty, that I adored right from the get-go.  There's nothing predictable or mundane in these pages, and the author's sharp dry sense of humor throughout is the icing on the cake.  Oh-oh, as we move through the story we're going beyond dysfunctional and getting a tad unbelievable.  Still love the author's writing and ability to tell a good story though.   I always thought my characters couldn't be quirky enough, but this author has proven me wrong. Too far fetched to believe Camille would be sent on an assignment that would involve her so personally (seems more a convenience for the story line) and the characters all become unbelievably over the edge at some point to like or be able to care about anymore. In retrospect it seems interesting that only the male characters retained enough humanity or balance to ring true for me in the end.  However I am excited to see that Flynn has written another book, and will absolutely give that one a read as well.
B002NXSRX4|4.0|4 of 5 stars for the action movie G.I. Joe. OK, so I've lost touch with some of the new things... When you say GI Joe to me, I think of the action toy GI Joe with his circa WWII Jeep and uniform. I seem to have slept thru all of the various modernizations of GI Joe including the comic book, cartoon movies and newer toys. So, going into this movie, I had no expectatoins of what it would be. So, I've learned that the action toy has morphed into an elite military unit with sci-fi special weapons and tools. Only the elite become GI Joe's (men and women) who work out of \\"The Pit\\". This movie was very well made. Action from the first minutes to introduce the team during a firefight to protect a truck convoy. Next we find the hero of protecting that convoy is taken to the Pit and introduced to the team; after traning he becomes a GI Joe. The bulk of the movie was focused on the recovery of the item taken from that truck convoy and learning who was behnd the plot. Some good twists and unexpected things. Great action, wow sets and special effects that were seamless, the characters were a bit flat and 2-D hence the 4 stars. Oh, did I mention great action (yes, I did). This is a fun movie to watch and is worth a couple of bags of popcorn to enjoy. I do recommnd it. The blu-ray had sufficient behind-the-scenes contents on a second disk in the set, however, that disk and materials were on SD on a DVD; too bad, no HD extra contents. I do recommend this movie.
B001P06GX4|4.0|Great product. Although you really need 4 players to have the best game. My 7 year old and I also used it for making cool pictures.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|Son's of Anarchy, what a show! So exciting we watched the whole season in one sitting! Not available in Australia, but heard raving reviews from friends and ordered online. Not one thing about this show that disappoints!!! Charlie Hunnam OMG! What a change from Green Street Hooligans. Top rated show, highly recommend.

B001TK3XO0|4.0|A decade ago, I lived in one of the poorest countries in the world, Burkina Faso, for two years. I saw firsthand there what a lack of female education and a male-dominated society can do to women. It drains them of their souls, their spirit, their livelihood. This novel brings that point home in a magnified escarpment of heartbreak and war-torn senselessness. You yearn for the two female leads to escape their wretched lives, all the while knowing it won't happen. With each page you cringe to learn what horror is next for Mariam and Laila, cheering for their small victories, weeping for their wasted lives. In Rasheed, their violent \\"husband,\\" you can see and smell the evil that he has become. You cry for the doomed futures of Laila's children - the girl because she is simply a girl, and the boy because of what he must emulate in his society as he grows older. The Afghanistan history lessons punctuate a background of human sorrow and desperation and make you realize that this is not just a story, it is real, and it is happening everyday in that country. Desperate people do desperate things, my Dad always told me, and this book is a mirror into the very stomach of desperation.
0142410349|5.0|Hi, the book was a gift for my son for Christmas. Impeccable and prompt. Totally satisfied. Thanks
0385341008|5.0|It is late at night and I just finished reading this remarkable book. I couldn't put it down once it was heading to its climax and conclusion.  My Irish father-in-law was a wonderful story teller and so was my own father and I have been known to spin a few tales and write some for my grandchildren so my appreciation of the writing here is very strong. To do what the authors did with a book of letters, that held me not wanting to put it down, is an example of research, imagination, and great writing. The character development is what held my interest.  I can hardly wait to visit the Channel Islands, off the coast of France. I fell in love with the Irish while visiting there for 16 days and if the people of these islands are anything like the Irish I met, I will fall in love with them. The characters in the book were people I would love to know. Couple that with the drama of the main author's first novel being published around the time of her death, adds an element that is moving and exciting. It is a fun read,the story of people surviving enemy occupation in World War II that should delight any reader. I give it 5 stars and a strong recommendation.

B000ZK4466|5.0|During the press junket for The Mars Volta's fourth full-length, The Bedlam in Goliath, a synopsis written by author Jeremy Robert Johnson detailing the story behind the album appeared on the band's website.  The gist of the story has been repeated countless times in review after review and article after article.  But Johnson wrote it first and he wrote it best, so I'm not going to rehash it here.  And it really doesn't matter- The Bedlam in Goliath would be awesome even if we had all been left in the dark about its subject matter.    TMV guitarist-producer-bandleader extraordinaire Omar Rodriguez-Lopez stated pre-TBIG that this album would have a very claustrophobic feel to it.  It does, which is both a blessing and a curse.  From the moment opener \\"Aberinkula\\" starts, it's obvious that TBIG is sonically much different from previous efforts, mostly because a few of these songs have something like 90 audio tracks apiece.  There are moments, though, where this saturation really works:  The way all of the instruments collapse in on themselves like a black hole towards the end of \\"Metatron\\" is a true thing of beauty.    Aside from \\"Metatron,\\" there are several other highlights to be heard here.  \\"Askepios\\" starts off sounding like a super-stoned army of bumblebees before breaking out into a full-on barnburner.  \\"Ilyena,\\" a funky tune with a bit lighter production, has a gorgeous bridge accented by soaring spaghetti-Western chords and new (now ex) drummer Thomas Pridgen's jaw-dropping touch.  (Hear that bass drum work?  That's a single pedal.)  First single \\"Wax Simulacra\\" is quite possibly the coolest song on the record, and that's saying something; \\"Soothsayer\\" is eerie and majestic; and \\"Ouroborous\\" is full of scrubby guitar and breathtaking vocal melodies.    One song that might sound familiar to Volta fans is \\"Goliath,\\" a louder, faster, reworked version of a Rodriguez-Lopez solo track titled \\"Rapid Fire Tollbooth.\\"  The first half of the song is great, but can't trump the original's laid-back, funky sexiness.  Then things change.  When the final chorus ends with a mighty organ swell and the end appears to be in sight, the volume drops, the drums and bass lock into a groove, and the whole thing explodes into the most bombastic boogie-breakdown Zeppelin never played.  And the song is rescued.  If it doesn't send shivers down your spine when frontman Cedric Bixler-Zavala snarls, \\"I'm starting to feel a miscarriage comin' on,\\" you should check yourself for a pulse.  In \\"Soothsayer,\\" Bixler-Zavala despondently proclaims, \\"My love becomes a mange.\\"  By the time this record is through you'll be bearing his plague and loving every claustrophobic minute of it.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This mini-series was very well done.  It takes the viewer back into that time period and let's him or her see the people who had the foresight to start something the world had never seen before.  We also see Adams as a Father and Husband.  We get to know his strength and his flaws. I hightly recommend this to history buffs and just plain movie buffs as well.

When Bruno returns home from school one day, he discovers that his belongings are being packed in crates. His father has received a promotion and the family must move from their home to a new house far far away, where there is no one to play with and nothing to do. A tall fence running alongside stretches as far as the eye can see and cuts him off from the strange people he can see in the distance. But, Bruno longs to be an explorer and decides that there must be more to this desolate new place than what meets the eye. While exploring his new environment, he meets another boy whose life and circumstances are very different to his own, and their meeting results in a friendship that has devastating consequences.<br /><br />Review:<br /><br />This book made me almost cry, it is VERY GOOD, I will LOVE this book forever! The writer is very good with his words and with his storyline. One of the things I really like about this book is that like the book,\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" this book is told from a child innocent perspective. I would have rated this book +10 except that this book may be too hard for some people to understand like with the ending, that was kind of hard to understand. This is a very good book, I give it 5 Stars!!<br /><br />Enjoy!! :D:D:D
B002RVZV9K|4.0|Like most people learning the guitar, one of my earliest ambitions was to be able to play the intro to Stairway To Heaven, as played by Jimmy Page. So, if you're into the guitar at all, this dvd is well worth exploring.<br /><br />It opens with Jack White constructing his own guitar from makeshift elements, and as it turns out The Edge as a kid also created his own electric guitar.  Jimmy Page got his first guitar when the previous owner of the house his family moved into left a guitar behind.<br /><br />As you get further into this movie it gets more fascinating, as we explore the music the musical background, the development and creative influences of these three outstanding guitarists.  Particular highlights for me are the facial expressions and fascination of the other two as Jimmy Page plays the opening riff on Whole Lotta Love, and watching The Edge through the use of effects magic playing Pride, and giving the impression through the echo effect of playing two different instruments.  I also enjoyed Jack White's rendition of Take The Elevator, and he seems to be somehow channeling Johnny Depp. Jimmy also explains Kashmir and gives a quick demo.<br /><br />I found my admiration for Jimmy Page in particular grew because not only is he a guitar great, he is also a cool guy.  The Edge impressed me with his dedication to pursuing the perfect sound, and reminded me of Les Paul in that respect in [[ASIN:B000QGE856 Les Paul - Chasing Sound]], a movie I highly recommend.  Jack White impressed me with his passion for the guitar.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the concert footage excerpts particulary the soloing on the double neck guitar on Stairway To Heaven.<br />If you're like me you'll be impressed by the passion and dedication and talent of these three.  Some of the most interesting bits are in the deleted scenes and extended footage.<br /><br />I hope you found this helpful, and think you will enjoy it.

When the lift's doors open, Thomas finds himself surrounded by kids who welcome him to the Glade, a large expanse enclosed by stone walls.<br />Just like Thomas, the Gladers don't know why or how they got to the Glade. All they know is that every morning, for as long as they could remember, the stone doors to the maze that surrounds them have opened. Every night, they've closed tight. Every thirty days a new boy is delivered in the lift. And no one wants to be stuck in the maze after dark.<br />The Gladers were expecting Thomas's arrival. But the next day, a girl springs up--the first girl ever to arrive in the Glade. And more surprising yet is the message she delivers. The Gladers have always been convinced that if they can solve the maze that surrounds the Glade, they might be able to find their way home . . . wherever that may be. But it's looking more and more as if the maze is unsolvable.<br />And something about the girl's arrival is starting to make Thomas feel different.

B0012GMUPE|1.0|In this CD version, which sounds like it's lacking a digital re-mastering, the sound sucks. I can barely hear the horns and strings. Quite disappointing!
0571202284|5.0|It's an excellent book to learn animation for 2D and 3D support. It's a timeless book, after all it was written years ago and it still remains like a bible in this area of expertise. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in this kind of matter.
B002NPUCIA|2.0|From the start of watching this DVD I smelled a rat. Although, obviously, all these famous musicians are in the studio and I don't dispute that they are on the end product, I am sure that the videoing and the music heard are different. It just doesn't have that \\"live\\" feel to it! Watch the drummer or percussion closely!  Compare this to something like the Casino Lights DVD with Fourplay, Boney James, Kirk Whallum etc. Now that is obviously live - they make the odd mistake! Very disappointing.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|After some research I found several well regarded information sources pointing to this cooler. This cooler had garnered great remarks from the authors and high testing scores versus the competition. This unit was the overall choice for my needs.    One item too note. This is a MASSIVE cooler! You need plenty of case and headroom for a proper fit. Make your case measurements before you by. Measure twice, buy once!
B000EHPZK4|4.0|This is a classic toy that is fun for all ages. I love the three different boards (easy, medium, hard) so younger kids can try it. The red is fun and looks great in our den.
B001TODCII|4.0|2008's extremely violent thriller \\"Taken\\" features Liam Neeson as Brian Mills, a retired spy whose daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) is kidnapped by white slavers from her apartment in Paris.<br /><br />Mills puts the skill set of his former employment to work.  He is prepared to rescue his daughter by any means necessary.  What follows is a thrill ride across Paris, through streets, cellars, apartments, offices and bridges, as Mills methodically and ruthlessly wrings information from various felons and follows the clues to a final showdown on a barge in the Seine River.<br /><br />The action is fast, furious, and fatal, as Mills leaves a trail of corpses behind him.  The good news is that they all had it coming.  The bad news is the PG-13 rating should be taken seriously.  The short running time (90 minutes) and almost continuous action cover up some gapping plot holes, while leaving little room for moral ambiguity.  \\"Taken\\" is highly recommended to those fans of action movies who still miss \\"Dirty Harry.\\"
B000Q6ZG5M|3.0|Harry Potter & the Sorcerer's Stone is a pleasant introduction to the team of actors who have grown up in this series of films. This isn't one of the better films in this series because Chris Columbus has done a pedestrian job as the director - he created a film about magic that simply lacks the magic of later entries in this series.  The best thing about this film is the cast.
B000FS9FC6|5.0|A terrorist freedom fighter known only as \\"V\\" begins a violent guerilla campaign to destroy those who've succumbed to totalitarianism, and recruits a young woman he's rescued from the secret police to join him. This movie is richly satisfying and very entertaining. When movies are at their best.
B000Q6ZG5C|4.0|Alfonso Cuarón comes on as the new director of this series and adds the magic that was missing from the earlier films.  The cast is still fun and the blue ray dvd is an improvement on the regular dvd
B000AWYOG4|3.0|It all begins inside Apartment 9F. This is where a single mother, Dahlia Williams, is trying to make a brand-new start in life. Attempting to escape from a bitter custody battle with her estranged husband, Dahlia moves with her daughter Ceci to a dilapidated, sprawling housing block on Roosevelt Island at the very edges of New York City. This movie has plenty of creepy moments, but not any satisfying jolts.
B001BTG3OQ|5.0|I have 3 SB-800s and 1 SB-600 and just bought the SB-900. It is so much easier to use than the other two flashes. It is definitely a big flash, but it works great for me.
B000E97Y6A|4.0|Flamboyant, foolhardy documentary filmmaker, Carl Denham, sails off to remote Skull Island to film his latest epic with leading lady, Ann Darrow. Native warriors kidnap Ann to use as a sacrifice as they summon \\"Kong\\" with the local witch doctor. But instead of devouring Ann, Kong saves her. Kong is eventually taken back to New York where he searches high and low for Ann, eventually winding up at the top of the Empire State Building, facing off against a fleet of World War I fighter planes. This movie is magnificent and very entertaining for a remake.
B0002DB52M|5.0|I wasn't expecting to give this five stars until its ending, surely one of the most stunning plot twists in cinematic or literary history.<br /><br />Without giving the twist away, the film essentially asks the question - how do you demonstrate respect for someone? Is it more respectful to 'forgive' someone their trespasses against you (as a Christian would)? Or are you showing them greater respect by crushing them into the ground? Is it more arrogant to hold someone to a lower standard and forgive them, or to hold them to a higher standard and judge them accordingly?<br /><br />Very few philosophical movies are as effective as this one, but you have to keep watching through to the very end, otherwise the message will be lost on you. As for the comments that it's 'anti-American', they completely miss the point - the film could have been set almost anywhere.<br /><br />The film is also noteworthy for Nicole Kidman's performance - usually a totally overrated and wooden actress, director Lars von Trier has somehow brought the best out in her, as she handles the lead role exceptionally.
6305433909|5.0|Deloris Van Cartier, now a headliner in Las Vegas, is persuaded by the good sisters to return to her inner city alma mater, St. Francis High, to go undercover as the new music teacher. This is a great feel good movie that brings song, and teaches one how to follow your dreams. A true inspiration for the young and old that you can pursue your dreams.
B00003CXRM|5.0|I can enjoy it more now that I have the CD... really funny and love the music!
B00005KAQP|5.0|A mobster's girlfriend cum trashy lounge singer is sent to a convent under the Witness Protection Program, and leads the choir there to national fame. This movie is excellent. The characters are hillarious and well-acted. A great cast and some wonderful songs, makes this movie a sure winner.
B00001U0DP|3.0|This highly acclaimed film is not without controversy.  The highly successful Italian comedian Roberto Benigni has created a film that uses all the time tested techniques of comedy and brings them to one of the most horrific chapters in human history, the systematic deaths of millions of Jewish people by the Germans in World War II. He is a master of slapstick which he combines with romantic comedy in the first half of the film. Every silly strategy from cars without breaks to raw eggs in hats is used. The first half of the film, except for a few references to fascism, is as light as a Rock Hudson and Doris Day romantic comedy with Benigni's wife Nicoletta Braschi playing his romantic interest. Benigni is the lovable clown character, the wise-fool, which is a standard in Western literature and films. In addition, Benigni uses a child actor, Giorgio Cantinini who is superb and is possibly the most appealing child actor since Shirley Temple in the 1930s. Thus there is a group of viewers who are thrilled and moved by the theme that a loving and inventive father could use his humor, intelligence, imagination, and love for his small son to hide and save that son in a concentration camp. This is understandable since we all want to believe that the human spirit can overcome all adversity and horror; that we can use our gifts to counter terror; that we can save innocence in the human condition through humor and creativity.     However, there are also groups of viewers who found the film highly offensive and their criticism bears analysis and thought. The film has absolutely no historic accuracy and the German's created a systematic killing machine that was structured so that no one could save themselves, no matter how creative or funny they may be. In summary of these critics, they point out that Benigni does to the viewing audience exactly what the character Guido is doing for his little son, shielding the viewer from the real horror and terror of the holocaust.    A defense of the film might be that the film attempts to show mankind at its best and mankind at its worst. However, the depiction of mankind at its worst was never remotely portrayed in this film. This may leave many viewers with a sense of dishonesty. If someone made a comedy film about the horror of 9/11, our entire nation would be offended. Keep this in mind when you hear that many found this film to be painful and dishonest.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|English comedy - you gotta love it.  This remastered edition is worth the purchase price it you were ever an afficianado.  I remember trying to watch it on our PBS station with its poor antenna reception...so this is pure fun, or pure funny.  Especially if you are a John Cleese fan.
0307593525|3.0|Just received my 2 volume set and am excited to dig into them.  Just a word to future buyers, my 2nd volume is bound backwards - not a huge problem since the internal content seems in tact but if you are planning on buying it as a gift, it doesn't look so nice.  Just an FYI for you.  Otherwise, cook till your heart's content!  Bon Apetit!
B000NU2CY4|2.0|Most reviewers seem to point out the edge enhancement (EE) and noise reduction as the primary issues with this Blu-ray release of this modern historical epic that has become a classic. After viewing, I've concluded that may not be the entire story. It looks to me like the source film scan may have been lower resolution, perhaps coming from a previous DVD release. The aim of the EE, which is an unsharp mask filter, is to increase visual acuity, or the perceived resolution. This is okay when there is resolution there to enhance, but the film does not seem to have the resolution you'd expect from high bitrate HD, and appeared more like up sampled DVD. Throw on top of that noise reduction, which can destroy details in the process of hiding noise, and you have a heavily compromised image. In addition, the colors and contrast were not very 'punchy'. Overall the image seemed muted and stale, I've seem better HD images on Comcast.    My playback set-up is a Mitsubishi 73\\" DLP on PC with the best available hardware and software. It could be that I've become spoiled by modern releases such as The Dark Knight and Transformers 2, both of which look absolutely jaw dropping on a DLP. But I don't believe that's the answer because I've seen much older films released on Blu-ray that look excellent, Goodfellas for example (on HD-DVD). Additionally, the sound track seemed heavily compressed on my 2-channel set-up. I'd describe the sound as `dead'. The dialog was muddy and the LFE track was nonexistent.    The only redeeming quality of this release is the film itself, which was just as superb as I remembered it. This was the first time I've seen the extra scenes. I felt they changed the flow of the film and compromised the plot on several points. The scene where Commodus takes a sword to a marble sculpture of his father Marcus Aurelius stood out for me. This emotional outburst showed commodious as even more physiologically weak than I remember, nearly to the point where he is sympathetic. Another scene that stood out was the execution of two Praetorian guardsman when Commodus manipulates General Quintus into giving the execution order in spite of his pleas to spare the accused traitors. This scene changed my perception of Quintis. Why did he suddenly decide to support his former friend Maximus in the final scene where Maximus fights Commodus when he could have over thrown him on several previous occasions? Who does Quintis really stand behind? Is he a moral character; or merely a soldier following orders? Does he fight for Rome, or does he fight for the emperor? Overall, I understand why these scenes were cut in the interest of time for an already lengthy film. They do fill in some holes and add some interesting details to the film and were worth watching, but subtract from the plot as much as they add.    In summary, don't buy this Blu-ray release. If you're a big fan of the film, and want to see it on Blu-ray, I would recommend renting this and buying a later release that will hopefully be much better.
B001FB4W0C|3.0|The disc were in good condition as promised. I love the show so I'm well pleased.
0756405890|4.0|I hate to say it-because its a wonderful book....  But in a series like this I think a huge delay like this does way too much to the flow of the story.  You lose your connection with the characters and the great details of the book.  I feel bad for him that so much has gone on in his life and totally don't blame the author.  But publishers should not publish a series until all the books-(or at least the second one) is/are finished.  I won't buy a book like this again where the others are not out.  It is too disappointing.       That being said it really is great.  Not full of cliche fantasy standards and overdone \\"magic.\\"  It is subtle and really well written and the main character is very likable and complex.  Many fantasy books I zip through..fun to read but nothing that I take my time with.  This one I tried to read slowly to enjoy the careful and interesting writing.  Would have given it 5 stars but for the huge delay between books.  I was going to give it three stars but... but restrained myself when I realized it was just my overblown reaction as a sci-fi/fantasy geek that is getting tired of series that either have huge delays between books or have a million books in the series and never end.  The book itself- delays aside- is quite fabulous.
B001BKG9SK|4.0|after watching a performance on tv, my husband and I were so impressed by David Gilmore....and I decided to purchase this for Christmas.  Unfortunately, I forgot it in the Christmas rush and we have yet to watch it!
0895260131|1.0|A serie of books and against Islam and Muslisms that this author with no academic and scholary merit wrote is enough prooof his intention.
0307266303|5.0|This book has to be one of the most remarkable reads of nonfiction I have come across in years.  A must-read for several good reasons:  The Tarahumara tribe of Mexico, the research on foot and leg injuries and why the shoe industry is at fault, and the very colorful cast of characters who embody that trite expression:  truth is stranger than fiction!  Read it and enjoy!
0330449605|5.0|This book takes you away to a far away land.  I would save it for when everyone was out of the house and I wanted to be taken to another world.  Loved it.
0316017922|5.0|An excellent and novel way of looking at \\"success\\" ... Excellently written, and listening to it was as if I was attending a fascinating lecture ... the time flew by far too quickly ... I was so enthralled with the concepts presented, and the writing that I ended up recommending the book to everyone I knew, and gifted copies of the book to many of my friends.
B002HWRZH0|5.0|Yes, I am the fanatic they make these for. With all the gift sets they made for the blu ray release of this movie, I have three copies. This one is really nice. It comes with a very detailed pewter replica of the famous starship. Great collectable with a great movie. If you collect models or miniatures, this one is for you.
B00005JKN9|3.0|First of all let me say the movie Gangs of New York is an excellent film.  I saw it in the theater and then purchased it on DVD and again on VHS (after I got the DVD).      The DVD for this movie sucks.  Many of the other reviewers have mentioned the lack of Mr. Scorcese extra footage he had to cut.  I was unaware of that, but my beef with this release is the fact that the movie is only 167 minutes long and they spread it onto 2-disks.  I'm all for two disc editions of DVDs I love the extras that get included because of them, but this 2-disc edition should have only been one disc.  If Francis Ford Coppola can fit the Godfather Pt. 2 on a single disc then Mr. Scorcese could have to.  I hate having to get up in the middle of the movie to change the blasted disc it is uncalled for.  When I found this out I immediately went and purchased the VHS, ha ha problem solved all on one tape.  If you have a working vcr or blu ray go with it instead of this crummy release an absolute waste of resources.      P.S.  Buena Vista -- Hurry Up and Release Mr. Scorceses true vision aka Director's Cut and keep the movie itself on one disc.  Fill the second disc with special features.
B001782N4A|4.0|I collect toy robots, and Star Wars gives me plenty to collect. This is nice because it is functional at what it is meant for, yet fun. It has a demo button to make it beep and talk when you press it, and it makes the same sounds when you plug something into it. Unlike an older USB hub, this one does not need an ac adapter to work...it gets all its power from your computer. Highly recommended for the robot collector and Star Wars fan.
B001GJOL22|5.0|This is my first Rush in Blu-Ray.  If you are a Rush fan, just get it.
B002MU4NL8|5.0|I have been a trekker since the sixties...been to the conventions, made the costumes, built the models. This movie hits all that hard on the head, and in a good way. We know how goofy we can be, and we can laugh at ourselves. And when this came out in Blu ray, it was a must have. Great movie, great cast, spoofing a great show. Highly recommended.
B0015DROBO|5.0|The tragedy of Stieg Larsson's work lies in the finite.  This, the first in a trilogy, is a beautiful introduction to characters so richly explored that you feel an emptiness when you have read the last page.  Larsson's gift for storytelling with mystery, murder and love is not often seen in modern literature.
B000ZELISO|2.0|The case for the blue-ray was broken inside, where the disc is stored.  The outside of the case was in perfect condition but the inside was shattered, but somehow the disc was not damaged.  The same thing happened to another blu-ray I purchased at the same time.
B002MBAJ4M|5.0|This is one of those bands that I always wanted to hear but kept putting on the backburner for some reason. Well I finally bought this note unheard and I am blown away. This is brilliant. Meets my expectations and then some. The weakest tracks are very good and some of these songs are masterpieces. This one's gonna get some heavy rotation. Now I've gotta get busy and start checking out the back catalog. I'm kicking myself for not doing it sooner!
B000ZELISO|2.0|I hated the blu-ray version with all of the character pop-ups.  I definately will not be watching this version.  The pop-ups were a total distraction.  I will only view the DVD.  That's a shame since I paid for both...
B0026P3G12|5.0|This CD is even better than I expected. Ms. Boyle's voice is incredible and there's something on the CD for almost everyone.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|I have all the other seasons of Supernatural.  A few of my favorite are: \\"Lazarus Rising\\" Dean returning to Earth and the introduction of Castiel, \\"After School Special\\" Dean in that gym oufit, \\"It's a Terrible Life\\" showing Sam and Dean still end up fighting the unknown no matter what life they are in, and \\"The Monster At the End of the Book\\" our heroes discover the novels featuring two brothers fighting the demons.  I know Season 5 will be another must have.  I like the way this dvd set is set up with the dvds on their own flip spine and the booklet clipped up front.
B001GCUO52|2.0|The first Final Destination was a surprising guilty pleasure, Final Destination 2 was enjoyable trash, and Final Destination 3 was an empty disappointment considering what came before it.  This fourth installment of New Line's horror series, creatively titled The Final Destination, finds FD 2 helmer David Ellis returning to the director's chair, only this time around the utilization of 3-D has been implemented.  The end result however offers up a few decent shocks, but is an otherwise forgettable teens dying in horrible ways dirge.  This time around, a group of friends manages to survive the destruction at a racetrack when one of them (Bobby Campo) has a premonition of their impending, bloody doom.  As said before, The Final Destination offers up some decent shocks and reasonably impressive and creative deaths, but what's in between them is nothing that hasn't been seen plenty of times before.  Combine that with the illogical plotting, terrible dialogue, stiff acting, and the fact that the 3-D moments are more few and far between then they really should be, and the end result is an installment in a franchise that is definitely on life support.  All in all, the 3-D gimmick alone isn't enough to save The Final Destination from mediocrity, but it is still worth a look at least for horror fans looking for one or two solid shocks.
0812550706|1.0|I feel like all the other reviewers who gave this book 1 star. The book's plot line was weak, I got tired of the endless military babel and the snooze fest \\"battles.\\"  The book had unnecessary religious undertones, add to that the continuous anti-military/anti-authority propaganda and you have a great brain washing book for young minds.  The only thing I can see that made this book redeemable was the obsessive game play, I SUPPOSE young boys/men who never grew up types love reading about someone playing video games, but I personally need a little more to keep me entertained.  This book was a huge waste. If only Card could reimburse me my time and money then maybe I wouldn't feel ripped off.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|This was hands down a wonderful movie from the beginning to the end. Every single actor in this movie was superb! Without giving away the story, it saddens me to have seen how easily it was to place someone into a mental institution without a valid reason back then. Without the help of people around you back then or ones who really knew you, you were a target for anyone who had a point to make. In this story the easiest thing to do was to give up, give in and not believe in yourself. The fight was not in everyone back then. This lady fought. I mean ..REALLY FOUGHT HARD! She fought hard for everything she believed in until she got it. I admire the movie makers of this film for stepping out on faith to retell it. It is definitely inspiring and challenges people today to believe and never ever give up. Great movie...
B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this dvd after reading in Self magazine this month that Carrie Underwood uses Jillian's dvds. I wanted to find something that incorporated weights because I hate to use weight machines at the gym. I work out 4-5 days and let me tell you, I did this dvd for the first time yesterday and already feel it!! That was only doing it on level 1! I actually struggled with reaching up and putting the dishes away from the dishwasher. Her work-outs go so quickly because you are working so hard, and you do feel the results. I can't wait to see how I feel after 30 days since I have felt such results after one day!! Buy this dvd!
B001HIJYR4|5.0|OMG!!!! This is an awesome movie! I have to tell you to make this purchase. There is action from the beginning to the end. You can't go to the restroom or for snacks while it is on. I have never in my entire life watched a movie that made me squirm soooo much. Whew! The stunts are off the chain! Wow!
B000LYCNJQ|5.0|My 10 yr old loves all the Star Wars movies and he watches them over and over.
B002VUFKG6|1.0|I really was inspired by Eat, Pray, Love.  I had high hopes for this next book.  I bought it on Kindle prior to any reviews.  Man, am I sorry. BOOORRRIINNGGGG.  And you can't get any refunds on digital content.  I normally give any book it's due. I keep reading beyond when I'm bored, every word.  About halfway through this slog, I stared skipping pages at a time, looking for real human interest content.  Sorry, sorry, sorry, don't buy this book.
B000VBJEFK|5.0|While this is possibly one of the most uncommon movie story lines that one could imagine, the genius of Brad Bird and Pixar turns what I would have normally expected to be a generic family movie into a feast for the eyes and the soul. The movie, the audio, and the story are all wonderfully entertaining and on Blu-Ray the quality is that of the theater itself in both visual and audio fidelity. It is a highly recommended movie for family times and there are moments in the movie which are truly moving in a way that only Pixar seems able to do. My compliments to the chefs at Pixar for delivering this one as it is a dish that is best served multiple times and goes down well at every sitting, even years after originally seeing it in theaters...
1423101472|5.0|I thought the book The Last Olympian was a great book because it had a lot of action. When Percy and all of the half bloods went to New York City to defend Olympus from Kronos a huge war broke out between the half bloods and all the under world monsters. The war lasted for multiple days and was very exciting. Also there was a lot of action when Percy and his friend sneaked aboard one of Kronos's ships to try to stop it from getting to Olympus.  They got caught setting bombs in the lower part of the ship. The action continued when they got in a battle with monsters. Percy even fought Kronos on the ship! When these parts happened in the book I could not stop reading. The detail in the action parts made the book extremely exciting, and easy to visualize in my head. The detailed action made this book amazing.   Another reason I liked the book is because it takes place in present day even though it is about ancient Greece. The characters use modern things like cell phones. When they are in New York City they need some way to communicate so they use cell phones like we would.  Since it takes place in modern times it makes the book easier to understand. This made this book better and more exciting to read. Another example is the location of Olympus.  Instead of Olympus being in Greece, it is on the top floor of the Empire State Building. Modern things made the book easier to follow and a bit funny.   I would give the book five out of five stars for its action and exciting story board. The story is very descriptive and easy to visualize. It was my favorite book series ever. I would recommend it to teens and kids who love exciting action books.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|The shipping was fast and was packaged so it came flawless.  This was the one item my niece really wanted.  Thanks for the great price!
1569242739|5.0|This is my favorite dessert cookbook - or wait - is it Vegan Cookies Invade Your Cookie Jar?  Well, get both just to be on the safe side.  I think the best way to show people how great vegan cooking can be is the bring them a cupcake with a smile.  This is the secret weapon for vegan diplomacy that every animal activist should have.    The golden vanilla cupcake is the most basic and yet the most versatile.  I have used it with different extracts and even made a 9\\" layer cake with it.  So good!  My other favorites are the Chocolate Stout, Mucho Margarita, Coconut Lime, Brooklyn Vs. Boston Creme Pie.  I love that the recipes do not use egg replacer, but use alternatives to getting fluffy cupcakes that hold together nicely.
0805091742|4.0|I came across this book because of a positive review by Malcolm Gladwell and I finished it in a few days.  The ideas of using checklists in this book make complete sense as the author lays out a compelling argument and uses good anecdotal and empirical evidence on how checklists can be helpful.  While about 2/3 of the book is focused on medical examples, he spruces in enough examples in other fields to show how almost anyone can utilize checklists.  So while my only knock would be that there's too much medical examples, I don't think that really takes away from the overall message.
B001684L0A|5.0|Excellent movie!  This movie is very well done, portraying an American hero (and his family) in our historical times.  Outstanding attention to detail in every facet.  This is a must see for everyone, American or not, to see the hardship and the sacrifice made to gain our countries independence.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Awesome talent, great debut album. A collection of songs in a variety of muscial genre from gospel to light jazz. After we listened to it my husband(mostly a country music guy) said \\"Wow - makes me want to hear more.\\" Looking forward to her next one. Also Amazon had this available before many others.
B000ZMX8CU|5.0|Now I can play when I don't have access to my amp, or when its really late, and it sounds killer too.
B00005JPD0|3.0|This film is nearly three years old but still drawing considerable comment. That should tell you something. For all its flaws, this movie is an enjoyable, fast moving action thriller that's worth the viewing.    The \\"science\\" itself relies on a science fiction cliche which doesn't hold up in reality. If you know the real science behind wormholes, the plot device may bother you to the point that your enjoyment of the movie will be lessened. But if you can allow yourself the \\"willing suspension of disbelief\\", you'll have an enjoyable experience.    Denzel Washington is one of the finest actors of our time and he shows why in this movie. His character provides the moral center and action focus of this movie. Denzel's riveting performance makes this man come alive as you see the plot unfold from his viewpoint, drawing you in and keeping you focused.    Val Kilmer is a disappointment in the way he plods through the movie. He reads his lines, but that's about it. Paula Patton does a fine job, creating a believable, vulnerable character, such that you really care about her fate. The actor who plays her father has a small role but a key one. His scenes are small but crucial, and he does a fine job.    Tony Scott's ability to craft an action thriller makes the best use of Denzel's talents and the talents of all the cast. The story moves along, never dragging nor jumping too much, and the action sequences keep you completely engaged. Scott does a fine job of combining a good action film with a well done human story. For all his technical skill, he never makes the big mistake you see in other films such as the Bourne series. In those films, the director is always saying \\"Look at me! Look at how I use the camera, or how I x,y,z.\\" Scott keeps the focus on the story, and uses his considerable skill to let the story tell itself.    It's not a great social statement by any means, but it's an enjoyable evening's movie viewing experience, even with the bogus science.
B002R68U7K|1.0|This boxset is great if you haven't been collecting her singles - in fact, it was made so that new fans who weren't around to buy these the first time would drop anywhere from 60-100 bucks on the Britney Machine.<br /><br />Problem is, they aren't the real singles - these are just replicas in cardboard sleeves that only have one bonus track per disc. Her real singles can be up to an hour long with remixes, instrumentals, unreleased tracks, screen savers, videos - you name it! This box set has nothing to offer the long time collectors. Even the booklet is just screen caps from her videos, so there is nothing new for people who already have all of this stuff.<br /><br />The DVD with her music videos was made as a single layer disc rather than dual-layer, so the quality suffers. I can't believe they took a visual performer and released a DVD that is of poor quality. She already released a DVD of her music videos and it happens to feature more than this boxset version does.<br /><br />The box itself is barely large enough to close over the CDs inside of it. There are also versions of this box set with typos and track errors on the sleeves. Why was this so cheaply made?<br /><br />A few of the tracks have had little things changed since their original album versions, but in my opinion it doesn't warrant buying this set. \\"Remastered\\" or not, this is not worth the current selling price of sixty-seven dollars.<br /><br />This is a small representation of her work compared to the stuff you get when you buy up the real singles individually. Let's face it - the fans who have been here for her since the beginning were NOT considered when they came out with this.
B001AVCFK6|3.0|I'm not the biggest Trek fan ever but I am a big enough fan to be bothered by J.J. Abrams dumbed-down Star Trek. I don't go to the conventions or anything but I have watched every episode of all of the TV shows (minus DS9, just couldn't get into it) and ever single movie several times. Now when I go see a movie called \\"Star Trek\\" that is what I expect to get is a Star Trek movie. That doesn't sound too crazy does it? Instead I got a generic action Sci-Fi flick. This movie has more in common with Star Wars (not saying Star Wars is bad, at least with the original trilogy) then it does with Star Trek. I understand they wanted a more accessible and more popular movie to relaunch the series with (not that it needed to be relaunched) but they could have easily accomplished this without destroying everything that Star Trek is. They didn't have to make the Phasers into Star Wars blasters and they could have included just 10 or 15 minutes extra into the movie to explain the science of what was going on. Something Star Trek has always been about, not to mention character relationships but we'll forget that for the sake of a summer blockbuster. Instead we are left with no idea what the hell red matter is. Oh and by the way you can't travel through a black hole! The word the script writers were looking for was wormhole. How could they not even get that right? Regardless of my complaints it's still a fun action movie. It just seems to me that they could have rebooted the series and made it more accessible without throwing everything out the window that makes Star Trek what it is. Like I said, 10 or 15 minutes extra to the movie is all they needed, plus some fact checking on the script, and I would have been fine, even happy. However J.J. Abrams was too quick to make the film he wanted and not the film that Trekkies wanted. Note to Abrams: when making a franchise film, leave out your trademark red matter bull crap,just because it worked on Alias doesn't mean it works everywhere,and slusho references. Anyway if your looking for a fun action flick to pass the time, you could do a lot worse than Star Trek and it does look great in Blu-Ray.
B00288KNLS|4.0|I love this movie so much and bought the collectors edition before the movie was released. I am actually slightly disappointed because the 3D version in fact, is not that great at all. Along with the movie, the ad said that there would be attached 3D glasses to watch the movie in 3D(which was incredible in theaters) but the glasses were the really poor quality paper with red and black lenses you would find in a cereal box. If someone was excited to see this in 3D, there is no hope. It degrades the movie with the glasses on. Also, even with the theater quality 3D glasses(don't ask how I have them) it doesn't seem to work at all because of a different 3D formatting I would assume.     However, the problems the glasses create for the 3D version are corrected in the 2D. For example, most of the reason why Coraline is so fantastic is use of vibrant colors. With the red and blue lenses in 3D, all you see is shades of red and blue. The colors in the 2D version are fantastically maintained theater quality.     The reason for my 4 star rating is because of the 3D version lacking so much and the glasses being completely useless. The 2D version is great, but the 3D version in theaters was better. Unfortunately, there is a slight difference in experiencing the movie in 3D. I'm still satisfied enough to watch the 2D video though, and the extras are awesome to watch as well.
B0017I1FP8|5.0|I love film scores but I have never bought a soundtrack like this one. Genres like this tend to have film scores that are more unsettling than enjoyable to listen to, but the music in this film score is enjoyable and also, I would say, energizing! I listen to it when I run or bikeride sometimes. It's amazing, totally recommended.
B001GCUO16|5.0|I was never into the other X-men movies, but this one is great, and looks awesome on blu-ray. It tells the story of how Wolverine became a mutant, and shows how he became who he is. Loved it!
B002N3GD8K|2.0|Not what I expected, but with knowing the quality of the cd (bad mastering and typos in the booklet and credits) there was a red flag about this all along.  This is a 4-disc set, the jacket is a simple double jacket made out of paper so thin that you usually find it used for die-cut maxi singles. So you can image how soft it is, and they put two records inside each pocket. The vinyls are very thin and they almost bend if you keep one on your finger in the spindle hole.  They barely fit inside the jacket, almost sticking out. But if you stick them in really good so that they don't stick out, the will be so tight towards the spine of the jacket that you will see the round shape of the vinyls on the jacket, not to mention bending the discs over time. It's so cheap. Why bother producing this if it's going to be this bad quality? It is not worth the price.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|We were not able to see this when it was out in the theaters, so we were counting on the bluray to be good. The picture was gorgeous and the movie is awesome. The movie was so well cast, and the writing was phenomenal- lots of great scifi and action with a great mix of humor. I LOVE that Leonard Nemoy is in the movie. Yes, I know it's sappy, but it actually brought tears to my eyes to see the \\"real\\" Spock. Definitely one you'll want to watch multiple times.
1439102813|4.0|Finally, a good read written by a thoughtful and intelligent author.  Happy me.     Lately, it seems like most of the books I pick up are a true waste of time. NOT THIS ONE.    I like the fact that we were hearing Alice's viewpoint. Excellent, it would have been sad to hear only the people around her.      I can't wait until the next book comes out.
B000H2AH7W|3.0|'Childhood's End' has a reputation as one of the greatest science fiction novels ever written. And I'll admit the premise is compelling. But the book fails because Clarke does not create a single character worth caring about. Sure humanity is transformed, but the reader's emotions remain untouched.

1843106698|5.0|I am a retired teacher. Where was this book when I was teaching?I recommend this book to parents and teachers.
030014332X|5.0|This book was written many years ago. It does not say exactly when but ends in the second world war. It is written as a textbook. Use simple language, no history analysis is done. Just described. There are quite famous quotations. It is explained with simple words and to a public that knows almost nothing about. There is greater emphasis on ancient history but in general it can be said that it is well distributed in terms of stages of history. It's entertaining. If you know nothing of history or just remember what came to school, this is a good book to start. If your skills are above normal the book will seem empty. To me has helped me to fill in gaps I had.
B001608QVS|5.0|I just received my Dirty Harry Ultimate Collector's Edition Blu-ray and have to say that I am overwhelmed by the extraordinary extras and stellar packaging.  Warner Bros. has both my respect and gratitude for delivering a box set that is truly special and clearly designed with die-hard Harry fans in mind.<br /><br />The five films which comprise this set stand up beautifully on their own, filled with the same raw, fierce energy that has always served to set them apart from the standard cops-and-robbers flicks which preceded and followed Dirty Harry.  However, the addition of such unique swag as- reproductions of Warner Bros. Departmental memos and letters from studio brass and star Clint Eastwood, movie poster cards from all 5 films, detailed poster map chronicling the route of Harry's first adventure, replica badge/i.d. card, and hardback book- serves to push this Blu-ray box set to the front of the line in terms of quality, originality, and value.<br /><br />If you are a Dirty Harry fan treat yourself to this spectacular box set.  You won't be disappointed!
B0026P3G12|5.0|I will not labor the rags to riches story of Susan Boyle here as it is well known. Suffice to say the first album released by her is pretty impressive, (and I'm no aficionado of popular music, being more classically oriented). Who would have thought you could take music by the Rolling Stones, Monkees, and Madonna, and make it sound new! Plaudits there to her producer Steve Mac, despite whining by self proclaimed music experts giving music reviews on Amazon.   It is indeed unfortunate that the CD released to the western hemisphere did not include the beautiful \\"Wings to Fly\\" track included in the CD sold in Japan, however I am sure that will be rectified when a second album comes out.  Some reviewers have noted that they like Ms Boyle's voice but were unhappy with the choice of song. I cannot understand why? Some of these songs clearly have a personal meaning to Ms Boyle and, being cognizant of her difficult upbringing, are a way for her to hammer a final nail into the coffin of those who were unkind, and her current detractors.   The songs chosen are beautifully sung. Ms. Boyle is still learning her trade and has gone from proverbially singing in a choir in church each Sunday to being instantly recognized wherever she goes. Are there many of us who could handle such pressure? To all those reviewers out there who are carping at miniscule issues, my advice would be to sit back, relax, and let what is an undoubtedly astounding talent mature. I am sure you will not be disappointed.
0307588335|1.0|Finished reading it a couple of weeks ago.  An OK book.  The book goes into the details of how a group of high level officers internally tried preventing the upper management from taking on more debt and going more into owning the mortgages of highly overvalued residential properties.    However, the book lacks (a) the big-picture view of the reasons why Lehman went down the path it did and (b) what was the impact of the collapse on the industry.  The first part of the book goes on Mr. McDonald's rambling on how he accomplished the things that he did in the finance industry.  However, much of it is irrelevant to the main theme of the book.    Later part of the book also doesn't deal well with the subject. It is very personalized to a few people who he has worked with.  Of course, the industry had a lot more brilliant people than he mentioned.  He seems to think that only his colleagues were the brightest people on wall street.  If that is so, then why did these supposedly brilliant people not resign out of Lehman Brothers and make a lot of money shorting its stock?  They could have made a lot more money than what they would have lost in their long term compensation!    Don't waste your time reading this if you are interested in some serious stuff.  If you something light weight related to finance, this is a good book to spend time on.    -Chandra.

B002OB9KPE|2.0|Don't get me wrong - I highly respect NM - love Spock's Beard, the first two Transatlantic efforts, and appreciate Neal's solo releases. But this is so much in line with his solo work - complete with religious message - that it is unmistakably one-sided. The musicianship is all top-notch, but the overall feel is uninspired, predictable and just too serious. I understand that is work is dedicated to Neal's father, which would explain that. It just sounds like there was very little input from the other members on the main CD. The bonus CD has some redeeming moments, especially with Hogweed, and the diversity of the other tracks. Overall, I'm disappointed by this release and could not recommend to a friend.

B002NULL9E|3.0|No, sadly, I cannot recommend this album.  I am a long-term Queen fan, and purchased this new compilation for the remastered sound and photo booklet.  The remastered sound is, indeed, good quality (whatever that's worth to one's untrained ear); however, several key tracks are missing from this compilation, most notably Innuendo off eponymous 1991 album.  For a more complete introduction to this band, better purchase the Queen - Greatest Hits, Vols. 1&2 box set - that is, unless you are particularly keen on acquiring that photo booklet.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|This was a great purchase.  Although we don't own a Blu-ray yet, I assume we will in the future and now I have both for only a few more dollars than the DVD price.  Made the mistake of then buying Sleeping Beauty in a 2 Disc Blu-ray set assuming it was the same deal, but it was not.

At the list price, i would not have purchased it.  At the discounted/sale price, it is close to $8 per movie.    Point of clarification.  The \\"Sale\\" price I paid is still much lower than what Amazon is currently pricing.  It was a Gold Box deal I believe just before Christmas.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|I played this game with family over the holidays and it was one of the best board games I've ever played. Would recommend this game for any group of people. The only downfall is that it is limited initially to four players. We have a very large family so it would have been nice if more people could have played. There are expansion packs that allow for more people to play, which would probably work out great. There are also different expansion packs that alter game play in some way, which would keep the game fresh. Great game!

0810979772|5.0|My 10 year old son loved this book.  Within minutes he was reading, writing, drawing... and most importantly using his imagination!  Does use some bathroom humor, but my son thought that was hilarious.  Offers lots of different things to do with examples on one side and room for your child's own thoughts or drawings on the other.  Really encourages your child to get creative.  Has quizzes, comic strips etc.  Plenty of fun stuff that my child had a blast with. Also includes blank, lined pages so that your child has room to journal.    Has held his interest for longer than I thought it would.  I see him from time to time carrying the book around with a pencil in hand.  When he get quiet and I ask what he's doing he replies \\"Writing in my book\\"!  He's not a studious child so this has been a remarkable experience for me!

B002T9H2LA|2.0|I don't see what all the hype is about. In every scene it seemed to take too long to get to the conclusion. I don't mind the subtitles and all that, but the first 20 min is just 2 guys sitting there talking(Snore).   It really wasn't that funny either. there were a couple of lines in the whole movie, and that's about it. Mike Meyers can't seem to get away from his Austin Powers character, and for a war movie he just doesn't seem to fit in.     How Quentin Tarantino got to be a director I will never know.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|100% worth the money! The reason the show got sacked is the reason its so good -- it was extremely detailed and costly to produce.

1416550542|5.0|I completely enjoyed this book, and looked forward to every minute that I could find to read it. The book is beautifully written, amazingly descriptive with wonderful character development. I had no problem following the back-and-forth between present, recent past and long ago, as the author deftly moved between the various time periods that are part and parcel of the story. While there were a few elements of the story that seemed to become a bit convoluted and strained, the beauty of the writing and the intrigue that is at the heart of the story more than made up for these few moments.   This book is truly a treat to read!
0786868724|5.0|Mitch Albom wrote one of my favorite books of the past 15 years, TUESDAYS<br />WITH MORRIE . . .

Albom accepts, but only on the condition<br />that he gets to conduct a series of interviews with the rabbi to get to know him better.<br /><br /> Around the same, Albom also becomes involved with a Detroit pastor who also happens<br />to be a reformed drug dealer and convict . . . his church has its own problems; i.e., it<br />is decaying and there's a hole in its roof.<br /><br />The writing repeatedly moved me . . . to cite one such passage where that was the case:<br />* . . .  and I am in my religious high school.

I look across the room to a girl<br />I like and contemplate how hard it would be to get her attention.<br /><br />\\"There is a Talmudic commentary here,\\" the teacher says.<br /><br />Oh, great I figure.

1401322336|5.0|I actually bought this for my brother a few years ago as he was looking to get into cooking for himself.  After he used it for sometime I was over and browsed through it more myself.  As a young bachelor it's probably the best cookbook I've leafed through so I bought it myself.  Excellent recipes, great advice on how to choose cuts of meat, and a light but comprehensive overview on cooking methods, equipment and everything in general.  It's all geared at the very natural in foods and combining great tastes.  Few if any recipes contain anything that is processed as an ingredient.  Most everything has a sub-recipe for the sauce/condiment/base.    Pros:  If you're not necessarily looking for recipes that are \\"family\\" orientated or \\"In Under 20 Minutes\\" you'll seriously enjoy this cookbook.  All the recipes do work well for families of course, but you're not going to get 30 pages of how to make different Rice Krispie treats.  Great pictures of the final dishes for nearly every recipe.  \\"Jools' Favorite Saturday Afternoon Pasta\\" may be one of my favorite new dishes and has been an absolute hit for everyone that has tried it.    Cons:  A few of the ingredients can be hard to come by if you're not near a farmer's market or a well-supplied grocery store.  Similarly, some of the advice relies on obtaining the ingredients from their nearest harvested state.  I live in the Midwest, not too many fish mongers around here...  Lastly, he seems to enjoy wrapping things in bacon quite often as well, and while this isn't necessarily a con, understand a solid 5% of the entree-type recipes are bacon wrapped or somehow involved with bacon.    Still 5/5 for the best cookbook a single guy can own.

1416572287|5.0|I loved it.  \\"Modern\\" physics seems to be at best counter intuitive, and sometimes some sort of fairy-tale fantasy.  I was reading about Solar-wind sail powered space ships in the newspaper and the big question-mark over my head said how can a particle with no mass push a sail?  This book explained, so I my 12 year-old grandson could understand it, that it is possible to have momentum without mass.    The conceit of talking to a dog about the problems of how to chase the squirrels in the backyard while demonstrating the insight into the workings of the universe makes this book readable and fun.  The dog describes itself as much smarter than the average dog.  The author describes it as a very mixed breed.  The three dogs pictured on the jacket look nothing like Emmy, who is actually shown on the inside flap, with the author.    Chad Orzel strikes me as a very interesting undergraduate science teacher.  Wish I had been exposed to more teachers like him.   This  book reminds me alot of the non-fiction works of Isaac Asimov some 40 years ago. He too could make esoteric science understandable to mere mortal humans.  Orzel does him one better and says even a dog (granted, a very special dog) can understand it.
B000VS6QTK|5.0|EDIT:    Someone pointed out that that Dolby Digital audio track on the blu-ray is the same in-your-gut mix on the original DVD/film.  I checked it out, and so it is!  So I am very pleased to rescind my original complaint.    It's very odd, however, that the new mix on the blu-ray (included as a lossless track) is so inferior to the original one.  By the way, even though the old mix is included in a lossy format (Dolby Digital), it sounds absolutely perfect.  I typically can hear the difference between lossy and lossless audio, and much prefer lossless.  But that fortunately doesn't appear to be an issue here.      ORIGINAL REVIEW:    I got the Blu-Ray, having already had the DVD. The picture quality is good. Nothing to complain about there. However, I'm disappointed with the new mix.    The bass guitar on the old DVD was very beefy, like you were standing in front of the amp. It shook my house (as it should). On the Blu-ray, however, it has an ambient sound, and the overall power/punch of the band suffers greatly.    All the other elements of the mix sound great. The uncompressed audio is a noticeable improvement (which is almost always the case, and a good reason to prefer the blu-ray format). It's sweeter to the ears.    But without that kicking low end, this doesn't \\"rock\\" to the extent it used to. Bummer.
B000IOM0WE|4.0|Aeon Flux (2005) is a slick science fiction adventure, with Aeon being a sleek, attractive, and athletic heroine.  The character is taken from an animated MTV short, created by Peter Chung.  Substantial changes were made in order to develop a suitable full length story, and to allow for the adaptation of an animated adventure, to a real life format.  The story is complicated, but holds together pretty well, and features various futuristic sets, numerous action sequences, and impressive special effects.<br /><br />In order to survive a deadly plague, drastic measures were required, and the last remnants of humanity live in a city with walls along its perimeter, called Bregna.  Life seems ideal, but a small organization, known as the Monicans seeks to destroy the government structure.  Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron), is an elite guerilla operative for the Monicans, who receives instructions telepathically, from the Handler (Frances McDormand).  Her next mission is huge, to assassinate the head of the government, Trevor Goodchild (Marton Csokas).  Tragically, before she is about to embark, Aeon's sister Una (Amelia Warner) is shot, apparently for being suspected as a Monican.<br /><br />Oren Goodchild (Jonny Lee Miller), is also a member of the Government, believing his brother Trevor is not with the program, he hatches a scheme to eliminate his older sibling using the Monicans.  With the help of Sithandra (Sophie Okonedo) another elite operative, Aeon enters the Cidadel, the seat of the government, and gets into position to complete her mission, but when face to face with Goodchild, Aeon hesitates, and is captured.  Things take a dramatic turn when Aeon learns the truth about Trevor, and the work he has been involved in.  The two team up to try and survive the Bregnan government, and the Monicans, who regard Aeon as a traitor.<br /><br />The film shifts into a high action mode in the final stretch.  There are some shaky, over the edge moments, but the result are exciting, stylized, and dramatic.  Whether the resolution is palatable, is another matter, as Aeon makes a decision that all humanity must live with.<br /><br />After Charlize Theron won an Oscar for Monster (2003), by her own admission, she did no major physical training, and needed to get in top shape for her physical demanding role as Aeon Flux.  Theron and Sophie Okonedo, both tall and athletic, underwent similar training regimes, eventually training together.  Remarkably, Theron did almost all of her own stunts, and amazed the production crew with her physical ability and timing.  Her acrobatic performance, in a skin tight suit, is quite impressive, as is that of Okonedo whose character has hands for feet.<br /><br />The  future world of Aeon Flux is intriguing, and semi-understandable, but with many mysterious elements.  There are theatrical show pieces like the cathedral where the Handler gives directions, a and blimp that flies over the city, and interdimensional transitions, that are really not explained.  The unique architecture of Berlin was featured, and helps give the film an certain ambiance and futuristic look.  Director Karyn Kusama (Jennifer's Body), whose only previous experience was Girlfight (2000), does a quite remarkable job in a challenging project.  The screenplay by Matt Manfredi and Phil Hay, apparently covered much more ground, and may have filled in some of the gaps.  Some 30 minutes was reportedly deleted from the director's cut, for the theatrical release.  Some may feel that the liberties taken with the character, had already gone too far.  Creator Peter Chung, apparently had some problems with the film.<br /><br />The blu-ray disc does not contain the director's cut, but appears to contain the same 92 minute version of the film, as well as the extras from the Special Collector's Edition.  This includes two separate commentary tracks, and a number of informative featurettes.  Graeme Revell contributes a cool score for the film.  Although perhaps an incomplete vision, for some thoughtful science fiction, with some stylized action, Aeon Flux is worth a look.  Based on her performance here, Charlize Theron has great potential in the action genre, and hopefully she will pursue this avenue at some future time.for some thoughtful science fiction, with some stylized action, Aeon Flux is worth a look.

0385737424|5.0|\\"Words can barely describe how I feel about this book and all it reveals about us as human beings. Miranda is the kind of girl we all are or were. We struggle to find out why things go the way they do and suffer, sometimes in silence, through the changes that happen in our lives. Being about the life of a girl in her early teens it's easy to assume it's written only to reveal the paths our lives can take when were young, but it is about much more. Primarily about caring for others and taking an active roll in transforming the lives of those around us. Doing these seemingly small things have the power to transform their lives and ultimately our own character. This is exactly what happens to Miranda. I may be alone in my thinking, but this is the way it touched me.<br /><br />\\"Rebecca Stead has beautifully crafted an amazing journey that spans what seems decades when it is only a few months. So many times in my reading of this book I thought I had some part of it completely figured out, only to learn I was just off and the subtle changes made the difference. After reading a bit more about Stead herself I can see where some of the twists come from, because as she says, \\"The most important thing to know about writing is that there are no rules.\\" Her imagination takes you places and helps you to feel things you may have not thought about in ages and it's wonderful.<br /><br />\\"My most genuine feeling about the journey of this book was how much I can't wait to share it with my own children, Littlebug in particular. When things can be so difficult, this book shows a way to make the best of things. It's truly a book for all ages and very appropriate for a young audience. And although I know it will appeal to younger readers I feel that an adult audience has so much to gain by reading When You Reach Me. As you will find deeper meaning in the relationships you have carried with you through the years.\\"

0385737947|5.0|When I initially sat down to read The Maze Runner, I thought it was going to be just like the many other dystopian novels that are popular now, but I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, it falls into the general category and meets all the criteria, but because the main setting of the book is apart from the actual \\"dystopia\\" you are able to experience so much more.<br /><br />The environment in which the boys live in is idyllic, maintained, and very near perfect with one exception. Many of the boys remember nothing of their pasts or where they came from before entering The Glade. In what you would expect to be near chaos you find order and harmony. Never in my life would I have believed that a large group of boys with no outside guidance would chose the lifestyle in which they reside. But why not? Everything they need they are provided with, including the means to create the additional wants they may have. With one exception, the way out.<br /><br />Only one thing stands in their way, the Grievers. It's amazing the power one obstacle has over an individual or group of people, and The Gladers are no different than the rest of us. In the midst of their struggles to find the way beyond this obstacle and a way back to the past they are all seeking, a kink is thrown in, a girl is \\"delivered\\" to them. And thus begins the chaos.<br /><br />Throughout all that occurs, from that point on, the central character, Thomas, shows that he's just a little different from the rest of The Gladers. He won't take the generic answers he's given and is determined to change the circumstances they are trapped in. Using this determination and leadership he provides a way for them to unite and defeat the Maze they are all trapped in. He shows us all the ability to overcome our obstacles is not only possible, but a reality.<br /><br />In the end I'm happy to say this is an amazing book with an original plot. The characters are genuine and will stay with you long after you've finished the book. It's also exciting to read a book that I will one day be able to share with The Turkeybird. We need more books that boys can enjoy just as much as girls and this one doesn't disappoint.  I highly recommend this book and can't wait to read the future installments due out in the next few years.t I will one day be able to share with The Turkeybird.

006145785X|4.0|This is a behaviorial economics book, I listened to the audiobook, which looks at how we are predisposed in certain situations to make irrational choices like:<br /><br />1. When people are given a third choice, a different version of one of two similar choices, the person will likely chose the choice with two options, like a trip to Paris with or without a free breakfast or Rome with a free breakfast, the person would likely chose Paris simply because the two choices of Paris predisposes the person to thinking of Paris. So, sometimes just adding a more expensive version of the same product will cause more of the product to be sold.<br /><br />2. Creating a new \\"anchor\\" can change the attractiveness of something, like Starbucks creating an attractive ambiance of its shops can make people want to pay more for coffee than at Dunkin' Donuts. Or, when a person moves from a city with inexpensive homes to a city with more expensive ones, the person is conditioned to buy a smaller home because he/she is 'anchored' to a certain price range. The same thing can work in reverse, affected by the particular 'anchor.'<br /><br />3. Social versus market norms can affect choices. People sometimes are likely to do more work for free if for a social cause, rather than being paid. Sometimes small gifts work better than more expensive ones, because they keep the relationaship more social and less market-driven. The implication is important as companies have become less generous with creating a family atmosphere with free healthcare and other things like free lunches, company picnics, etc workers likely will feel more dedicated and work harder.<br /><br />4. Ariely shows how sexual arousal alters a person's think so he/she will act less rational.<br /><br />5. The book also looks at procrastination and how just having a person set his/her own deadlines works better than having no deadlines.<br /><br />6. Ownership cause people to value something more than not owning it. That's why trial offers and money return guarantees work well.<br /><br />7. The book covers the placebo effect and why a 50 cent pill might be more effective than the same one costing $2.50.<br /><br />8. Thje book covers cheating and why simply having people contemplate the morality of doing something predisposes the person to be more honest - like saying, you know we use the honor system here or asking them if they can list the Ten Commandments even if they make mistakes in doing so. Also, context can affect cheating. People are less likely to steal cash than when someting which is removed from actual cash, like pencils at work, getting stock options at work when acting unethically, etc.<br /><br />Overall, the book amplifies how human psychology must be considered in economics and how we are conditioned to make economic choices sometimes irrationally and in doing so is worthwhile in making a person think a little deeper about some things which have economic consequences.7.

B0002858YS|5.0|This is, without a doubt, one of the classic modern rock albums of the 2000's. The Killers somehow were able to successfully mesh stadium-rock grandiosity with sweet synth pads, biting guitar riffs, and fast-paced and catchy rock melodies to create one hell of a record. Sure, \\"Mr. Brightside\\" and \\"Somebody Told Me\\" are the songs that everybody knows, but there's a lot more to this album than that. \\"Believe Me Natalie\\" exemplifies the group's ability to use synth pads to exude pure musical emotion, while \\"All These Things That I've Done\\" has quickly become a hipster anthem. \\"On Top\\" is another standout. The Killers continue to put out great music, but this first album is still far and away their best release.

B002SJIO4A|5.0|So many science fiction stories are about aliens attacking, subjugating, or exploiting humans.  In District 9, the shoe is on the other foot.<br /><br />One day, a gigantic space ship comes to a stop over Johannesburg, South Africa.  After a few months with no other movement and no communication, the ship is opened, only to discover over a million aliens living in squalor.  These aliens (eventually called, derogatorily, &#34;prawns&#34;), cannot explain how they came to be there, or how to operate the ship.  They are settled in Johannesburg and, after 20 years, the settlement is a massive slum.  The movie begins with the initiation of a massive resettlement process to move the aliens to a new &#34;settlement&#34; (a guarded camp away from Johannesburg and its people).<br /><br />To abide by international laws affecting refugees, a mid-level bureaucrat (Wikus) is assigned the task of getting the aliens to sign a release authorizing their relocation.  The interaction between Wikus and the aliens is comical and horrific at the same time.  But when Wikus is accidently sprayed with a strange &#34;fluid,&#34; his life, and his relationship with the aliens, changes radically.<br /><br />The cinematography in District 9 starts off in a herky-jerky fashion, and the viewer gets pulled into an intense story just as the cinematography, and the plot, gets more complicated and coordinated.  At the end, I suspect 99% of all viewers yelled or thought, &#34;What happens NEXT!&#34;  We will never know, but it's a great topic to bring up with friends in a cafe.<br /><br />I've seen this movie twice, and I wish I would have watched it on the big screen.  I really see it as becoming a classic sci-fi flick, pushing the boundaries of what is typical - humans being noble and aliens being ethically challenged usurpers.<br /><br />Not this time.<br /><br />Unique weapons, a novel language, the matter-of-fact way of killing alien babies, Nigerian scammers, the power of money, the power of love, the status and treatment of refugees, ... these are all introduced in this film.<br /><br />Highly recommended.ntroduced in this film.

0596522347|5.0|This book gave me a whole new perspective in building presentation slides.  It's for people who already have the basic skill of building a mediocre presentation to advance to the next level, to make their presentation slides stand out from others.  That's why some readers may not find it suitable as most business environments settle on mediocre presentations.    I emphasized on the word \\"slide\\" because this book as its title suggests, puts more focus on building slides, the how-to part, which in my point of view, is a skill that you should learn only if you already figured out the objective and what-to-say of your presentations.  For more basic but essential skill of presentation planning, I suggest \\"The Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs\\" by author Carmine Gallo.     I enjoyed reading behind-the-scene stories about some well known presentation making processes such as Al Gore's.  And this book made me much more interested in graphic design.  Duarte, the company behind this book, seems like an exciting place to work for!    It took me time to go thru the whole book because:  1. I wanted to take time to digest and try out each point at my work presentations  2. This book's rather odd shape and heavy weight makes it difficult to be carried around
B002QW7ALW|4.0|One hundred percent Michael Moore, no doubt what-so-ever. Emotional to the utmost. Founded on undeniable facts and truths, note the plural of these truths. He oscillates between the good old Christian truth, the good old socialist truth, the good old founding fathers' truth, and even the good old Framers' truth, without forgetting even the truth of F.D. Roosevelt. Only one is missing, Abraham Lincoln. The point is that the Founding Fathers and the Framers were building a constitution  that excluded the majority of the population  of the first United States and were to exclude that majority for quite a while (Blacks, women, Indians, non-propertied and non-taxable residents). The Constitution is of course something that can be perfected but the meaning of the quotations from and by them Framers and Founding Fathers has to be taken in their context if we want to capture their truths. And that's the main problem with Michael Moore: he builds a patchwork of quotations, references and facts that has an emotional meaning and impact but that does not stand any serious reflection. Instead of building an argumentation that would be homogeneous in time and place, absolutely impregnable in logic, he overkills his single targeted bird with a dozen of stones and a few bullets, and even here and there a rocket. That overkilling alas neutralizes the argument and sterilizes the demonstration because of the anachronistic nature of many of the arguments and the non articulated nature of the accumulative train of his thought, or rather thinking. Of course capitalism is greed, and it is all the horrors that lead to the worst crimes and wars. But the market economy is not capitalism. The market economy is here to stay because the economy, that exists since the beginning because the homo sapiens is an economic species, can only bring us the future and more means and more justice, but capitalism is only one way of managing that market economy and it is the worst way possible nowadays. And alas the film leads us to some vague democratic ideal in the workplace. What is it? A cooperative form of management? Or a more important and decisive role for the unions and the workers' representatives? Or plain state socialism? The film is in fact exploded in all these directions and brings no clear perspective, not even a direction that could have several slightly different lanes or roads. And we cannot forget that his antics in Wall Street are only possible because everyone in Wall Street accepts him to do it, including the bankers, the traders, the financiers and the police. That sounds and looks very well negotiated and produced. An interesting message but too emotional to lead very far on the highway to the future.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGIDalas the film leads us to some vague democratic ideal in the workplace.

0071636080|5.0|I think you should read this book if you're interested in making great presentations.  This author does an excellent job in writing out the so-called \\"secrets\\" in a very easy-to-digest way which is not easy to do.  So I applaud him for that.  This book is great in training your mind to pinpointing what is really important about your presentations, thus helping to cut out all the unnecessary things.    I recommend reading \\"slide:ology\\" by author Nancy Duarte as a set with this book to get both planning and design perspectives of presentation making.  Read this one to get a great start in learning how to plan and make presentations and then learn how to add spices to your slides by reading the other one.

But Carrie has grown up, not into an adult, but into something darker, more vengeful and infinitely more powerful that will repay them blood for blood. Sissy Spacek is perfect as the deer-in-headlights performance she gives as Carrie White, creating a character that is simultaneously horrifying and pitiable.

B001UDYI9K|5.0|Thankfully Eric Woolfson found some of these forgotten gems that didn't make it to earlier albums and has made this wonderful album.  Many of these have similar styles of songs of which Woolfson had written and performed on many of the The Alan Parsons Project releases.  They could easily fit onto past or future APP albums.  Beautifully written songs, Woolfsons voice sounds as good as ever before.  It's fun to imagine what they would have sounded like on an APP album as many might have been sung by other artists and with Alan Parsons lending his talents as a music mixer.  None the less, this is a worthy album on it's own merits. Thank you again Mr. Woolfson, you have just made a loyal fan very happy indeed!<br />I urge others to give this album a listen and not be put off by a few negative reviews out there from others that think they are experts.  We all know they are trying to write some clever criticism to puff themselves up, bringing down an album just to be mean, it's just so uncalled for.

0451530977|4.0|Treasure Island, a novel filled to the brim with tales of adventure, betrayal and, most important of all, treasure. The great author Robert Louis Stevenson organized the tales contained in Treasure Island so greatly that putting the book down for even a moment is a shame. Stevenson is a famous author for many reasons, possessing many skills that are necessary to write truly beautiful tales. One of these skills that Stevenson has mastered is the ability to give each and every one of his characters a distinct personality, as distinct as any real person. Throughout his adventurous novel Treasure Island Stevenson impresses his audience with the way he develops each of his characters, as he does, Jim Hawkins, Dr.Livesey, and Long John Silver.   We are introduced at the very beginning to our narrator, Jim Hawkins himself. By orders of Squire Trelawney and Dr. Livesey Hawkins writes down all of his adventures, leaving out only the position of Treasure Island for there is still treasure supposedly buried there.   Hawkins is a young boy of about twelve or thirteen living in his family's Inn, the Admiral Benbow, he is (as most young boys are) very relaxed and not very aware of the potential dangers about him.  An old pirate Billy Bones wanders into the Inn, throws down some money for a room and makes himself right at home. After many months of terrorizing and staying long past where his money paid for Bones falls ill, at almost the same time as Bone's illness Hawkins father passes as he has been very ill as well. Once Bone's has become well a man presents him with a black spot, or a pirates symbol of guilt or judgment which causing him to have a stroke and die as well.   After seeing Bone's die Hawkins seems to mature a bit, suddenly realizing the dangers that could now harm him and his mother.  Acting quickly Hawkins and his mother unlock Bone's chest, and escape the Inn as it is being attacked with a logbook and map in hand.   Hawkins and his mother meet up with Dr. Liveseyand Squire Trelawney in hopes that they can help with their new found map. They  are told that this map is to a huge treasure, assumed to only be a legend. This being where we first meet Dr. Livesey, an extremely responsible and safe man, never doing anything without thinking twice and making sure of that's its outcome is the best it could possibly be. Stevenson, (our author) makes Dr. Livesey personality easy to predict, only in a good way of course. He can be relied on in the heat of the moment to come up with a last minute ingenious plan to save the day.   Squire Trelawney quickly rounds up a crew and ship to start an expedition, with a top-class crew they all set off, Dr. Livesey, Trelawney, and Hawkins. Each of them quick to notice that their crew is nowhere near what they expected. Hawkins is stuck with the ships chef, Long John Silver in hopes that this will keep him out of trouble. Sometime into the voyage Hawkins overhears Silver discussing a Mutiny with the other crew members and immediately reports this to the captain and all the trustworthy men. They reach land and the captain gives all the crew some `leisure time' on shore in hopes to get ride of them.  Hawkins follows and after witnessing Silver murder a man of the crew he flees from the pirates coming across a slightly crazy man named Ben along the way, who in the end is a great help.  This epic tale goes on into many more betrayals and discovery's to end in a traditional happy ending.   From the beginning of the book to the end Jim Hawkins develops from a child to a man, and a strong man at that. He learns to defend what he thinks is right and how to choose the right side in the end. After finishing off his adventures as a one-time sailor he goes back to the Inn with his proud mother, fixing it up of course. Going from a young boy who never knew any better to a man who could do it all again a million times if he had too. His personality never once wavers from what he truly is, always in character. Then there is Long John Silver, although he may switch from side to side throughout the book it is always what you expect him to do. It was in Silver's persona to do whatever it took to get his treasure and not to care what that meant he had to sacrifice.    When it comes to making a character with true substance, making it seem like they could step right out of a book, a living breathing person. Only great writer's can make such amazing things come to life,  a gift that Stevenson did definitely possess, among many others I'm sure.

0451228731|4.0|A great story full of accurate cyber info, although there are a few minor inaccuracies!    I would not choose a Haas mini mill as a general parts creator, its a bit underpowered (wimpy) & only 3D.  An Okuma 5 or 6 axis machining center, or even better, a 3D printer with laser sintering  can create arbitrary metal & plastic parts today. I like Haas CNC machines, but a mini mill for this story, no...  Also its very unlikely that a portable plasma cutter could cut though 6 inches of steel;  An old school oxy-acetylene cutting torch would do so however (I've used both)    Daniel is right on the money with his computer tech  and tells a great story. It's a bit scary how accurate he is!    I wonder if game algorithms really can compete in the real world  but I don't want to find out. The swarm/cloud/zombie approach to distributed  denial of service is here today, so cooperating multi-processing  is getting there; just needs a few demented geniuses I guess.    Enjoy & shiver with this one. A great story. I haven't read \\"Freedom\\" yet  but I'm really looking forward to the follow on.

B001QOGY9K|4.0|Though I've skipped most of Disney's animated features post-POCAHONTAS, I'm always glad to see traditional animation stay alive, and given the pedigree of the filmmakers involved in this one - and the fact that Disney dropped traditional animation for several years - I felt I needed to get out and see this in the theater, just hoping that it would deserve my support.  It did - and it deserves yours too, I think.<br /><br />THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG is probably my favorite since BEAUTY AND THE BEAST - though I have to mention that the period since then hasn't been my favorite in the Disney canon - call me a traditionalist who thinks that PINOCCHIO still reigns supreme.  And THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG I don't think achieves any real greatness - but it also doesn't have many of the problems that to me make many of the studio's more recent efforts just \\"kidstuff\\".  This is an attempt I think to really get back to the \\"all ages\\" approach and reel in some adults, and for me it worked.  None of the songs (mostly by Randy Newman, who also wrote the instrumental music) were outright bad, smarmily cutesy or overly mushy - though I have to say none were extremely memorable either.  They don't go overboard with celebrity casting (John Goodman and Oprah Winfrey do secondary roles) and the voicework overall is excellent.  The animation is never slipshod, never looks like shortcuts were taken, and the storyline makes sense more or less and moves along well.  Much of the credit belongs, I think, to directors Ron Clement and John Musker - responsible for THE LITTLE MERMAID and ALADDIN among others - two filmmakers who really do know how to tell a story and not waste a huge amount of time on too many side bits.<br /><br />The main problem that the film has is that it isn't really all that compelling. The villain, a voodoo practitioner called \\"The Shadow Man\\" is just never very scary or exciting - he's more humorous and sly than actually nasty.  The film never goes into the scary and intense areas that THE LITTLE MERMAID or BEAUTY AND THE BEAST went to - which made the heroine's eventual triumph much more exciting.  And the main character, Tiana, who dreams of opening her own restaurant only to become a frog and have to struggle to reclaim her humanity along with the snotty frog-prince whose kiss turned her amphibian, is obviously destined for love - yet again, Disney gives us a girl whose heart's desire is always, deep down, love rather than career.

And the main character, Tiana, who dreams of opening her own restaurant only to become a frog and have to struggle to reclaim her humanity along with the snotty frog-prince whose kiss turned her amphibian, is obviously destined for love - yet again, Disney gives us a girl whose heart's desire is always, deep down, love rather than career.

031606792X|5.0|To be honest...I didn't even know there was such a strong opposition to Breaking Dawn until the movies stared coming out because I thought it was a great finale.  Can no one suspend their disbelief anymore?  Is our society so ruled by the thirst for reality TV that no one can just read a book or watch a movie anymore?  Why do you all read books or watch movies?  So that the story will perfectly emulate the real world?  Does anyone else find this absolutely ridiculous?  The story is about VAMPIRES!!!  and WEREWOLVES!!!!  So all of you believe it's perfectly acceptable for a vampire love story, but won't accept that a child could come out of the union?  Give me a break...it is a BOOK...shall I repeat that...IT...IS...A...BOOK!!!!  Often also referred to as a STORY.  No one had a problem with the Quileute's legends about spirit warriors and wolves spontaneously turning into men (excuse me...the SPIRIT of a man INSIDE of a wolf BECOMING a man), but people have a problem with vampire/human babies and imprinting? (even though, if I recall, Meyer has already EXPLAINED that there is nothing ROMANTIC about his attachment to Renesseme...I believe that was at the same time she was explaining Quil's attachment to Emily's niece?  Did we all forget about that part?)  How do you know it's not possible...have you ever MET a vampire?  Let me guess...that would be a NOOOOOOO!!!  If you wanted a story that would follow regular social norms then WHY ARE YOU READING VAMPIRE BOOKS?!?!?  Stephanie Meyer has done a fabulous job explaining how everything works in explicit detail.  That is the great part about her writing...she EXPLAINS how the UNEXPLAINABLE is POSSIBLE.  Did you all really expect a normal ending to the series?  Can I please reiterate...it is a story about VAMPIRES!!!  As far as we all know vampires aren't REAL...so why can't she make up any ending she wants as long as she flushes out how it got to that point...which she DID if any of you took the time to PAY ATTENTION instead of closing up your minds to the fantasy.  SUSPEND YOUR DISBELIEF...look it up...I'd be happy to explain it to anyone that is having trouble grasping the concept.  I would tell all of you to grow up, but, unfortunately, I think that's the problem...people are too grown up for their own good...what is it we all had as kids?  Something that enabled us to believe in stories, legends, and make believe?  Oh yeah...an IMAGINATION...that's what it's called...

B000059XUO|5.0|The Crow is one of my favorite goth movies ever.  It is a small classic in it's own way.  It is a fantasy, an action film, and a romance all rolled into one dark and disturbing, scary, sad, inspiring, and sometimes downright chilling saga. Based on the graphic novel by James O'Barr, the movie has unfortunately been romanticized into a somewhat different story.  Way to go Hollywood.  But  the story works.  Brandon Lee is a good choice for the part of the main character, Eric Draven.  He is a young and good-looking rock musician.  His girlfriend, Shelley Webster, is petitioning for tenant's rights in her building in the worst part of downtown Detroit.  The story in told interesting enough through Eric's flashbacks and cop scenarios throughout the film.  The little girl Sarah tells us at the beginning of the film that a crow can carry back the soul of the dead once a terrible sadness will not let it die.  And what happens to this couple is evil.  Thugs barge in and shoot Eric until he falls out a five story window.  Then they gang rape the poor girl until she dies later of agony in the hospital.  It all happens on Devil's Night, the nickname in the area for the night before Hallowe'en, when they were to be married.  Devil's Night is so named because the entire town goes up in flames as to the wishes of Big Dollar, the head of the underworld Syndicate.  Exactly one year after the tragic event, Eric bursts out of the grave and, led by the huge raven, finds his way back to the deserted apartment where the murders happen.  Everything he touches reminds of the event in a crazy flashback.  He paints his face to look like the clown he feels he is.  Fueled by a pulsing goth rock soundtrack by banad like The Cure and Nine Inch Nails, he sets out to destroy the thugs.  In the meantime he ends up destroying the entire Syndicate.  The violence is too sadistic and the atrocities are too real.  But the villians are so sleazy and despicable that it somehow seems necessary. Eric also saves Sarah off the streets and gets her mother away from the gang.  With the help of a kindly black cop he finds out everything he needs for all this action.  But Big Dollar's girlfriend Myca disables the Crow so Eric is no longer quite as unstoppable as he was when it's guidance gave him the ability to conquer death.  The final sequence in the church is a thrilling shootout to save Sarah's life after Eric tries to return to the grave to be with Shelley, his obsession.  Eric wins the fight against Big Dollar by placing his hands on his head and giving him all Shelley's pain.  He falls off the roof and is impaled on the gargoyles.  Eric then, exhausted of energy, returns to the graveyard, where Shelley comes like an angel to kiss him back home.  And home they go.  The cop, on suspension, gets to say \\"I told you so!\\" to his snarling boss as he is wheeled out on a stretcher.  No one believed his story.  It's quite a yarn, true.  But it works.  The revenge fantasy is very inspiring, even though the violence and the flashbacks are hard to take.  The movie does not stay true to James O'Barr's version, but it is exciting in a different way.  It opened the door for the genre of graphic novel movies to come.  And if you are brave, you should see it, even if it too dark and dangerous.  Because it is worth seeing. It;s exciting.saves Sarah off the streets and gets her mother away from the gang.  With the help of a kindly black cop he finds out everything he needs for all this action.

B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan has a marvelous voice. It's so refreshing to hear people like her again, as most of the so-called singers today can't carry a tune at all or are raspy as an old file to hear. It would be nice if she put out several albums with separate types of music on them, perhaps one or two that are all religious, a Christmas album or two and others with popular tunes. She has a great gift that has been hidden away much too long. I am so glad she finally got her chance to shine.

0385335997|4.0|Well, I am back to rekindle my love for Jamie Alexander Fraser. The second book left me in such an emotional turmoil, I just had to know how the drama ends. I cheated and flipped through pages of \\"Voyager\\" to get closure some weeks ago but now it is finally time to read and enjoy the book in full...<br /><br />Once again, Gabaldon doesn't disappoint. She has a talent for characterization and is a stellar storyteller, there is no doubt about it. Once again, she takes us on a fabulous adventure through times and countries. The first third of the book follows the stories of Claire and Jamie as they live separately for 20 years in their own worlds. I thought I would dislike this segment, but in fact it is by far my favorite part of the book. There is a lot of sadness, tragedy, loneliness and longing on these pages, as Jamie and Claire mourn each other's loss.<br /><br />When our couple get together, Gabaldon takes us on an emotional roller-coaster ride as Jamie and Claire try to re-discover each other and come to terms with their dark secrets of the past and their time apart, they are also forced to undertake a lot of traveling when all they want is to be together. Not to give anything away, but prepare yourself for an intense adventure through brothels, slave markets, sea voyage, Jamaican forests, etc.<br /><br />\\"Voyager\\" is a great book, but again, I can't give it 5 stars. First, the shift in POVs. It bothered me some in \\"Dragonfly in Amber,\\" but there is more of it in \\"Voyager.\\" For the most part, the book is written in 1st person from Claire's POV, but some parts are written in 3rd person from the POVs of Jaime, Roger, Clare, and even Lord John Grey, even though he is a very-very secondary character. I am not going to say that the story itself suffers from it, but it creates a bit of a sloppy narration IMO.<br /><br />The other thing I didn't care for is the presence of mysticism. Granted, the time-travel itself isn't really something real, but the ending of the book just has way too much of \\"unrealness,\\" too much of unexplained paranormal, in fact so much that I found it a little hard to swallow.<br /><br />Were Gabaldon not such an engaging writer, I probably wouldn't have forgiven these flaws. But she is one, and in spite of the flaws, \\"Voyager\\" is an irresistible combination of adventure, history, tragedy, violence, love, humour, and (last but not leas) smut. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and will undoubtedly read next installment - \\"Drums of Autumn.\\"ok just has way too much of \\"unrealness,\\" too much of unexplained paranormal, in fact so much that I found it a little hard to swallow.<br /><br />Were Gabaldon not such an engaging writer, I probably wouldn't have forgiven these flaws.

1594565201|3.0|\\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\\" is the first published book of Agatha Christie's and the first book where she introduces her well-known private detective Hercule Poirot.<br /><br />The fact that the book is Christie's first effort is apparent. It definitely lacks the finesse of her later works. The main thing that drags down this otherwise standard Christie story is the trial proceedings. It would have been wiser to edit out that part of the book altogether as it added very little to the investigation.<br /><br />However, the signature marks of Christie's books (that I personally enjoy so much) - the murder in a rich upper-class English home, family secrets, minute clues and a murderer you can never guess - are already present. Plus, the narrator of the book - Hastings - is a lovely storyteller - very straight-forward, albeit not too smart, funny, and always in search for the next girl to fall in love with. Reminded me of P.G. Wodehouse's Berty Wooster, actually.<br /><br />A nice book, not Christie's best, but enjoyable enough.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I am a period film fanatic...seriously.  I have watched upwards to 100 some different period dramas and North and South is, by far, the best one I have ever seen.  Was it perfect?  Was all the acting dead on?  No, but I don't expect that out of any movie.  This movie holds so much more to it then just the normal period pieces where the girls sit around stitching all day and the guys have nothing better to do than go visiting and quail hunting.  This movie touches on poverty, the industrial revolution, class struggle, unions, working conditions, suicide, politics, religion, and it has a killer love story to boot!<br /><br />John Thornton is a character worth admiring.  I wish I had read the book North and South so much earlier in life because then I wouldn't have wasted so many years holding a literary crush on Darcy when there was a man like Thornton waiting in literature.  Thornton has all the same character as Darcy, but Thornton has the added layer of a hard life that adds to him that silver-spoon-in-the-mouth Darcy could never have.  Richard Armitage did an excellent job with the role.  Many of the other actors did an excellent job with their roles as well.<br /><br />The movie is beautifully shot, even if the subject mater isn't always beautiful.  I could listen to the musical score all day and the costums are believable.<br /><br />Go and read this book...and watch this movie...you will want to watch it again and again and again...
037571457X|3.0|\\"Persepolis\\" is a widely acclaimed memoir/graphic novel, it was rated highly by several of my fellow readers and therefore I've had my eye on it for a while. Sadly, now, after reading this book, I am a little underwhelmed by it.<br /><br />As a graphic novel, it is a notable work. The cartoonish style of the drawing is superb, the subject matter is very current, the combination of tragedy and humor is clever.<br /><br />However, as a political memoir, \\"Persepolis\\" lacks. I don't know exactly why, but I never got a grip on what Satrapi's personal views on the politics within her country are. In fact, I am not even sure if she really knows what what was happening in her country. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that this memoir ends when the author is 14 (although writing it as an adult, she should be able to present her views clearly). Or maybe it is because Satrapi herself never personally experiences any hardship in this book. I find it very interesting that in times of turmoil, during the civil war for democracy, during the rise of religious fundamentalism, during the war with Iraq, Satrapi's family never seems to experience any discomfort. Quite the opposite, when people die and suffer, the writer's most hardship is to hide the liquor at a party (which they are not supposed to have), or to wear a headscarf, or to get an \\"Iron Maiden\\" poster through customs. This narration from a perspective of a person in power is a little disheartening and has a bit of a fake tone to it, as if the author doesn't know what is really happening in her country and writes about from her million dollar mansion while being served by one of her maids.<br /><br />It's not a bad book, especially for younger readers who want to know a little bit about Iran and its current political events. It is presented in a very appealing, easy format. But for me personally this book appears to be too superficial to leave any kind of lasting impression. I will however read the second part of the memoir. Maybe it will have some more insight.he memoir. Maybe it will have some more insight.

B002RVZV9K|4.0|Three men. Three musicians. Three icons. Two really good guitarists. And so you have the meat of \\"It Might Get Loud\\", the much anticipated \\"movie\\" starring Jimmy Page, The Edge and Jack White.<br /><br />\\"It Might Get Loud\\" tells the personal stories, in their own words, of three generations of electric guitar \\"virtuosos\\" The Edge (U2), Jimmy Page (Led Zeppelin), and Jack White (The White Stripes). However, the subtitle could easily be \\"which one of these is not like the other\\" as despite the film's attempt to give the viewer an inside look into the minds and hearts of unequivocal rock legends, the pace and feel of the film is overshadowed by what can only be described as a hiccup in casting.<br /><br />Where it does succeed is in revealing how each musician developed his own unique sound and style of playing favorite instruments. The premise revolves around a day when Jimmy Page, Jack White, and The Edge first meet and sit down together to share their stories, teach each other famous riffs and play. From there the viewer sees breakaway scenes of each telling their personal story, air guitaring and remembering how they developed their craft.<br /><br />Fans of Page and the Edge will not be disappointed as the film shows both in their elements - one surrounded by shelves of guitars, the other in a former school room and giving the viewer a very intimate and surprising, \\"hey these guys are just doing what they love\\" kind of feel to two of rock music's most recognizable and copied forces. Thankfully Page comes across as human and The Edge is depicted as having a soft side rarely seen on stage or video.<br /><br />The aforementioned hiccup is Jack White. Admittedly, he is stretching musical boundaries but in terms of being a major contribution if he is to be this generation's greatest guitarist, someone needs to go back and recount the votes. White peaked with The Raconteurs, and while admittedly his work is experimental and w.o.p. (weird on purpose), it feels remarkably out of synch within the context of \\"It Might Get Loud\\". Out of the three guitarists White is the least original following in the footsteps of The Flat Duo Jets, The Ramones and nearly every underground Bluesman you've never heard of. Chances are within the next year he'll do a bad cover of Stairway and wear a knit cap.<br /><br />Thankfully, \\"It Might Get Loud\\" rises above White's mediocrity and gives some real insight into some of rock's greatest legends; even if there are only two in this story.<br /><br />4 stars<br />Kim Thore-<br />Uber Rock UKxt of \\"It Might Get Loud\\".

B002SB2AAM|3.0|I'm glad I got the CD version instead of the hard copy.  It's easier to glide along such a book when you're listening and I admit I would not have read this book.  This audiobook was a gift from my mother who thinks I need more fiction in my life.  Plus we all loved Tom Hanks in the Da Vinci Code.<br /><br />The audiobook is a 14-CD and 17.5-hour long experience.  There were times when I was very attentive and times when I was not.  The reader, Paul Michael, did a great job.  He was able to deliver the voices of different characters authentically.  One technique used in the book was the use of characters' thoughts, not just dialogue.  Paul Michael handled this superbly so that whenever he was reading a character's thoughts, his tone made me sure of it and thus I was not confused in thinking it was dialogue.<br /><br />Since I reside in DC where almost the entire plot takes place, the story was extra-interesting to me.  In the entire U.S., there is no city like DC when it comes to great architecture of churches, Masonic Temples and monuments.  Of course, this is not an accident.  Every denomination has placed grand churches and temples here in an effort to project influence.  Also, monuments would serve the country better if they were spread out across the land instead of clustered around elected officials.  The author, Dan Brown, did not take this viewpoint in The Lost Symbol.  Instead, he treated this entire splendor as intrinsically meaningful based on symbols depicted and gave it a patriotic message.  The Lost Symbol celebrates the political nature of architecture as opposed to a utilitarian approach.<br /><br />Brown did an incredible amount of research in developing The Lost Symbol.  He provided an education in symbolism actually.  He deserves credit for this.  Even though the plot and the characters held disappointments, I found the educational aspect was redeeming.<br /><br />The villain was not at all believable to me.  I don't want to ruin the plot so I am limiting what I say about this.  But the superhuman aspects of the villain character and his motivations were not believable from the start.  Further, the technique of telling us the villain's thoughts felt cheap in that they were not the thoughts we'd want to know and they were conveniently selective so that the story's mysteries would be suspended until the end.<br /><br />Another gap in the storytelling had to do with the CIA, which played a major role.  If you know anything about the CIA, you could not believe they'd conduct themselves as they did in The Lost Symbol.  I felt this area was not well researched to say the least.<br /><br />In summary, The Lost Symbol had strong points and a few glaring weak points.  I think one should consider the audiobook version over the book version.  Yet the educational value redeemed the weak points for the most part.  This work was heavily researched but the plot and some of the main characters were flawed.  I learned a lot about the history of symbols and do not regret listening to this book.limiting what I say about this.

B002T9H2LA|3.0|It was an OK movie, but if you are expecting it to be \\"all Basterds, all the time,\\" then you're going to be disappointed. The movie seemed to move a bit too slow for me, as well.  The previews hyped it as an intense, non-stop action type movie ... and that isn't what it was.  There was some action, but the way the storyline was developed was kinda similar to beating a dead horse:  We get it, already, now get to the action!

Aside from an almost unnoticeable step up in detail... There really wasn't any difference. Although I have read, \\"Not to expect a 25-year-old film to look as good as one that was released last summer\\".

0765316889|3.0|First of all, this book read really slow. Second, there are a lot of inconsistencies and sloppiness within the book as well. (Spoiler: A major fight scene where Vin burns duralumin, and then proceeds to burn another metal--tin, I think--without downing another vial) To be honest, I felt kind of cheated at the end too. It seemed like the whole book led up to a revelation, like a mystery novel, but unlike one, the revelation wasn't satisfying at all--in fact it wasn't much of a revelation at all. So rather than this being an exciting adventure like the first, it was just a long drag out leading to more unanswered questions.    All that said, the world Sanderson has created is spectacular, and I did like the book overall. I'd probably give it 3.5 stars but that isn't an option. I just feel like Sanderson had gold (atium?) in his hands with this book, but he kind of just sloppily put it together.    If you've already read the first, I'm not sure how you could stop reading the second--and the series will ultimately be decided by the third--crossing my fingers it ends the tale well.
0670021652|2.0|How does someone who writes a book like, \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" follow it up with something so bad??!!    I read \\"E,P,L\\" around two years back and absolutely LOVED it. I loved it so much, i wish i had written it. I identified with the voice so much, i felt like I HAD written it. It became one of my most treasured books and I couldn't recommend it to people enough. Since i live in Dubai, I'd missed the hype around the book and was therefore lucky enough to have stumbled on it, and luckier to have not had any expectations from it. Two days back, I happened to stumble on \\"Committed\\" in a book store here, and was SO excited to read, what I understood, was the sequel to her relationship with Felipe from her previous book.     Committed is a non-fiction book, but unlike EPL, is a non-fiction piece that reads like an essay. A long, boring essay. If you want to read every single quote or every single fact or every single ANYTHING written on marriage, buy this book. I have skimmed through its pages only to find a personal narrative of the authors on every tenth page.. that too if you're lucky. Another reviewer wrote that there is nothing that really connects you to Ms Gilbert, and I really can't agree more.     You kinda know the beginning from reading the back cover, you know the ending from reading the first Chapter, and you really don't need to know anything in the middle. This has got to be one of the most boring books i've ever read! I'm so proud of myself for bothering to finish it.

B001UV4XUG|4.0|\\"(500) Days of Summer\\" is not the first movie to tell a love story using an unorthodox chronology - with \\"Two For the Road,\\" \\"Betrayal\\" and \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" having done brilliant trailblazing work in this area long ago.  Yet, while \\"Summer\\" is not quite in the same league with those three earlier masterpieces, it`s certainly miles above the formulaic nonsense that too often passes for romantic comedy these days.<br /><br />Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who in \\"Mysterious Skin\\" delivered one of the truly searing dramatic performances of recent times, here displays a similar adeptness at light comedy playing Tom Hansen, a greeting-card writer who falls head-over-heels in love with Summer Finn (the adorable Zooey Deschanel), a newly-hired assistant in the office.<br /><br />While Tom is dead-set on having a meaningful, permanent relationship, Summer feels no compulsion to throw herself into any kind of long-term commitment, determined to savor the freedom that comes with being attractive and unattached in a buzzing metropolis like Los Angeles.<br /><br />Rather than following a strictly linear chronology, the screenplay by Scott Neustadter and Mark H. Weber freely jumps around in time, a technique that allows us to observe the various stages of the couple's courtship simultaneously.  But fear not, for the writers are careful to identify, through numbered title cards, which of the 500 days any particular scene is taking place on so the audience doesn`t become disoriented.  This \\"dramatic irony\\" approach of letting us in on where the relationship will eventually wind up - beyond what even the characters themselves know at the time - adds an additional layer of poignancy to the romance.<br /><br />Astutely directed by Marc Webb, \\"(500) Days of Summer\\" is marked by smart writing, perceptive storytelling, charming performances, occasional flights of fancy and a rich attention to detail.  And there's a scene on a park bench near the end of the movie that is absolutely heartbreaking.<br /><br />A quick FYI:  for a far more somber version of pretty much the same story, check out the equally fine \\"The Hottest State\\" by Ethan Hawke.  Together, these two films would make for an interesting double-bill.A quick FYI:  for a far more somber version of pretty much the same story, check out the equally fine \\"The Hottest State\\" by Ethan Hawke.

B002RSDW80|2.0|**1/2<br /><br />For anyone who came of age in the second half of the 20th Century, Julia Child was the \\"chef de cuisine professionnel\\" of home cooking.  Every week, millions of housewives and wannabe culinary artists would tune into her TV show or pore over her many cookbooks in an attempt to reproduce the master's recipes.  With her distinctive high-pitched shrill, her folksy sayings and trademark pearls, Child brought gourmet French cooking to the masses and turned herself into an instantly recognizable cultural icon in the process.<br /><br />\\"Julie & Julia\\" is not a \\"biography\\" in the traditional sense of that term, but rather a melding of dual stories culled from two separate sources - \\"My Life in France\\" by Child and Alex Prud`homme and \\"Julie and Julia:  My Year of Cooking Dangerously\\" by Julie Powell.  The latter is a writer who, in 2002, decided to work her way through every one of the 524 recipes in Child's \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" while posting her results on a daily blog.  The site soon became a sensation among internet readers who shared Powell's passion for all things cooking and Child.<br /><br />In blending the two books into a single work, Nora Ephron has created a tasty, if somewhat lopsided, confection.  One of the inherent weaknesses in the approach is that Meryl Streep so dominates the screen with her interpretation of Child that her side of the story all but steamrolls over the more contemporary side, where Amy Adams is stuck trying to add spice to the far more bland and flavorless Powell.  Time and again, just as we're becoming intrigued by Child's evolution from restless housewife - living with her ambassador husband (Stanley Tucci) in Paris - to student at LeCordon Bleu to published author, we're suddenly thrust back into the infinitely less compelling world of our modern-day blogger, who often comes across as needy, self-indulgent, creepily obsessive and whiny.  Frankly, I'm amazed all her friends didn't take her off speed-dial for the duration.  In addition, the husbands in the film (Tucci and Chris Messina) are completely lacking in charisma and personality.<br /><br />Still, Streep - despite an ever-so-slight tendency towards coyness and cutesiness - is a genuine hoot and, like a good yeast, makes even the flatter parts of her story rise to the occasion.  Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for Adams.  In the case of \\"Julie & Julia,\\" the wrong J gets top billing.In addition, the husbands in the film (Tucci and Chris Messina) are completely lacking in charisma and personality.

0451191153|3.0|The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand was a worthwhile, if lengthy, endeavor.<br />Being too lazy to actually attack this by *reading* it, I picked up the audio version. I have listened to Ayn Rand's \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" at least a half dozen times over the past couple of decades. If you know me you'll know that I don't give up the time to do this lightly. \\"The Fountainhead\\" I found to be somewhat more preachy (yeah, yeah I know. Is that even possible?). Ayn's never really been known for multifaceted and realistic characters, instead they all rather assume aspects of her ideology and remain focused in that manner throughout the book.<br />About halfway through \\"The Fountainhead\\" I had considered not bothering to finish it (it *is* just under 31 hours long after all) because the characters really are not at all accessible to me. The motivations the characters espouse for their apparently sociopathic behavior toward each other (protagonists and antagonists alike - although which are which is sometimes not really obvious) are absurd to a rational human. They make sense only in Ms. Rand's relatively black and white conception of the world and the values that one needs to hold to be true to themselves within it.<br />But I persevered and was gratified by the way the story wound up finally.<br />I would say that it's worth experiencing this book at least once just to get a sense of Ayn Rand's philosophies. But I am unlikely to listen to the book again.<br />For someone interested in a more entertaining and mildly grayer (IMHO) view of the world I would suggest \\"Atlas Shrugged\\".
B001LRJH0U|5.0|This movie starts off with a bang (literally). The action doesn't stop and you become part of the movie. I enjoyed it a lot.
B002BWP49W|3.0|On the plus side, \\"The White Ribbon\\" is extremely well directed and acted, and the cinematography is magnificent.  But there are several negatives.  Hemingway once said that a writer could leave whatever he knew out of a story, but not what he didn't know -- for that would leave holes.  The same rule applies to directors.  I enjoy a thought-provoking mystery, but not one that is essentially insoluble.  If the director doesn't have the answer, for the very good reason that there isn't one, then it's obviously impossible for a viewer to come up with it either.  One can speculate idly and fruitlessly, but that's hardly the same thing.    Another negative is the director's contention that the sinister occurrences in the movie are a harbinger of the Nazi era.  This is pretentious and groundless; asserted, rather than proven.  Also, the director clearly believes that the way children were brought up a century ago was pathological.  Indeed?  Child-rearing has improved, has it?  Today's youth (and from all classes) are materialistic, hedonistic, and narcissistic.  Some are just plain thugs.  Many, as young or younger than the ones depicted in the film, are alcoholics and drug addicts, and are sexually active.  Oh, yes, welcome to the brave new world.    Recommended, but with significant reservations.
0385504225|3.0|Was it bad?  No.  Was it good?  No.  The story is written around interesting information about D.C. as opposed to adding interesting information into a good story.  The ending seemed as though it had nothing to do with the rest of the story.  Definately the worst of all the books he made.  I would give it 2.5 stars if I could.
0316044938|5.0|On a wintery day between Thanksgiving and Christmas 14 year old Susie Salmon (like the fish) took her usual shortcut home after school.  She never arrived because a neighbor, the one that everyone in the subdivision thought was a bit odd, but harmless, made her his latest victim.  After he raped and then murdered her Susie watched the aftermath of her death on her family and friends, saw her younger sister's adolescence made more complicated by the awkwardness of those around dealing with the tragedy, saw her parents struggle to cope with the loss of their oldest child, saw her little brother try to make sense of the sudden disappearance of his oldest sister.  For the next decade Susie saw the impact that her death had on the lives of her family and neighbors and wondered just how she would be able to fit into her own afterlife.    This is a powerful story, one that keeps the reader turning pages to find out, not who did it (which is established in the first few paragraphs), but what will happen next.  The author has told the story in a beautifully lyrical style, enabling the reader to clearly visualize each scene.  This is one of those novels that would gain even more impact by being read aloud, the better to appreciate the poetic quality of the narrative.      Undoubtedly this book will appear on many English class reading lists for years to come, right along with TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD and THE COLOR PURPLE, an honor it richly deserves.
B001OQCV60|4.0|As a public watching Sherlock Holmes mysteries for well over fifty years, we have become accustomed to a certain Basil Rathbone stereotype--an intellectual in tweeds with a deerstalker hat, \\"over six feet,\\" \\"sharp and piercing eyes\\" and \\"hawk-like nose\\"--that the character's creator, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, clearly delineates in his novels and short stories starring the legendary detective and his trusty sidekick, Dr. John Watson.  5' 9\\" Robert Downey Jr. with his expressive milk chocolate eyes and rakish bad boy looks cannot be further off type.  Yet aficionados of Conan Doyle's famous sleuth cannot fail to find the inner Sherlock lurking in director Guy Ritchie (Madonna's X-Man) and Downey Jr. brash interpretation in the film \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" and look upon this with all the intrigue of watching the popular television character Monk hypochondriac his way through solving mysteries of his own.<br /><br />Conan Doyle created not only a genius of deductive reasoning, but also a highly sophisticated human database with state-of-the-art archival and retrieval software that allows his mastermind to quickly wing his way through complicated problems with the 100% accuracy rate of a supercomputer.  As neatly architectured as the halls of Sherlock's brain may be, his private living space resembles something akin to a dwelling on an episode on A&E's `Hoarders.'  He struggles like all great minds with the ennui that comes with not enough stimulation, dresses with a bohemian flare to unconsciously promote his individualism and develops his strength and physical agility because he knows he should with the same passion and perseverance he would pursue the solution to that generation's Rubick's Cube.  Guy Ritchie's Sherlock may tilt the scale towards superhero classification, but let's face it, that's exactly what author Conan Doyle originally had in mind.  He just wasn't privy to 2010's technological advances.<br /><br />Ritchie's Watson (Jude Law sporting an attractive mustache) and his eccentric housemate, Holmes present an interesting partnership between two men whose personalities play off each other like other great literary and film foils, i.e., Sancho Panza and Don Quixote.  Unlike the austere Rathbone and his counterpart, the slightly befuddled but kindly Nigel Bruce, this Holmes and Watson team are rife with less cozy or erudite idiosyncrasies--an ex-military man, Watson is impatient with a mean right foot and a gambling habit to temper while Holmes blows off steam at a Fight Club London and seems frequently depressed in his genius that in its exception denies him similarly calibered fellowship--yet pursue their quest with the modern intellectual acuity of Dan Brown's Robert Langdon and the intrepid doggedness and single mindedness of John Rambo.<br /><br />As attractive as Rachel McAdams may be, she somehow seems like an add on meant to fill the bill for the film's requisite female presence and box office draw rather than an intrinsic and indispensable piece to the film's suspense puzzle or as a clue as to what adds vulnerability to Mr. Holmes otherwise impenetrable persona.  The donning of supposed ill-fitting men's clothes and high-heeled boots which certainly shouldn't wear so fetchingly in obvious 21st century bootilicious-ness during the climatic chase in the Parliament and bridge scene at the end of the film, epitomizes McAdams' brand of derring-do that seems forced, unnecessary and unrealistic.  Let's just say that her all-American good looks are too colorful for the grey-toned London that Ritchie expertly conjures up with a touch of Tim Burton's macabre nightmarish reality.<br /><br />Scenery-wise, Richie excels.  His London is a masterpiece of soot and chamber pots.  Rats and cobblestones aside, his vision transports the audience to the height of the industrial revolution with all its glories and pitfalls.  His scenes on the Thames are awash with rain and fog; the action on the half-built bridge sways with feelings of vertigo secondary only to a real-action roller coaster ride.<br /><br />The only concrete failing of this flick is the plotline.  Attempting to depict the age with its concentration on the occult--the villain of the piece definitely bears resemblance to the historical Aleister Crowley--screenwriters Johnson, Peckham and Kinberg try too hard to evoke a supernatural Da Vinci Code conundrum that doesn't have enough plot layers and relies a little too heavily on spectacular computer-generated images and pyrotechnics.<br /><br />Bottom line?  Guy Ritchie puts together Jude Law and Robert Downey Jr as the quintessential detective partnership in his film \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" with an eye on what goes on beneath the surface, warts and all.  With its cliffhanger ending, this one is sure to be the beginning of a franchise I am sure Ritchie hopes to perpetuate with the longevity of the older Holmesian adventures of the 30s and 40s starring Rathbone and Bruce.

0805091742|5.0|One hundred years ago, flying an airplane was slightly more difficult than mastering the many handles and levers on a Model T Ford.    Medical practice of the day was also fundamental. Without antibiotics, anesthesia or solid sanitation practices, the physician of 1910 knew that luck would play a big part in patient recovery.    In his book \\"The Checklist Manifesto:  How to Get Things Right,\\" Atul Gawande, an endocrine surgeon at Boston's  Brigham and Women's Hospital, addresses the course Aviation and Medicine took as time and complexity marched on.  In this 209 page volume, Gawande offers disasters and dramatic saves like:    The 1935 maiden flight of the Boeing B-17 that ended in a fiery crash.    A 5 year old girl who was revived after an hour at the bottom of a freezing pond.    The Jan 2009 flight of a US Airways 1549 that ended in the Hudson River.    In 1935, Boeing engineers had heard the rumors - a four-engine airplane may be too complex for human beings to fly. Elevators, fuel mix, dozens of make-or-break settings - who could remember all that every time? Their response was a checklist. Gawande notes that humble birth and visits Boeing's `Checklist Factory' to learn how, even today, checklists are developed, tested and distributed.    The little drowning victim was saved, not by dumb luck, but by a coordinated effort between the rescue squad, the hospital ER and the surgical team at a small town hospital - all guided by checklists.    While the media toasted Captain Chesley B. Sullenberger III as the lone savior of Flight 1549, Sullenberger insists it was the capable team of Sullenberger, Skiles, Dale, Dent & Welsh, guided by checklists and practice that landed the plane safely.    Gawande is no mere observer. His story reaches beyond medical disasters set in motion by a missed detail, to a checklist project funded by the World Health Organization designed to answer a simple question - can a short checklist lead to better surgical outcomes, no matter where in the world the hospital is located?    As a Lean consultant, I'm a big advocate of checklists. I'm also familiar with the resistance clients can put up (\\"We know what we're doing\\") when a checklist is suggested. Gawande's book provides much needed ammunition. I will purchase multiple copies of The Checklist Manifesto and give them to clients reluctant to write down the steps. At 209 pages, it's an afternoon read that will change perceptions, then actions, then results.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|It is so lovely to sit down to a period piece where one can simply watch human drama unfold without crassness and general degeneracy intervening and without being plagued by technology, noise and rubbish dialogue.  So, this is a real treat with the story unfolding over 4 episodes giving plenty of time for human drama and maturation to take place.  This is what the BBC do best!  What can one say but that I came away from this piece feeling that life was good and that human beings could indeed be generous, magnanimous and loving.  Bravo!!!

Also I was pleasantly surprised to see the two (Region 1) DVD's included in the set also played on my PAL region 2 PS3. In addition to this if you desperately wanted the ultimate collectors briefcase you should consider buying this Blu Ray version and the HD DVD Ultimate version and simply put this (BluRay) version of the discs in Briefcase that comes with Considerably better priced HD collectors edition as aside from the discs the other content is exactly the same.

0307454541|4.0|This book grabbed me as soon as I started to read it.  The characters were woven together tightly, yet the mystery of the final outcome was unexpected. The relationship between the research assistant and the investigative journalist was continually both cemented and torn apart by others who had separate pulls on the team as individuals.  The research assistant, Salenger, is a reluctant anti-hero who despite her best efforts to be left alone to her own devices is continually interfered with by both well and bad meaning people.  In the teams quest to find a missing girl, there are numerous twists and turns, and a cast of many suspicious characters to throw you off the trail of the real killer.  Couldn't put it down, and didn't want it to end.  I'll read the next book in the series, but have learned that the author, Larsson, died before he was able to complete the series of ten, and it has ended with three books.  That gives me pause - do I want to continue following Salenger and be left hanging?  Probably will, as you never know what she'll be up to next!
B0000844M8|4.0|I saw this when it came out in 1966 or so and got it so that I could share it with my kids.  It was an absolute delight to watch with them, starting from the playing of lion cubs in a house to the struggle to re-introduce Elsie into the wild.  Of particular interest was the notion that the conventional wisdom about animals is wrong, that a deeper entente and understanding with them is possible if humans would only try.<br /><br />Joy Adamson developed a relationship with Elsie much as a mother would treat a child.  Though a dangerous animal to most observers, including her husband's boss, she loved the lion and influenced her personality development.  She then figured out a way to release Elsie into the wild again, which no one had ever succeeded in doing.  Finally, a year later, the couple found Elsie and \\"visited\\" with her and her cubs for an entire day, until her mate called from the distance; they would return in subsequent years to get to know the cubs.  Perhaps I am reading too much into it, but it seems to me that Joy discovered other possibilities of being and communication with a wild animal, which should get us all to think beyond genetic determinism and conventional behavioral models.  This is very profound as we contemplate the management of the planet in perilous times.<br /><br />The beauty of our experience is that the kids and I could discuss these issues as well as enjoy the spectacle of an animal film that was fun and very funny yet moving.  While I suspect that much of it is fictionalized - the couple later divorced and George Adamson died by recklessly driving at poachers trying to warn him off - the acting is wonderful as is the photography.  Warmly recommended.

That is when it occurred to me that this is A Bible. A guide to the way It Is.     I plan on buying 20 copies and handing them out at Burning Man this year, that is how life-altering I think this book is. Buy it!

This is an important read for anyone in the workforce.  If you are a leader, read it and if you are not a leader, read it and sit down with your manager  to discuss it over coffee.

B002CLBJPK|3.0|Bedknobs and Broomsticks released in the U.S.in time for the Christams season of 1971 was an attempt by Disney to recapture the mega success of Mary Poppins seven years before.But B&B would miss that benchmark by a country mile,lacking its`stellar and timeless charm; mostly through the lacklustre appeal and performances of its stars.<br />The story takes place in August of 1940 in Britain,not too far into the famous Battle of Britain.Invasion by the Germans is uppermost on every Englishmans` mind and the civilian homeguard has been formed as a first line of ``defence``,with special attention to coastal areas.Towns and cities are being regularly bombed by the Luftwaffe and the Government institutes a program of evacuation for its` younger citizens.Many are shipped overseas while many others are shipped to the English countryside.This is where the movie comes in as three orphans arrive in the small coastal town of Dorset.The last to find homes,they are foisted on an unsuspecting local by the name of Miss E.Price(Angela Landsbury).<br />This seemingly reclusive individual,the youngsters soon find out,has a fascinating secret.She has been taking witchcraft by correspondance through the mail.One night as they are in the process of leaving their digs to return to London they witness a rather unsuccessful attempt by Miss Price to take her maiden flight on a broomstick.The children decide to stay thinking the best way to improve their situation is to conduct some inventive blackmail.For their silence they want the food improved and money.After some wrangling both sides come to an amicable arrangement.<br />As it turns out Miss Price is missing the spell to Substitutiary Locomotion and needs to find the professor of her course in London.The kids and her hop aboard a brass rail bed and whoosh off to their destination.There they find one Prof.Browne(David Tomlinson) who is in reality a charlatan.His ``course`` was haphazardly put together for his ``pupils`` through the use of an old magic book.While the truth comes out Miss P is still adamant that she wants the other part of the book containing her spell.Through a long search the missing book comes,so to speak,to them.They are forcefully taken to a bookseller who has the part she needs.But it only refers to the words on a medallion,the Star of Astoroth and that is on the island of Naboombu around the neck of its`king,a lion.<br />Off they go and after refereeing a rather ``physical`` game of soccer,the Prof. relieves the king of his medallion.They return back home only to find the medallion has not made the transition from one world to the other.All the time the medallions`words have been in a book one of the children had been reading.At just this time a sub arrives just off shore and German soldiers take over the town.Through Miss Price`s Substitutiary Locomotion spell she is able to bring to life various and sundry pieces of old military armour and clothing.With her help in the air they are able to send the Germans fleeing the town and from England`s shores.The movie ends with Miss Price and Prof.Browne in love and the latter heading off to war.<br />What should have been a better movie turned out just the opposite.Landsbury is totally lacking the charm,appeal and I daresay talent of a Julie Andrews.David Tomlinson as the Professor seems like he is totally uninterested in the entire proceedings and sleepwalks his way through the film and it unfortunately comes across to the audience.Disney again thought that the Sherman Brothers would again create some musical magic to help the proceedngs but most of the numbers are really sub par material.There are some nice live/animation sequences here with the island of Naboombu but by the time they get there in the film the preceding time has been so mediocre that the same interest is not there that otherwise should have been.This film is really ``forced-cutesy`` and nothing the stars and the music is able to do can hide its` transparent facade for all to see.<br />This particular edition of B&B is the 36th anniversary edition,not the original theatrical version.The original movie came in under two hours but Disney pulled every bit of extra usable footage they had and reconstructed the film into a 138 minute juggernaut.The original film was too long and this version makes it that much more interminably long.This DVD releases` saving grace is the quality of the restoration.They have remastered the material here excellently and the film has never looked so good.The extras include a rare snippet of recording session footage with David Tomlinson being conducted by Irwin Kostal singing the Portobello Road number,the trailer,a look at the special effects,the Sherman Brothers and a reconstruction of the only major portion of film they couldn`t reinsert;a Landsbury number called ``A Step in the Right Direction``.As an aside,while you watch some of the scenes closely,especially some of the reinserted footage with Tomlinson,you will hear a definite voice change.There was some judicious overdubbing done to compensate for bad sound or a total lack thereof!<br />In conclusion while this film may have a limited appeal to children and even less for adults,time has not changed my oppinion of it at all.It was a mediocre film then and it still remains so today.The film was originally touted as a return to a Mary Poppinesque form(which explains its box office returns) but it was,in execution,far from Mary as things could get.The stars have little appeal in this film and  Tomlinson especially looks like he wanted to be somewhere else during the entire time.The music is lacklustre and not memorable at all.Another protion of the film touted in adverstising of the day was the live/animation sequences which again are lacking the punch and appeal of other Disney efforts.While the remastering is excellent here this newly extended 36th anniversary edition to about 138

With piercing analysis, he unravels the chain of events and the taut web of personal dramas and feuds that haunted Europeans in the aftermath of the Second World War.    A panorama of enormous sweep and brilliant insight, \\"Postwar\\" debunks various grand myths. The idea of Europe victim of fascisms, exuberant liberalism discourse, triumphant Marxism dogma and anti-Nazi Resistance united are all demolished. The author brings too, his encyclopedic knowledge to denounce, mercilessly, the silence and self-imposed amnesia of most European intellectuals (specially the French) over the Nazi collaboration and ethnic cleansing both at home and abroad. And the Great Powers´ unwillingness to forsake their autocratic imperiousness. Not even his native England is spared: \\"... The only way for the country to pay its way in these overstretched circumstances was for the British to impose on themselves unprecedented conditions of restraint and voluntary penury ...\\" and   \\"...basic food rationing in Britain only ended in 1954-- long after the rest of Western Europe.\\"     Judt´s vivid account of contemporary literature, cinema, theater and painting testifies to his astonishing erudition in the attempt to understand history in a much broader sense. Putting eastern and western \\"histories\\" on equal footing (a rare posture among historians), Judt was capable of justifying the advent of a European model of unification based on cooperation and mutual trust. And despite his flinty non-conformism, he doesn't refrain from drawing an optimistic picture of the role of the Continent in today's and tomorrow's world.     The absence of appropriate footnotes and a bibliography are the only weaknesses of this book that can be rectified by Judt and his publisher in a next edition.    It is high time Europeans and non-Europeans alike participated in this debate. Congratulations Prof !

B000X1Z0BU|4.0|How refreshing to see a film that doesn't have the obligatory sex scene thrown in, just for the hell of it, or because it's what people expect to see in a guy/girl movie.  I'm not a prude or anything, I just get tired of the standard hook-up that doesn't add a thing to the movie. Not that the guy doesn't make a move on the girl ... as he mentioned, in his apology to her, he had been very lonely, and she's gorgeous.  This movie is so low-key that my attention drifted from time-to-time, but that is not a drawback, it is simply a stylistic choice that fit the storyline well.  The music is enchanting, as are the scenes of the Irish countryside.

B00004ZAV3|5.0|SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />I'll start off with a confession:  I was NOT a Beatles fan before I heard this CD.  I had heard \\"She Loves You\\" and \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" ad nauseum and I was disgusted with the idea that they were considered a brilliant rock band.  As a further disclaimer, I am too young to have been around during the Beatles' heyday.<br /><br />I can still remember popping in this disc and rolling my eyes through the inevitable reprise of those two songs.  But, I had made up my mind to give it a fair listen all the way through.  Later on, \\"Can't Buy Me Love,\\" \\"Help!,\\" \\"Penny Lane\\" and \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" had worked their magic to a grudging reversal of my initial opinion of the band.  (I had grown up with a strong prejudice against The Beatles, and though it was irrational, it was very difficult to let go).  Then, near the end of the CD, some of the masterpieces such as \\"Come Together,\\" \\"Let It Be,\\" \\"Hey Jude\\" and \\"The Ballad of John and Yoko\\" completely converted me into a fan.  Having listened to the entire CD, I even had newfound respect for \\"She Loves You\\" and \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" as necessary creative steps in the band's overall evolution.<br /><br />I realized an odd thing had happened.  I had known of The Beatles, and I had known their songs, but their material had so become part of culture that I hadn't known so many songs that I had already admired had been Beatles' originals.  This CD really is just scratching the surface of the extent of the band's talent and influence.  For a fuller immersion into their granite legacy, pick up \\"Abbey Road,\\" \\"Rubber Soul,\\" \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,\\" \\"With the Beatles,\\" \\"Please Please Me,\\" \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" and, well you get the point.  I found \\"The Beatles 1\\" to be a solid primer on what makes the band great, and I think you will, too.  HIghly, highly recommended.

B00009RDGA|5.0|Tatum O'Neal's Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, won at the age of ten, was not only inappropriate (she actually has more screentime than her dad, putative lead actor Ryan O'Neal), it remains controversial. But the award really has to be seen as a tribute of sorts to director Peter Bogdanovich, who exacted an astonishingly assured, deadpan comic performance out of her, and then built an almost perfect piece of cinema around it. In the 1970s, when tough, gritty films were the flavour of the day, this seemingly simple, depression-era comedy, filmed in sepia-toned black-and-white, seemed way out of place. But this movie has it all: period detail, brilliant dialogue, wonderful performances, and elegantly economical storytelling. This DVD is especially valuable for Bogdanovich's commentary track, which is almost a master class in filmmaking, explaining how everything from filtered or wide-angle lenses, deep-focus cinematography, cutting on motion, or creating intimacy or tension through camera set-ups, can be used in service of the story. Bogdanovich also notes where he had to coach Tatum, and where she also simply surprised him by being preternaturally skillful or creative. There's one long scene shot in a moving car, full of dialogue and other \\"business\\" (as Bogdanovich refers to his actress' handling of props) between Tatum and Ryan, that is played without cuts, and, while Bogdanovich notes how many takes it took, he is also generous enough to acknowledge his child star's skill in pulling it off. As an honour to an entire film built around what may be the best-directed child performance of all time, Tatum's Oscar was well-deserved.

If you can get past your usual American-ized, evangelical blindness and censorship, there really is a LOT to be gained from watching the whole series.  Excellent job, HBO.

B002VPE1AM|3.0|Avatar is one of the most exciting blockbuster films to come along in a long while, especially if you have the chance to see it in 3D.  Some have argued that the plot is generic, predictable, and full of plot holes, but it's still very entertaining, and, If you're looking for a dense, thoughtful storyline, you shouldn't be watching a multimillion dollar CG blockbuster in 3-D to begin with. However, as much as I enjoyed the film, I have to say that its messages truly concerned me.<br /><br />Avatar tries to be a film that promotes good messages, taking on issues like environmentalism, corporate greed, military imperialism, and even introducing its audiences to a sense of New Age spiritualism.  I support all of these ideas, but here's what I feel we should all be considering about the film's messages:<br /><br />---<br /><br />1. THE MAIN CHARACTER IS FORCED TO FIGHT.  In the real world, choosing to confront threats to the environment and to oppressed cultures is difficult because these issues do not directly affect our lives.  The truly difficult (and heroic) part is to take action when your life would be easier and more comfortable if you stayed out of it.  However, the hero of Avatar is forced into his situation, failing to choose a side until the military literally tries to run him over with a giant plow for no apparent reason all while conveniently forgetting who he is and that he is working for them.  He's forced to take a side in a way that no one in the real world ever is.  The US military isn't going to invade your bedroom in order to protect the world from terror, nor will greedy corporations drill for oil in your backyard.<br /><br />We therefore can't learn anything from Jake's example because it does not pertain to us.  In order to truly confront these evils in our world, we need to learn from the examples of heroes that risk everything by standing up when it isn't in their best interest to do so.<br /><br />2. OVER-THE-TOP VILLAINS.  These guys are so absurdly bad that they bear little resemblance to anyone you'll find in the real world.  I consider myself a leftist, and I am generally anti-war, but even I know that the military isn't made up of gun-happy maniacs.  If anything, the US military of today has the hardest job possible, playing diplomat to real-world cultures and communities that resemble the Navi, building their schools and coming to love their children, all while waiting for roadside bombs and suicide bombers to come out of nowhere at any moment.  That doesn't make the military perfect, nor does it justify our presence in many countries where I feel we do not belong, but it does make the military incredibly different from the monsters portrayed in this film.  If we genuinely want the people seeing this film to be able to take a stand against, and make informed decisions about, military imperialism, then they need to first understand their enemy and what his side of the argument is.  But Avatar won't help anyone understand the real thinking that promotes military imperialism.  It will just make people angry against an exaggerated stereotype that doesn't apply to what's really happening.  It might also offend a whole lot of decent veterans who risked their lives to protect this country in the process.<br /><br />3. HIGHLY DISTURBING ESCAPIST MESSAGE.  I spend as much time online as the next guy (if not more), and maybe that's why I see the most disturbing aspect of this film for what it is.  The main character escapes his bland and unpleasant life by living through an \\"avatar\\" (which is, conveniently enough, the word for an online profile/identity) which he is able to do via sophisticated technology.  This allows him to be part of an idealistic fantasy world that is more exciting and colorful than the real world Jake has spent his whole life knowing.  In fact, with the exception of five comrades, every human in this film is portrayed as being thoroughly evil.  So Jake escapes to a world where these people are not present, and when they threaten to take him out of this world and pull the plug on it, he fights back and tries to kill them.  Let's also not forget that the emotional high point of the entire film (hopefully, this isn't much of a spoiler for anyone) is when Jake is transferred permanently to his Avatar body and now knows he will never have to return to his old life.  Do I really need to draw the disturbing parallels to having an online life, here?<br /><br />I don't think impressionable kids are going to grab grenades and start trying to blow up mom and dad, but I do worry that what we're really teaching them to value in this film is getting away from it all, escaping to a technologically enabled fantasy world where our problems don't follow us, whether they be physical short-comings (Jake is handicapped), disillusionment with the real world (Earth's environment has been \\"killed\\", greedy corporations run everything), or inability to get along with others (as said before, nearly all humans seem to be evil).  How many people will leave theaters wishing that they too could live with the Navi on Pandora or, worse yet, extend that sense of escapist excitement to World of Warcraft, Second Life, or even Twitter and Facebook?<br /><br />----<br /><br />The bottom line of all of this is that, while Avatar is an incredibly fun film, most of its messages are useless because they are exaggerated to the point that they bear no resemblance to the real world, and one of the film's messages actually has the potential to be really damaging.  I do think that people SHOULD catch this film in the theaters (in 3D!) because it's an amazing experience, but you should carefully consider the messages the film is telling you in the process, and then evaluate them for yourself.  If bringing children along, I would suggest having a conversation with them about the film's messages afterward.  I don't think anyone should ever avoid a good film, show, or video game just because it has disturbing messages, but those disturbing messages shouldn't be ignored, either.o take him out of this world and pull the plug on it, he fights back and tries to kill them.

B002GJT4XM|5.0|Okay! I must admit i am a fan of Harry Potter. I love this Ultimate Edition! It is a simple yet beautifully created set that has the consumers in mind - behind the scenes, bonus card, photo book, interviews etc. It gives us extra hours of indulgence into the world of Harry Potter.    For the publisher/distributor who is reading this and has promised us more ultimate editions in the same series to come, please ensure that you do so!    I would love to have all seven (or eight?) sets proudly lined up on my shelf. Love it!!!

B0026ICMLY|4.0|Highly recommended for fans of Disney's Snow White. I got this side primarily because of the bonus contents - book and pin set and the beautifully designed box. The box is cardboard and the richness of the feel is from the printed velvet-like fabric that was attached over the box. It would have been better if this is actually wood. On the other hand, the effect may not be as nice as a velvet feel.    Unfortunately, i would give it less than 5 points because the inner platform was torn in area. I do not think that this is a result of shipping. I think this is more a result of careless packaging when in the factory since the external wrapping are all in stellar condition. It is sad, a blight on a otherwise good product.     If the inner platform have used the same cardboard/velvet combination, i suppose this may be avoided

B0031OCY2E|4.0|In 1992 Mark Whitacre, the President of Bio-Product division of ADM (powerful Fortune 500 company), became the highest ranking executive EVER to turn whistle blower. For three years he helped the FBI gather evidence of a multinational conspiracy to control the price of lysine. As a result, US government collected hundreds of millions of dollars in fines from ADM and foreign corporations, followed by prison sentences for three executives. These are events in real life as well as the movie. However, according to the opening credits, the film is not intended as a documentary and does depart from real life facts... The final, cheeky line of the prologue: \\"So there!\\", gives us a hint that, though the topic and the consequences suffered by many in this story are somber, what we are about to see is meant to amuse and entertain, as well as educate...<br /><br />As promised, the chuckles do come often, but their source is not your typical one liners. Matt Damon is Whitacre, an inspired choice for the role. His plump, mustachioed and toupeed character comes across so harmless and ordinary you never question why his actions go undetected; even as his concealed recording equipment loudly malfunctions during a covert multinational executive meeting! You laugh at the bewilderment of FBI agents and the DA's office as they are led by the nose by Whitacre's increasingly outlandish antics. One could say \\"The Informant!\\" has the educational quality of an Aesop's fable: blinded by their desire to swallow a tasty morsel (ADM), the agents cross their fingers and fail to run even the most basic checks on their informant; checks that would immediately reveal inconsistencies in his stories (such as the true nature of his parentage, for example).<br /><br />The film is not perfect. Based on the way it was being advertised, I expected something in the same category as \\"The Pink Panther\\". In reality, one would not be wrong to describe it as a combination of \\"A Beautiful Mind\\", \\"The Insider\\", and \\"The Duck Soup\\" (Marx Brothers). Sadly, \\"The Informant!\\" never quite becomes as touching, thrilling and funny as those films were, respectively. The makers allow it to drag on a bit in the second half as Whitacre's behaviour becomes absurd. The logical explanation for it all arrives only after our initial keen interest has already begun to dissipate. I also hear some grumblings about the film's muted lighting. Since most of the action takes place in offices and hotels, I believe the lighting is true to reality. Anyone who has spent at least one work day in a cubicle, understands how oppressive that atmosphere can be. Despite these possible faults, Whitacre's story and Damon's performance make \\"The Informant!\\" worthy of at least one theater trip. Depending on your personal approach, you will see a funny thriller or... a thrilling comedy. Either way, expect to be entertained!<br /><br />PS: BRAVO! to the filmmakers for sticking to a relatively modest budget ($21 mil)! I am sick of paying to see worthless films with budgets that could bankrupt the economy of a small country.oup\\" (Marx Brothers).

B002RVZV9U|4.0|... might actually be a better title. There is an undeniable charm to this film, even if White's pretentious preciousness gets under your skin, as it did mine, and that irrespective of his technical ability. One would expect an Irishman to be charming, but Dave Evans is all that and more. The Edge, free of the yapping Maw known as Bono, conveys an intelligent and humble regard for his craft that he saw as his only way out of an Irish economy that was devastatingly empty of promise. He is grateful to the schoolmaster who let them use a clasroom to rehaerse what they didn't know how to do, and archive footage of the lot of them as kids, contrasted with the footage of an overblown performance at Slane Castle presents their career trajectory in vivid detail. But it is his humble but intelligent regard for his job that strikes as so much more eloquent than the endless righteous babble of his vocalist. It's a great reminder that U2 has a lot more to say when Bono keeps his mouth shut.  Edge is clearly interested in what Jimmy Page has to say. In many respects U2 was part of rock's reaction to what Page stood for: corporate fueled excess. And yet, as Page tells his story, it is quite clear that he was very focused on advancing his craft and taking a tradition of rural and brutal and feral blues from teh American south into the hearts first of working class Brit kids and later to a much more inflated platform. But it is his fascination with what goes on inside the spaces between the six, 8 or 12 strings of his instruments, the historical precedents of his own interests that have fueld his imagination and the almost kismet occurence of events that changed teh course of his life. His first guitar was one that was left in the house into which his family moved after WW2. The house in which they recorded LZ4 offered them sonic ambiences that, while he incorrectly identifies as being the first use of such in rock music - Traffic and Fairport had already repaired to country homes,albeit more rural and humble, for seminal recordings - still alert you to the fact that for all the excesses on tour, when it came time to get to recording, it was very much artists exploring their craft.  It may be that the contrast between an Irishman and an Englishman generate subliminal messages, such as Edge driving his own car and Page being chauffeured, but each of them regards the other as essential to the dialogue of guitarcraft. Edge boils his tea in a modest kitchen and talks about his obsessions with the technologies of the guitar and the effects pedals, while Page waxes almost nostaligically over seminal recordings from his youth and offers a self effacing account that if you believed all that you read about him as a session player, you'd be convinced he played on absoluetly every record ever made. He is quite funny about film work that led to \\"Goldfinger\\" and Shirley Bassey passing out after the first take.   Between both men, there is a very serious and committed regard for preparing themselves so that the music plays them. While consummate enough as professionals, they have lost none of the innocence that infuses them with wonder.  In almost every frame White is clearly jarring or out of his element. There's no denying that he has talent to spare and a way of doing things, but there's also no denying that there is something quintessentially oblivious to that sacred innocence that Page and Edge still have. A sense of it all being contrived haunts his every utterance, and while he, like anyone else who attempts a life as a professional musician, has suffered disappointments as well as success, it could all be an absolute Ground Hog Day and start all over with nary a well placed toussled hair awry. While not exactly patronizing him, Page and Evans know they are someplace else, even as they all play together.   My guess is that they are two men who have attained an enlightenment that still eludes White, no matter how much he exactly nails a sound or technique. For all 3 men, music offered a way out of a life that none of them wanted to be stuck in, but in Page and Edge there is a recognition that the gods smiled kindly on them and that their good fortune lay in their ability to silence themsleves in just such a way that Music might lean over and take them into its confidence. At that point, it might indeed get loud.
B00005JKGK|1.0|The movie depicted the Asian man as a guy who always wants the wife to pay half of the money.  In reality, I see more women trying to use men's hoping to be a gentleman to make him pay for this and that, and to get away with things she did that was bad.    Another thing is that the movie depicted Asian men as bad guys.  But in reality, I found that Asian men tend to be the \\"nice guys\\".  And in fact, too nice that it became \\"nice guys finish last\\".    So this movie just uglify Asian Men.  The truth is, if you want to uglify anything, you can successfully do it.  If you uglify with humor, at least people know it is just for making fun of somebody.  If you uglify and make it look like a reality, then it is not so good.
B001NFNFNU|4.0|I haven't cried this much watching a movie in a long time. Maybe it's the mother part of me that just couldn't handle it, especially when what happened at the chicken coop begins to be revealed. Everything from then on was just heartwrenching. I almost didn't want to finish the movie, but I had to find out if she ever found her son. :(    Amazing movie--I'm shocked that it was based on a true story--but I sort of wish I hadn't put myself through this--it felt a bit like having my heart ripped out and stomped on. I had to go give my kids extra hugs and kisses when I finished watching it.
0312360258|1.0|I'm a 28 year old mom... not a teen. However, I do keep current with pop culture via media and books. This book was super cheesy. Beside the completely unrealistic take on vampires (vampyres according to this books writing). Instead of the typical vampire biting human to become a vampire this book choses to \\"Mark\\" a human with a tattoo type marking. I'm not opposed to changing the legend of vampires. I do mind the misuse of pop culture. Its really annoying! I felt like the authors' used celebrities just to lore in teenagers. Its insulting. Another thing about this celebrity usage that bothers me is specifically how it was written. A character who is annoying was compared to Sara Jessica Parker because she too is annoying. I do not think it is appropriate to purposefully mock actual people in the stereotypical teenager way... especially in a teen series.

0439023483|5.0|What can I say about The Hunger Games that hasn't already been said a thousand times? I'm not sure but I'm going to try and do justice to this amazing book.<br /><br />I feel as though I'm one of the last people on the planet to have read this, but I'm so glad I took the jump and picked it up off my shelf. There's no reason I've been putting it off, just that I was worried I wouldn't enjoy it. Luckily with a bit of peer pressure from Katie and just not being able to wait in general I started reading it... and couldn't stop. I probably could have devoured it in a day, but unfortunately I started it just as Winter Break was ending, so not much time to read. I still finished it after a couple of days and it's definitely one of the best books I've ever read. Katniss was a remarkable character with all the power and stamina needed in a strong female role. I really liked Peeta as well. I didn't get enough of Gale to completely choose whose side I'm on, but for now I'm Team Peeta. He and Katniss balanced each other out. There wasn't a ton of romance in the book, but I like Peeta and Katniss's relationship. I liked most of the characters in this book. It was easy to dislike the bad guys and to get attached to the likable characters. There was a lot of emotion in The Hunger Games and the plot kept me at the edge of my seat throughout. It was such an original plot idea and although at first I wasn't sure I was going to like it, I definitely did. Collins drew me into the Games so I felt like I was watching them myself.

0307269981|5.0|Lisbeth Salander jumped into the thick of the trouble in this trilogy's first book, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and through her stealth and sharp intelligence was able to help Mikael Blomkvist in solving the Vanger mystery. She was a fresh new crime fiction heroine, but the story ended before we got to know her and her backstory as fully as we wanted to. This second book does a lot to fill in the missing details as its murder mystery features many themes and incidents from Salander's own past, that in order to solve need to be faced by someone who is ambivalent about introspection.<br /><br />This book is about a Blomkvist, Salander, and a new cast of police detectives trying to solve a triple homicide for which Salander is the prime suspect. Because of this, there is a greater immediacy in the story; we are involved in it much more than in the first book because there is no distance between the crime and these characters who we have grown close to. The investigation is evenly plotted out, and there is hardly a boring page in the entire thing. Like the first book, sexual depravity is a big theme here, but is restrained enough not to continually wallow in the disturbing details. Characterization is at a minimum, but that is excusable in a story of such quick momentum. The ending, leaving the story still wide open, brings closure to the reader but not the characters, who still do not know near as much, and leaves you eagerly waiting for the sequel. The trilogy continues to be high-quality and far above most other books in its genre.
B001992NUQ|5.0|If you have ever seem Fight Club you should know how dark and dense it is. Now in Blu-ray, this movie gets more intense, more visceral and more dark. A \\"should have movie\\" that is now on Blu-Ray.
B002K8BLSA|5.0|TEARS TO MY EYES BEAUTIFUL.....  To David Stone listen to \\"Let's Change The World\\" with no expectations and I will promise you this will be one of your Prefab favorites. This album has nothing to do with Christianity or religion though it helps to believe in a God. Remember LCTWWM is almost 20 years old.
B001OQCV2O|4.0|2012 is an amazing movie. The catastrophic special effects are absolutely amazing, and the story is hilarious. I was either laughing or exclaiming with surprise at the disasters the whole way through this movie. This was the funniest, most unusual comedy I have seen in the last couple of years.
B002SJIO5E|1.0|As a Peter Jackson fan I can't believe I wasted $19.99 on the Blu-ray version of this plodding, predictable, poorly acted, pitiful effects \\"film.\\"  Sci-fi for simpletons.  Make me wish for the days of the VHS cut-out bins.
B002VPE1AM|4.0|Apparently some people have chosen to interpret the theme of James Cameron's Ferngully remake, Avatar, as racist.    The theme of the outsider who arrives, becomes an insider, and then helps save them, is about as anti-racist a theme as one is likely to find. The Thirteenth Warrior had the same theme (Arab becomes accepted among barbarians), as did the recent remake of The Day The Earth Stood Still (alien decides not to destroy humanity). Even Twilight has a touch of that theme. This theme goes back at least as far as Beowulf (a Geat hero among Danes -- and the story which inspired The Thirteenth Warrior), if not further.    People who cherry-pick their examples only to include races against which they have a grudge, and then use that as evidence of some kind of racist message, really need to examine their motives, imo. The message isn't about \\"race\\" at all. It's about crossing cultural boundaries. It's about synthesis.    Yes, the human \\"saviour\\" in Avatar could do things the Na'vi couldn't -- because he would do them. He was not constrained by their assumptions about what was possible or proper (praying to the tree/planet/god, capturing a big red bird, etc.). But anyone who thinks that the Na'vi did not also teach him things completely misses the point. He was able to accomplish more as one of the Na'vi than he could ever have done as a human -- and not just because he was big and blue.
0740785508|5.0|This book has advice that you won't find in any other book, like the windmill effect and other terms that James Gurney invented to explain art. He came to my school once to give a lecture and is the nicest guy too.
0767802470|4.0|They say that war is long stretches of boredom interrupted by brief moments of panic, fear, terror. This movie is a very good example of this cliche. All credit to the scriptwiters, editors, director, actors - it's an excellent war film. I saw it orginally in the theater (shorter version 2 1/2 hours) and now the uncut version(4 hours and 50 minutes). Frankly, I did not need the extra minutes. I know that is heresy to some purists.<br /><br />Das Boot is based on true autobiography of Lt Werner, which makes it interesting, it's accurate and it is very, very long. You have the option to view it with English dubbing, which was nice. Subtitles require your undivided attention.<br /><br />The U Boat Captain knows the long odds and the youth on the boat have not yet learned that war is gory (If you've read or seen The Red Badge of Courage, All Quiet on the Western Front, Platoon, you get the idea). It has a great twist and the end. I think it is very much an anti war, anti Nazi movie. It shows the waste of lives, the loss of innocence, the false glory of war. It deserves to be listed in the great category such as All Quiet, Red Badge, etc. But it is very, very long.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|I bought this movie because Sargent York is my husbands 2nd cousin and he has often spoken of him and his courage. He too is from Crossville Tenn. I gave it to him for Christmas. We have watched it and it is very true to the story according to my husband. The movie arrived fast and in good condition. would use this seller again

B002KQ6BT6|1.0|As a reader I truly loved Angels and Demons using my Kindel Text to Speech.  In saying this, I have wanted to have that same enjoyment with this novel.  However, Dan Brown has decided not to allow this choice as of yet and that breaks my heart.  Which forces me to go onward to other authors such as Stephen King.  In my research this author has no issues how his novel is read as long as the public reads.  Great choice by Stephen King!
B001CDLATE|5.0|First, I'd like to mention the picture quality. This is, by far, the highest quality film I have ever seen on blu ray. It's truly breathtaking, from the first scenes of mountains to the very end.    As for the film itself, it's a wonderful (and admittedly 80's looking at times) dive into different cultures around the world. They don't tell you where each scene is, but I like the mystery of trying to figure it out myself. And of course, there's the internet if you're curious.    Some might thing it's a bit boring, but I wouldn't call it a movie so much as an experience. Just take in the fantastic visuals and different world music and enjoy it.
0307460444|5.0|If you are looking for a cookbook that has it all, this is the one for you.  I have found that Martha's recipes turn out beautifully.  The pictures, illustrations, and directions are masterful.  Add this book to your collection.
B000FA5TTW|3.0|I really thought this book had a lot of potential. The first half was very good and I  really wanted more.  I was disappointed in the ending and didn't feel that Mr. Harvey really got what he deserved.  I wanted to see the family get some real peace and catch the bastard.<br /><br />I think if the book would have continued more as a murder/mystery it would have been good.  I know it ended up being more about the family and I get that, but I wanted more of the mystery.<br /><br />It was still well written and I did enjoy it.  I just felt let down by the ending and really expected an entirely different story.
1416550542|5.0|When I did have to put it down I couldn't wait to pick it back up again.  It had a good plot with lots of twists, some mystery and many interesting characters.  Loved the switching back and forth between time periods. Characters were numerous and taking some notes as you read might be helpful.  If you have a Kindle you can just use bookmarks or a Search to find a specific character.  The relationships were a little complicated.  Figured out some of the mysteries but not the big one till I got close to the end.  The bottom line - it was well written and held my interest and I was sad to have it end.  Now that is a 5 star book.
B00158K0S8|5.0|Patton is a life-changing movie that was a great deal from Amazon, especially on Blu-Ray! I recommend Amazon for any Blu-Rays one might want to purchase.
B0006IIPIK|2.0|A terrible screenplay. The story was juvenile, literally as if it was written by a 12 year old... a 12 year old in 1940, that is.  There is NO character development at all. None. Zero. Zip. Goose eggs.  The acting was juvenile. A shame, really, because I like Jude Law. Oh well.  BUT! The visuals were interesting. An old sci-fi, film noir, movie serial vibe that was taken to the max. So much so that it can become distracting, but the idea was original, and so I give it two stars.  Interesting eye-candy, but everything else was so terrible that it is almost shocking.
B000BQPC3S|5.0|This movie is a must see. Katharine Hepburn and Jimmy Stewart are great. It was a great deal to buy it on Amazon and I highly recommend it for anyone that loves film or classics.

B0011UBDTK|5.0|After watching the complete series in one really long weekend! I am left feeling empty. I want more :( I have laughed & cried & well found a little bit of me in all of the girls. I feel like I just lost 4 really special sisters/friends. This is a great collectors set & a great gift for any one. I had only caught a few episodes here and there from time to time, but I can truly say I am one of their biggest fans.     The girls not only teach you about life, but answer many of the same questions that women have.    Thanks for reading! Sit back & enjoy, you wont need the tissues early on but OMG come season 6 get ready :).

1597801577|5.0|Windup Girl is a detailed, complex, and plausable story of an oil empty and diseased food ridden future world set in Thailand. It is a tale of how genetically created disease free food has replaced oil as the essential worldwide trading commodity, and of how Thailand fights to protect itself from foreign gene tailored foodstuff, while the Western world intrigues to maintain economic dominance by smuggling their gene tailored food into Thialand, at the same time the West attempts to steal Thialand's own genetic food creations.     Windup Girl is a book filled with interesting and human characters, rich in psychology and exciting actions.    And most importantly, Windup Girl is written in a wonderful prose style that flows smoothly, and carries the reader on a stream of words that makes them see, hear, and feel the reality of the writers future vision as if it is now and you are there.
0307454541|1.0|This book was a mess. The author didn't know if he was writing a thriller, a crime novel, or an espose on corruption. It felt like the author threw all his ideas in a blender and this is what we got.<br />It was torture to read since there were so many characters( many of whom were unnecessary) and the characters themselves lack depth. I didn't care at all about any of them and rushed to the ending so I could at least tell my book group I read it!!!
B000002UZ4|5.0|The Pet Shop Boys started their electrifying career in 1981 when singer Neil Tennant met keyboardist Chris Lowe at an electronics shop on Kings Road in Chelsea, London. They figured out they both loved dance music and worked on some new material together. They began by calling themselves West End after their love of London's West End. The new and final name--Pet Shop Boys--came from two friends of their's who worked at a pet shop. In August 1983, Neil was assigned by SMASH HITS to interview The Police in New York. Neil and Chris fell in love with a bunch of Hi-NRG records made by Bobby O. Neil was determined to have lunch with Bobby O, and so he did. They shared some food at a restaraunt called Apple Jack, where Bobby O wanted to make a record with Neil and Chris, after Neil showed him a demo tape. In 1984, Bobby O produced \\"West End Girls,\\" which did not do as well as its rerecording in 1985. After a few more successful singles, \\"Please,\\" their debut LP, was released on Parlophone Records. After three more overly successful LPs, their singles collection, \\"Discography,\\" was released. It featured 16 classic PSB singles along with two new ones: \\"DJ Culture\\" and \\"Was It Worth It?\\" \\"Discography\\" earned a 5-star rating from Allmusic and and 'A' from American music reviewer Robert Christgau. And now it can be in your home! Just buy it from Amazon and have it shipped to your house. Trust me, you won't regret it. Below I have rated the 18 songs:    WEST END GIRLS: 5/5 STARS  LOVE COMES QUICKLY: 4.5/5 STARS  OPPURTUNITIES (LET'S MAKE LOTS OF MONEY): 4.5/5 STARS  SUBURBIA: 5/5 STARS  IT'S A SIN: 5/5 STARS  WHAT HAVE I DONE TO DESERVE THIS?: 5/5 STARS  RENT: 4/5 STARS  ALWAYS ON MY MIND: 5/5 STARS  HEART: 5/5 STARS  DOMINO DANCING: 5/5 STARS  LEFT TO MY OWN DEVICES: 4.5/5 STARS  IT'S ALRIGHT: 5/5 STARS  SO HARD: 5/5 STARS  BEING BORING: 4.5/5 STARS  WHERE THE STREETS HAVE NO NAME (I CAN'T TAKE MY EYES OFF OF YOU): 5/5 STARS  JEALOUSY: 5/5 STARS  DJ CULTURE: 4.5/5 STARS  WAS ITWORTH IT?: 4.5/5 STARS    There you have it: my ratings for all 18 classic PSB tunes featured on \\"Discography.\\" I hope this review helps!

0061849901|3.0|At first one is struck by the surprising, fresh, and often delightful descriptive metaphors that light up the pages of this book (3 or 4 of these are so strikingly apt that they may stick with the reader; e.g., the \\"eye of a tornado\\" already on p.3), but beyond mid-book even these have become tiresome through overuse. \\"Much metaphor and a dash of feminism, both gratuitous\\" pretty much sums up this work. The purported insights (deep or otherwise) into mental illness and a plunge into it, are simply not there, except perhaps for those so young or naive as to have never thought or experienced much. There is that sort of caste to it which is familiar in that which seems often to appeal to histrionic and/or etiolated young females. Beyond that, and its feministic arrogation, one can perhaps see one other reason for its apparent popularity among a certain readership: its lack of any real nexus (other than serving as a cathartic for SP, herself) invites emotive readers to read into it what they will, including their own themes and prejudices.
B001AQT0OU|5.0|Kubrick's most lyrical film, even sentimental in his own sort of way. No other filmmaker can equal Kubrick's suffocating technical precision,and yet with \\"Barry Lyndon\\" Kubrick adds a color pallette, textures, and landscape compositions unequalled in cinema before or since; his most humanistic, if not humane, film.<br /><br />This stunning work of art cries out for a BluRay version that captures the film's original richness. Pleeeease!?
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I ordered this book and had no idea it was written for kids.  I was immediately absorbed and couldn't put it down.  I enjoyed all of it!  I gave it to my husband, son and best friend and they all love it too.  I can't wait until the next book comes out.  I ordered his other book The Thirteenth Reality.  It was good, but clearly for a 12 yo boy.
0440246164|5.0|This was a real page turner. I have read most of Grisham's leagal novels and this one is the best one yet! It grabed me in the first chapter and I read it straight through. I lost a night of sleep but the payoff was well worth it!
B000W967KQ|5.0|I never knew Donald had such insight--this is simply a great book.  The name is a bit gimmicky and childish perhaps but he shares his insights in a practical and fun-to-read manner that made it hard to put my kindle down.  I tend to disagree with his chapter on \\"revenge\\" but it was sure fun to read!  Buy this book and it will help enlarge your vision and restore confidence in yourself as you contemplate taking risks and thinking bigger.
0385737947|4.0|Saw this book on several different blogs last year, so picked up a copy. Read it last fall and really enjoyed it, but never finished my review for some reason. As I enjoyed the book, I'd like to now finish and recommend it to anyone who enjoys YA fantasy fiction!<br /><br />It's a bit of a mystery, as we don't know why the young boys are sent to the glade and what they are supposed to accomplish. I've seen some reviews compare this story to Lord of the Flies, but aside from featuring boys, I don't see any other similarities. The Gladers are not uncivilized, and have a nice system set up in order to survive while trying to solve the puzzle of the maze.<br /><br />This was a fun, original, action packed story. Gave it a rating of 4/5 as I really enjoyed it. The ending was a little abrupt, but set things up nicely for the next installment. Dasher is a very talented, creative writer who has written the start of a really good trilogy!
0307346617|5.0|I wasn't convinced that another zombie story could really be all that compelling.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The author creates a convincing narrative by stringing together usually unrelated individual interviews.  I'm usually a slow reader but I devoured this book.  You won't find any cliche love story or glamorous protagonist here.  Humanity might survive but only by adopting some of the brutality that their zombie foes posses.
B001ACH4DS|4.0|I really am enjoying the David Cook CD.  I rooted for him on American Idol and was so excited when he won.  I am definitely not disappointed with his CD.  It's a great mix of songs and his voice is amazing.  I love the songs, especially \\"Permanent\\".  It's a beautiful tribute to his brother.  Overall... it's an excellent CD and I look forward to his next one.
1401323820|5.0|Heat Wave was a Christmas gift for my dh, as we both enjoy \\"Castle\\", and both of us had a blast reading this witty little mystery.  It is well written, evocative, and humorous, the mystery is plenty tricky, and the book, by the way, is longer than it looks because it's printed full page/small print/hardcover instead of 300 pages of a dinky 4x6 paperback.  If you watch the show you will certainly catch funny references and asides, and picture the characters' expressions as they are described.  I appreciate that the book is pretty clean as far as language and graphic content (both regarding romance and violence), and I like that even secondary characters still get good lines.  Love the \\"credits\\" at the end, as \\"Castle\\" the author thanks not only his fictitious family and agents, but also his real life actor/producer friends.      One of the reasons I like the show is that there is a deft mix of humor, flirtation, family tenderness in Castle's relationships, and clever deduction on the cases. I'm sure this is due in large part to the actors involved, but also to some inventive and excellent writing.  There are always a couple of laugh out loud moments (like the Halloween episode with the Firefly reference), and the book had some of those moments as well. I did not expect it to be a masterpiece of modern literature (it's not), but frankly, plenty of \\"masterpieces\\" I have read have been an unmitigated misery (Old Man & the Sea, Tess of the d'Urbervilles, Wuthering Heights, A Separate Peace, HONESTLY, did anyone ENJOY those???) and I make no apologies for liking a happy ending!  Heat Wave is a great idea, well-realized, fun, and entertaining, well worth the purchase, greatly enjoyed as a gift, and I hope ABC runs \\"Castle\\" for another decade or two!
B001LF3YQK|5.0|I love this case.  I've been asked by moms watching me use it where did I get it.  I like that I can hang it off the stroller or anywhere else as needed which is useful for me.  The case makes it easier to get to wipes and I can resupply as needed.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Being a bit jaded by a recording industry which keeps re-packaging and re-selling me my favorite content, I was not planning on purchasing this box set.  I ended up getting it as a very nice Christmas gift and after spending an afternoon listening to a smorgasbord from the box set ( [...] ) and have reached the following conclusions:    1) Differences are immediately apparent and entirely better.  I heard that you need really fancy speakers to tell a difference and admit that I have moderately fancy speakers ( energy veritas bookshelf & Denon 2801 amp), but they are about 10 years old and far from super audiophile.      THAT SAID, I am not sure if a casual listener will really be able to discern. Meaning, I love the Beatles, lived the Beatles for a few years, stayed up all night watching the anthologies a few years back (C-O-L-L-E-G-E), and have listened to some of their albums probably 100 times.  This is not how most people consume music and am not sure I'd have noticed a qualitative difference which would make me want to replace my existing Beatles collection. Especially if heard through a boom box or equivalent equipment.    2) The stereo mixes made me really curious what the Mono box set sounds like.  I know that this was their \\"true\\" intention on most of their albums, but I can't imagine the difference is so great that owning both is a necessity, even for a serious Beatles fan.    3) I'm sure a lot of people have seen the 'Remastered' label on pretty much any \\"Classic\\" album from the Police to Blue Öyster Cult.   Not disrespect to the umlauted, but this is more than just a remastering which too often sounds to me not much more than 'Louder'.  These recordings put the legacy Remasterings to shame.    4) I still love the Beatles.  Thanks Eric for the great, GREAT Christmas gift.  Of course, few things in life are more enjoyable than sitting on a couch on a lovely, warm and sunny Southern California day and listening to this the Beatles.  If that taints my review, so be it.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I pre-ordered my movie ticket a month in advance and I eventually saw the movie four times in theaters.<br /><br />I was riveted. I loved seeing a behind-the-scenes Michael Jackson who was very humble, understanding, yet totally in control and not one to accept any less than the best. My favorite part of the movie was when he was instructing Michael Bearden, the musical director on how to correctly play \\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\". He knew what he wanted from his dancers, musicians and singers and he got the results.<br /><br />I am grateful to Kenny Ortega and all the others involved in the making of this film for allowing us once last glimpse of a man who should very much be alive today. What a tragedy June 25th, 2009 was......I don't care to relive that.<br /><br />I have been a fan of MJ since 1988 and I felt that a piece of my childhood was literally ripped away from me when I found out he passed. It was lilke hearing about the death of a family member.<br /><br />Michael Jackson was one of the greatest that ever did it and I pray that his critics and detractors come to learn it.
B001CDLATE|5.0|I saw this on the big screen & remember being stunned & shocked at the visual juxtaposition from the Himalayas to the slums of the Andes to the ant colony movements of Manhattan.    The blu-ray edition sets the standard to be achieved for HD remastering but I suppose it isn't always realistic to expect this of most movies, given it was shot in 70mm.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I enjoyed this album very much, although I didn't feel the title song had as much power and spontanity as the original. I gave 3 of these for Christmas gifts.
0451529308|3.0|How to review a beloved classic such as Little Women?  I have been considering this question since finishing the book a few days ago.    Hailed as one of the best books written for children, Little Women has stood the test of time and is still read by many today, clearing showing that most love this book...however, I did not enjoy it that much.  This brings us to the difficulty in reviewing, as book critics, schoolteachers, and children the world over disagree with me.    The writing is beautiful with descriptions of the girls, their home, and their lives..but I didn't really relate to any of the characters, even Beth or Jo, which would be the two most memorable of all the girls.  I also wasn't caught up in the plot and found it easy to walk away from the book for days at a time.    I would still recommend this novel as it gives a glimpse into another time and is an important piece of classic literature, but just don't expect it to be too riveting.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I love this miniseries and was thrilled to be able to purchase it at such a super price.I am a big Laura Linney fan going back to Tales of the City.Superb casting for this miniseries.HBO has done it again with this beautifully done period piece.

0425200477|5.0|If you like detective stories and mysteries, this is as good as it gets.  Only Dame Christie's other great work And Then There None (also known as 12 Little Indians) is comparable for unexpected plot twists, great complex characters, and a unique approach to a worn out genre.     This Hercule Poirot mystery starts out like all the others.  The Lord of the manor is murdered in his home, with several guests nearby, after a long day in which he learns something terrible about the woman he had planned to marry. The usual suspects appear, including the step-son, the widowed sister-in-law, her daughter, the butler, a drug-addled stranger with an American accent. Fortunately for us, Poirot has moved to this English village in his retirement to grow vegetables and is quickly enlisted to the cause.     The story is told from the perspective of the town doctor, who is also among the last to see the victim, and a potential suspect himself. The doctor has a gossipy sister who makes his life unbearable; Dame Christie has said she was a precursor to our other favorite detective Miss Marple.     Of course, Poirot takes control.  He digs up clues including telegrams, furniture out of place, drug paraphanalia, lost engagement rings, patients in lunatic asylums, traveling salesmen, and various boots. Per the formula, we then have the big showdown scene where Poirot presents evidence but does not reveal the criminal, only telling him that the jig is up. No one is whom we expect and the one telling us what is happening is also showing some reticence with parts of the story.     At the end, Poirot shows a ruthless streak, letting the criminal know that there are alternative endings, but none involve freedom at least in this world.
0684859106|5.0|I was going to buy this book for a friend of mine who is a fantastic sweet baker. I got a little worried about the book on reading the negative reviews. I decided to try the Blueberry muffin recipe using the look inside feature as that was specifically mentioned as not being a good one. They were easy to make and turned out great. They looked beautiful and tasted lovely. My three year old devoured two right out of the oven. I am going to go ahead and buy two copies and keep one for myself. I'm looking forward to all the other recipes I can try when my book arrives.

B002SJIO4A|5.0|District 9 is by far one of the best Sci-Fi films I've seen. It's creative, fast paced, believable, do not move out of your seat type of film. People here are giving it 5 starts because they saw in it what I did, and others don't like it at all which is quite different from liking it but objecting to a few aspects of the production. It's either love it or hate it. Rent it from Netflix before investing the few dollars to purchase it, see if you like it. It's up there with Alien, Aliens, and Predator. I am hoping it will make some noise at Oscar time, thereby assuring more people will see it!

B002VPE1AM|5.0|It starts with the visual. Cameron's epic just changed the landscape of CGI. These effects-meisters have mastered the tension of muscles working hard, and the yielding where something presses against a body's soft tissue. These figures truly come to life, instead of resembling over-medicated puppets. But the technology is only the paint and brush - artistry comes from how they're wielded. Cameron's fantastic land- and skyscapes, his luminous nightworld, his thundering devastation of war all set new standards of their own, as well.<br /><br />But imagery alone doesn't make a movie memorable. It's the plot, the character, the scripting, and the acting (if the word actually applies) that engage the viewer's feelings and imagination. Cameron succeeds again in more ways than I have words to describe.  Although the ecofable tends toward the predictable, it's beautifully done. The imagery and character form such a dense mesh of strands that readers can see almost anything they want in it: religious, moral, social, political - I'm sure there are long arguments being held over every way pick the threads of this movie apart. One thing I appreciate is how every scale holds something of interest. Minutiae like the Latina pilot's warpaint contribute moment by moment.<br /><br />At the larger scales, though, Cameron echoes C.S. Lewis's thought that \\"The greatest evil ... is conceived ... in clear, carpeted, warmed, well-lighted offices, by quiet men with white collars and cut fingernails and smooth-shaven cheeks who do not need to raise their voices.\\" Once those quiet voices have spoken, von Clausewitz's dictum comes to mind: \\"War is regarded as nothing but the continuation of state policy with other means.\\" Even if the distinction of corporation and state blurs, the adage remains true.<br /><br />The grand visual scale of this movie demands a big screen. Detail will get lost when I see it again on DVD (and I shall see it again). But the complex flow of ideas and beliefs will come through as clearly as ever, and I expect to see more in it with each viewing.

1594488843|5.0|\\"And if the men should drive them hard one day, all the flock will die.\\" -- Genesis 33:13<br /><br />Dan Pink has done his usual fine work in Drive by:<br /><br />1. Identifying the relevant scientific research<br />2. Turning the findings into brief, reader-friendly material<br />3. Simplifying the key points into a few principles to remember<br />4. Comparing and contrasting those points with what prevailing practices are in larger organizations<br /><br />If you are already familiar with the literature of creative motivation, you won't find anything new here. If you don't read that literature, Mr. Pink will take you to where you should want to go with a minimum of time and effort on your part.<br /><br />The key point is that people respond to more than money in getting their work done. And the more you need someone to use all their resources, the more money becomes a hurdle to success rather than an aid . . . by narrowing focus too much.<br /><br />Here's a personal example that I remember well that shows the same point. As a poverty-stricken undergraduate, I never saw a psychology experiment that I didn't want to participate in . . . as long as it paid. One such experiment involved memorizing some nonsense material over a series of sessions. I could usually do it relatively quickly. One night my girl friend was in a big rush to go out, but I needed to get paid by the experimenters before I could afford to take her out. I decided I would try much harder than usual so I could get done faster and be on my way with the money. Wrong! I thought I was never going to finish that experiment. The harder I tried, the worse I did. The experimenter was obviously astonished by all the trouble I was having. I'm sure I messed up that set of results for some graduate student.<br /><br />I've also seen this problem occur where company executives have an opportunity to gain undreamed-of wealth. They get so focused on the money that they don't see anything else, and they make a lot of mistakes that they wouldn't if little money were involved.<br /><br />As well documented as these points are, don't expect Wall Street banks and automotive companies to quickly switch over to encouraging autonomy, mastery, and purpose instead of paying big salaries and bonuses. Carrots and sticks involving money are in place because they pay well for those on the receiving end . . . not because they reward shareholders well.<br /><br />The key problem with drawing all your lessons about motivation from this book is that the number of applications to work environments that have been well studied scientifically is pretty limited. My research suggests that there are lots of important motivating factors for doing good work that exist in addition to autonomy, mastery, and purpose.  For instance, most workers tell you that they don't have the resources they need to do a good job . . . and that discourages them. In addition, most workers don't feel respected by those who are in charge of their work . . . which also discourages them. If you want a longer list, read Dilbert or visit someone in a cubicle. And those are just removing negative influences. There are other positive influences as well, including being faithful to God, expressing love to others, and being loyal to friends.<br /><br />You also have to address whether the most important management task is to make everyone more motivated so that they produce more . . . or to make a few people effective in creating astonishingly large improvements that ordinary people can learn to implement. My work suggests the latter route is the way to go. Most people would choose the former route.<br /><br />However deep you plan to delve into this subject, Drive is a good starting point if you are new to thinking about how to encourage people to accomplish more.olved.

B001PJRAUS|5.0|I checked out this movie from the library and ended up liking it so much that I bought it.      It's a fun little tribute to everyone who dreams of living in Pride and Prejudiceland.  The heroine, Amanda, trades places with Elizabeth and shakes up the Bennet family's story.  In her attempts to bring the right couples together (and keep the wrong couples apart!), Amanda ends up changing the story.    It's light and fluffy and a lot of fun.
B000068QJX|5.0|If you like choreography, dancing, and smiling... this movie might be for you.  I saw Strictly Ballroom when it first came out and since then I have owned the VHS and now DVD version... I love watching it every once in a while when I just want to smile and have fun!  Also, some of the choreography used is awesome...
1416594787|3.0|If you want a more long-winded explanation of evolution and colored photographs this is the book for you. But if you want a more concise (233 vs. 437 pages) and clear explanation, read Why Evaluation is True by Jerry A. Coyne.  And when Richard Dawkins is concise Jerry A. Coyne quotes him: \\"Richard Dawkins provided the most concise definition of natural selection: it is 'the non-random survival of random variants.'\\"
B0017I1FP8|3.0|First a complaint. You can't get the final track (A Dark Knight) as an MP3 download so I bought the CD. Except that when I got it the final track was flawed and would not play properly on my CD player or my computer. So still waiting to hear it.    Secondly, I have not seen the movie so this review is based on the musical quality of the soundtrack divorced from any images in my mind of the film. No doubt the music fit the movie perfectly but it is not all that great just to listen to. As a contrast, I have never seen the movie, \\"Starship Troopers\\" but the soundtrack for that movie is excellent and worth listening to on its own merits.     On the whole I was disappointed after reading all the reviews praising this soundtrack as like almost the best soundtrack ever. I'd recommend downloading the one track \\"Like a Dog Chasing Cars\\" and nothing else. Or maybe go see the movie first.
B002BX4VEK|5.0|Along with the '68 Comeback Special, this album (which includes its companion piece, ELVIS BACK IN MEMPHIS) represents the peak of Elvis' career. Why? Because for once, he stood up to the Colonel and did what he wanted. If only he had the cojones to do that more often! Actually, as has been well-documented, Elvis tried to fire Colonel Parker on numerous occasions, but because of his habit of spending money like a drunken sailor, he was in financial hock to the Colonel (and others), and his dad warned him that the family would be back in a trailer park in rural Mississippi if the Colonel was fired.  This set is excellent, and presents the material in much better sound quality than the [[ASIN:B014I79E7A From Nashville to Memphis: The Essential '60s Masters I]] box set from 1993. The mono single mixes are a nice addition, and actually sound better than the stereo versions in some cases (particularly &#34;Kentucky Rain,&#34; where the backing vocals are clearly audible in mono, but almost indecipherable in stereo). I too would have liked to have had all of the stereo mixes included on this set, but I do have them on the 1993 box. In addition, the stereos of &#34;Suspicious Minds,&#34; &#34;Don't Cry Daddy,&#34; and &#34;Kentucky Rain&#34; are on the [[ASIN:B002QVBP6O Elvis 75 - Good Rockin' Tonight]] box set, as well as other recent compilations; &#34;Rubberneckin',&#34; from Elvis' final scripted film, &#34;Change of Habit,&#34; which was remixed for the 2003 compilation [[ASIN:B0000AUHOX Elvis: 2nd To None]], appears in its original stereo form on the companion CD single, as well as on 2007's [[ASIN:B000PHW23Q Elvis At The Movies]]. The stereo versions of &#34;My Little Friend&#34; and &#34;Mama Liked the Roses&#34; are on the '60s box set, as well as several older compilations.  2016 UPDATE: The newly remastered version of FROM ELVIS IN MEMPHIS, included in [[ASIN:B019YQJRKO The RCA Albums Collection]], has four bonus tracks: the stereo mixes of &#34;Suspicious Minds,&#34; &#34;Don't Cry Daddy,&#34; &#34;Kentucky Rain,&#34; and &#34;Mama Liked The Roses.&#34; The BACK IN MEMPHIS material returns to its original source, a newly remastered CD version of the double album [[ASIN:B000U6G4Q8 From Memphis To Vegas/From Vegas To Memphis]]. Three of the four bonus tracks on Disc 1 of the Legacy Edition, &#34;I'll Be There,&#34; &#34;If I'm A Fool (For Loving You),&#34; and &#34;Who Am I?,&#34; appear on the remastered  [[ASIN:B01AXM4HVW Let's Be Friends]] CD (&#34;Who Am I?,&#34; originally on the [[ASIN:B000IONJ7E You'll Never Walk Alone]] album, is a bonus track); the fourth track, Elvis' less-than-spectacular version of &#34;Hey Jude,&#34; appears on [[ASIN:B002ZBEFEY Elvis Now]]. The stereo versions of &#34;Rubberneckin'&#34; and &#34;My Little Friend&#34; are on the newly remastered [[ASIN:B000FFJ7J0 Almost In Love]] CD.  All in all, this set is well worth purchasing; I got it at a great price from an Amazon Payments retailer, and now I have two versions, which I can compare and enjoy.
1592332803|5.0|I know that sounds silly, but this is the truth.  Baking is one of my most adored hobbies, but being a vegetarian for ethical/animal reasons, I have started to feel that I need to also cut out dairy and eggs.  Baking has been the one thing that has held me back from making the transition to vegan, so with the new year I decided to try this book to see if I could replace my more traditional baking with vegan baking.  This was the ultimate test -- if I could make great desserts and really find \\"joy\\" in this new way of baking, I'd make the leap and start going vegan.  I'm so excited to say that everything I've made out of this book has been fabulous!  Not fabulous vegan, but just plain fabulous with no categorization.  My in-laws, co-workers, and husband have given everything out of this book two thumbs up without hesitation.  This has shown me a new way to bake and a new way of seeing vegan treats: YUMMY!  I love serving up food and being able to say (mostly to myself), \\"No animals were harmed for the sake of this meal/cookie/cake.\\"  Thanks to the author for being an inspiration in the kitchen!
0440244870|4.0|I have really enjoyed the Shopaholic series, but the first has been my favorite.  Being an avid mall-stalker, I liked reading about someone who was really over-the-top when it came to buying whatever caught her eye.    The next releases were also enjoyable, but not as much as the first.    Totally recommended for anyone who enjoys love-at-first-sight for a purse or boots or shoes whether or not they are 'needed'.
B000TEUSJK|4.0|'Caligula' the film may have mixed opinions, though the film delt with extreme explicity, it also had delt with true and genuine emotions of Caligula. A strong lust, yet a truthful love for his sister Drisulla has been potrayed very well, for throughout the film, you may feel Caligula had cared for his sister more than any other being in the world and when she dies, you give out your heart to her brother, who couldn't be any broken. This is one outstanding chemistry and McDowell does it again! after 'O lucky man' this is the second film that does really potray his talent very well. This film maynot be adequette in terms of its historical events, but the situations are very realistic. Behind a lusty man, a womanizer, lies a good soul somewhere in the man 'Caligula'. Give it a chance, you won't be dissapointed.
B001CN2WXM|5.0|I picked up a copy of the book at a used book sale. It was hard to put down once I started reading. When I finished, I wanted to see the movie - Kevin Spacey is one of my favorite actors. Amazon had it, and in two days I received it. The setting was in the 1940s and '50s; I lived through those years and remembered reading about some of the \\"gangsters\\", i.e. Lana Turner's daughtered killed Stompanato; the cars, the scenes were great. The movie followed the story line very well, not deviating too much. This set also has a CD with the pilot of the television series that followed - I don't remember that. The musical score was wonderful and that was also included in the 2-disc set. I'll be watching this again and again; you can't see everything the first time. Good movie - Guy Pearce was great, too!
B0011UBDTK|1.0|I borrowed this set from a friend and watched every disc at least 3 times. I was hooked. I had to have my own set. I purchased this SATC set. Season 2 and 3 discs would not play. I figured I got a defective set so I returned it. Again, the same issues. The discs won't play. I've tried on my computer DVD player and my regular DVD player and the episodes freeze up or won't play at all. My friend's set had a couple of episodes freeze up but I figured her discs may have been scratched. My set is brand new. I am so upset. I love the show but I won't pay 100.00+ dollars for only half of the episodes!! Do not purchase this set. Obviously, this is a production issue that has not been resolved and if you buy the set you will be disappointed. Read the other reviews. The issues are the same over and over. Not worth the money or the risk. My second set is going back tomorrow for a refund.
B002QGUFWE|1.0|I actually bought this CD at Target.  It is censored and not marked as such. Neither Target or Interscope will refund my money.    I discovered through some online research that Interscope Records released ONLY a censored version of this album.  They have not marked on the cd that this is the case.  When I called their office, I was told that they cannot do anything and I have to deal with Target.  The man I talked to also wanted to argue with me about how much Lady Gaga curses, saying that she doesn't curse that much and I should read the lyrics.  This is very interesting too, because the actual written lyrics have the censored words, they're just cut out of the cd audio itself.  Target will also not refund my money because I opened the cd - there is absolutely NO other way that I would have known this was censored.  I have kept my receipt and the packaging and have filed a complaint for Interscope Records and Target with the Better Business Bureau:[...]  I encourage everyone else who agrees this is wrong to do the same.    This is NOT the album that I intended to buy and I find it unconstitutional to have only a censored version released for sale - especially when there is no clear indication to the consumer that this is the case.  It is a shady way to do business and essentially forces the consumer to have to wait for the release of an uncensored version and purchase it for a 2nd time!      Interscope either needs to refund my (and everyone's) money or release the uncensored version ASAP, allowing me (and everyone else who unintentionally purchased a censored album) to exchange my cd for no charge.  A public apology is in order too, this is unconstitutional and I resent record companies trying to parent me - I am a grown woman and can decide for myself what is appropriate for me to listen to.
B00260HH3K|1.0|Dragonball Evolution is the worst movie ever. I would have rated it Zero, except this site won't let you do that.     It is not a Dragonball movie. It simply has Dragonball in the name, like that Final Fantasy Spirits Without or whatever. If Dragonball Evolution is a movie adaptation of the Dragonball anime/manga, than \\"Time Cop\\" must be the live action adaptation of the Jungle Book.     You may lose sight in your left ear if you watch this movie, I know, that may not make much sense, but it is true. It's like a 2 hour episode of Power Rangers, except far less entertaining. It is an ABC Family TV movie with a $100 million dollar budget. It is often mistakenly categorized as \\"Sci Fi\\" or \\"Fantasy\\", it is really a Drama loosely based on the true story of Koko, the gorilla who can talk with sign language.    If I had to rate this movie on special effects purely, I'd give it 4 stars.   - Half star is for the outdated computer graphics, Yamcha's blonde highlights, the 6 foot man in a gorilla suit, and the christmas light bulbs in the Dragonballs.   - Half star for the Capsules, and bullet time at the castle, that actually was pretty well done. And the girl that plays Chi Chi is hot.  - Three stars for the innovative \\"smell\\" technique only found in this movie: you actually can smell sweaty butt cheeks coming out of your sound system. I know! This movie is that bad!    There is actually one movie that comes close to being worse than Dragonball Evolution. It is called \\"Paranormal Activity\\". Except that Paranormal Activity does not meet the text-book definition of a \\"movie\\", it is simply what can only be described as \\"moving pictures\\". Sometimes experts refer to it as an \\"un-animated feature\\". So therefore Dragonball Evolution is considered the worst movie ever.
1590171993|5.0|This is a beautiful book, written in a very terse language, which makes the narrative even more powerful. it should be considered along with books by Faulkner, Fitzgerald, Roth (American Pastoral) as another piece in the great picture of American life.<br /><br />Stoner, the protagonist, is a village boy, who becomes fascinated with literature in his first year in agricultural college. His interest and abilities are noticed by his teacher, and he eventually becomes a teacher of literature himself, later on becoming a tenured professor in the same college.<br /><br />The book is really about unraveling of Stoner's life, beginning of which was so promising. Even though John Williams does create a detailed picture of college life, the book is much greater than that. It is much more about life in general, its futility and inability of man to control events which - first and foremost - are beyond his understanding, beyond his imagination, however intelligent he might be.<br /><br />Stoner's marriage, his & his wife's attitudes to sex and child bearing & rearing are shown by Williams to be based on complete ignorance, which in its own turn is based on the current state of society, common, shared - false - consciousness. Williams shows how difficult it is, especially for young people, to place themselves in the \\"outside\\" position, to be able to view their life and attitudes critically.<br /><br />And this is just the beginning of tragedy. Because Stone, essentially \\"good\\", and trying to be good to other people, rewarded for his goodness with complete disaster in his personal and professional life. One can consider his academic achievements as some kind of justification for his sufferings, but the question remains: is it worth it?<br /><br />Same question can be asked about his great love which he found late in life and allowed to be destroyed by his colleagues in the full of hatred and spite conflict in the \\"quiet\\" academia world.<br /><br />Is life worth living? Williams leaves us with this question unanswered - just the way all other books which belong to what we call great literature do.t the way all other books which belong to what we call great literature do.
B002VKE1K2|1.0|This \\"movie\\" was complete garbage. 1OO% HYPED! The real paranormal activity going on here is how so many people fell for the movie previews claiming this was the scariest film ever seen and people rushed to  theaters only to the Blair Witch Project pulled on them again only with way worse acting. There are only  two people in this film the whole time. Neither can act! Neither are very smart. This movie is NOT about  a ghost or poltergeist but a possession. I wanted both characters to just die then maybe we would see   some kind of action. You never see anything in this movie. Nothing happens! I shouldn't have to use my imagination when seeing a movie. I can do that at home.
B002BU0DPE|4.0|I've always used a bluetooth headset with my PS3 and my home theater. If you've spent any time online, you know how frustrating hearing someone else's home theater through the TV can be. I read mostly positive reviews about the P21 and thought I would give them a try.     Talk about a game changer. From a pure sound standpoint,they are incredible. I spend a lot of time on Modern Warfare 2 and the game experience is substantially improved through the headset. Ambient noises are everywhere and the bass is stunning. The first time I got loose with an ACR and blew up a car (and some bad guys) I couldn't contain my smile. Simply incredible. Also, being able to change the volume of the voice chat versus the gameplay is awesome. For most games, I mute all of the other players and just listen to the game, but when I play with my team, it's great to be able to listen to the game AND teamates clearly (as opposed to game turned low as not to interfere with my headset).    If there are any complaints, they are from an wiring, set up standpoint. The headset is not wireless, and for me, that is a problem. I have 2 game stations, one that is a smaller screen and I play from about 4-5 feet from the television. The other is in my living room and the chords are a hassel and not nearly long enough. You can get a USB extension if you want, but in the wireless era, I don't want. Also, the instructions are very simple and make set up very easy. The problem is that my PS3 is my Blu Ray player as well and you have to go in and change the audio set up everytime. It's not difficult, but it would be nice if the headset turned off when it was unplugged from the USB and default setting were restored. I am also concerned about the longevity of the of the chords and control module. The chords are very thin and there is no sort of clip to stop them from just hanging and pulling on the connection into the headset. I will purchase a clip and fix it up myself, but for close to $100, that something that should have been included.     Gripes aside, I'm not sure there is a better, more functional, better performing headset available for the PS3 and highly reccomend the Turtle Beach P21.

0312944098|3.0|Writing: Unadorned<br />Plot: Easy To Follow<br />Suspense Factor: Almost None<br />Entertainment Value: Medium<br /><br />First and foremost, \\"A Prisoner of Birth\\" is long. If you can make it through the long opening court scene, you'll have an idea that this novel stretches out its plot points. I think Jeffrey Archer wanted to write something that feels as long to read as Alexandre Dumas' \\"The Count of Monte Cristo.\\"  He succeeded. This isn't James Patterson country. It's Charles Dickens. The writing is plain, spare.  The verbiage is unadorned. It's pure story. The suspense is almost non-existent. We know that unfairly prosecuted Danny Cartwright will exact revenge. The plotting is clever, however, and the question becomes how he'll manage it and what kind of obstacles he'll have to overcome to pull it off. If you buy that Danny can slip into the life of a fellow prisoner and if you can buy that he is released on parole in the dead prisoner's name, you'll have no problem swallowing the rest.<br /><br />Once he's out of the inescapable Bellmarsh prison, it's all about Cartwright's effort to set up the revenge. What follows is a long series of conversations (note--not action sequences) involving collector postage stamps, wills, passports, death certificates, bank accounts and a missing key. This section is mostly talk and scheming. There are lots of meetings and some land dealings in the run-up to the 2012 U.S. Olympics in London. And, since it's England, there is plenty of \\"Lord Chancellor\\" and \\"My Lord\\" that.<br /><br />There is another long courtroom battle at the end it's plenty slick and neatly crafted.<br /><br />Too long? For my tastes, by a couple hundred pages or so.<br /><br />Fun ride nevertheless? In the \\"light entertainment\\" category, yes.

The only thing I will say is I cannot wait for the next book.
B002VKE1K2|2.0|The only thing I can say is that I am so glad I didn't actually go the theater to see this movie.   I love this type of movie but this was just too slow and boring.  It picked up a bit at the end, though by that time it lost my interest and also most of the \\"scare\\" factor.
B001VZY4M8|5.0|Neil Young's third album, After the Goldrush, is testimony to his eloquent songwriting skills.  Some of his finest work can be found on this recording.  The album is mainly a mix of acoustic guitar and piano driven material, along with some electric intensity reminiscent of his second album, [[ASIN:B001VZY4MI Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere]].  This album may be forty years old, but it's still amazing.  Young writes plaintive songs, full of yearning.  Highlights include the wistful title track, the angry \\"Southern Man\\" written about racial inequality (one of Young's songs that inspired some controversy, as well as Lynyrd Skynyrd 's \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\"), and the absolutely amazing \\"Don't Let It Bring You Down\\".  One of my favorite Young tunes has long been the short and sweet \\"Cripple Creek Ferry\\".  Honestly, there isn't a bad song on this album and even the cover of Don Gibson's \\"Oh Lonesome Me\\" fits seamlessly into Young's pastiche of melancholy, redemption, and yearning.<br /><br />The 2009 remaster is simply amazing.  The piano is bright and vibrant, individual notes ring out from the acoustic guitar, and the electric guitar snarls out from the speakers.  Background vocals have a clarity not found on the original CD issue.  This obviously isn't a repackage job to bring in a few extra bucks, but an honest attempt to breathe new life into a classic session.  Even the CD booklet is printed on heavy, textured paper.  After the Goldrush was already a 5 star album, but John Nowland and Tim Mulligan's remastering work has served to make it even better.
B001OQCV2Y|3.0|Even the very start of the credits grabbed my attention as a familiar tune from the John Wayne version of \\"The Alamo\\" announced the start of our film. The drama commenced with a sinister SS Colonel Hans Landa questioning a French peasant who is believed to be hiding Jews. His charm and manners are engaging and sinister at the same time. Every polite compliment to the peasant is encouraging and threatening. The actor Christoph Waltz who plays the sinister colonel appears to speak French flawlessly, but asks the peasant if he minds if they speak English, which he knows the peasant does. This only heightens the suspense. From this sequence, we learn just how much guile Colonel Landa possesses. And that is the end of Chapter 1. From here the movie slowly begins to lose its velocity.<br /><br />Lt. Aldo Raine, from Tennessee has eight American soldiers of the Jewish faith before him. These will be his two thirds of a Dirty Dozen that will be dropped into France for the express purpose of killing German soldiers.  Why he has been given this assignment, or if these men are volunteers, or simply have a bone to pick, we don't know.<br /><br />Soon we see one ausgepinkelt (polite for ticked off) F&uuml;hrer wanting the head of the Jewish Bear and the others who are scalping his soldiers, and bashing their brains in with a baseball bat. The leader meets with a gefreiter (pvt) who survived the holocaust of his patrol, and we are taken to the scene to see the scalping, the bashing, and the tattoo scarring. (This is fantasy at its richest for survivors and those actually touched by reality and history).<br /><br />Chapter III, (the film actually pauses to give you the chapter number), takes us to England where a British officer, actor, and critic of German films in civilian life is asked by a British colonel, alias Michael Myers, to drop into France, hook up with the Inglourious Basterds, and carry out a scheme hatched by a young French woman who suffered at the hands of Colonel Landa. The scheme is that all the Germans will gather at her theater one night, to include Hitler, Goering, Bormann, and Goebbels.<br /><br />There is another moment of heightened suspense when the British officer in SS Nazi drag meets with a double agent in a French local.  The intrusion of an SS major makes the heart pound again is it did in Chapter I. You almost can't wait for its resolution. After this chapter, I couldn't wait for the film to end.<br /><br />There were several annoying features to deal with. The subtitles, in white, often provided little contrast to the white that was background in this black and white film. The subtitles went very fast, and I often found myself replaying and pausing to just read them. The film languished as they introduced a German hero who spoke perfect French, as he tried to woo the affections of the French woman/theater owner. The interesting part was the reintroduction of Colonel Landa meeting the French beauty and asking her seemingly benign questions over apfelstrudel. You wonder what Landa suspects, or how much.<br /><br />If you are looking for reality at any level, you will be sorely disappointed right down to the small 1970's map used by the Basterds. The Americans who die in the film within a film are wearing post 1960 field jackets, as they are felled by a left-and right-handed German sniper who spoke excellent French and knew of Sgt. Alvin York, but did not wear the Knights Cross to the Iron Cross, which he most certainly would have been awarded.<br /><br />It seemed like Tarrantino was trying to mesh several genres at the same time and make them meld. The \\"Alamo\\" melody at the beginning was intriguing, and reminded me of westerns. The \\"three fingered mistake\\" reminded me of an old Alan Ladd movie where they repeatedly reminded an American agent not transfer his fork to his knife hand, which typifies good American table manners. (Of course, we know what he did the moment he entered a German gasthaus). There was also the writing on the screen, as if John Madden was showing you what went wrong with a football play--arrow pointed at an actor in a theater box, then the writing: \\"Martin Bormann,\\" and a circle around the name. It could have been Batman hitting a villain and seeing the word, \\"ZONK!\\" Still sounding like a lieutenant from Tennessee, Brad Pitt couldn't pass for Italian, if his life depended on it, and for a while, it did. \\"A-day-vree-derchi\\" sounds like an American saying the phrase for the first time.<br /><br />If you want to trip the light fantastic and sigh about what could have been in your wildest imagination for ending WW II, than this is for you. The performance of Herr Waltz was outstanding, and should garner him an Oscar. His French and Italian sounded extraordinary. His ability to play the disarming psychopath was phenomenal.<br /><br />The very best part of the movie, is Chapter I, and with that I will say, \\"Adieu.\\"ng you what went wrong with a football play--arrow pointed at an actor in a theater box, then the writing: \\"Martin Bormann,\\" and a circle around the name.

0385504225|3.0|I was a bit dissapointed with The Lost symbol and that is mainly because it was more predictable than Dan Browns previous books and the ending sucked. I was hoping it would blow me away like The Davinci Code or Digital Fortress, but I was sorely dissapointed. I am not saying its a terrible book, I just do not think it lived up to the hype. Read it if you like Dan Brown but not a must read.
B00049QQHI|3.0|The final scene gives a brief glimpse of why we should care about this rather routine drug addiction film-noir, when we see Jim Carroll giving a reading of his writings. However, that comes 90 minutes too late to save what should have been an interesting biopic. The loss is now more poignant, given Carrol's recent death at age 60. Songs from Carroll's four rock albums dot the soundtrack, and the script is based on the book Carroll wrote at age 17 depicting his grim youth as a Catholic school drug addict in NYC. If only watchers were advised of these accomplishments at the film's beginnings, and then given a tour backward in time, the movie would have benefited. As it is, it's a lot of puking and screaming and fighting and writhing as the characters search for dope and/or go through withdrawal.
B002W6Z0UK|5.0|I am a huge Lady GaGa fan and it was cool to receive this for Christmas.  I enjoy all of the songs on the cd.  From the first single \\"Bad Romance\\" to \\"Alejandro and \\"Monster\\".  Other ones that i enjoy are \\"Speechless\\", \\"Dance In the Dark\\", \\"Telephone\\" w/Beyonce and my fav on the cd. \\"So Happy I Could Die\\".  The only one that didnt really like that much was \\"Teeth\\".  It's okay but not something i'd really recommend as a one to listen to over and over.  7 out of 8 songs on here could easily be heard on the radio and would all make for excellent second singles with \\"Bad Romance\\" already out there.<br /><br />On a side note - I do hate that they \\"censored\\" this CD.  I wasnt aware of that til i first listened to it.  I'm more than old enough to make a decision whether i want it censored or not.  In the future no censoring a cd or at the very least.  Inform someone that the version they are buying is censored.
0385504225|2.0|The book started out with a great story, but descended into a truly predictable, boring and disappointing ending.
0811870987|5.0|this book brings birds into your home.  the little details of a bird's appearance you wouldn't ordinarily see in the field or at the zoo are here to discover.  some have eyelashes, others don't.  some have nice 'feet', others don't.  some have lovely beaks, others don't.  condors and vultures are quite pretty up close.  this marvelous book of detail and color lets one see for oneself the splendor of our winged friends.
0670021652|5.0|After seeing the huge popularity for Eat Prey Love, I was a little concerned that Elizabeth Gilbert's next book, Committed would not be as honest and enlightening as the first book.     Happily, Committed is another wonderful book that now continues her personal journey by examining marriage.     At turns funny, thoughtful, and fascinating, the book covers all aspects of marriage from both the writer's personal point of view and the wider worldview.    I found the early Christian views on marriage to be as fascinating as the Hmong peoples' view of marriage.  The best parts of the book though, are the writer's personal anecdotes from her life and from the stories of the various women in her family.   She always has a wonderful way of making the stories funny, insightful and natural.      Readers will not find this book to be an exact copy of Eat Prey Love.     Instead, it shows the next progression in her path to find peace with the concept of getting married again.   (Marriage was mandated by Homeland Security in order for her to stay together with her partner, Felipe)    The tone of the book is what you would expect from someone who had lived 3 more years of new responsibilities and new commitments past the experiences found in Eat Prey Love.         The book gave me a great appreciation of the complexity of marriage and an even greater appreciation of the strong personal commitment two people must work to try to achieve a strong marriage in these times.   In the preface, Elizabeth Gilbert states that she wrote the book as if it was being written directly for 27 close family and friends.     In this book, I think almost all people will find something to make them laugh and they will also find something new to learn about marriage.
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|i got enough out of this to know more about Wolverine's past.  As it's something that i've read in his comic book series and through the X-Men as well.  So for me that wasn't an issue.  It was good seeing them bring some stand characters in Deadpool, Agent Zero and of course Sabretooth played very good by Liev Schrieber.  Col. Stryker is his typical, mutant loving/hating self and is obviously using Wolverine to get his powers so that he can build the ultimate mutant killer.  The action is solid, intense and in your face which is just how it should be.  Wolverine is one of my favorite X-Men and this movie only serves to amplify that.<br /><br />It should also be noted that Deadpool played by Ryan Reynolds is getting his own spin-off through this movie.  Gambit is played very well by Taylor Kitsch (Friday Night Lights) and hope that they decide to go more into his back story as well.  Because he has a lot also (Rogue anyone?).  Overall i really enjoyed the movie and got what i needed to out of it.  I look forward to the second film that will start filming in 2011....can't wait.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|The product's quality is amazing, so also are the extras. I found especially interesting   the \\"Gene Roddenberry's View\\" extra. We can fell it watching the movie, but here we   can see that J.J. Abrams was heavily concerned in keeping the main spirit of Star   Trek, that is the technology's use in absolute benefit of mankind.
1554685133|5.0|If you haven't read Q & A by Vikas Swarup, you should. Even if you hated the movie that was based on it, Slumdog Millionaire, you should read the book (like most book/movie adaptions, the book is very different, and much better!).<br /><br />This book is unique and creative, and different than almost anything out there. The story itself could have been just another story of a boy in the slums of India, growing up without parents and ending up on a quiz show. And I probably would never have picked it up.<br /><br />What makes this book different is its structure: the whole format of the book is different than anything else I've read. Its premise is stated in the first few pages: boy from slums wins a billion rupees on game show and is arrested for cheating. How can a boy with no education know the answers to questions most people in India don't know?<br /><br />The rest of the book is structured by the game show: each chapter is a slice of the boy's life, followed by the question. Of course, each answer comes from the experiences of his life.<br /><br />Unlike the movie, the book doesn't follow a chronological timeline. It jumps back and forth through his life, with few threads throughout so it's almost a series of vignettes about his life that you might be tempted to think have no bearing on each other at all. In this way, it's easy to read, quick, certain sections more interesting than others, but all like pieces of a puzzle.<br /><br />And the end... BAM! Just when you think it's just a story about his life.... maybe a commentary on the game show industry or on poverty or a referendum on how humans treat each other... it suddenly becomes something much greater. The threads of the story-line, all seemingly random, come together in a WOW moment.<br /><br />Swarup could have written this book with a traditional chronological structure, but my guess is the book might never have been picked up. What makes it fantastic - what gives it that WOW factor in the last few pages - is it's uniqueness in the way it uses time and the way time is less important than the quiz show format. It's brilliant.e and the way time is less important than the quiz show format. It's brilliant.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|I've decided to buy this DVD when I saw it at a theater.  I love the first 10 minutes of story (a memory of the old man), I love the characters (especially you can't help loving the dogs!!), and I love how it ended.  In DVD, you get extra stories and also you get to watch an adventure of animators going to real \\"Paradise fall\\" to make a movie.  That was soooooooooo great!  You can see how much effort they put into making this movie and you get to see which scenes were inspired by original scenery.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|as we all know Season 3 leaves us with Gibbs gone from his position as the head of the NCIS team.  He's out of the fold but comes back in a case by case basis for the first few episodes.  As Tony is in charge of the team since Gibbs has been gone and isn't really too keen on giving that position back.  Among them being Ziva gets framed for murder when a bombing takes place while she's out on the town.  It only takes another episode or two and Gibbs is back and running things.  All the actors/actresses come together to make this show what it is.  A throughly engaging, story driven and all around fun show to watch.<br /><br />It just clicks from episode to episode with various cases in need of solving and a couple that delve deeper into the inner workings of the Director.  As she has a history with one of the criminals that the team is trying to apprehed.  The fourth season of NCIS continues to roll on and bring us excellent stories.  I'm looking forward to checking out the next couple seasons on DVD very soon.  Keep the show going it is one of the better and more interesting shows out there.
159102594X|4.0|...that's how Joe Abercrombie describes Logen Ninefingers, one of the central characters to this first book in 'The First Law' series. I'm inclined to agree.     'The Blade Itself' was a refreshing read for this jaded speculative fiction fan. Fantasy is my first love in terms of genres and it's hard to find something that piques your interest in the Mass Market Sea on which long-term genre readers often find themselves hopelessly adrift.     Why do I like it?     1. Complex characters. None are perfect. A few you will find yourself relating to. Some will make you cringe. Others you will want to slap (or impale on the pointy end of a suitably sharp object). All of them are credible.   2. Good world building. Yes, it's another place that's reminiscent of Medieval Europe. Yes, some will call it ye olde sword and sorcery teritory. The only problem is, the magic and spirits in the world are dying, so this isn't a book where every problem is solved from within the sleeve of an all-powerful wizard's robe. Prepare for far more sword than sorcery. If that's your thing, you'll have no problems with Abercrombie's world.   3. Dialogue. Hallelujah! You will believe what is coming out of Abercrombie's characters mouths. And whilst `The First Law' series is shaping up to be gritty, rather than fluffy (like a lot of the offerings out there these days), it's not without humour. If you don't end up laughing out loud here and there you'll at least be wearing a wry smile at some stage.   4. Intriguing plot that balances just enough action with character building, backstory and political machinations to keep the story rumbling along amidst the intricacies.     So why not five stars?     I wouldn't say 'The Blade Itself' is self-contained perfection. In terms of style, it's very well written but there is just a hint here and there (small instances of repetition, for example) that remind you this is Abercrombie's first book and he will continue to mature as he masters his voice (and it should be a great, booming one - I already love that Abercrombie doesn't have an adjective addiction).     Also, five star books for me are clear standouts in their own right, even if they're part of a series. Think Stephen King's `The Gunslinger' or George R. R. Martin's `A Game of Thrones'. Instead, `The Blade Itself' feels like a book concerned with fleshing out the characters and laying the foundations for future adventures. But I like that kind of stuff, so if the rating system allowed, I still would have given it more than four, though not quite the holy grail of five stars.     By the end of The First Law series, that may change, though I'm certainly looking forward to the ride!     My 'where it's at' rating: 4.2 / 5     @@@@ Plot   @@@@ Pace   @@@@ World   @@@@@ Characters   @@@@ Style
B00009AOBI|4.0|It's the classic story about youngsters in love. Boy and girl go to camp. Boy impresses girl with wit and intelligence. Girl falls in love. Boy falls in love. Boy's face looks like someone fried it in a chunk off of John Merrick's lower back.    Very quality movie. Also, re: Laura Dern: I'd tap it.
B002VPE1AM|1.0|Stunning sure; revolutionary, absolutely. Pomp does not a movie make.     Avatar was one of, if not the most, predictable movies I have ever seen. (Not the worst, that honor still belongs to Wanted.) I really do believe in the main message of this movie - It IS wrong to steal and destroy someone's home. This is not a new theme. It has and probably will be done over and over again, but it's not this that I find lacking. The story is, as I said, completely predictable, with stereotyped characters and little development; not to mention incredibly long winded. An hour in, I was already twitching in my seat. Then, of course, there are the heavy-handed, ultra-environmental messages and the Mother Goddess junk, with which I won't even begin to bore you. (To be honest, I could have even forgiven this stuff.)    There is nothing new under the sun. Every story takes something from somewhere else, but I still need it to wow me. I can't in good conscience tell someone to drop $10 and 3 hours of life to see screensavers, however beautiful they may be. I've seen films made for pennies compared to this, and been left excited, entertained, and satisfied. This movie gave me none of these things. A good, compelling story is always going to win the day over special effects and money, in my book anyway.
B000JLTRIG|5.0|for the Charmed Ones and the series as a whole.  Piper, Phoebe and Paige continue in their quest to have a normal life all the while battling demons both physical and their own inner demons.  A special quest from Phoebe's past comes in to \\"help\\" in an episode.  When one of the Charmed Sisters goes down in the fight, literally.  Leo continues his battle with his own feelins and powers as he's brought into the fold of the group known as the \\"Avatars\\".  They are out to rid the world of evil completely by remaking it.  He gains new and profound powers while trying to convince the Charmed Ones that this is in their best interest.<br /><br />That is a task in of itself and Paige meets up with our favorite inspector from the FBI (Kerr Smith) and they hit it off.  He has own interests in this but works together with the Charmed ones through several episodes this season.  I believe that Season 7 is one of the better ones in the Charmed series.  An excellent series in its own rights, i miss this one not being on TV anymore.  But regardless it doesnt change a thing.  I love the Charmed series without question.
B001DMJ9R4|1.0|Yet another concert DVD that depends on 40-50 camera edits (shots) per minute.  If you like that style of music DVD, this one is for you. Pretty good set list  and sound is good. The CD is ok for what it is.     R.I.P.  Jimmy 'The Rev' Sullivan - you will be missed.
B0025KVLTC|5.0|The Beatles revolutionized music. They took influence from earlier rock and roll greats like Buddy Holly, as well as innovating themselves. Quite simply popular music was changed with the enormous success of The Beatles. They made six albums before Revolver and with each one the Beatles' own writing became more sophisticated. George Harrison in particular comes into his own on this album, with three songs, \\"Taxman\\", \\"Love You Too\\", and \\"I Want To Tell You\\", my personal favorite. Paul McCartney's Eleanor Rigby is an absolutely beautiful piece of music. The string section is beautiful and sounds like a film score from a film for that time. Ringo Starr sings lead on the silly but classic \\"Yellow Submarine\\". John Lennon's \\"Tommorow Never Knows\\" ends the album with music unlike ANYTHING anyone was making in 1966. Three of Lennon's songs were removed from the original US pressing and placed on another album. They are \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" a song about Lennon preferring to stay in bed, \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\", and \\"Doctor Robert\\". Unfortunately, due to this removal, the album did not gain as much of a status as a great like Sgt. Pepper's or Rubber Soul. With the issue of the album on CD in 1987, its status as a classic grew and many people call it their favorite Beatles' album, including myself.     This 2009 remastered edition has great sound. Unlike many newer remasterings, the sound has not been completely brickwalled and overcompressed. It is louder then the older, tinny-sounding CD, but not in a way as to destroy and distort the sound. This was the first Beatles' album, in my opinion, to have a very good stereo mix. The early albums feature a bit too much separation for mine and many others' liking. The packaging is very well designed and is a digipack. The booklet has historical and recording notes, as well as pictures from the period of the group. The CD face replicates a 1960s Parlophone LP. The back cover replicates the UK LP sleeve (Long Play 331/3 RPM, Emitrex Record Cleaner, etc.) It's all very nice looking. I highly recommend this new 2009 remaster, either to replace your old 1987 disc, or especially if you don't have a copy. It's an essential album!
B0009P66TK|5.0|I ordered this watch for myself on Christmas morning (didn't get what I wanted from family).  Received it the following Tuesday.  What a nice watch!  Being left-handed, it never occured to me to buy a left-handed watch.  The quality is very good, with nice, heavy leather strap.  Nicely finished and solid, easy to use stems.  Easy to read dials.  Very satisfied for the price.  A Bargain.
B002V091IO|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I became a big fan of Nicholls with his first novel (A Question of Attraction -- originally titled \\"Starter for Ten\\" with its U.K. edition.) I was a little letdown by his second -- The Understudy, which was fun, but not quite as good as his first. This book exceeds his first. He takes a great device -- following the lives of one couple on the same day over a period of 20 years -- and does a masterful job of storytelling with it. We go from the couple's idealistic college days -- they meet on the day of their graduation -- all the way into their late 30s, with all the physical and emotional changes that come during that timespan. We see the career missteps along the way, and all the various relationships they have while still remaining friends -- and the woman, Emma, always secretly in love with Dexter Mayhew, who has more than a few wild oats to sow before he realizes the woman he should be with is the one who's always been his best friend. The writing is absolutely marvelous. The dialogue is absolutely terrific -- the couple have a teasing/kneedling way of talking to each other and the reparteee between them remains funny and fresh throughout even though the novel is long -- 435 pages.<br /><br />To say much more would be to give too much away. But if you like insightful books about relationships that can touch all of your emotions, this is the book for you. I think structurally the way Nicholls manages to take you on an extraordinary trip from the first page to the very last is a tour de force.<br /><br />I had to buy this from amazon/uk because it was available in Britain a year before it became available in the United States, but I'm so happy I got it. This is definitely a book I will re-read several times -- and I hope Nicholls continues to have a prolific career.

B001OQCV2O|3.0|This was a disaster movie so when I went to see it I had to ignore all my knowledge on well anything to do with earthquakes and earth tectonics in general.    The storyline was the end of the world...and yes actually that part of the movie was good, the special effects were the reason I wanted to see it on the big screen but a number of things put me off:     1. The characters were dreadful, really who came up with them?     a woman, ex-husband , 2 kids and new husband yay original but they were so annoying, no real detail or any sort so no one (well I didn't) have any attachment to any of them.  The Russian guy was ok but again too little info on them. Too bland and boring.     2. Storyline (I don't mean the main part disaster movie so that explains itself) the storyline or lack of with the characters, I mean it was far too predictable I find most movies that way these days. Also a limo surviving all that ?   I don't want to give anyway any real major pieces but the end...     one word - Sad in a way that makes you want to turn it off (if watched again once all the major disasters have taken place)     One will have no trouble remembering its a movie and I actually laughed as earthquakes tore the place apart as no way anyone could take this film seriously.    I think if you are looking for entertainment it gives it to a point then well becomes Sad....    If you can see if as comical and throw all your own logic out the window then you might enjoy this movie.    All the stars here are for the special affects after that it has not got much else although it did get to the stage I hoped most disaster movies would get to the annihilation of the world (is that not all the reason we want to see these).
B000FA5TTW|4.0|I wanted to read prior to seeing the movie and did not realize that the  thoughts of Heaven would weigh so deeply with my soul...<br /><br />Learning to accept loss is normally one dimensional.  Not for me anymore.  This read made me ponder the souls of the dearly departed and how it must be difficult for them to let go as well..<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone that has lost a love...
B001R4MEYI|5.0|Just for the record, I am a new fan of Mastodon, and this is the first album I bought by them. It is a brilliant piece of work, from beginning to end. I bought it because I was looking for something new, and I'd heard great things about it. The music is just layer after layer of metal brilliance. I just don't know what else to say. It has to be taken as a whole, like a movie or a book. Beautiful.
0061766089|5.0|I will be brief: if you like conceptual books, this one will make you stop and think. If you like immediately actionable guidelines, grab another title.  This book provides insights into IDEO's methods (observation, prototypes, experiments, brainstorming), and this in itself is pretty interesting.   I was amazed when Brown closed the loop and showed that the Toyota Production System is based on the same principles as \\"design thinking\\": observation of gemba, strong emphasis on the human side of business, constant experimentation, good common sense reasoning.
0634014331|5.0|This is the book to get, if you're interested in Hammond Organs, although it's more geared toward the musician.  Dave Limina gives a very thorough history of the development of this instrument and how to play it. After describing the technical part of the organ, he uses music charts of well known Jazz and Blues songs along with some keyboard exercises. On each chart he has a diagram of the drawbar settings used to get the sound which you can hear on the accompanying CD. Dave and his band play two tracks on each tune; one track has the full band and the other a mix-minus where you can play along with just the band. I've seen nothing better on the subject.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|Love this movie!!!  There is some adult innuendo, but nothing I would worry about.  Good movie for the whole family!
B002T9H2L0|2.0|Frankly it is just boring.  There are a couple of clever scenes, but they are not worth slogging thru the whole mess.  I finally gave up and turned it off when they started speaking Italian.  I'm sure the ending was spectacular, but I couldn't stick it out that long.
B002RSDW80|5.0|This movie is so cute! Meryl Streep does a fantastic job of portraying Julia Child. It makes you want to learn to cook like Julia. I'm not going to lie... I bought \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking: Volume I\\" immediately after watching this. It's really a good movie, I recommend it.
B00005JNJV|4.0|Before I bought this, I'd seen it a couple times, and I'd gotten the Dark Knight for Christmas, so I thinght, why not buy Batman Begins? Even though the Dark Knight is haled as like, \\"the best Batman movie ever\\". I say, Batman Begins is a good movie, and it made the Dark Knight possible, it breathed life in to the dusty rotting bones of the Batman franchise, (I've heard that somewhere else, just thought it was cool). Anyway, this movie is good. It gives the origin story of Batman and how Bruce's parents died. It gave you two really cool villans, Ra's Al Gul and the Scarecrow, and it was a good origin story. Although it's not quite as good as the Dark Knight, it stands alone as a good Batman movie.
B002SJIO5E|1.0|the only one movie that i keep fast forward all the time.  I can't find the other one so far.  My advice is:seriously, don't consider buying the movie \\"district 9\\", and not even worth renting.  Don't waste your time and money, there are tons of good movies out there.
B00002438V|5.0|Richter plays Dvorak Piano Concerto with warm affection and admirable technical polish. The way he captures the rapt serenity of the slow movement is simply magical. The outer movements glow with poetic beauty and rich tonal colours.     Wanderer-Fantasy, played with penetrating tone and uncompromising technical refinement, receives Lisztian rendition; not a hint of sentimentalism, but radiant with transcendental beauty.     Relatively good stereo recordings, beautifully remastered.
B00008PX8P|5.0|When I put Disc One of this flippin' awesome set in my laptop, the sound that issued forth from my speakers was a cacophany of appalause, and then the Hammer of the Gods began playing, and I've never had so much fun with a DVD ever, as in my life ever.<br />I've loved Led Zeppelin since I was a kid, but I respect and enjoy them more than ever. Between Robert Plant's unmatched vocals, to Jimmy Page's legendary guitar, to John Bohnam's hammering drums, to Jon Paul Jones' insane bass. This DVD made me experience the Led Zeppelin live. I give it a 5 out of 5, you MUST BUY if you're a Led Zeppelin fan
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|This is my all-time favorite album. Every song is amazing, especially \\"The Kill\\". Jared Leto's voice is beautiful and he has the genius song-writing skills to make him and his band just about perfect. :)
0316017922|5.0|This is an interesting perspective conducted by the Author, in order to explain his point of view about the factors which would concurr to the blossom of success. I think it is useful to assist in broadening our way of thinking in respect to such theme.
B000QIYPB6|4.0|This is a story of a young man who has committed a pointless murder.  Monsieur Meursault tells his own story of a young man living a comfortable life in Algiers.  He drifts through life, working everyday at his office job and enjoying the pleasures of life: smoking, eating at restaurants, dating his girlfriend Marie, swimming at the beach, and people watching.  He is a easygoing, untroubled fellow who lives in the now and is not concerned about the past or future.      His mother dies in a home for aged persons and he travels to attend her funeral.  He feels no grief but just observes the proceedings of the funeral and then journeys home for a weekend of swimming and going to movies with his girlfriend, Marie. Marie wants to get married and he agrees; but when she asks him if he loves her, he says no, but he will marry her if she wants to get married.  He doesn't seem to have any deep feelings or emotions.  He has no ambition or direction.  He is a sensual, feeling, person who likes to observe others.       He is kind to people like the neighbor who has just lost his dog.  He inadvertently becomes involved in scheme of a pimp named Raymond whom he has befriended to punish the pimp's girlfriend. This leads to Monsiuer Meursalt senselessly killing the girlfriend's brother.  He is imprisoned and tried for the crime.  Oddly enough, he is prosecuted more for his amoral character than the crime he has committed. While lying in his cell, waiting for either his execution or appeal, he continues to think only of himself, not worrying about dying, just watching, feeling and observing the things around him.       Mersault is an honest, but shallow and ordinary man who is also an atheist.  He believes only in what he can see.          I liked this book although it was sad and bleak.  The plot is very simple and the writing style is very smooth and expressive and interesting enough to keep you reading until the end. It was interesting to read about what can go wrong when a person just drifts along with life.
B0029LHW68|5.0|I loved \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" & didn't think they could top it. Thank God I was wrong! A unique sound, which is so refreshing. Jared Leto is a genius! :)
B001MW0J2O|2.0|This album has a few interesting sounds, but not much in the way of music. Try puting a few more hooks and melodies that are pleasing to the ear mixed in with the wall of Noize. I ordered this album along with embryonic by the flaming lips, little too much experimentation going on here.

B002U3A438|4.0|This is great record. everything was delieverd on time and in even better condition then what was described.
B0031Q0XCA|5.0|Very original movie. Many story telling methods put together, Black and white, interrupted time line, dream sequences, fantasy scenes, and narration just to name a few. This should be too much but just works so well.<br /><br />Soundtrack is different and good. Zooey Deschanel does some vocals she & him as artist track I think. J G Levitt can sing too.<br /><br />This is a Fox Searchlight film. A corporate backed independent film company that puts out good movies. Go figure. Wrestler Juno Garden State to name a few they put out.<br /><br />Zooey is as cute and interesting as ever. Levitt is becoming one of the best working younger actors out there. His script choices are varied and good. This from a guy that started on an inane TV comedy and through his choices made a place for himself. As in the movie chance played it's part I bet, but he can act. Well. He was great in [[ASIN:B000QFCD8Q The Lookout]]<br /><br />As it was happening I still couldn't dislike Zooey's character. The story was deeper than I expected. Levitt's buddies are a riot. Not a bad performance in the whole movie. Best movie I've seen in a while. Levitt keeps getting better. No type cast for him.

B000UR9T7I|5.0|Loved this movie before I saw it on blu-ray, loved it even more after viewing it on blu-ray.
B000SJJCX4|3.0|I've had Boss, Korg, and Artec pedal tuners before this one. I've had my entire pedalboard stolen 4 times now. I just got tired of buying $100 tuners that weren't even true bypass. I've had 4 of these units. They get the job done. They don't register very fast but once you use it for a bit, you get a feel for how to get the best from it. If you need a tuner now and are strapped for cash, this is a working alternative to the TU-2. Just don't be disappointed when its not quite up to the quality of a Boss, Digitech, Korg. If you can afford it, by all means get something that will last longer. My first TU300 lasted me just a few months before it crapped out, but for the price, I can't complain much. This is not a good touring solution. Its plastic for crying out loud. The build quality is pretty flimsy.
B001OQCV60|4.0|As Dr. Watson (Jude Law) plans to move out of the home he shares with Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) and dissolve their partnership, a piece from their last case comes back to haunt him. Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong), sentenced to hanging for the murders of young women in association with cult practices, seemingly rises from the grave after his death was overseen by Dr. Watson. With Lord Blackwood's black magic ties sending British commoners into a frenzy, Holmes must find the truth behind Blackwood to return peace to England and clear his dear friend's name.    Sherlock Holmes is a hard character to pin down. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle seemed to be unconcerned with continuity when it came to his famous detective, and as a result Holmes has continuously changed throughout his novels and it's many adaptations. When Holmes first appeared in a novel, Doyle wrote him as a detective lacking in general knowledge, but later gave him a plethora of knowledge. From there even more inconsistencies in Holmes's character exist at times he's lazy at others he's energetic and industrious, emotional and at others he's full of emotion, and so on. When Holmes finally reached the screen (particularly with 1939's The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes), though, he was pretty much defined as an upperclass no nonsense brilliant detective with a corn cob pipe and wearing a deerstalker hat who uses smarts instead of brute strength, and Watson as his larger and inferior accomplice. With the new Holmes adaptation, though, the filmmakers opted to follow the source material a bit more faithfully. So how does this new adaptation stand up to prior adaptations of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's character?    I'm not sure if the new Sherlock Holmes will make you forget about Basil Rathbone, Nigel Bruce, or all the others who protrayed Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson before, but it does a great job of defining the duo for a new generation. Guy Ritchie, best known for his neo-gangster flicks Snatch and Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, injects Sherlock Holmes with a shot of adrenaline moving the movie along at a cheetah's pace that at the end of nearly two and a half hours makes you wonder where the time has gone. One of the more controversial things that Ritchie brought back to the character of Holmes was his abilities as a street fighter and martial artist. In the books Holmes was a brawler at times, but wasn't portrayed that way in the adaptations that came after. With the way that Ritchie does it it's understandable that Holmes is a fighter. In the first scene we meet Holmes he is about to take out a guard to find Lord Blackwood, and as he observes the man he finds the guard's weaknesses, and before he steps out of the shadows he formulates a step by step plan to take the man out before doing so in the same manner he just planned. Not only does this give an explanation for such a change in the character, but it also shows us just how this great detective thinks and what we can expect of him.    Naturally, the movie is really about Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, and they carry their characters superbly. We've come to expect great things from Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law and they never let us down in this movie. Robert Downey Jr.'s performance as Sherlock Holmes is never over the top, and is even slightly understated. We completely buy that Downey is Holmes and that he is this highly intelligent detective. We also feel Holmes's disappointment at losing Watson, even if the emotion is bubbling underneath rather than lying naked on the face of the character. Law does a great job at playing the straight man to Downey's somewhat odd Holmes. You really get the feeling that Watson is the glue that holds Holmes together, but his exasperation with Holmes at times is palpable even though you also feel that hidden feeling that Watson doesn't want to leave Holmes behind, and may even be worried about where Holmes would end up without him. The chemistry between the two leads isamazing, and ups the \\"bromance\\" level of these two leads as we watch them bicker like an old married couple.    The film isn't without it's flaws though. Rachel McAdams is criminally underused as Irene Adler, and isn't completely fleshed out. While this makes for great suspense as you try to figure out exactly what her game is throughout the movie, I still feel as though she could have been written better. Mark Strong's Lord Blackwell is also underwritten, and this would typically be okay considering that his character is supposed to be mysterious and hard to pinpoint, but the problem here is that the underwriting leaves him feeling not as menacing as I feel he should have been. Also, Ritchie's frenetic camera work can at times make it hard to follow the more high octane action sequences and knockdown drag out fights. Also the writing leaves you with the inability to be able to figure out some of the mysteries on your own, which is part of the fun of watching an old school detective mystery.    All in all though, this movie is a great mystery action movie. I highly recommend it if you, like me, are getting tired of the highly scientific mystery stories that have been bombarding the media as of late, or if you're just looking for a highly intelligent thriller/ action movie. Personally, I'll be owning this movie the moment it comes out on DVD and I can't wait for the inevitable sequel that will be coming later.    4/5
159413300X|5.0|This book is on the line of the previous books by Lauren. It's hihgly entertaining, funny and really advisable. You can have a journey with the three main characters through a hole year where amazing and challenging things will happen to them. All in the NY atmosphere. What else can you ask for?
B000OVLBGC|5.0|This movie will either get you involved and interested or not.  If it doesn't work for you, then it will be long (very long), boring, and probably pointless.  That said, this movie got me big time and this appeal is more on a gut level than on an intellectual level.  My gut level response is surprising, because this is not a flashy movie with lots eye candy and exciting twists.  In fact, the whole movie is subdued (on purpose) in color and tone.      Like the Stasi portrayed in the movie, Lives of Others plods along at its own pace. But with the plodding plot, there is an underlying tension that never lets up.  We start watching the movie from a naive point of view, not understanding the hidden power and ruthlessness of the Stasi.  But we learn fast.  As the movie progressions, we realize how mindless and dangerous the Stasi obsession with control and surveillance can be.    Lives of Others is a tense melodrama with most of the dramatic emphasis on the characters.  There are gregarious and stoic Stasi bureaucrats doing their jobs with no regard to the people they crush.  There are also victims and there are heroes.  It was the unlikely hero that riveted me to the screen.  How does one change a lifetime of beliefs and practice to make a change?  What price does one pay for this?  This was the message I got from the movie, and its impact stayed with me for many days after watching the movie.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|Am I reviewing the movie or the physical disc? The movie is a Trekkie's dream. I used to manufacture CDs, so I can say the physical disc is perfectly acceptable.
B0015DROBO|2.0|Aside from the possible 'translation' issues, this novel at times becomes painful to read due to its slow pace. And what is going on with those bizarre 'statistic headings' before each chapter? As if this is some documentary and the author is trying to be an activist of sorts. I fail to see how this book was such a big seller. I still see it on the front shelves of many bookstores across the U.S.(europe notwithstanding), and everytime I'm boggled.<br /><br />It's not a 'bad book', it's just very monotonic. In fact, I can tell by this 'review' I'm writing, that the book has temporarily effected the pace of my normal thought pattern... right now it's slow... this has got the be the most humdrum review I have written so far. Sorry if it doesn't help.<br /><br />I'd just say, unless you get this book for under $5, no under $3 USD, or the equivalent in Kronors or euros, don't get it. Sorry, and godspeed...
B0019LY5IM|2.0|For a person who loves Lost, having the new DVD cause read problems is very disappointing. For Xmas this year I bought myself a new BlueRay player and recieved the Lost-5 pack as a gift. The BlueRay works with other disks but my Lost set, well, often gets lost. This reminds me of shipping damaged MS-Halo games. Anyone else experiencing tracking issues? PS: I love Lost.
B002QW7ALM|3.0|If I had to classify this film, it would be [[ASIN:B00011V8IQ Alien (The Director's Cut)]] with more gore or a toned-down [[ASIN:B001AGNMGC Event Horizon]].  Things get off to a good start, as the atmosphere is quickly and creepily established, with flickering lights and cramped crawl spaces, but the difficulties begin when people start talking.  Maybe it was the theater I was at, but at least half the time the dialogue was drowned out by sound effects, making it difficult to follow.  I will probably rent this when it comes out in hopes of understanding the dialogue better.
0385532458|3.0|The book is quite enjoyable.  I like that you can get through one story in a small amount of time.
B002WY65VU|4.0|Okay, I know that's not saying much, given it was the only movie of its type to come out last year, but that still takes nothing away from this film.  While this movie may be about four people struggling to survive in a world overrun with zombies, really it's about four people learning to tolerate and put up with each other long enough to come together in order to survive in a world overrun by zombies.<br /><br />And I think that's the appeal of this film, at least for me.  In most other zombie movies, all that matters is whether another individual is living or the living dead, but here it takes a little longer.  Another factor which appealed to me was the protagonist, a neurotic loner well-played by Jesse Eisenberg ([[ASIN:B002BFBAWO Adventureland]]).  His character is not the sort of person you'd expect to possibly be the last non-undead in the world, but because he is pretty much an Average Joe, it made it easier for me to root for him; besides, the alpha-male zombie butt-kicker part is left up to Woody Harrelson, who is constantly teetering on the verge of a violent psychotic outbreak (and his not being able to find some Twinkies isn't helping matters).<br /><br />All in all, this is film well worth seeing, considering it clocks in at less than 90 minutes.  Throw in a cameo by a well-know actor playing himself and a rocking opening song (Metallica's \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\"), and you got yourself a good candidate for a purchase.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|Lost is one of my favorite TV Series.  I've been collecting each season as they have been released.  I love all the extras they always include on the DVD's.

0803731094|5.0|This clever book, written in easy rhyme, is one of our very favorites.  My kids can recite it and even my husband loves reading this one to them!  I recommend it to anyone and can't believe I'd never heard of it until I picked it up by chance at the library one day.  You will love this book that teaches even being small and seemingly helpless is not a disadvantage when you're smart and clever!

0786868724|4.0|I'm torn between reading the entire book at one sitting and taking it slowly, in a little pieces. So far, the latter. I'm savoring the book like I did Tuesdays with Morrie. I'm enjoying the book immensely and finding it to be the perfect elixir for this time in my life.     Albom's writing is at once accessible, simple, but penetrating and insightful. Albom at his best and reminiscent of how we grew to love his writing in the first place. Fully recommend.
044654146X|4.0|I am not Jewish.  But this book is staggering in its exposure of the continuing injustice which has been the lot of the Jewish people for the last several centuries, the terrible cost of ideologically imposed myopia with accompanying bad political, economic and military policies.      Using vignettes from economic success stories, the book documents the performance of a people who have outperformed every other nation in building an economy and creating jobs and prosperity for citizens the majority of whom were evicted penniless from their own countries while the Arab nations around them have imposed vicious trade blockades, blizzarded them with rockets and sponsored worldwide campaigns about the injustice of lands seized by Israel in an unprovoked attack to obliterate it.  It documents an extraordinary litany of obstacles Israel has overcome to achieve this remarkable economic record and still outperform much less disadvantaged economies many-fold.     The book is adequate with the facts.  Numbers of patents granted to Israel vs other nations, number of new companies listed on stock exchanges, numbers of new jobs created, total dollars exported per capita, etc. are irrefutable. There are useful comparisons to other countries with proactive economic development such as Singapore, Korea, and UAE.    The book, however, is not a polemic or intended to embarrass anyone, any government, religion or ideology.  The authors' purpose is to identify why and how Israel has been able to achieve such literally unbelievable economic results (if you do not follow Israel closely, you will be amazed by what you learn in this book), particularly in light of the USA's current economic issues and performance in job creation.  The authors' conclusions are threaded throughout the work and provide ideas for public and private policy makers; but I finished wishing they had pulled their observations together for application outside Israel although that might have taken the authors too far from the fact and objectivity which characterize the book.    I think I am an optimist; but in the end the book left me pretty melancholy about us human beings.  Here is a sliver of a country with \\"the only receding desert\\", creating millions of jobs in impossible situations, integrating and employing disparate refugees from more than 100 countries at a pace and success rate unapproachable anywhere else, creating more patents and technological innovation than anywhere else in the world.  The US has a problem with immigration from Latin America and the loss of jobs and a poorly performing economy.  Israel's neighbors, i.e. most of the countries of the Middle East, have the same problems with very poor results, if any results at all. Is the world looking to this economic petri dish with admiration and curiosity?  No, seemingly most Muslims wants their obliteration.  No, the rest of the world is apparently happy to use whatever they succeed at if it can do so without offending Arab nations.  No, the US Congress and President seem bent on a course in the USA's current economic difficulties similar to the book's description of what had to be undone in Israel to achieve its current economic success.  Why can't we learn from Israel?  Why can't the Arab nations adopt and use the leanings of these people of the same if not similar ancestry and the same God?  Why can't our politicians look to countries with and without economic success for their policies?  Do religion and party trump history, logic, and statistics?  The book doesn't go there.    If we are to have a peaceful world, all nations will have to learn how to create and/or sustain economies which provide satisfying jobs for their citizens. This book should be in the library of anyone curious about the formula to achieve that.

B002NWRMVS|5.0|I've listened to this album through more than 10 times. It's a laid back alt rock kind of sound. It doesn't jump up and bite you, but like most better albums, it grow on you with repeated listening. I like this better than her Diana Krallish music. highly recommended.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I love this movie and ordered it from Amazon. I was so disappointed when after waiting 3 weeks for it to arrive I was notified a credit was applied to my account - with no explanation of why the movie was not sent to me.  If you have never seen this movie - it is a holiday \\"must\\" for children of all ages.
B00008K7AM|1.0|Do you want to know how awful this movie really is? Well, imagine a large pizza that's covered in dead crickets, dead earthworms, and dead centipedes. Then imagine rotten frog legs and some disgusting pig feces wrapped in a tortilla. And then imagine a carton of milk that's been expired since the summer of 2002. So now, It's dinnertime, and this is the main course. So what's the point of all this? Well, personally, this is how I felt like when I was watching this poor excuse for a comedy. It felt like the entire movie was feeding me nothing but s***! The jokes are stale, the teenage girls were annoying as hell, and Rob Schneider.....well, he should just stay away from comedy. Why? Because he sucks at it! I will admit, though, that there are far worse comedies than this, such as Freddie Got Fingered and The Master of Disguise. But this one, The Hot Chick, is just plain bad.<br /><br />Grade: F
B000VBJEFK|2.0|First, the deleted scenes that consists of rough pencil sketches are horribly uninteresting.  But what killed this movie for me was the 2.35:1 aspect ratio.  I didn't pay attention to the 2.35:1 aspect ratio when I bought this blu-ray movie--incidentally the first blu-ray disc I have ever bought.  The preview captures on Amazon.com looks OK because they do not represent the true aspect ratio of the movie.  I have fond memories of the movie so I let this be my first blu-ray.  Unfortunately, even when viewed on a 50\\" wide screen, the the movie's menu, the attached game, and the movie's 2.35:1 ratio means I can't read the texts, and the movie doesn't seem to be all that good--maybe it has something to do with the fact that it feels like the movie's shown on a tiny monitor because it is so much wider than it is tall; so much blank space at the top and bottom of my widescreen, and no option to make it fit the screen. The TV's zoom button is not made for this since editing is required and not just simple zoom.  I feel like it has been a 1-star blu-ray experience, but I'll double it for whatever it's worth.  The aspect ratio is definitely a deciding point for all future movie purchases.
0545091020|5.0|#1 Hunger Games YA fantasy series. Katniss Everdeen is sixteen this Reaping day--the day when Tributes from all the districts of Panem--a post-apocalyptic country somewhere in future North America--are chosen. Tributes are children between twelve and eighteen, a boy and a girl from each district, who will fight to the death in a nationally televised (watching is mandatory) program called The Hunger Games. Sort of a reality show on steriods!Her name is in the barrel many times, so Katniss is totally shocked when her little sister Prim's name is chosen. She loves Prim more than anything, and thus invokes a rarely used rule and volunteers to take her place, knowing that this most likely means a death sentence for her as no one from district twelve has won the Games for years. Like the Olympics, the Tributes survive because of their sponsors, and when you come from the poor mining district, no one is interested in backing you.<br /><br />She and Peeta, the boy accompanying her from district twelve, are off to the Capitol, where their dictatorship is ruled from, to have a couple weeks of training before being sent into The Arena--where the terrain, the wildlife, the weather and available resources are controlled by the powers that be. More than anything they want an exciting show, so if the various Tributes were to just isolate themselves, they would do 'something' to bring them together for confrontations. Implanted with tracking chips before being released, the Tributes know that they are being watched 24/7.<br /><br />I found this book gripping, compelling, horrifying and very difficult to stop listening to.  The characters were very well-drawn, and it wasn't long before you felt you knew Katniss inside and out and liked her despite her foibles. I cannot speak highly enough about this book and am very much looking forward to listening to the next one. The sad thing is, I find this whole scenario to be not as fantastical as it should be. This audiobook was skillfully read by Carolyn McCormick. A+McCormick. A+
B0026P3G12|2.0|I loved Susan Boyle's TV appearance as did my wife so I bought this album for her for Christmas. Should have expected but was shocked when I listened to this over-produced collection. The arrangements and the accompanying orchestra really over-shadowed Susan' pure voice. Very disappointed but my wife apparently likes it so the result was OK as a gift.
1401307450|5.0|I thought this was going to be your typical Rock 'n Roll autobiography when I first started this book.  By the time I finished, I realized the true talent this man has!  He's not only a great lyricist, but a great story teller.  You feel each & every one of his own heartbreaks & share in his joy.  He created such a gripping page-turner, I'd recommend this book to any music lover, whether they like RHCPs or not.  It's a true testament to the horrors of drug abuse & the passion & love for life this man has.  We are so lucky he's been able to get himself clean & stick it out with the rest of us.
0684824906|5.0|Wonderful writing - I really did have a hard time putting it aside and found myself looking forward to when I'd have the time to pick it up again.  The author uses personal correspondence from friends, family, colleagues, and others from the time period to create a nuanced and detailed portrait of Lincoln.  She also contrasts his early life with those rivals on his \\"team\\" to effectively show the strength of Lincoln's drive, intellect, character, and, of course, his unparalleled political genius.  A fabulous read that will leave you with a sense of gratitude for the sacrifices Lincoln and his family made to insure that the US remained one nation, indivisible.
B00005U2JL|4.0|I'm not the typical fan who gets all the videos & whatnot, but my husband got me this for the holidays this year.  We watched it a couple days later.  Such fun!  All the times I had seen him live were from this tour & after.  I'd love to see some earlier concert footage, more of what he describes in \\"Long Hard Road out of Hell\\".  If you've never seen Manson perform, this will be a great starting point, if you're an avid fan who sees him each time he's out touring, it's a great addition to your collection.
0307266303|3.0|This book starts off interesting, gets a little long winded, and finishes strong.  The author is a storyteller for sure, but scientist he is not.  If he would have spent more time discussing their journey and less time giving a one sided argument for the evolution of man, I would have enjoyed the book more.  It does give an interesting perpesctive to the ultra running community.  Having read Dean Karnazes's books, I appreciated his alternative perpesctive on them.  I also enjoyed the glimpse into the Tarahumara culture, although the view he takes is a little simplified.  All in all, the book is an interesting read, but not a running classic.

B00005NRO3|5.0|It's been two years since the horrid events in Woodsboro, and most of the survivors have tried to put the events behind them.  Reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) has written a book about the events that has been turned into the new movie Stab.  Opening weekend, two viewers are brutally killed in a theater in the college town where Sidney (Neve Campbell) and Randy (Jamie Kennedy) attend classes.<br /><br />Try as they might to ignore it, there is soon evidence that a copy cat killer is on the loose in their town.  With Dewey (David Arquette) back in the mix, the entire group of survivors have reunited.  Has one of them gone over the edge?  Or is someone out to get revenge on them?  Or maybe the killer has been inspired by Stab?  Will any of them survive long enough to figure it out?<br /><br />After the success of the first movie, it was rather obvious that a sequel would come out.  This one was rushed through, with only a year between movies.  At times it shows, with some elements feeling a little rehashed.  However, for the most part, this stands up well.  It is a continuation and not a complete copycat.  A few times the character's actions don't seem logical, but they set up some of the best suspense sequences of the film, so I won't complain too loudly.<br /><br />Like the first movie, there is a great balance of thrills and laughs.  Some of the lines are downright funny.  Yet there are moments that have me holding my breath even after I've seen them numerous times.<br /><br />Because the movie continues the story, we really get to see some character development with the returning cast.  Sidney especially grows a lot stronger over the course of this film.  I also like what they did with Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber).  Because I really do like the returning characters (even Gale), there is one death that still upsets me, but it did make the rest of the movie that much more intense.<br /><br />Yes, this is a rated R Slasher.  That means you get lots of violence and foul language.  Not my normal genre, but I know that when I sit down to rewatch it.<br /><br />This movie doesn't quite have the punch of the first one, but if you want an entertaining slasher, you can do much worse., but I know that when I sit down to rewatch it.    This movie doesn't quite have the punch of the first one, but if you want an entertaining slasher, you can do much worse.
B002LL13AM|3.0|in many respects this is a dogmatically conservative bach recording. the tempi are generally strict, though rubato is clearly available (Praeludium IV); the dynamics are generally flat (Praeludium I) though they can be expressively contrasted (Fugue IV). but there is a cumulative sense of thickness and monotony created by the near equality in dynamics and articulation across all voices and by pollini's preference to play everything rather loud and give chords (even within polyphonic passages) a nice solid thwack. fluent or \\"fingerwork\\" passages (Praeludium VI) produce a churning or grinding quality. there is great similarity between the tonal and dynamic lack of contrast in this interpretation and those of a standard harpsichord performance, except that pollini's tendency to flirt with the upper limit of the dynamic range too often creates a sense of stridency: even in the gently played Praeludium VIII, the trills pop out from the voices they ornament. i think part of the problem may be that the piano was too closely miked, which also means the performer occasionally audibly breathes (though this never a distraction). certainly pollini hits every note in tempo without breaking a sweat, and renders passages of crystalline precision where many other pianists lose their grip, but the refusal to take any voice into an expressive solo, and the indulgence of loud or mechanical  -- or loud and mechanical -- whenever the opportunity appears (as in Praeludium XV), produces a beautifully recorded, virtuosically performed but rather tense recital.
030738683X|5.0|Jane Austen's first novel is a delightful and witty satire of gothic literature, and is a paradigm of both her future genius and current youthful exuberance. While I would argue that Austen by no means condemns the genre itself nor the reading of it, she does artfully illustrate the foolishness of expecting such romantic extremes in real life, and in her own writing acknowledges the conventions of the genre that render it so identifiable. Like Austen's later work, Northanger Abbey is full of social commentary and astute observations as she leads you through a year of the life of Catherine Morland - the increasingly romantic young woman who finds herself in several less-than-gothic conflicts.<br /><br />Northanger Abbey is as charming the second and third time as it was the first. As a fan of both Austen's body of work and the gothic genre, I can't help but find myself enamored with this particular work. I do not hesitate to give Northanger Abbey my highest rating.
0790749556|5.0|Fred and Ginger, as always, are great; but it would also be a great injustice to overlook Irene Dunne's performance in this classic.  Her singing is first rate, her acting is excellent and, without a doubt, she is \\"lovely to look at\\".  All this---and Lucy too!
0930289234|2.0|Watchmen was recommended to me by several intelligent friends, and though I have been wary of the genre I figured I'd give the graphic novel a go. I saw the movie when it first came out, and I think that was detrimental to my reading of the original text. As printed material I found Watchmen to be surprisingly unappealing. The film seems to be very close to the original, but far surpasses the comic in terms of visual interest. The women were particularly disturbing, as the movie had lead me to believe they were supposed to be attractive, and not have .. mullets (yes, the original Silk Specter has a mullet in the text).<br /><br />I wish I had read Moore and Gibbons before seeing the film - I think I would have enjoyed it much more. As it stands, it was actually fairly slow-going for very little end reward.
B002VKE1K2|2.0|Another so called scary movie!! I rented this movie during the weekend,and by seeing the auidence reaction from this movie during the previews I thought that this would actually be a scary movie.    Horror movies are my favorite genre of movies, so I know a good horror movie when I see one. In my opinion this movie was not scary at all, all you had were the bedroom door slamming shut, and a few loud bangs at night. They tried to make it scary towards the end but for me it was to little to late. The ending I couldn't take serious because someone was even smilling at the end. I feel sorry for the people who actually paid ten bucks to see this crap at the theaters. One last thing Paranormal Activity did not deserve half the money that it made at the box office!!    Bottom line if you want to watch a movie by yourself and be scared rent or buy the \\"Strangers\\", \\"REC\\", heck even Animal Planets \\"Lost Tapes\\". But do not waste your hard earned money on this.
0142000671|2.0|One of the first things I noticed while reading Of Mice and Men was a sense of comfort on the part of the narration; the descriptions and character development seemed so natural that the sense of realism was undeniable. Although there is much that Steinbeck keeps to himself in terms of his main characters, I found Lennie and George to be well-rounded and honest - simple men trying to keep their heads above their water as they pursue (to different degrees) what qualified as \\"the good life\\" for two migratory farm hands.<br /><br />Much to my surprise, I had no real emotional response to the novel. I tend to be a very emotive reader, and more often than not will respond passionately to what I read. However, Steinbeck has left me feeling completely neutral; I was not particularly invested in the characters or events of the book, and found the conclusion neither satisfying nor disappointing. In the end I'm willing to consider this neutrality a positive result of the trial - I didn't hate the book, so I'm more open to reading something along the lives of Travels with Charlie, but I also didn't love it, so I doubt I'll be tackling The Grapes of Wrath anytime soon.
1416572287|4.0|I flipped through Quantum Physics for Dummies -- impenetrable. I selected pages at random from Quantum Mechanics Demystified -- nothing but equations and hieroglyphics.   But Chad Orzel explains things like wave-particle duality and the many-worlds hypothesis in terms that dogs can understand. And you and I, dear reader? We're the dogs.  I never took a physics class, and I don't really understand about \\"allowed states\\" and about how polarized-light wavelengths can vary horizontally and vertically.  But I can think like a dog -- so I know just what Orzel means when he talks about bunnies hopping up and down the grass while squirrels zigzag across it.   And because Orzel prefaces every chapter with a canine conversation -- his Emmy is a German Shepherd -- there are a lot of bunnies, cats and squirrels in this discussion of quantum basics.     One chapter explains that particles (and even large chunks of matter) can be in multiple positions at once, but that we can perceive only a sliver of multifaceted reality -- which leads both to the multiple-worlds hypothesis and to that Star Trek episode with the evil Spock wearing a goatee.  Despite the joking around, Orzel isn't always simple or clear; quantum mechanics is pretty dense stuff. He lost me, for example, somewhere around the Bell theorem for resolving the famous Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen paradox. (Well, famous among physicists, I guess.)  But the implications for proving that Einstein's idea was \\"brilliantly wrong\\" are profound: \\"Our universe,\\" Orzel says, \\"cannot be described by any theorem in which particles have definite properties at all times, and in which measurements made in one place are not affected by measurements in other places.\\"  Yet if that sounds scary -- everything's utterly random -- it also raises the prospect of phenomena like quantum computing, cryptography and teleportation (which Orzel describes, using one of his down-to-earth analogies, in terms of a fax machine).  With the Large Hadron Collider over in Geneva about to confirm the existence of the Higgs boson and supersymmetry, exciting discoveries are on the way.  So you'd better brush up on your quantum mechanics. You can talk to Emmy all about it
0385751893|4.0|John Boyne's young adult novel The Boy in the Striped Pajamas rightly deserves all of the high praise that lead me to read the work in the first place. Told from the perspective of a nine-year-old Nazi officer's son, the story describes life\\"on the other side of the fence\\" as Bruno struggles with a sudden move from Berlin to Auschwitz, the heavy military presence in his otherwise civilian life, and the meeting of an unlikely friend.<br /><br />The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is no less striking for its charming and simple naivety; indeed, the youthful ignorance and innocence is what makes the novel so endearing, and ultimately heartbreaking. Boyne shows his reader under what circumstances the Commandant of a concentration camp can be seen as a \\"good man\\", and the true difference between boys and families living on opposite sides of the fence.
0385504225|5.0|Dan Brown has once again made dance partners of the factual history and probable meaning of secret societies and suspense.  I learned even more than I knew I wanted to know about the early American forefathers masonic backgrounds, while tracking through the book a madman with a twisted understanding of all of that.  Suspenseful and enlightening, and close to home as well, being about our national history and monuments.  What more could I want?
0545128285|2.0|I am incredibly disappointed with The Tales of Beedle the Bard by J.K. Rowling. The book, presented as a collection of wizard fairy tales annotated by Albus Dumbledore, lacks the inventiveness of the children's novels that have made Rowling famous. The short tales themselves, which contain all the elements familiar from classic fairy tales, can be quite charming (I myself enjoy reading classic fairy tales, and Rowling's writing varies very little from the style and intent of classic collections). However, the \\"extensive commentary by Albus Dumbledore\\" is uninspired and does little to accentuate the collection or the past character of the headmaster of Hogwarts. While I am no Harry Potter fangirl, I did enjoy the original novels, and The Tales of Beedle the Bard does not live up to the imagination Rowling showed in her previous writing.

0545140315|5.0|It takes new-coming writer Elizabeth Eulberg no time at all to establish a lovable universe in her debut novel The Lonely Hearts Club. From the start, the reader falls in love with both her characters and her eloquent narrative tone. The novel begins with a very powerful hook, immediately drawing readers in to Penny's fascinating life. It begins in the middle of endings, of new beginnings, in the middle of a firmly established world that we very quickly get used to. It's amazing how fast paced this book is, fitting a lot of story into a limited amount of space. In this day, some novels just seem to take forever to start with the interesting plot material, so this was a welcome breath of fresh air. The novel is a catchy work, clearly demonstrating the uncomfortable dichotomy between boys and girls in the dating world. As cheesy as some of it is, the characters have a lot of life in them, with amazingly realistic interactions between them. The one word that keeps jumping to mind regarding this book is 'charming'. Everything about it is cutesy character development, from the writing to the cover. The ending follows the same adorable formula and does not disappoint readers. Fans of writers like Susane Colasanti will adore the seemingly simple and perfectly adorable cast of characters that make up this fantastic novel.<br /><br />Rating: 5/5
038533348X|3.0|I am glad this wasn't the first Vonnegut book I read. Had it been I probably wouldn't be enthusiastic about reading another. Fortunately, my first was Slaughterhouse-Five.   There are plenty of reviewers here who gave great, detailed synopses of the book, so I will skip that.   What I found good about the book was it's commentary on religion and, more specifically, the relationship between religion and political power (Papa and Bokononists/Bokonon). I also enjoyed the reactions John had to some of the absurd things people would say, especially on the plane. And the elevator scene was a riot, funny and thought provoking. Vonnegut is a master at providing us with funny and ridiculous characters, and there are some in this book (although not enough to make it a great book, but still enough to make it worth a read).   But...the book got slow in many places, and after a while it seemed almost like a chore to read. I enjoyed the message, but not the way it was told. If this is your first Vonnegut book please don't use it against him if you find it boring, many of his other books (like Slaughterhouse-Five) are awesome.

B00275EGX8|5.0|This movie was by far the best movie I saw in 2009, perhaps even the best of the decade.  This is not an arthouse movie, an indie flick, neither is it a movie that follows the same hollywood script: bad guy, good  guy, good guy kills bad guy.  The Hurt Locker shows the amazing bravery, incredible courage, and borderline insanity that Marines must show on the battlefield.  It does not take sides about the war but rather shows men, soldiers, who were sent to Iraq on a job, and who cannot possibly leave unscarred and unchanged, mentally and physically.  According to my Marine friends this is the most accurate war movie out there.  You will not be able to get it out of your mind for months afterward.
B002SJIO4A|5.0|District 9 is easily my favorite film of 2009 and one of the best films I've ever seen. It takes an almost forgotten theme of using science fiction to explore social issues as well as deliver invigorating entertainment. It's in-your-face in it's approach but never once did I think this film was preaching. It lets the story, action and characters tell a tale without trying to shove anything down your throat.<br /><br />The basic plot (as you know already) is about an alien ship arriving in South Africa and the social/political/military back-lash becuase of it. The story at first unfolds in a documentary style using mockumentary footage. This would've made a facinating story enough, but the movie takes it several steps farther and starts to slowly move behind the scenes to show the more humane story behind all the mock-interviews and news footage. I wont go into more detail but what unravels from this setup is an exciting sci-fi thriller packed with knock-out acting (particulary by lead Sharlto Copley), excellent special effects (with wonderful creature animations), and exciting action scenes.<br /><br />While I'd be satisfied with just the movie alone (and it looks suprisingly good on small-screen DVD), the single disc DVD actually comes with a three-part indepth look at the makings of District 9. It's probably not as involved as the double-disc or blu-ray editions but it's more than I'd expect from a single disc release.<br /><br />I really can't praise this film enough. It's got a strong DVD release which looks great and pushes the bar for Sci-Fi films to come. This is movie making at it's absolute best!
B000V6U80A|4.0|I'm not sure whether the composer(s) of this music acknowledges or is even conscious of the roots they're feeding from here, but it would be good to know if they were. Case in point: play the first few measures of \\"Ode to Simplicity\\" fast, with a little staccato, and you will find yourself playing the principal theme of Beethoven's \\"Tempest\\" Sonata (No. 17, Op. 31, No. 2). I'm not kidding.<br /><br />So, am I accusing this Secret Garden group with thievery? Well, it's no more than has been done by and among composers since Bach's time and maybe even before. Just because something is derived doesn't mean it's either criminal or defective -- I personally like much of the music presented here. Clearly, no one will mistake the musical quality of this group with Beethoven's middle period genius, though maybe the connection actually supports the effect this music delivers. I'm merely saying that some acknowledgement of that connection would help draw people toward the source, as from a river toward the ocean. I know folks, for instance, who were introduced to Bach's cello suites and other classical literature for that instrument after they had heard the boys of Apocalyptica; just as, decades ago, Ravi Shankar and classical Indian music suddenly became popular after George Harrison brought the sitar into the Beatles' output.
0316069906|5.0|This book contains a staggering set of viewpoints regarding the consumption of animals by humans. It starts off with the author's vacillating experience with vegetarianism but it's obvious pretty early on that the author is not going back to eating meat ever again. Written in the context of having to explain to his newborn son why they eat meat, the author approaches the topic with wit and respect. As 5-year vegetarian, I was curious to see if the author would reach a definite conclusion, and if they would tread any new ground. I've read a lot on the topic of animal welfare (and I highly recommend \\"Thanking the Monkey\\" for not just a look at how we treat the animals that become our food, but those we use for show at zoos, circuses, and as pets). This was still a fresh enough approach to me to make this one of my favorite books of the past several years. I'll be recommending it to others readily. The teaser posted in the New York Times by him on October 7, 2009 is a great way to determine if you want to read the rest of this book.<br /><br />The author really dug into this topic, too. Apparently, he's written quite a bit of fiction or semi-fictional novels, such as \\"Everything is Illuminated\\" (which eventually became a movie) but took a different turn in tackling a non-fiction topic. His writing style is quite accessible, and he's able to steer away from preaching for a good part of his writing. He does this by offering space to various animal ranchers and farmers in an effort to present some contrasting views. Their contributions appear as multi-page rebuttals or explanations in the final third of the book. He doesn't exactly have the \\"other side\\" fully represented in these cases, but in his defense he didn't get much of a response when he tried multiple times with a certain popular meat purveyor. What was especially impressive was that the last 40+ pages of the book are his reference notes. It's like a bibliography on steroids. Not only does he cite references, but he often elaborates on them with additional statistics or how he applied them to the book. I thought that this was going the extra mile in terms of research because he at least laid out his thinking behind his use of the information he'd gathered. At the very least, he's being more open than I've come to expect with respect to references.<br /><br />The author seems to have done the legwork here in his investigation regarding animal welfare (which he leans towards using more than the typical \\"animal welfare\\" terminology thrown around). It's worthwhile to note that this book touches exclusively on the ethics behind the eating of animals, and does not relate in any way to any health-related aspects. (For that, I'd highly recommend reading \\"The China Study\\" or any of Dr. McDougall's online newsletters at [...]) I've actually just finished reading the book but I am going to take a second pass through it just to jot down so many of the great statistics that he gathered so that I always have them on hand. It's important to note that the author's viewpoint is largely influenced by the ethics of eating animals as they are raised and slaughtered today. That is, he's taking his stance mainly because of the fact that 99% of the meat we have access to is factory-farmed. While it's hard for me to review this with a perfectly open mind because I am already a vegetarian, I still think that if I were coming into this as the omnivore I used to be that it would actually be enough to get me to reduce or eliminate my meat consumption. Essentially, that's what Eric Schlosser's \\"Fast Food Nation\\" did for me.n elaborates on them with additional statistics or how he applied them to the book.

0312330537|4.0|As a novel this is as marvellously sprawling and complex as India itself. Gregory Roberts has clearly drawn on his own life experiences to write this book - a short biography appears in my copy about his life. The novel follows the life of 'Lindsay' the assumed name of an Australian criminal on the run from a high security Prison in Australia. Having got to New Zealand he assumes a false passport in the name of Lindsay and ends up in India, in Mumbai. There he meets Prabaker, an Indian guide Lindsay trusts immediately, and with just cause - and soon after Karla. Karla is a western woman, her reasons for being in Bombay are unknown and unexplained, but Lindsay falls in love with her at first sight and seeks to stay longer.    These two relationships are the foundation for this novel which follows Lindsay, or 'Lin' as he becomes called, through the slums of Bombay, its prisons, its heroin dens, the colour and smells of the place and the local Mafia - on to Afghanistan with the idealistic Mujahadeen fighter and philosopher, Khaderbhai, and then back to Mumbai.    What lifts this novel is that it is well written and observed. The conversations are at times hilarious, Lin/Greg observe excellent comic timing and keeps the pathos at a limit.    In fact I opened this book and was immediately hooked - I thought wow and sat down and read the first 300 pages with barely a thought for anything else. Yet I started to lose interest in it, and finally by the time Lin was fighting for the righteous cause in afghanistan I was starting to skim pages.     Part of this was that I lost interest in the whole 'Karla' issue. His intense desire for her was generally unrequited - or not really returned - it was almost reflective of Dr Zhivago and teh Lara obsession and I wondered if Roberts was intentionally trying to mimic that.    The relationship between Lin and tne indians such as Prabaker, and Johnny Cigar was interesting, and really held the novel together for me. I found that the mostcompelling and driving force of the book, the cultural differences which reflected how they reacted, and what they did. And their reactions often surprised me,for instance when there is a fire in the slum, or when Lin invites a few of his trusted friends to join him in a business he has.    So, while the first part of teh novel was intense, I found it lost my interest towards the end. However overall I would definitely recommend this. A powerful book which I am certain will be enjoyed.

B002ZTQVGQ|3.0|Ponyo has about the most beautiful animation I have ever seen in a movie. It is simply stunning. It seems to live in a world somewhere between Anime and Japanese woodcuts. The large stunning blocks of vibrant colour almost live in themselves and most of the actual things which are chosen to be animated are stunning to - however this does little to hide what seems to be a stilted story which I feel sure has lost something in the translation both of language and culture from Japanese to English.     This is the retold tale, Japanese style, of the little mermaid. Brunhilde is the daughter of a mad scientist and the sea/earth mother. She is a fish like creature who lives in her father's ship in a bubble under the sea. But she wants more, and in the opening scenes escapes inside a jellyfish, the most beautiful scene to open a movie with.    She ends up being saved from certain death by a little boy, Sosuke, who takes her to school but loses her back to the sea in a rather child-frightening scene where the scientist summons up some fierce and sinister looking waves.    Ponyo (or Brunhilda to her father) returns to Sosuke determined to be a girl. She drinks her father's elixirs and unbalances the world in the process. The tsunami scenes are both fearfully frightening again for some young children, and hilarious - Ponyo - now a little girl runs along the top of the waves.    It all is resolved and the earth mother talks to Sosuke's mother and Sosuke says he will love Ponyo forever and all is well with the world again.    The story just didn't seem to flow. The mother and earth mother talking for long hours. The Old lady who refused to go under water and is taken down anyway, Sosuke and Ponyo's long, seemingly pointless trip in the boat. The very strange prehistoric fish which swim, seemingly threateningly, under their boat. And why does Sosuke say \\"pre-cambrian\\". I know what Pre-Cambrian is, but is there a point that they are there? Is there a point that he knows? why aren't there just fish there? Is this because the balance of the world is out? But then why does Sosuke, a 5 year old know?     Sorry, but for me the movie was full of these sort of questions. What was this or that all about? Some is explained but very often I think there is something really important been missed out somehow.    Anyway. It was an all right movie to watch. My 7 year old quite liked it, the 6 year old found it very frightening, and I found it frustrating and full of unexplained things.

B00008CLOA|5.0|A themed album about the potential of society's pressures to drive a fellow to paranoid insanity, \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" was a quantum leap for Pink Floyd, launching them out of BBC Top Gear reverie and into arenas and stadiums.<br />At this time, Roger Waters' lyrics weren't yet so weighty or preachy as to mention their subjects by name, so his brilliant words fit extremely well with the beautifully constructed, psychedelic music, mostly the creations of Pink Floyd's music department (Dave Gilmour, Richard Wright, and to a slightly lesser extent, Nick Mason). The lyrics never overshadow or outweigh the music, which even by itself could have made a substantial landmark of a record. Two of Wright's musical responsibilities, 'The Great Gig and the Sky' and 'Us and Them' are evocative masterpieces, and Waters' lyrics on the latter are nothing short of eerily poignant.<br />In fact, these were probably the best lyrics ever given to a psychedelic-oriented rock album, even if by 1973, Pink Floyd's \\"psychedelic\\" reputation was ready to fall away to more deliberate pieces of work; 'Money' was the biggest US single of Floyd's career at the time ('Another Brick in the Wall Part 2' was still six years away), and 'Time' is an album-rock radio staple to this day. The use of sound effects and spoken word snippets throughout the record were effective and hugely influential for many acts and albums to follow, but it's the brilliantly constructed, equal-band effort that makes it such a flawless work.<br />Its mystique allowed for \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\"'s appearances on Billboard's album chart for a record-breaking fourteen years. Arguably \\"the 'Sgt. Pepper' of the 70s,\\" this monumental 9-track disc made Pink Floyd a name as commonly spouted as that of the Beatles, though Floyd kept their music somehow greater than the individuals who made it.

0547258305|4.0|This is a very interesting young adult fantasy novel. The main character, Katsa, lives in a world where certain people posses extreme skills or talents, called a \\"grace\\". These people are called Gracelings, and they are easily recognizable by the fact that their eyes are two different colors. Katsa's grace is the ability to kill, and she's forced to use her grace as the King's enforcer. But what should she do when the King's orders go against everything that she believes and feels?<br /><br />This was a really good fantasy novel! I enjoyed it quite a bit. Lots of action and a good touch of romance. The only reason that I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the ending. There was this whole build-up around who the \\"bad guy\\" was and evading him and such, and then it ended really abruptly and was very anti-climatic. There was another section of the book after that to wrap up a few loose ends. I kinda liked that section, but at the same time it seemed a bit odd to me. Maybe it's trying to set up another book? Not sure. But overall, I am really glad that I read this.<br /><br />The only other problem I had was that I listened to the audiobook and I'm not sure if I recommend that. It was a full cast audio, so basically one reader for everything but the dialogue, and then a bunch of readers for the dialogue. And honestly, they were all pretty good. It took me a bit to get used to that kind of setup because I am so used to just one or possibly 2 readers. But I got used to it pretty quick. The problem I had was the music that they kept inserting into it! That drove me crazy! I kept feeling like I was watching some old movie where some says something that's supposed to shock or surprise you, then you hear \\"Dum, dum, dum\\" (or whatever the music happens to be). I just felt like laughing every time that they did it! Which is probably not a good thing since they were adding it to the parts that were supposed to be suspenseful! So, I think that I'd recommend reading it, not listening to it..
B0009LNRL4|4.0|Amon Dull II made better albums than Phallus Del, such as [[ASIN:B0009LNRLE Yeti]] and the classic [[ASIN:B0009NR8E4 Tanz der Lemminge]].<br /><br />But Phallus Dei introduced the dark, layered space psychadelia that made Amon Dull II one of the most inventive bands of their era. They were more complex than Pink Floyd, more compositionally able than Hawkwind.<br /><br />Some of this seems hokey now--the ghoast noises on the second track, for example. But for innovation and a blueprint to truely dark underground music, this album has few peers.
0439023491|5.0|I don't know what it is about this series, but I seem to always have a hard time really saying what I think about it!  Let me try to talk about this book, but I'm really not sure if I can put my thoughts into words, so I'm sure this review will be lacking! Also, fyi, I don't like to give spoilers, so this'll be vague!<br /><br />This book more than lived up to my expectations! I had read a number of other people's reviews and some felt like the first 173 pages dragged on. I didn't feel that way at all! No, there wasn't a ton of action at the start, but there was a great psychological side to it.<br /><br />Then came page 173. I stared at that page, rereading the same sentence probably 50 times, because it couldn't really say what I thought it said! From that point on, no distractions were allowed! I had to just keep reading. Then came the ending. And I knew without a doubt ahead of time that I was going to hate the end, because it meant that I have to wait an entire year to find out what will happen next. And I was right! In fact, it was worse than I though it'd be. I had been anxious for 6 months for this book to be released. I thought that wait was unbearable. This one will be worse!<br /><br />I am a major reader, and I have a ton of favorite books, series, and authors. But there is just something about this series that pulls me in unlike any other. I don't know if it's the characters or what. But these 2 books are pretty much at the top of my all time favorites.
0375413405|5.0|I've always cooked pretty well but after reading through this cookbook I think my cooking has gotten a great deal better.      The instructions are very clear and almost fool proof.      Ive had this book for several years and I always find myself thumbing though it when I need an explanation on a technique or an extra recipe to add to my meal.    I strongly suggest this book to anyone who is looking to improve skills.
0375842209|5.0|I just finished rereading The Book Thief and I don't know if I have the words to describe how this book has touched me! On a scale from 1 to 5, I would give it a 10. I will admit that several times during the first few chapters, I almost put it down and started reading something else. I am EXTREMLY happy that I didn't. This is a book that is well worth the read! The basic description of this book is that it's about a young girl named Liesel Meminger as she grows up in Nazi Germany. One of the descriptions that I read of it says, it's a \\"coming of age story about faith, love, hope amidst tragedy.\\" I think that if I was to try giving a more in-depth description of what the book was about, I'd end up writing several pages and not do the story justice. I'll just include a quote from the book itself, describing what the story is all about:<br /><br />\\"It's a small story really, about, among other things:<br />* A girl<br />* Some words<br />* An accordionist<br />* Some fanatical Germans<br />* A Jewish fist fighter<br />* And quite a lot of thievery\\"<br /><br />Markus Zusak is an incredible writer. The descriptions of things and events would just leave me gaping! He has a way of painting a picture that just brings everything to life. His narrative/story telling style was very distinctive and intriguing. The narrator of the story had such a unique viewpoint on the events, plus he would give you these glimpses of what was going to happen much later in the story. It was completely different from what I am used to, but I loved it. But saying all of that, I have to admit to something. All of those things that I just mentioned, I was really only able to recognize, appreciate, and enjoy them with a very small portion of my mind. The rest was so wrapped up in the story itself, that I had a hard time pulling myself away from it long enough to appreciate how the story was being told. This was such a powerful and yet heartbreaking story. If you only like books that are lighthearted, happy, and have a happily ever after, you will hate this book. If you can stand for your heart to be broken (and not just once) then this book is well worth the time to read it!<br /><br />I will definitely be reading it again!r after, you will hate this book. If you can stand for your heart to be broken (and not just once) then this book is well worth the time to read it!     I will definitely be reading it again!
B001UQ71QY|5.0|You can't beat the price on this but one thing I found annoying was that you don't see the title of the book you are actually reading, because the title of this book comes up as \\"Complete works of jane austen....), not Emma or Pride and Prejudice. That kept throwing me off.  I might have looked for another source to get each individual book for free just because of that.
0439023483|5.0|I just finished re-reading one of the best books that I've read all year. It easily makes the top 5, possibly even the top spot. The book is called \\"The Hunger Games\\", and it's by Suzanne Collins. This is the first book of a Young Adult dystopia trilogy, but really it's a book that will appeal to readers of any age.<br /><br />The book takes place in an alternate reality. Imagine our country in the future. There have been wars, famine, natural disasters, and a complete and total breakdown of our government and country. What is left is a country called Panem, which consists of the Capital and 12 districts throughout the nation. While the Capital is very wealthy, the districts are very pour. There's no welfare system. You are completely on your own. And the laws are brutal. If you break them, you'll either be subjected to a whipping or more likely be killed. This is not a fun country to grow up in. The main character is a 16-year old girl named Katniss. She is quite the survivor. At the age of 11, her father is killed in a mine explosion and she becomes the soul provider for her mother and little sister Prim. Every day, Katniss and her best friend Gale risk their lives by breaking the law, sneaking under the fence that surrounds their district and going into the woods to hunt, fish, and gather plants and berries. Anything that their family doesn't need for food gets traded on the black market for essentials. Although life is far from pleasant, Katniss and her family are surviving well enough.<br /><br />But then comes Reaping Day when everything changes. Once a year, the Capital holds The Hunger Games. It's basically their way of showing the districts who is in charge, and who has all the control. 1 boy and 1 girl (called Tributes) from each of the districts has to compete in the ultimate game of survivor. Only one of the 24 will leave the arena alive. Katniss becomes one of the tributes and now she is literally in the fight of her life. She just has to hope that her brains, and nerve, and talent will be enough to keep her alive. She also has to decided who she can trust, or if she can trust anyone. What are people's ulterior motives for what they say and do?<br /><br />This book has everything! Action, suspense, mystery, friendship, romance, humor in the most unlikely places, and a great psychological element! Once you start reading, you wont want to put the book down!e, and talent will be enough to keep her alive. She also has to decided who she can trust, or if she can trust anyone.

159102594X|4.0|I bought this book up because of the way it looked, and felt in my hand. I know, crazy reasons but I trusted my instincts. Boy, am I glad I did. This book (and the rest in the series) is the best thing I've read since A GAME OF THRONES. Abecrombie's style, and his ability to give his character unique voices, is addictive.<br />  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the ending of the third book (which concluded the series), felt hurried and a wee bit weak for such an amazing journey. Seriously, though..give this a try. You'll be happy you did!
B001V7WC1Q|2.0|When I bought this at Best Buy I was SO excited because it was only $9 and I hadnt seen it since the theaters..well it was too good to be true. The Dubbing is terrible and reminded me of the Asian martial arts movies everyone used to make fun of. It ruined the experience for my boyfriend who hadnt seen it before!
B000BNX3B4|5.0|I just rented this because it was a comedy I hadn't seen and I was loading up with movies to watch during a snowstorm.  Very surprisingly funny, and one we girls in the family decided we had to buy.    The theme is divorced people dating.  The blend of actors you recognize from other movies now together in this was very interesting too--Christopher Plummer from Sound of Music, Elizabeth Perkins from Big, and Lane and Cusack from numerous ones.  If there is a difference between a chick flick and a romantic comedy, I'd say (in my opinion) this is more a chick flick.  Personally, I would not want to go on a date and watch this with a guy.  Two thumbs up is our vote!
B002GY9F9K|4.0|Legend of the Seeker S1 has been entertaining in bringing to life Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth novels. The reason I gave it four stars is the fact that they really do take some broad liberties when adapting the story for the tv show. If you are a die-hard SoT fan then you will most likely not like the show. I know that when you adapt a book to a movie or tv show you have to change some things for the sake of time, etc., but the changes made here were more than I would have liked. I admit I was annoyed by the changes that were made (SPOILER ALERT: Like that they made Darken Rahl Richard's brother, and that Richard is in his early twenties instead of like in the book where it's his early thirties). I loved their choices in actors for Kahlann and Zedd. Those two were as I pictured them as I read the book. The tv show also jumps around through novels taking some of the best story lines from them and making an episode. We meet Jensen in the S1, but not the Stone of Tears until S2. Again, they take liberties and jump around.    Bottom line: While they keep some things similar to the books they take many liberties (some which I found vastly annoying). I enjoyed S1 and plan to enjoy S2, but I was disappointed in some of the diversion from the books that the show takes (thus 4 stars).
B000Y9Q59W|3.0|One of the worst blu-ray video transfers I've seen.  Love the movie, but save yourself some money and watch the original DVD upscaled.  The Blu-ray transfer has an odd graininess that while present in the source, is too pronounced in the Blu-ray transfer.  Poor example of a Blu-ray transfer.
1595141715|4.0|Thirteen Reasons Why<br />By Jay Asher<br /><br />Publisher: Razor Bill<br /># of Pages: 288<br />Age Rating: 14+<br />My Rating: 4 Stars<br /><br />Synopsis:<br />Clay Jensen returns home from school to find a mysterious box with his name on it lying on his porch. Inside he discovers cassette tapes recorded by Hannah Baker--his classmate and crush--who committed suicide two weeks earlier.<br /><br />On tape, Hannah explains that there are thirteen reasons why she decided to end her life. Clay is one of them. If he listens, he'll find out how he made the list.<br /><br />Through Hannah and Clay's dual narratives, debut author Jay Asher weaves an intricate and heartrending story of confusion and desperation that will deeply affect teen readers.<br /><br />Review:<br />Jay did a very, very good job at writing this book, It was very touching and raw, it shows how our words and actions affect people, even the smallest words that you said but can't remember.<br />I thought that the ending was a little disappointing and at times, it got a little confusing with Hannah voice and Clay's thoughts.<br />This is a must-read book, go and get it!<br />I give it 4 stars<br /><br />Enjoy!! :D:D:D
0307278255|1.0|I initially enjoyed the first few stories in the book, both because they were something different, as well as getting a first glimpse into mixed Indian-American culture.<br /><br />But as other reviewers have noted, the stories eventually seem to all sound the same, and by the end I couldn't wait to be done with this book.<br /><br />I was further disappointed because most of the characters are miserable (to various degrees), and two of the tragic endings rely on completely implausible circumstances -- the resolutions come across as lazy, since the reader can imagine plausible circumstances that could have yielded the same results.

I was fourteen when I was murdered on Dec. 6th, 1973.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Lovely Bones\\" is easily one of the best books I've read in the last few months.

B002SAUCBC|2.0|I really did not like this book at all.  I typically enjoy King's books, however, the story is true to the title, The Loooooooooooooong Walk, felt like a longer read.  I gave it two stars because I wanted to know what was going to happen and I was disappointed!  I read the ending a couple of times and I am not sure how I am supposed to interpret it exactly.  It just suddenly stopped. I don't want to spoil the ending, but can somebody help me with this?
B002T9H2LA|3.0|I'm not sure how the advertising campaigning went in the States but here in Japan, Quentin Tarantino went on TV offering a \\"You'll Like it or Your Money Back\\" deal. I was a bit surprised. This demonstrated either a lack of confidence or over-confidence, I'm not quite sure.       I'm not sure why, but since I've come to live in Japan, I've ceased to enjoy films that employ war-related gore and violence like candy and I'm sorry to say that I got no joy in the last 15 minutes of the film. Obviously, the big wigs Hitler, and his snivelling lackeys need a good slaying but but the other folks getting slaughtered wasn't any fun for me. I liked the idea of going after Nazis but unlike films like Munich, the idea of revenge going too far and how far the shadow of revenge should extend, there was no real moral debate. I also like the branding of the swastika on those who planned to \\"live a good life\\" afterwards conveniently forgetting their bad deeds when Nazis.        I think Tarantino is having too much whispering in his ear by fellow director Eli Roth who as the \\"Bear\\" had a bit of a disappointing entrance, himself. Roth's films employ the torture pornography that is the candy of budding serial killers everywhere. Tarantino's best films, while not without violence were, at least without the violent pornography present in this film.       That having been said, for Tarantino's first period film, it was very beautifully shot and had wonderful sets and props. I feel he let scenes go on for too long, though. The basement bar and Nazi lunch/interview scenes went on for a painfully long time. I kept thinking, \\"when are they getting out of here?\\" If they were joking about differences between Nazi and Allied cultures or different parts of Germany, or how family-run barkeeps always have a sexy daughter as waitress it might have kept my attention but it was all slow and about the silly bourgeois game they were playing.       The suspense leading up to The Big Fat Kill (using Sin City verbiage) was severely lessened by all of the slow and long pit stops along the way. The young private's character, while an essential plot tool for the big finale was REALLY annoying. Hans Landa's character was one of the only unique things that stayed with you to the end. He's kind of an ultimate Dolores Umbrige: evil wrapped in a polite and sweet package. The scene where he strangled the collaborator shocked the hell out of me. His use of English, French, German and Italian was enough to impress my love of linguistics but everything he said in any language was always directed at deflating plans, poking holes in alibis and defrauding the language ability of others. He was the truest \\"Basterd\\" in the film.        With better editing and perhaps a bit more demonizing of the hundreds killed in the last 15 minutes in order to better balance their complete and utter annihilation, it could have been a truly great film.

0307386171|3.0|I guess even major writers deserve a day off and after the achievements of 'Atonement' and 'Saturday' -- both towering works, Ian McEwan takes one with this slight story.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT -- THIS REVIEW WILL REVEAL SOME THINGS ABOUT THE BOOK<br />It's the early 1960s and a young English couple, both virgins, face their wedding night in a seaside hotel in Dorset with trepidation. For the man, Edward, it is the usual first-night nerves, nothing extraordinary. But the woman, Florence, has a more serious problem -- a real aversion, even loathing, of intimate physical contact. McEwan describes in great detail her reactions when her new husband puts his tongue in her mouth. It's almost as if she is being raped and she clearly understands it's the prelude to a real rape. Why is this? The author hints very subtly at sexual abuse by her father but it's never developed.<br /><br />We learn something about the backgrounds of these two people and how they met each other and decided to get married. Then we get a very painful chapter as the disaster of their wedding night unfolds. But McEwan cheats his readers badly in the final pages. He tells us exactly what happened to Edward for the rest of his life and how his entire fate hinged on that one night. But he neglects to tell us what happened to Florence.<br /><br />McEwan is such a significant author that nothing he writes could be bad. But in terms of his own high standards, this is a loss of form. He sets up an intriguing situation and then muffs it.
0307291146|3.0|For the price paid I was expecting something of an original copy, not a printing that came out of China, especially when it was billed as \\"collectible\\".  That being said, my wife loves the book set and is using it daily.
0321525655|5.0|This book is part of the tool kit I recommend to our students in our Master of Communication, Digital Media program at the University of Washington. Successful persuasive presentations rest on emotional connection, not facts-and-data. Garr Reynolds helps speakers rethink the supporting visuals that appear as a backdrop when on-stage so that the visuals extend the speaker's core message. The book is also helpful for those who must prepare presentations for internal staff meetings.<br /><br />Although I recommend the book -- and Garr's web site -- I also caution audiences to be aware of emotional appeals because those with questionable ethics can use these techniques in a less-than-above-board manner. This means that the book is valuable even if you don't plan to give a presentation, because it can help you be aware of emotional manipulation.<br /><br />Finally, if you are interested in information graphics (contrasted with images as concepts), I recommend Edward Tufte's books and seminars.
B0017R5UAA|5.0|I have yet to stop listening to this album.  It's been awhile since I've enjoyed an album this much.  The only \\"low point\\", if you can even call it that, is Tiger Mountain Peasant Song.  It's not a bad song.  It's just a lot quieter and softer than the very energetic first couple of songs on the album.  And it really quickly changes the mood on you.  But things pick up quickly after this more somber song.    All in all, if you've listened to the samples and like what you hear you should buy it.   It is very enjoyable, and I eagerly await their next album.
0756659841|5.0|My son loves this book. It is full of pictures of lego minifigures in different costumes.      It is the 6 year old trifecta of entertainment: Stickers, Star Wars and Lego Minifigures.
0765356147|3.0|[SPOILER ALERT]<br /><br />also egregiously unsatisfying.  It hurts me to have to give this series only three stars, because the Final Empire was a masterful stroke of creativity.  I won't prattle on about why; the other reviewers here have already articulately fleshed out its shortcomings.  Call me a sentimental fool, but what's the deal with that ending?  What is it about the hemalurgic need for authors these days to unwittingly cast genocide on their most intriguing characters and unnecessarily mystify the plot at the story's final resolution? Hero of Ages is guilty on both counts--pack your obsidian daggers and go.  I'll go on record and admit that I had to shed a tear at the end.  Was it due to the author's ingeniously original system of magic, witty/humorous dialogue, wildly entertaining storyline, likable cast of characters, and ability to bind the loose ends?  Partially, yes.  But mostly, no.  It was the combination of a depressing/hurried conclusion, a departure from the elements that made The Final Empire so enthralling, and the knowledge that overall execution could have been better.  Runners up would be the annoyingly revelatory chapter headings, lack of acceptably realistic moral lessons, a focus on pointless events rather than development of character, details of history that raised more questions than answers, and the knowledge that the character's actions/beliefs/agency will be rendered impotent by inevitability.  Sanderson's potential as a writer is off the charts, however I just don't think he reaches it with this novel.
B0026P3G12|5.0|This CD is not only a good investment for your own library but for any music lover! I gave both of mine away at Christmas (well received) and I'm going to order 3 more to have on hand for presents...Susan has exceeded my expectations in every way.

I also recommend watching \\"Susan Boyle: I Dreamed a Dream\\" TV special OnDemand right now (Jan 2010)--it's a delightful peek at her rise to fame, all the wonderful experiences she's been having and you get to see her performing live some of the songs on the album.
B002VPE1AM|5.0|The story of Avatar has been nicely told in other reviews, as has the stunning beauty of the film. I think that anyone who goes to see Avatar will understand from the beginning that Sam Worthington's Jake will be drawn to the Na'vi and eventually join them.  The audience certainly wants to see that happen, because we are drawn to the Na'vi ourselves. Jake, however, is in conflict over his obligation to infiltrate the natives of Pandora and his sympathy with them; his journey to understanding the Na'vi that is the heart of the film.     Yes, this story has been told before, as noted by others, in Dances With Wolves.  I am sure there are other examples as well.  Indeed, how many stories have the same basic core?  How many love stories, adventure stories have the same basic plot?  I read a comment from an author that we simply re-tell stories from different perspectives. Although Avatar is a story of the exploitation of indigenous people, bringing to mind the American Indians, Australian aborigines and African people it is a theme bearing repeating.  People on this planet are still being exploited and it is not a stretch to imagine humans going to other planets to do the same.     The story of Avatar is also one of intolerance. The corporation carrying out mining operations has its own mercenaries to bend the will of the Na'vi.  This is a universal film theme going back to D. W. Griffith's Intolerance. James Cameron creates a compelling world where all of nature is connected, and the majority of we urban bound viewers find such a magical place fascinating. Naturally, the greed of the humans guarantees that the unique world of the Na'vi will be destroyed. Mr. Cameron is pointing a mirror at us.  The debate is still going on as to how much of our environment is to be sacrificed for the good of economic development.  We need to be reminded of environmental loss. When a decision is made to exploit the land, the destruction cannot be undone.     Unfortunately, there are many who politicize Avatar into an attack on the Marines or an attack on the policies of the Bush administration.  It is just a movie, not an environmental manifesto or a threat to our security.  Can't ex-Marines be treated as fictional villains?  There are those who are far too eager to twist film stories into a political attack or supportive of a political view; this only succeeds in perverting the film, which is a fiction is the first place.  The message of Avatar is that the underdog can defeat their enemies, a rarity event indeed. If one considers the fate of the American Indian's the story of Avatar is a marvelous fantasy. It is a fantasy that is beautiful to behold and if it motivates people to think about nature and the environment as something to appreciate and preserve instead of a source of profit, so much the better.
B002EWD08Q|4.0|The Arctic Monkeys aren't kids anymore. The mere need for speed no longer thrills the way it used to, and their third album is a darker, more complex batch of songs than anything they've ever attempted. Stone Age Queen Josh Homme may have pushed the band in this direction, but since some of the songs on [[ASIN:B000NQR7NO Favourite Worst Nightmare]] seemed to me to already be moving towards the dark, I suspect a natural progression.<br /><br />In many ways, \\"Humbug\\" reminds me of The Undertones' as they progressed to their [[ASIN:B0007TKG4Y Positive Touch]] album. The bands both started out as hyper-adolescent punkier outfits, with their lyrical sights set on teen girls and gear (Mars Bars to Nikes), and both sounded like a group that could have only formed in a British DiY environment. While their fans might have wanted the Monkeys to do songs like \\"I Bet You Look Good On The Dance Floor\\" forever, band leader Alex Turner appears to be tired of the form. So he minor-keys it, slows the pace down (allowing drummer Matt Helders room to show off) and allows his voice to flow like an instrument.<br /><br />That makes songs like \\"Propeller\\" sound almost menacing. Or let the hook in the first single, \\"Crying Lightning,\\" evolve out from the song instead of sledgehammering you. Or to experiment with textures, like the backwards guitar on \\"Cornerstone.\\" With \\"Humbug,\\" the Arctic Monkeys prove once and for all that they're a three dimensional act, and will outlast the hype that swept them to their original stardom.

B000B5XOXY|2.0|Batman [Val Kilmer] comes back to face Two-Face [Tommy Lee Jones] and The Riddler [Jim Carrey] who've aligned in an attempt to take over Gotham City with a damaging brain device. Along the way, Batman meets Dick Grayson [Chris O Donnel] who eventually becomes Batman's sidekick Robin. While Carrey is a perfect choice for The Riddler and Kilmer is ok as Bruce Wayne/Batman [Despite having blonde hair], This installment in the series suffers greatly from its poor story, Tommy Lee Jones' annoying performance as Two-Face, Chris O Donnel's equally annoying performance as the annoying-in-general Robin [Batman should always work alone], and the very campy direction that new director Joel Schumacher decided to take with this sequel. Like the 60's series, Batman and Robin spew boring one-liners, Robin acts silly, and the whole atmosphere seems too colorful. Another thing that dogs this film down is the horrible score by Elliot Goldenthal [Elfman should've been brought back to conduct the score]. The movie as a whole is overblown and too hollywoodized for a Batman film. Gotham City here looks much too glamorous as opposed to the dark, gothic look of Gotham in the first two films. The action scenes are tolerable at best, But the movie ultimately brings shame to Batman's legacy. And Nicole Kidman's Chase Meridian character serves no purpose whatsoever [Chase was never even a character in the Batman comics before or since]. If you're a fan of the 60's Batman tv show, You might like this movie. But, If you're like me and prefer a dark version of Batman, Skip this one and especially disregard the next film, Batman and Robin.
B001DRF84W|5.0|After reading several reviews on here, and as a longtime True Hulk Fan, I am here to say that both movies ROCKED!! They were just done in totally different ways. 2003's 'Hulk\\" and 2008's \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" both showed us key parts of the Hulks character and did in a way that really tapped into what the character means.     Now, \\"Hulk\\" was an amazingly done movie. Ang Lee tapped into so much with this one. First off, there were stories told in the comics as to why the Hulk is the way he is psychologically (generally an incredibly strong 3 yr old having a temper tantrum) and where it all came from. This movie explored that deeply and added to it. For anyone out there that loves watching a movie where you need to think a little, this is a great movie. Especially, if you love psychology. It shows us what can eventualy happen to someone through years of torment or even one really big traumatic event and how that can really screw said person up. Just in this, it manifests as a Green Hulking beast that can use a tree as a baseball bat. LOL. However, Though I agree with some things that others have said here about magnificent set shots, I am not always sold on the CGI. Some scenes look incredible (i.e. busting out of desert base and the streets of San Fransisco) and some look a little less done. I know a lot has to do with Ang Lee's interrpertation of the physiology of the Hulk (The more angry he gets, the bigger he gets. The more angry, the more gamma, the more greener), but as a true hulk fan, I have my days with this theory. The Hulk never needed to get bigger to get stronger. That was the great thing about him. Other than a few indescrepancies in the theology of the Hulk, I really enjoy this movie. Ang Lee does bring to it a very artistic, albeit, sometimes over thought, vision of what the Hulk is and how he operates. I know a lot had to do with his wife actually being someone that does research in biology and gave him real world explanations for everything.     \\"TheIncredible Hulk\\", the most recent of the two movies, and primarily a reboot, bypasses a lot of the thought provoking part of the Hulk and brings us back to the \\"Hulk Smash\\" mentality. It also gives many nods to the television show from the 70\\"s that most of us grew up on. For that reason alone, I love this movie!! However, I thought it superior in a few ways to its predecessor. First off, I thought the Hulk looked better. In Ang Lee's version, the Hulk was almost \\"TOO\\" Bulky and the first time you see him (again, an overthinking artistic vision) was supposed to represent a toddler...so the hulk almost had some baby fat. Now, Seamlessly, speaking CGI wise, I think the first hulk was better. I am speaking strictly on the actual look of the hulk. In this version, He looked more human, more like the comic. And in some scenes (the grotto scene) flat out looked awesome!! There really was not that many psychological references in it. The few that were are really only pertaining to how Bruce Banner can control the Hulk or if he remembers anything that happens as the Hulk.  Otherwise, there is quite a lot of action in it. None that seems too extreme.     There was also a nice balance on how they incorporated the show and comic lore together in this movie. My one gripe with it, and I think this may have actually been a gripe of Edward Norton's as well, was that there is a lot of deleted scenes that had they left it in, may have explained more and made it more thought provoking. The director, Louis Letterier, was trying to go for the knockout punch by keeping the movie short and sweet. However, just the deleted opening sequence alone, with Bruce in the artic, would have explained a lot and added a nod to many comic book fans (watch and see what I mean). Plus, some scenes that could have been extended might have added an extra element to the movie.     So in closing, I do recommend both films!! I think they are both highly entertaining (on different levels) and lets face it, No one can have a bad time watching the Hulk smash up everything!! Have a good day, Amazon Community!!
B000FA5TTW|1.0|i hated it. i thoght that it would scare all readers worst book ever i give it 2 thumbs down. what a sad excsue 4 a story. it is terrible. im sorry if u disagree but TERRIBLE BOOK. i dont recomedn this book.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|Wow! Nicholas Sparks has done it again with this book. It is phenomenal. It is one of the best love stories he has written.
B00164EAC8|2.0|I think movie reviews are funny because they really don't mean anything and everyones taste is differet.  BUT, since Amazon wants me to write this, I will:<br /><br />This movie sucks.  It's crap.  It's a shame money that could've fed homeless people or even gotten homeless people off the streets was spent on the creation of this.<br /><br />OH, and then they put it in Blu-Ray!  Even more money!<br /><br />We bought this for my father in law as he has no taste in movies.  If you know someone like that, then please, buy this.
B000002GXS|4.0|On Waits' second album his poetic lyrics are wrapped in a variety of jazzy, bluesy and folk styles with a hint of the orchestral on two tracks. Diamonds On My Windshield and The Ghosts of Saturday Night are spoken recitals, a form he would later explore over entire albums.<br /><br />The most outstanding tracks, lyrically and melodically, are the tender San Diego Serenade with its elegant strings, the soulful and melancholy Shiver Me Timbers and the title track which in sentiment and imagery brings to mind his much later composition [[ASIN:B000002GWR Jersey Girl]].<br /><br />The jazzy numbers include New Coat Of Paint and Semi Suite; Fumblin' With The Blues represents that genre whilst Drunk On The Moon is somewhere in-between. Of the other ballads, Please Call Me, Baby is an orchestrated outing whilst Depot Depot has the most arresting saxophone solos.<br /><br />The Heart Of Saturday Night provides a satisfying cross-section of all the different styles Tom Waits would develop in his illustrious career, including on masterpieces like Rain Dogs, Heartattack and Vine and [[ASIN:B00000IGGA Mule Variations]].<br /><br />For fans, I recommend the book [[ASIN:1560256672 Innocent When You Dream: The Tom Waits Reader]] which documents his life and music up to 2004 and is perhaps better than a formal biography as it provides various perspectives from many different writers.
B000WQWPKA|4.0|This is a classic movie however putting it on blu-ray is just pointless.  It's just as good on VHS as it is on blu-ray.
0446310786|4.0|After purusing the many reviews, not much else can be said, except the summary would be \\"it's a classic,\\" and should be read by every youngster, especially by the age of Scout and young people gaining their independence and starting to think for themselves. The reader gains insight into the human spirit and behavior, even though you don't live in Maycomb County, Alabama. You don't have to - one size fits all. I read it originally about 1960 when it was first published and enjoyed reading it again - definitely an American classic.
B000HIVOI2|4.0|This is another movie where it's pointless to have it out on blu-ray.  It wasn't meant for that format.    Good movie though.  Crappy TV show, but good movie.    Thank you.
B000HEWEJO|3.0|I thought the movie was going to be colorized since it's the 60th addition. Disappointed it was still in Black and White. Thought it was pricey for a black and white film. I own the VHS and think it's better.
B000AGTPUU|4.0|It's a good movie, good story.  My boy likes it...well, he likes the train.  My only surprise was to see that Tom Hanks DIDN'T play the part of all the children too.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|This is one of the best, if not THE best, Eagles concerts I've ever watched. Farewell: 1 is essentially the definitive live collection of the most memorbale songs from the Eagles' amazing music career, as well as megahits from Joe Walsh's and Don Henley's solo projects. The Eagles have aged since they first hit the music scene decades ago, but these guys are very much at the top of their game. Joe Walsh performs better on guitar than ever. Timothy Schmit and Don Henley's voices sound the best I've ever heard them sound. The Eagles really went all out for Farwell: 1. When watching this concert, its evident that these guys really know how to perform to a crowd and truly enjoy what they do.    Don really gets a chance to show what an amazing frontman he is, especially when performing his 80's solo career songs with the Eagles. Bass player, Timothy Schmit's impressive, high pitched vocals shine on songs like \\"I Can't Tell You Why\\", \\"Love Will Keep Us Alive\\", \\"Hotel California\\" and \\"Hole in the World\\".    Joe Walsh gets a chance to be the smart-assed, fun-loving, goof that he truly is. (I vote Joe for the role of the next Joker in future Batman movies.) Walsh is given several oppurtunities to show off his refined lead guitar and soloing skills. My only qualm is that some of the lead guitar and solo parts of songs were handed over to the Eagles' stand-in concert guitarist, instead of Joe. Walsh, however, does get to perform some of his solo career songs, such as \\"Life's Been Good\\", \\"In the City\\", and \\"One Day at a Time\\". I am a HUGE Joe Walsh and Don Henley fan, so perhaps this review is slightly biased.    They only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was some of the songs that Glenn Frey either wrote, co-wrote, or just plain sang too twangy (i.e.- \\"Peaceful Easy Feeling\\", \\"Take It to the Limit\\", \\"Lyin' Eyes\\", \\"Tequilla Sunrise\\"). To me, they sound way too similar to one another and far too country bumpkin for my taste. I am however a huge fan of Frey's solo work from the 80's(which was more rock n' roll based). I was glad to see his hit solo song \\"You Belong to the City\\" IS included in the band's playlist for this first, and hopefully not the last Farewell tour. If you are a fan of the Eagles, Don Henley or Joe Walsh, then I strongly recommend you check this dvd out. Even new fans of The Eagles, Don or Joe will find something impresive here they like.
B002XHN776|2.0|I really wanted to like this album, but the more I listen the more I consider it too average. I'll admit I haven't bought a Mars album since the first one, but what happened to the cool crazy timing signatures and walloping drums? I'm no longer a big fan of Leto's vocal delivery.  He's generally got a good voice but on this album it just seems he's trying too hard and he doesn't know when to hold back.     Night of the Hunter - The first 90 seconds is powerful, exciting, setting the stage for something great... and then when the chorus hits the rest of the track falls quickly and I said to myself, \\"wait, I've heard this all before.\\"    King and Queens - immediately a standard rock track that a thousand bands are putting out. Complete with requisite strings in the background.  Boring and oversung.    This is War - decent intro but once again oversung and the chorus ruins the whole song. Leto is trying to hard.  This is one of my LEAST favorite songs.    100 Suns - there is a time and a place for slow songs and this one hits at a good time.  Great intro to 'Hurricane' too.    Hurricane - Sweet and slow. Piano and cool industrial percussion. Builds a little but never gets blown out unnecessarily. This is more along the lines of what I expected to find on this album.    Closer to the Edge - After 'Hurricane' I started getting more interested.  The intro to 'Closer' has the drumming I'm more interested in.   Then, just as soon as I started paying attention the chorus (once again, oversung) brought the whole song back down to average.  Hard to even finish listening to this track.    Vox Populi - intro reminded me of a modern Pink Floyd song maybe, then cuts in to a steady paced little number that might work well for the treadmill.  But again, this is not \\"single\\" material and doesn't rise above the rest of the standard rock fodder that fills the airwaves.    Search and Destroy - sounds like all the rest of the album. 4/4 timing, all the little studio add-ons, and about asboring as it gets.    Alibi - a nice, quiet song that fits into the album but gets ruined by Leto's singing in the end.  He just doesn't know when to hold back.  I like the bells though, nice touch.    Stranger in a Strange Land - great intro, immediately familiar. The song works itself into a \\"comfortable\\" Mars song but does not break any boundaries. Not disappointing but no surprises here.    L490 - the intro sounds like a singing bowl and that's cool, then turns into quiet guitar work before ultimately ending in chanting.  Maybe Gyoto monks or throat singers?
B002PMV9FG|4.0|well,this is one of my favorite parts of this series.i made some predictions early in the first movie and i was right.of course i cant gloat heere or i will spoil your fun.              lets just say ,a few things happen that you should have seen coming a long time ago.then there are some genuine suprises if you hadnt read the book.               i will give you a clue though.this movie is a lot like \\"the revenge of the sith\\" in many ways.               i like all of the harry potter movies and this is no exeption.ron is still really funny.his would be gf shows her ugly side a bit.this movie was great fun and now im really psyched up for the upcoming 7th part and the lego video game.   i say watch it.if youve come this far,dont give up now!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Not the greatest book I have ever read, but definately an intelligent read.<br />I would recommend it and look forward to the upcoming movie interpretation of the book.
B002T9H2LA|3.0|when i heard that director quenten tarantino was going to make a film about nazis i was estatic!my brain was buzzing with the possibilities!a director known for his extremely gory and violent films is going to make a nazi movie!nazi movies are notorious for being ultra violent.this would no doubt be the \\"a clockwork orange\\" of the new millenium!the movie that was decades ahead of its time.it would be considered too violent even in 30 years.                     BUT NO!It was not that violent.it was a bunch of long talking scenes,reading most of the film because it was in german and french and a couple cool fight scenes.                          a lot of hype was being built up around the \\"baseball bat scene\\".well,ive scene worse violence on \\"tom and jerry\\".the scene was over in like 10 seconds  after the 10 minute build up to a highly anti-climatic ending.it was being talked about like it was going to be an all time great movie scene like meg ryan faking an orgasm at the deli.but it was hype and hype only.like they say \\"everything in hollywood is so fake\\".                           then when there were no action scenes it was all talk.so the movie went talk talk talk talk talk talk.........baseball bat scene........talk talk talk talk talk talk...........nazis.......talk talk talk talk talk........movies...........talk talk talk talk ..........big finale!                           there was very little violence.and even less ultra violence.                the actors and actresses were a bunch of people i am mostly unfamiliar with.there was brad pitt who did ok i guess.the chick from \\"sweeny todd\\" may have shown up briefly too.the guy who played hitler was paid 3 pennies because thats all he was worth in this film.                  also,when all of the nazis were supposed to meet up,a bunch of the big wigs were missing.it was incredibly historicaly innaccurate.the facts were all messed up.especially the end which took the film into an alternate reality.the violence that was done to the nazis was the same type of stuff that they allegedly did to   thier victims in ww2,making the  so called \\"good guys\\" no better than the nazis.                  this was supposed to be quenten tarantinos masterpiece.his \\"mona lisa\\" or \\"moonlight sonata\\".he said it was the film he'd always wanted to make.he'd been planning it for ten years he said.                   the childish \\"get the nazi\\" antics  that are all too common in movies ever since the 2o's are just plain stupid.they are way too played out in this movie.and if this \\"masterpiece\\" was aimed at that juvenile approach and aimed at redefining himself as a snoozer film maker,than he suceeded.                   this movie could have been the ultimate ww2 film of all time.easily beating out any ww2 or skin head film in existence.but what it did accomplish was a half baked,watered down,movie that has gone places hundreds of movies already have.                     ww2 was bad.the nazis did bad things.everyone knows.so all these childish pokes at someone who cant fight back ,without a time machine, are just infantile.grow up ! try complaining about something from the last half a century!get with the times!you'd think with that gigantic head of his he'd be able to think up the next citizen kane!

B001OQCV60|5.0|After reading the reviews from some of the critics I was surprised by how many of them talked disdainfully about this movie as a divergence from the source material. I'm assuming many of them were relying on the old Basil Rathbone movies to color their interpretation of Holmes. They seem to overlook the fact that in the actual novels and stories penned by Doyle Holmes was an artistically tempermental, manic depressive, physically powerful individual who annoyed Watson by conducting experiments in their shared flat. He had been a prize fighter under another name, he was a cocaine addict and, according to \\"the Adventure of the Empty House\\" he was skilled in one of the earliest \\"mixed martial arts\\", Bartitsu (misspelled by Doyle as \\"Baritsu\\"). Watson was a formidable former Army doctor discharged due to complications from a shoulder injury sustained in heavy combat while serving in Afghanistan. In many ways their depiction in this movie is much closer to their depiction by Doyle than what we've seen in the past. I am especially gratified that they finally did away with the ludicrously out of place deerstalker cap that became a staple of the Holmes movies due to one of the original Padget illustrations and which made no sense for the character when he was in an urban setting.
B000FA5TTW|5.0|I wanted to read this before watching the movie which is scheduled for worldwide release in theaters on 1/15/10. I really enjoyed the book. Some parts were very surprising as I had not read reviews prior to reading the book. I heard there was some controversy about the references to heaven. I don't think it was meant to have a true spiritual component to it. Susie often referred to heaven as \\"my heaven\\". It was different but not bad. Now that I have the characters and the storyline fresh in my head I am looking forward to seeing the movie this weekend.
B001OQCV2O|1.0|I went to this film for the special effects. I find it amazing that before it was over I was actually tired of seeing them. Cities being destroyed actually got boring. I could pick apart the many problems in this film, but why bother. This film is bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.
B002XTBEDI|3.0|I only saw the first presentation on PBS and I am disappointed.  I loved \\"Cranford\\" and I wish that many more of the original cast were kept in the \\"Return.\\"  Why was it necessary to lose Dr. Harrison and his new bride and leave Cranford with no doctor at all (hence the death of Martha).   A different actor for Matty's brother - Mary Smith's lack of eye glasses - and so many references to things past we must read all the books for answers.  What was Mary Smith's disappointment?   Hopefully, Septimus will not win out in the end.    But, I have pre-ordered the DVD and I am sure I will perhaps learn to like it.
0553381687|5.0|I have to admit that I have a serious soft spot for swords, bows, and blood, and this book has plenty of each.  I was at first intimidated by the projected size of this series and then I was leary to start because I didn't want to get stuck on book 4 while awaiting Martin to finish the series.  When I finally decided to go for it I entered an excellent fantasy world that I didn't want to leave.  There is a very strong sense of loyalty in this book and of course there is valor, honor, integrity, love, hate, and all of that but I would say that this book's core is loyalty.  One of the things I like about Martin is that he isn't afraid to kill of characters.  There's nothing more annoying than reading a book where a character never dies and it takes all the excitement out of 'life threatening' situations.  In this book anything goes.
B000N6TX1I|1.0|I had read the novel by P D James some years ago, and because this movie was so awful I plan on reading it again.  Maybe too many pages have come and gone since last reading this tale, but the movie, supposedly based on Ms. James novel, didn't strike me as anything like the book.  Basically, even when the characters are somewhat cleaned up and dressed nice, it is dark and dingy.  The fact that the whole of the west is sterile, is basically used as backdrop by the writer/director Alfonso Cuaron.  Maybe because the director is from Mexico he felt compelled to use the movie as allegory for United States political and global policy, though the movie is based in the United Kingdom.  Did the director ever stop to think that without immigration, because of the continual over promoting of birth control, consumerism, and socialistic secularism, most countries in Western Europe would cease to exist?  Maybe this is the plague of sterilization P D James alluded to in her novel?  But you wouldn't know it by this awful movie.  The movie trys and sell us on the idea that the UK becomes insular and is either killing or deporting all immigrants.  Again, the whole idea of Ms. James book, no children moves out of the forefront in this movie.  The movie is absurd.  All one need do is read books like Londonistan by Melanie Phillips or The Last Days of Europe by Walter Lacquer to see how stupid this movie really is.  I mean these are not new ideas.  The 1930s writer and British Parlimentarian, Hilaire Belloc, predicated the end of Anglo Saxon Britain and Christian Europe due to unbridled Islamization.  As for the acting, Clive Owen is his usual dark, inward doting self.  Julian Moore gets killed.  (She should have passed on this movie.)  And Michael Caine as the 70 some year old hippie just looks goofy and awkward in his role.  The cinematography is jumpy and comes at you in snippets.  Enough already with that cliched approach.  If I have to say anything positive about the film, it is the music composed by John Tavener.  Oh and before I forget, if you dare look at the \\"extras\\" on this DVD you will be intellectually assaulted by the usual Brit Ivory Tower types and the cinematographer going on and on about overpopulation (by the way, all the people currently living in the world standing side by side would fit in the state of Texas) and global warming (this is interesting as right now Britain and the US is seeing the coldest winter in 25 years.)  Of course if you are an actor, film maker or ivory tower type your attitude about poor people in poor countries, as you jet around the world, is there are too many of them and just enough of me.  In the end there is nothing worse than a bad film on DVD that is preachy to boot.  Unless you pick this one up at a garage sale for 50 cents or less, pass on it.e music composed by John Tavener.

B002W6Z0UK|5.0|I love Lady Gaga, and she didn't disappoint again! Can't wait for the next one.
B002R0F3Q2|4.0|I have great respect for Alicia Keys and her gifted ability as a songwriter and performing artist.  I'm writing this review after having listened to the CD five times. My criticism here might come off a little harsh; but my intent is merely to be constructive. I am sure that she will understand, if she gets around to reading reviews of her work posted on Amazon. I am choosing to make comments on each individual song.  LOVE IS BLIND is a love song about a man she is totally enthralled with, but her friends don't seem to think she should be wasting her time on him.  But Alicia ain't paying no attention to what nobody gotta say about nothing; because she is crazy all up in some love.  Certain sections of the song seem to have a Middle Eastern flavor musically, and I like it quite a bit. DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING has some great lyrics about a relationship gone sour, and there is no one to blame but herself for pushing him away.  Alicia laments with remorse and wants her man back.  SLEEPING WITH A BROKEN HEART opens with a tribal-like percussion.  This song is also about a relationship; one that for whatever reason had to come to an end.  I thought that perhaps the song was about a lover that passed away, because I sense an air of mourning and loss in it's delivery.  WAIT TIL YOU SEE ME SMILE has a prayer-like tone to it.  The singer seems to be stressing the importance of looking to God, or some higher power to assist her in keeping a smile on her face in times of trouble.  She has been let down, or perhaps has been mistreated by negative people; but when she faces these dark forces with the smile from God; what negative people have to say becomes insignificant. This to me is a song of affirmation and healing.  I also notice Native American sounding drum beats, and haunting background vocals in the wonderful piece.  THAT'S HOW STRONG MY LOVE IS is yet another love song, and a beautiful one it surely is.  Alicia does some beautiful and delicate piano playing in this one.  UN-THINKABLE is a song about the desire for commitment in a loving relationship.  I like Alicia's voice a lot here; she sounds at ease and comfortable. The beat is so intoxicating that I found myself shaking my head back and forth a little.  I like when she sings, \\" I was wondering maybe, could I make you my baby.\\"  Alicia Keys is serious about her loving.  LOVE IS MY DISEASE doesn't do much for me.  I think it's because Alicia's vocal delivery is sort of strained and off pitch.  I think she is attempting to sing beyond her comfort range, and it does not do her justice.  If she were my friend, I would make her aware of how this pitch problem needs to be addressed.  This song would be great if it were delivered with less strain.  Less is more.  LIKE THE SEA is a hand clapping, and finger snapping good time song with strong R&B rhythms.  Oh yes; love indeed is a powerful drug that can take you completely over.  I must give praise to the great background vocals and instrumentation in this one.  PUT IT IN A LOVE SONG is Alicia sounding a little strained again; thus taking away from the song's potential.  Beyonce has the perfect voice for the piece, and it wouldn't surprise me to find out that it was written with Beyonce in mind.  I think the song will get good radio play, and will have people shaking their Beyonce booty on a dance floor somewhere.  THIS BED is too repetitive.  I felt that what the song was about had already been sung.  That being said; it is still better than many songs played on the radio these days.  DISTANCE IN TIME is a very beautiful song, and I like the sexiness of Alicia singing.  I think this song would do well if released as a single.  Powerful background vocals offer powerful support. HOW IT FEELS TO FLY showcases Alicia's strong songwriting ability.  Her singing is a bit strained again; but the gospel flavor of the song avails.  I like the \\"yeah, yeah, yeah,\\" sung by the Greek Chorus in the background.  EMPIRE STATE OF MIND is a great choice for the last song on the album.  It has an anthem-like quality - celebratory.  If I were a native of New York, I would feel proud of this song.  Now; Alicia does get a little off pitch again here; but I have to forgive her this time around because the song rocks.  Aside from the pitch problems that I've mentioned earlier; I feel that this album is well worth listening to from start to finish more than a few times.  The majority of the songs create emotions that come across as personal and universal.  Alicia Keys writes some of the best lyrics out there, and her stories are powerful and real.  I like that she has branched out musically this time around; with effective attention paid to background music and vocal harmonies.  It's all put together quite tightly.  I highly recommend this album to music lovers everywhere.r the last song on the album.  It has an anthem-like quality - celebratory.  If I were a native of New York, I would feel proud of this song.

B001NFNFIK|5.0|As is always the case, the movie was much better than the book. I mean, why read a bunch of dumb pages and words in a book, when I can get the whole thing in a movie and it takes less time. I love this movie, and I'm glad that I won't have to read books anymore since the movies make them so much better like in this movie. Who has time to read books these days? It's like, I have to go on myspace and facebook to chat and like totally tell my friends about going shopping at the mall and all this stuff. But I like this movie too.

B0028RXXFC|3.0|I purchased this series expecting it to be good historical drama, but found it to be a soap opera on a lavish stage.  Granted the storyline follows true historical events, but the immoral behaviors displayed by the characters in the subplots overpower it. When I read the description of this series, I don't recall reading about how sexually explicit and violent some of the scenes are, but parents know that this is NOT a series for your children!
B002SJIO5E|5.0|District 9 is a 2009 science fiction-action film directed by Peter Jackson. Newcomer Sharlto Copley plays the role of Wikus Van De Merwe, an Afrikaner bureaucrat assigned to relocate a race of aliens. The aliens are called \\"prawns\\", from District 9, a military-guarded slum in Johannesburg, South Africa, to a concentration camp outside the city.    Totally Original! Realistic Plot! Awsome special effects!
0670021652|4.0|Eat, Pray, Love was like a torte. I savored every rich page and in fact delayed reading the final few chapters, as I never wanted the adventure, the jokes, the insights to end. As I'm sure Elizabeth Gilbert was keenly and painfully aware, that sort of appeal is nigh-impossible to top--or follow.     She could have simply kept going, stitching together outtakes from EPL into a second act that readers would have hungrily devoured. But to her credit, she was attempting to grow stylistically as a writer, satiate her intellectual curiosity, and share the results of her research. However, as with any monograph, as fascinating as the information uncovered may be, there's little plot. Here we enter Wait, Think, Wait territory. Gilbert has embodied the Hanged Man of the tarot deck, on a trip through the hell via a holding pattern in the airspace of Homeland Security. However, as maddening and frightening this place is, it doesn't offer enough of the sort of dramatic trajectory that made EPL famous. To make matters worse, Gilbert opts to lose her narrative tension almost immediately when she tells us that ultimately she will marry. A little \\"will she or won't she?\\" could have bought her some momentum.     Gilbert's forte are her interviews with people of other cultures, often those bearing scant resemblance to modern-day America's, such as the Hmong of Vietnam. I greatly admire her ability to establish instant rapport with her interview subjects.  It is here where she sparkles most brilliantly, and here where I wish she'd lingered longer, as in EPL.     But curiously, Gilbert foregoes the luster of her real-world anecdotes to lead with extended passages about the history of marriage. And despite some fascinating facts, they seem to go on for many pages at a time, with little of her trademark humor. The \\"Marriage and History\\" chapter is 32 pages long, tossed in right as she starts to get some traction and grinding things to the halt like a droning Sunday sermon. It's sad because this could have been a reasonably quick fix. Her research simply needed to be assimilated more, spoken through her own lovely voice, and lavishly punctuated with examples from her globetrotting.     As Gilbert's editor, I would have sent her back to the parts that really sing: Her obvious affection for people and fascination with other cultures. Her capacity to sort through the noise and cull her own truths, after assimilating the perspectives of others. And her ability to turn our cherished paradigms on their ears by presenting radically different points of view. I will say that she does do some of the latter when she interviews the Hmong women, who seem to possess few romanticized notions about marriage--or the specialness of personal identity overall. To these people, \\"one man is the same as the next.\\" They seemingly can't even grasp how a woman would fall in love with a man's specific qualities or personal za za zsu. They simply don't differentiate themselves from others--a fascinating concept, especially for Westerners hung up on their own personal punch lists of traits they bring to the party and those they can't live without. And, as Gilbert discovers, these marriages tend to endure far longer than ones driven by love and personal preference. As odd as it may seem, arranged marriages statistically stand a better chance of lasting. And thus, she worries--and worries and worries--that her own marriage to Felipe may not.    I really started to perk up about 2/3 of the way through, when Gilbert takes a sudden left turn, becoming much more personal, as she sifts the marriages and child-rearing experiences of her matrilineage. The excellent questions she raises about what constitutes happiness and satisfaction within the confines of marriage and rearing children provoke much thought, as they ask what we sacrifice or subsume in order to sustain a long-term marriage or family.     Despite its strengths, Committed has still left me a bit cold, and I can't tell if that's because I so adored its predecessor or due to its blatantly patched-together quality. I found myself wondering why her editor had apparently fallen asleep on the job.
B00284BMBM|2.0|First I like to say I loved every album till now I have loved most of all the tracks on all his CD's.  This newest one is not so good there is about 2 tracks on here that are decent the rest are starting to sound all generic pop rock that is out there.  I think he needs to bring back his hard edge that he had the first couple of albums that made him stand out.  I hope that he can bring back a harder more rock edge to his songs.   Hes lost the hard rock solos and the more singable songs that most of albums have.   I hope he doesnt head down the road of elevator music that just plays over and over till no one cares....
B001AVCFK6|2.0|I was very disappointed to find that this movie was not a true BD title and was NOT 1080p format but was letterbox instead. Unbelievable considering that this movie was \\"filmed\\" a lot directly to digital and was available for viewing in IMAX theaters as well. To access the BD-Live features as well you have to logon to the BD-Live content site and have created a username/password to access. No thanks. Why release a first run top rated movie on Blu-ray and not have it be in 1080p?
0525950079|5.0|An incredible book. 1014 action-packed, juicy pages that would keep you hanging on to your seat. There are multiple plots and sub-plots as well as numerous characters in this story. Historical facts such as the royalty, the wars, the effect of the plague etc.. make this story stunning. The politics and backwardness of the church, as well as the depravity practised by many under the guise of God are brought out in this story. Some of the most influential characters are women, making me suspect as I did in 'Pillars' that this author is indeed a feminist.
B00007ELEL|5.0|One watches this film and it's, like, perfect. Sheer perfection. The Coen Bros... tuned into an astrological constellation or something, the stars were aligned, and out came a film that is not a film as much as a monument to the art of filmmaking. When you catch that feeling, you can't go wrong. Baby. The film is a testament to friendship, authenticity,untethered life force, the beautiful craziness of SoCal and the sheer genius of directing with a light touch and a clear eye. This was the perfect strike.

B002VECM4K|3.0|Like most \\"slice of life\\" movies meant to induce viewers' indignation and outrage at one injustice or another, \\"Precious\\" hits the mark with deadly precision. It would be almost inhuman not to pity Precious, or be outraged by her circumstances and (most of) the adults in her world, but no one should really be surprised. Her story represents an amalgam of all too real experiences suffered by teens and broken families irrespective of geographical or racial boundaries.    After so much emotional investment into the story and main character, the movie never offers a satisfying release. Nor should it- the story is dismal as dismal can be. Life sucks, and then you die. Painfully. ANy \\"Hope & Change\\" moments live only in her dreams and fantasies never to materialize into any real life experience. Precious was check-mated in life from the moment of her birth. The efficacy of antiretroviral therapies available in the 80's was marginally above placebo. How's that for a \\"hopeful\\".  And who would be granted legal guardianship of the children? Mostlikely their granny who did such a spectacular job with her own daughter. How's that for \\"change\\". The inept and impotent social services network available crumble in the breeze. Even her name, Precious, in the end is nothing more than a cruel sarcastic pun.    Predictably, this film is every critic's darling and is sure to rack up awards. However I am unaware of any reviews mentioning the failed liberal agenda responsible for Precious as a real person or merely in the abstract to actually exist. And so the praises are off the mark other than to rightfully congratulate some fantastic performances.    The real outrage provoked by stories such as this needs to be directed at the root cause which not only created this depravity but continually feeds and sustains it. If someone knows a film which more effectively exposes the cruelty of the welfare state then please let me know.    Take this movie as a simple glimpse into someone's dire life if you so wish, but better to think beyond that narrow view.    If I may ad lib on a recent quote from a Man of the Cloth: \\"LBJ, your 'Great Society' hens have come home to roost!\\"

B002VKE1K2|1.0|Let's make this simple, this movie is poor at best. It was not the least bit scary until the last twenty minutes. Even during the last twenty, it was not all that scary. The other sixty minutes is nothing but a video diary of a family that no one really gives a crap about. If you can get this movie for free, get it, you can use it as a doorstop, make it look like you own a lot of movies from afar, or you can take the DVD out and use it as a coaster. If you have to pay for it, then it's not worth the money.

As he freaks out some people out of the seats it comes true as the rest of the people in the stadium dies horrificly becoming one of the worst accidents in the city's history. But it's not over yet as some of the survivors such as a sexy mother (Krista Allen), a security worker (Mykelti Williamson), and others are in danger for the Grim Reaper wants to kill them as well and only Nick can save them.<br /><br />Improves over the weak third entry and it goes in 3D as it was amazing in theaters but still nice on home theater viewing. The director of part 2 returns in the director's chair as this installment takes the franchise even futhur and goes for the jugular on the graphic gore and accidents that pushes limits much like the similar \\"Saw\\" series was. You gotta see some of the deaths in this movie to believe it such as the pool-drainage death which is horrifying, the acting is bad including some dialog but this is a 3D ride to hell done right like last year's pleasant suprise \\"My Bloody Valentine 3D\\".<br /><br />This Blu-Ray offers 2 pairs of 3D glasses as it has both 3D/2D versions as the picture and sound are just plain flawless as it was in theaters with a standard def DVD. An exclusive just for this Blu-Ray first look at the upcoming \\"Nightmare on Elm Street\\" remake, deleted scenes, alternate endings, featurettes, previsulations and storyboards with exclusive featurets by BD-Live.
6305308659|5.0|Yes, there is instances of sex, nudity, masturbation, violence, etc; But there is also talk of change, acceptance, growth, joy, sorrow, and much more.  This movie shows everything that we as humans are, both the good and the bad and how we can and have grown from it.  It is a beautiful and meaningful movie which everyone should watch more than once (the first time just to see the story, second time to understand it).  To the people who give it one star, the ones who all say its all about sex, etc, come on!  Look deeper, stop pointing out only what you want to see!  If we didn't have our bad side we would never appreciate, well, anything, not our best friends, our family, God, life, or a simple flower from the one you love to cheer you up, negativity allows us to have all of those things and so much more and that is one of the few messages of this movie.
B002T9H2L0|5.0|1944 Nazi-Ocupied France, it seems Adolf Hitler (Martin Wuttke) with his troops are taking over the country and killing off Jews. American soldier Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) with a group of  Jewish-American Soldiers (Eli Roth, Christoph Waltz, Til Schweiger, B.J. Novak, Omar Doom, Michael Bacall, Paul Rust, Samm Levine) who call themselves the Basterds as they spread terror and fear to every Nazi in europe. They run across with a beautiful French-Jewish woman named Shoshana (Meline Laurent) who's family was brutally killed by the Nazis as she runs a local movie theater in Paris to get revenge.<br /><br />Featuring appearences by Mike Myers, Julie Dreyfuss, Rod Taylor, Diane Kruger and Bo Stevenson this is one hell of a Quentin Tarantino action-war thriller. Some people love this movie or hate it but i loves it since Quentin never fails me! i believe this is a unique and ultraviolent character study that breaks up in 5 parts like Pulp Fiction back in 1994 did with 3 parts in one movie. I love how this mixes history and fiction combined as the director knows how to do it right and i know the film is a bit slow paced for some but this was a delight to watch. It has a mix of art-house and mainstream all combined in one, if you like a good quality action-drama-character flick then i suggest checking this movie out.<br /><br />The movie looks and sounds terrific in High-Def even with that theater quality on the sound with the parts during the war sequences. The Extras are terrific such as trailers, interviews, featurettes, poster gallery, camera angel feature, and extended & alternate scenes.
0199535574|5.0|One of the Dashwood daughters is smart, down-to-earth and sensible. The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.<br /><br />And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.<br /><br />When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.<br /><br />Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.<br /><br />But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...<br /><br />At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.<br /><br />Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").<br /><br />And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. What's more, they each have to become more like the other before they can find happiness. There's also a small but solid supporting cast -- the hunting-obsessed Sir John, the charming Willoughby (who has some nasty stuff in his past), the emotional Mrs. Dashwood, and the gentle, quiet Colonel Brandon, who shows his love for Marianne in a thousand small ways.<br /><br />\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is an emotionally powerful, beautifully written tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love.

B002TY78QY|5.0|The best thing you can say about any movie's soundtrack is that it can stand on its own, and that no matter what you think of the movie, the soundtrack is chock full of amazing music.<br /><br />And the soundtrack to \\"New Moon\\" is one of those -- apparently the people behind it have gone completely indie in their tastes. Whether you love or hate the teen-vampire-infatuation flick, it's undeniable that the soundtrack is bursting with brilliant bands -- angular rock'n'roll and lush echoing pop, some of it well-known (Muse, Thom Yorke) and some relative obscure (Grizzly Bear, Lykke Li).<br /><br />\\"Meet me on the equinox/Meet me halfway/The sun is perched at its highest peak/In the middle of the day... \\" Ben Gibbard sings distantly as the gentle guitars swirl around him. A storm of drums builds up every time he laments that \\"everything, everything ends,\\" as his pronouncements about an unknown lover become eerier (\\"A window/An open tomb/The sun crawls across your bedroom/A halo/A waning moon/Your last breath moving through you\\").<br /><br />There's a pretty good showing of solid rock'n'roll following Death Cab For Cutie's memorable introduction -- Band of Skulls provides the buzzing, blunt-edged rocker \\"Friends,\\" Hurricane Bells erupts in a buzzing storm of fuzzy bass and sharp beats with \\"Monsters,\\" and Sea Wolf's \\"The Violet Hour\\" is a swirling little pop-rocker that seems to trickle down the reverberating guitar.<br /><br />Then there's Thom Yorke, whose buzzy-edged electronic \\"Hearing Damage\\" is a furtive, dark little rush of sinister beauty. And of course, Muse is included in the stomping, mournful rocker \\"I Belong To You (New Moon Remix).\\"<br /><br />Some of these bands are also going unexpectedly low-key to suit the mood, even if they're usually much louder. The Killers turn out the dramatic layered lament of \\"A White Demon Love Song,\\" while Black Rebel Motorcycle produce twangy lo-fi ballad \\"Done All Wrong.\\" OK GO abandon their usual sound in favor of the trippy psychedelic \\"Shooting The Moon,\\" and the Editors have dramatic, hauntingly sad piano-rock sound in \\"No Sound But The Wind\\" (\\"Help me to carry the fire/it will light our way forever...\\"<br /><br />But some brilliant indie pop also makes the cut. Lykke Li's \\"Possibility\\" is a shimmering, icy little melody, while Anya Marina sticks to acoustic guitar riddled with organ in the whispery \\"Satellite Heart.\\" The best of the album: Bon Iver and St. Vincent collaborate on the otherworldly, hymnlike \\"Roslyn,\\" and Grizzly Bear's exquisite \\"Slow Life\\" is a slow haunting build to a celestial climax. There are two extra tracks in this edition -- Sed's fuzzy, erupting rocker \\"No Way Out\\" and Ximena Sariana's stripped-down guitar ballad \\"Frente Al Mar.\\" The former is a solid addition to the rest of the soundtrack, and the second... put me to sleep.<br /><br />For the record, I'm not a fan of \\"New Moon\\" or Stephenie Meyers' Twilight series in general. But I felt a prickle go down my spine when I saw the songs listed for the soundtrack -- they've crammed it with one brilliant band after another, ranging from hard rock'n'roll to soft, sweet ballads. In fact, the only one that failed to move me was Alexandre Desplat's outro -- frankly, it was four minutes of boredom for me.<br /><br />Otherwise, the playlist sets a wonderful mood -- think a mingling of bittersweet romanticism and outright melancholy, with lots of slowly winding piano, buzzing guitar, acoustics and ghostly veils of electronica and organ. The singers' voices range from dramatic laments (Matt Bellamy) to quirky murmurs (Anya Marina), and their lyrics tend to reflect two themes: loss (\\"How much pain has cracked your soul?/How much love would make you whole?\\") and love (\\"Even though you're only one I see/I've got to set you free...\\").<br /><br />Even those who are not (and probably never will be) fans of the Twilight phenomenon should immerse themselves in the \\"New Moon Soundtrack.\\" Taken on its own merits, it's still a haunting string of beautiful songs.
B002P5XXR0|5.0|I loved this soundtrack.  I have to admit that after reading some of the reviews I approached it with biased ears but after tossing away all of the negatives I have come to really love this Avatar soundtrack as much as I do Titanic.  Granted I do hear some similarities to James Horner's other works but I finally said to myself that I love those other soundtracks too and if I hear similiarities in sounds and chords then I'm okay with that because I loved that music too.  I adore the soundtrack to Titanic.  It can evoke distinct memories, for me, from the movie.  After listening to this soundtrack for the last 4 weeks I can say that it does the same for me with Avatar.  The main theme is laced through out the soundtrack and because I love that main them so much so that I bought the soundtrack I have no problems listening to it.  If you loved Avatar, and there are many of us out there that do, then you will definitely appreciate this soundtrack.  Listening to it with an unbiased ears to Horner's other works and just enjoy it for it's rich, evocative sounds.

B001GCUO4S|3.0|A plane crash, a multi-vehicle pile-up, a care-free roller-coaster ride derailed. Where will Death strike next? In \\"The Final Destination\\" (in 3-D!), Death has its eyes fixed on a Nascar race, and when an assortment of spectators escape their fate, they find themselves receiving their comeuppance in the most grisly and brutal ways imaginable, of course.<br /><br />By now, the formula for these films has been worn down considerably, and unfortunately the fourth installment in this inventive franchise does little to push the envelope, save for some gory and outrageous deaths. Switching back to [[ASIN:B00005JLZK Final Destination 2]] director David R. Ellis, it should come as no surprise that the film is yet another guilty-pleasure carnival of carnage. At this point, you know what to expect, and while the plot is skimpy at best, this sequel pulls no punches and, at the very least, doesn't make you feel like you wasted your time. What it lacks in good characters and original story, it makes up for in its money shots (a.k.a. the death scenes).<br /><br />The 3-D gimmick helps the film out a bit, but unfortunately it's not put to as good of use as it was in the \\"My Bloody Valentine\\" remake. You'll get giddy during the opening sequence (which is introduced brilliantly by pummeling you with Shinedown's hard-hitting hit, \\"Devour\\") and get slight satisfaction out of seeing a few less-than savory characters get what they deserve (it's all about that pool scene!). Fans of the franchise will no doubt squeeze some entertainment from \\"The Final Destination,\\" but as for its future as a lasting franchise? I have a premonition of an assortment of direct-to-DVD sequels.

Lucy Lawless plays a secondary character, but her attempt at comedy gets in the way of her more serious roles from Battlestar Galactica or her campy Xena.<br /><br />The bug-eyed guinea-pig is a freakish large-eyed animal, that Skeeter exclaims would \\"be big for a cow!\\"  Thankfully, the cute rodent is not overly played -- at least not too much. :)<br /><br />Although a Disney film, there is a mild potty humor to the piece (which makes me argue: there were plenty of funny comedy films from Disney in the 70s and 80s without the fart jokes, but I digress).<br /><br />The story essentially starts off in a heartwarming but dangerously boring vein.  We meet his dad and the two kids.  The boy Skeeter has an active imagination and loves to hear bedtime stories from his dad.  But Skeeter's sister is the serious type.  His dad signs away the deed to the hotel as it builds up lots of red ink.  The buyer says he will have Skeeter as the manager to the new hotel.<br /><br />Twenty years later, Skeeter's dad has died, his sister married then divorced and has two small children, and Skeeter?  Well, he is the janitor!<br /><br />Yeah the same old story of down on his luck fella somehow beats the odds and comes out on top, but not quite.  The stories the kids and Skeeter weave start to actually happen out in the real world.  His nephew imagines what it would be like to have it rain gumballs.  Later in the day, it actually does rain gumballs (dropping from a busted 18 wheeler hauling candy)!<br /><br />Great for the kids, the special effects are a bit fake, the humor only a child could truly appreciate.<br /><br />Recommended for the family, but it doesn't beat Dean Jones in the original Love Bug!

B000Q6ZG5C|5.0|I was surprised to discover that the third Harry Potter film was to be directed by none other than art-house favorite Mr. \\"Y Tu Mama Tambien\\" himself, Alfonso Cuaron. While I rejoiced Chris Columbus' departure, I was a bit hesitant if Cuaron could take Harry in the direction he so desperately needed to go. However, choosing Cuaron as director of \\"Azkaban\\" wasn't necessarily a complete shot in the dark. In 1995, Cuaron directed the very under-appreciated but very enchanting, \\"A Little Princess,\\" an adaptation of the classic children's story. It's interesting that in nearly ten years, Cuaron had not attached himself to another children's story. That was until 2004's \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,\\" the very best Potter film to date (though they are all quite consistently good). Something amazing happens in \\"Azkaban.\\" Yes, the film is \\"darker\\" and obviously more intelligent than its two previous companions, but most importantly, \\"Azkaban\\" feels like a valid piece of filmmaking! The bar has been raised with this particular entry. It's hard to imagine what kind of films the current three successors would be had Cuaron not directed \\"Azkaban.\\"
B00319ECGK|4.0|To Neo (Keanu Reeves) it seemed as if his entire life was a dream. As with most of us he was searching for something. He was also looking for a person named Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) who would be able to answer the burning question &quot;What is the Matrix?&quot; It just may be possible that for other reasons Morpheus may be looking for Neo.<br /><br />The movie producers get points for it the first people to do the particular FX.<br /><br />This film even though it has a beginning and an end is really the first is a series that unfolds a further truth.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves plays his part well; however, he is better as Siddhartha in &quot;Little Buddha&quot; (1994).  Their little trick with pills reflecting off the classes was good. Speaking of Buddha one does not realize until going through the rest of the films in this series that there is a subtle Buddhist philosophical thread running through them.<br /><br />Even though this is a review of the first film in a series or trilogy I do have the compete Blu-ray set. It rather grows on you.<br /><br />[[ASIN:6305428360 Little Buddha]]

The only reason I'm here to write this review is:  I'm going to buy this baby again!  Don't hesitate if you've never heard Tom Waits before:  this is a great, step-right-up, intro to Mr. W that you will never regret.
B001EU5TJW|4.0|Once again the graphics outstretched the story, and for this day and age the CGI did not exceed that of most movies.  The continuing saga of the movie requires that you have seen the first one to get the proper background information.  As with Keanu Reeves' portrayal of Siddhartha in &quot;Little Buddha&quot; (1994), this time a change of costume and he must deal with impermanence and the Vedic cycles.  Super imposed on this gem of understanding is excessive action that would rival that of &quot;Kung Pow!  Enter the Fist&quot; (2002).<br /><br />Neo is supposed to be &quot;The One&quot; according to prophecy.  According to Morpheus he is to lead the people out of bondage.<br /><br />Is the oracle what she appears to be?<br /><br />Will Neo, in the midst of endless kicking and shooting, go on to fulfill his destiny?<br /><br />Or will the love of Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) interfere?<br /><br />This story is not so comprehensive. It needs to be viewed as part of the series to make it worth viewing.
B002C6K7NU|4.0|There are good songs on here, there truly is.  I love Southern Rock and they do it pretty darn good.  But for those that think your gonna hear classic Skynyrd songs in 2010, well keep hoping.  The name is Skynyrd, and there's Billy (RIP) and Gary, but thats it.  Even if they brought back Ed and Artimus, they still couldn't make a GREAT album.  Its just not possible, we're in a different era, their inspiration isn't there, and they're stinkin' rich.  The 70s Skynyrd was unbeatable and they are doing Southern Rock justice by keeping the band going.  I hope they never stop.      For those that are confused about the song \\"God and Guns\\" when comparing it to \\"Saturday Night Special\\" - well, I can only trust Gary.  He knew Ronnie and I seriously doubt they'd cut a song that was against what Ronnie truly believed.  Times change and so does people's opinions and views.      If you truly love Southern Rock but don't think this is up to par - I'd recommend Blackberry Smoke.

I desperately wanted to replace my (huge) collection with another all-in-one that included \\"Lady Susan.\\"  My husband bought this for my for Christmas, and it's exactly what I wanted!  Yes, it's big and clunky, but I knew that because I already had my other copy.  If you want a small book to read in the bath, I would buy each novel individually.  As a complete set, this is perfect!

When I asked for a refund they told me they would only refund me if I removed my review, which wasn't bad but it did say the video did not work. I would rather that other buyers know that the movie didn't work than to recieve my refund. I think it is shady how I could only recieve my refund if I deleted my review. I would not do business with this seller again. I have copies of all email conversations with this seller if any one would like to see. Thank you!

B000051Y0G|4.0|My grandpa was in a movie with her in the eighties called \\"Vibes\\", the movie was not great. But every time I hear \\"Girls Just want to have fun\\" I remember him, and I like having this happy cheerie memory with me.<br />So you can say I'm biased, but the truth is that the album holds pretty tightly. There is a lot of 80's classics here such as \\"Money Changes Everything\\", \\"Girls Just Want to have Fun\\" , \\"Time After Time\\", \\"She Bop\\", \\"All through the Night\\". All the tracks are good with the exception of \\"When you were mine\\" which I can't stand its monotone, but since is a Prince song I don't blame her.<br />Also I love the little section of \\"He's so Unusual\\", you can tell she is very unusual by putting that in there. I appreciate those type of things that take you by surprise .<br /><br />So if you are looking for a good 80's pop album, this is definitely one.
B0015DROBO|4.0|The Girl w/the Dragon Tattoo started off walking the bases. I'm talking suh-LOW. I nearly put it down several times out of frustration, in fact. But I decided to give it to 25% (on my Kindle counter) before throwing in the towel...and I'm so glad I waited because it turned out to be a home run. Right around 13%, the story - or, more accurately, the characters - grabbed me.<br /><br />The cast of thousands was initially confusing until I realized that 80% of them didn't advance the story at all so they could be easily ignored. That simplified things a bit. And while I spotted a number of Kindle formatting/spelling errors, it wasn't so distracting as to ruin the pace of the story. I'm guessing much of the plodding prose should be credited more to the translator than the original author. But since I don't speak Swedish, I'll likely never know for sure.<br /><br />So while the book may have had a few issues - including the torturously slow start - the intertwining plots, weird characters and surprising twists kept me reading. The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo may not be a perfect novel, by any means, but I'd certainly put it on my 'suggested reading' list.<br /><br />If this review gave you information that was helpful, please feel free to click the YES button below!
B000WQWPJQ|5.0|We are taught to believe that our future is determined by the choices we take and miss and although that is true in a way, I have come to realize that many important paths in my life had been chosen in a more coincidental way.<br /><br />From the minute he gets to the island every single decision he takes has to comply to the laws of nature. This is something is not apparent when you live in a society but the truth is that you are as confined as he was in the island. There is a beautiful shot of him at the top of the hill overlooking everywhere and only seeing the ocean, it makes you feel so insignificant and powerless.<br />You want to believe you are the owner of your destiny but you aren't. Life can and will take you to places  you never expected to be.<br /><br />I might be in a minority here, but I really like this movie. Without saying much it speaks a thousand words to me.<br />I am extremely grateful to everyone who participated in creating this movie and I am glad they did it as real as possible, no music on the background to dramatize scenes in the island. Tom Hanks never overplayed the part and I know I would go through the same feelings if I was in the same situation.<br /><br />PS: I did cry for Wilson

B000025XKM|5.0|Pink Moon will always hold a special place in my heart. Not only was this my first introduction to the Artist. But was also my first CD exchange with a dear friend. The ramifications of emotions and memories this album brings are at times overwhelming.<br />This Album embodies all I ever wanted to achieve, and all that I have.<br /><br />In the most simple definition Pink Moon represents the true shape of music. Music in its purest form and most beautiful shade.<br />Recorded over two nights in October 1971. Nobody knew he was making an album. He turned in the master tapes and proclaimed \\"I have no more songs left to sing\\".<br /><br />This is just a man and his guitar. No more, no less. This is not about making a statement, creating greatness, or re-designing the laws of music. But merely an expression. And that is what music should be.<br />Is so easy to indulge ourselves with production details and ideals. That we forget what true music should be.

B002TYZKIM|5.0|I view this movie-documentary as a tribute to Michael for thousands of his loving and adoring fans worldwide.  It is a beautiful legacy,  a splendid farewell 'eulogy' to a beautiful man who's heart was all about love/brotherhood, a man who truly tried to make a difference in his/our world. He danced his dream to make it a better place.  I am glad TII was NOT a `tissue-for-tears' work. In my opinion, a true documentary would have been less perky.   For me, it was uplifting (with funny moments sprinkled in).  My heart felt light and chipper, filled with the light and spirit of MJ's love.      Before TII, there was a new generation out there who had never heard of MJ before his passing. They were curious about this world-stopping icon.  They wanted to know who and what he was all about, who was this man who almost crashed the almighty Internet, who all but brought the world to a standstill...fans pausing at their various activities/occupations to mourn, to bring honor and tribute to MJ's passing.  People everywhere seemed to mourn him in some shape or form. This generation found themselves wanting to go with the flow, to climb aboard that seemingly 'universal' bandwagon... and they have.  For many, many of us who had stepped away from his career path and forgotten him for the moment, we reset our sails in an effort to renew our interest in the talents of this Man and his phenomenal Music.  Ortega's TII set out to do just that...to 'showcase', if you will,  this country's masterpiece...our King of Pop.  TII is showing us in this movie-work the makeup and musical depthness of Michael's genius... who and what The Man In The Mirror was all about.  We saw him at his art, at his final best--preparing, carving, chiseling, molding, sculpturing it for the Moment... a la Michael Jackson! This Michael Moment was not to be, however.     For the fair price of a ticket, we were able to see him at his work, to see him weave his tapestry of magic, to look into an integral part of hissoul.  We readily see him in character and style, we  watch him perform (robbing himself of 100% now to give 200% later at O2), we see him (perhaps not at his best) at what he does best and probably better than any performer alive---happy, smiling catchingly, singing, dancing... executing his phenomenal talent and influence on stage right in front of our eyes. Counting my blessings that day, I likened the film to a 'live' concert!!!!!   Yes, yes, a warm and loving human being.  Outside of our dreamy state, all of us knew that we were watching his swan song-- those final `animated' days of his life. We knew that the stage-curtain would never again be lifted on him, not in our time and space.    In this movie, he appeared thin yet he went about every facet of his work joyously.  My thanks and appreciation go to Ortega for his fine footage-editing and 'displaying' MJ in a good light for millions to see.  And, I thank the producers for giving us Michael as Michael appeared in the last months or weeks of his life. Many say he was not health, but he did not appear frail. Thank God, I would have truly tear-flooded the theater.   Michael was 50, said not in his finest form, and a tad thinner than former times... yet, in loving eyes (his fans) he was beautiful and the man we knew and loved as Michael Jackson. As I write this my eyes are teary; I do not apologize for this emotion.      Btw, I took along a couple of my larger hankies to wipe away my tears, but had no need for them.  Each emotion of the moment (no sad moods) engrossed me throughout the movie--so much so that I forgot that MJ had left this same stage a mere 4 months earlier!     I walked out of this theater feeling greatly touched, inspired and entertained... enough to want to see this movie a second time.  And, I did... but this time without the hankies!    TII....no waste of my bucks!!!  Anxious to add the movie DVD tribute to my MJ trove of 'precious memories

I really like Jillian, I know she comes off kind of harshly, but that is what makes me want to work harder. I think her comments about working hard actually motivate me to get my butt in gear.

B0028RXXFC|5.0|With Rome, HBO wonderfully marries the spectacle of the big screen with the intimacy of the small.

B00000JRTX|5.0|\\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\" (1994) is one of my favorite movies: well-acted, a rollicking romantic comedy with one serious, touching scene, and an overall feeling of the vitality and the spirit of life. The movie creates a gang of friends, each one interesting and fun to be with. It may be Hugh Grant's best film where he's able to balance his boyish charm with a more ruminative side. The gang gathers at a series of weddings, and through wonderful vignettes we get to know each one: the hippie girl, the deaf mute, the Charles Addams Morticia-looking woman, the flamboyant, joyful gay guy and his devoted lover, and the clutzy millionaire.<br /> At the one funeral scene in the movie, Gareth's lover, Matthew, delivers a very moving eulogy that always tears me up. He reads W.H. Auden's poem \\"Funeral Blues\\" otherwise known as \\"Stop All the Clocks.\\" With the lines \\"He was my North, my South, my East and West/I thought that love would last for ever: I was wrong.\\" As in other British movies slapstick comedy like Monty Python can be paired with the deadly serious.<br /> The movie begins with Hugh and his Platonic roommate hippie girl buddy late to a wedding, and at a fast pace the film travels through multiple lives and meetings. Charles (Grant) falls for Carrie (Andie MacDowell) at first sight, but he's always been unwilling to make a commitment to marriage, and has had a series of girlfriends. He's met the right girl but doesn't have the ability to effectuate. Grant can play flustered, irresponsible, self-absorbed, irritated, bedraggled, put upon, and still keep his impish, boyish charm.<br /> The multiple weddings are fun with their eccentric characters. Grant and his friend say awkward, indiscreet, funny things in wedding speeches. One of the film's hilarious highlights is when Rowan Atkinson (of Mr. Bean fame) officiates at his first wedding as a newly ordained priest. He says \\"Holy goat\\" instead of \\"Holy Ghost\\" and \\"Holy spigot\\" instead of \\"Holy Spirit.\\"<br /> The film's dialogue is literate and funny. It's clever the way Charles and Carrie use \\"skulk\\" for example. The film has great photography.<br /> At the final wedding suspense piles up, we in the audience get more involved and tense as the scene plays out. Stick around for the credits at the end: they're fun. And the soundtrack is fine too.literate and funny. It's clever the way Charles and Carrie use \\"skulk\\" for example.

B002SJIO5E|4.0|Okay, I read a bunch of the negative reviews and I get it.<br />This is NOT a Hollywood Assembly Line Sci Fi movie.  This is not the Wizard of Oz, or \\"Aliens\\".<br />This is a film (with artistic pretentions) masquerading as a action movie.<br />As a film? It rocks!<br />As a movie? I enjoyed it, but it ain't \\"Alien's\\".<br />It's got too many real world elements that make it less a fantasy then a glimpse at an alternative reality.  It does not pander to it's audience, which is where I think a lot of the angy review are coming from. This is a slow moving, totally engrossing story that builds, and builds and builds. Even when you figure out where it's going, it does not take the EZ way out.<br />It's \\"action\\" is the brutal world that the aliens live in (and military rule they live under).  You'd have to be a sociopath to enjoy watching this type of stuff for \\"fun\\".<br />I thought the lead actor was wonderful, as was his character flaws.  He slowly reveals the layers of complexity to his nature, and it's very confusing and wonderful.<br />You keep wondering who is the hero, the victim, etc.<br />I disagree with reviews that think the message is that all Military Forces are brutes or that all big business is evil.<br />The world is filled with heros and villians.  Sometimes they defend the flag, other times they hide behind it.<br />What is far more interesting here is the idea of just what it takes for something to be alien enough for we humans to turn off our humanity and decide that it's okay to mistreat and destroy another race.  Yes, it's not an accident that this takes place in South Africa and it only  the film that much more stunning.  Like the \\"Twilight Zone\\" decades earlier, the film uses Sci Fiction to make a larger point.<br />The film has no easy answers, which only serves to make it more real and facinating.<br />The SFX are fantastic and come across real, which only make the film more satisfying.<br />If you like films that make you think and challenge you, this is your kind of film.<br />If you're looking for mindless entertainment on a Saturday night (as we all do sometimes) this is NOT that film.<br />Check out WALL-E or Transformers.<br />If you want to see a hugely entertaining film that will haunt you for weeks, this is that film.oking for mindless entertainment on a Saturday night (as we all do sometimes) this is NOT that film.

1904380522|5.0|RADICALLY RE-WRITTEN AND UPDATED FOR 2010<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />This is very much a practical handbook written for Waterside Press by Bryan Gibson -- a barrister, ably assisted by consultant, Mike Watkins, who conducts training courses for magistrates. This first rung criminal court, of which both authors have considerable experience, handles in excess of 90% of criminal cases; indeed every criminal case commences in this court.<br /><br />The magistrates, although not legally qualified, (but supported by qualified advisers) are concerned and committed citizens who, following their course of training, give their time up to serve their local communities.<br /><br />One of our oldest public institutions, magistrate's courts -- in which magistrates perform an unpaid public service - have no equal anywhere else in the world. The \\"Timeline\\" at the back is a great illustrator of the history of summary justice for the curious.<br /><br />The popularity of this unique handbook is amply demonstrated by the fact that the first edition came out 20 years ago when there was no book like it.  So, anyone who was unfamiliar with the topic, whether they were new magistrates, practitioners, or laymen simply had to learn from scratch.<br /><br />Gibson & Watkins refer to the tendency, sometimes, across the Criminal Justice System (CJS), to \\"speak in code\\" and express the hope that anything like this book which helps people to understand the everyday language of the courts will serve to alleviate this.  It is no small wonder, then, that this excellent book has remained in print for two decades.<br /><br />This new 5th edition has not merely been updated; it's the result of a radical rethink.  As the authors explain, this edition `is a completely fresh one, re-written so as to  incorporate the best of the old, but also to take account of the way in which the magistracy and the way in which the magistrates' courts are administered, have evolved towards the end of the first decade of the twenty-first century.  Naturally, it also takes account of many changes of law, practice, procedure and sentencing'.<br /><br />With graphs, tables, diagrams, a glossary of terms, timeline and useful index, not to mention expert commentary and analysis based on the practical experience of the authors, this timely and up-to-date handbook will help guide you through the complexities of the Magistrates' Court as it is at present constituted and run.<br /><br />It's aimed at a much wide readership unlike either \\"Anthony & Berryman\\" or the massive 3 volume \\"Stone's Justices' Manual\\" both of which are more technical. This work is obviously a must for the police and magistrates, especially newly appointed magistrates. In addition, it's ideal for ordinary members of the public as general reading with many useful training techniques employed in the text to make the reading easier.<br /><br />Its subtitle, `An Introduction', is certainly apt and it should also be required reading for anyone seeking to understand, or involved directly or indirectly, with the criminal justice system. It really is a benchmark book managing the basic concepts with a suitable level of detail radically re-written and updated for 2010... and no cases!<br /><br />ISBN: 978-1-904380-52-8wards the end of the first decade of the twenty-first century.

0823015017|5.0|I received this book as a gift. It was the best christmas gift I got. I've been working and playing with polymer clay since 1995 and have many books on it. This one is on the top 5 ever written. Like many clayers I needed color theory and finally here it is. There are many project books and we didn't need another one. Even if you are a starter you will need this book sooner or later. Why work with just basic package colors when there is a whole world of color possibilities out there waiting for you to be discovered? Already read it completely and started with the exercises. Thanks Maggie and Lindly for making me fall in love again with polymer clay. I would have given the book 10 stars out of 5. Don't wait any longer and get your copy.
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|First I have to say that whether I think a book is good or not is completely dependent of how much enjoyment I got out of reading it.  I'm not reviewing any quality of writing or anything like that.  That said, I thought \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" was fantastic.  Yes, the story is depressing, tragic really, but I was gripped after the first few pages.  It's been quite a while since I read a book that brought such a strong emotional response out of me.  I was beyond angry with Rasheed, held my breath as Mariam and Laila tried to make their escape and cringed when they didn't.  There are some plot twists in the book that I did not see coming.  I would have no reservations recommending this book.
B001JQTSG6|5.0|Now, THIS is what a blu-ray disc should be! Great movie. Excellent transfer. Jammed with special features, including three excellent audio commentaries and about two hours worth of documentaries about making the film.<br /><br />First rate product.
B000Z0OX9O|1.0|Ok i will sum up this review with one word: useless.    Case in point, only one CD brings new Blade Runner material, and that's CD 2. So don't get your hopes up when you see \\" 3 CDs Blade Runner\\" because that's just false advertising.    Note i didnt put *original* in CD 2 description, because it aint. Vangelis had to add effects like Wind. Yes, wind blowing over the magnificient end titles which absolutely and needlessly ruin an otherwise perfect piece.    Thank god i didn't buy this.    Cheers  Xavier
B002RSDW80|4.0|I haven't read Julia Child's books, but watching this movie inspired me to stick it (and her DVDs) on my wish list. I received this as a Christmas present, and got to enjoy an uninterrupted viewing of it. There were a couple of points when I had to rewind a few seconds, to verify what I saw or what I heard. The acting was wonderful, all around. If one enjoys cooking shows, or has an intense love affair with one's food-loving spouse, this is a great movie to see. I'm very glad it's in my collection.
B001BTG3OQ|5.0|I've used the SB-900 about 4 months now and this is indeed an excellent flash. Before I purchased it I read all the comments and there are some very good and detailed comments regarding this flash. But over and over the issue of the thermal protection came up and that caused some concern. I was conflicted over whether to buy this flash. Make no mistake this is an expensive piece of equipment and I didn't want to throw money away. So I took a gamble. Closed my eyes and clicked the purchase button. In the end all say and done I believe I have a very good flash. No regrets.  But back to the thermal protection that cause all the anguish. I did my research.  I read comments at Amazon, read many reviews and comments from professional photographers but they all said the same thing. Great flash but... I read comments about using only certain type of batteries or batteries from certain manufacturers and even some that didn't understand all the fuss because they never experience the problem. When I first received the flash I did my own test. I hit the flash manual button over and over again trying different batteries to the point where I was satisfied I would not have the problem. Then a few months later it happened. I was in Chicago shooting a birthday party and I was continuously shooting couples as they came down a dance line and the flash stopped working. Sure enough the thermal protection circuit kicked in. Now the only difference between my test and the actual shoot is that I was using the SD-8A battery pack, however, I don't feel the SD-8A was the cause of the problem. The batteries in the flash were so hot I could not hold them but this was not unusual I had this same situation of hot batteries with my SB-800 flash after a long shoot. That experience as well as some of the comments I read makes me think that the best option is to just turn the thermal protection off.  Yes it will get hot but I would rather do that then to worry about when the flash is going to cut off. So I've turned it off and have for about a month been shooting without it.. So I've turned it off and have for about a month been shooting without it.
B002QH2NUA|4.0|Just watched the DVD - what a great sounding, well-filmed concert!!  Excellent selection of songs from Paul and his killer band!  You get a lot of unexpected rockers like \\"Flaming Pie\\" and \\"Mrs Vanderbilt\\" plus newer ones like \\"Highway\\", \\"Dance Tonight\\" and \\"Only Mama Knows\\" - - along with the usual classics -- it's a great mix of Macca.  And let me just say that 2 CD's (33 songs) and a DVD w/ 33 songs for this price is about the best deal that you can find these days.  I snagged it on the marketplace for even cheaper.  It comes in a quad-fold cardboard digi-pak Well packaged, very sturdy - well done w/ decent liner notes.  If you're a fan, you'll have a lot of fun with this one!!  One of Paul's better live albums!  4 stars![[ASIN:B002QH2NUA Good Evening New York City [2 CD + 1 DVD Combo]]]<br /><br />Now if they would only remaster Wings Over America one day [hopefully they do!]
B002VKE0XA|4.0|I love horror movies, have seen many. I watched this by myself at home today, alone and I thought it was amazing. Perhaps not a \\"Horror\\" movie by todays standards but anyone with a brain and the patience of at least a 7 year old, would find this movie frightening. Even the ending was downright creepy as heck. A very, solid movie that should keep you on the edge throughout. I cant believe those who are saying that its boring???? Man, I couldnt keep my eyes off the screen for sake of perhaps missing something. Put down your IPods, Cell Phones and DSs while you are watching movies there kids!!!!!
B002SJIO5E|4.0|I saw this movie in theaters and purchased the Blu-Ray because I became of a fan of it. This not Star Wars or Star Trek. So people don't be surprised if we don't see cute cuddly alien creatures having beers in cantinas. This science fiction, South African style. I liked the story, though you kinda knew what was going to happen. I like the appeal of taking the first 20 minutes of the film and making it seem like a documentary. Though I know that's one of the things most people hated, I remember hearing that people actually got upset that that is what they thought it was and some of them even threw their copy in the trash. Like I said, a new take on sci-fi, it's a take I like, even though others don't. The look has amazing quality and the sound is amazing. I received on time and undamaged.
B002NXSRVG|1.0|This movie was complete garbage from beginning to end.  If you followed GI Joe as a kid, this movie will just leave you dumbstruct.  First off, the plot was so weak that it made my stomach turn.  Second, the characters were not even close to the mark, not to mention nothing like the original.  The creators of this film simple used the name GI Joe to get people to the theaters.  Well, good job and mission accomplish.  However, the result is a complete an total let down.  Hell, I could have made a movie ten times better then these morons.  Come on, Cobra Commander a good guy turned bad, ditto for the Baroness, really give me a freakin break here.  Did the movie have some special effects, sure, but that's about all it had.  The actors were sub par, in fact quite pathetic even in most cases.  I am completely disgusted and wish that I never wasted my time watching such a piece of trash.  People, do not waste you time with this lame attempt at bringing GI Joe to the big screen.  The movie is indeed quite laughable and a mockery of GI Joe.  Hopefully, someone brillant takes the name and remakes it in a much better fashion suited for GI Joe.  Let us hope and pray that this movie dies out and there is never, ever, ever a sequel and that there is not even a notion to create one.  If we could only be so lucky.  Yet, I am sure that some jackass will do it, becasue apparently garbage sells these days, because people are gullable enuough to go watch the crap they are putting out these days.  Save yourself some time and take a pass on this one, you will thank me in the end.  If I could I'd actually give this movie no stars, because that is what it deserves, unfortunately that is not an option.
B002VPE1AM|4.0|I had to luxury of seeing this movie in IMAX 3D with my friend and it was one of the most visually stunning films I've ever seen. The colors, the textures and the physics are truly amazing. James Cameron has raised the bar again. Now he'll have other directors like George Lucas and Michael Bay nipping at his heels. The story I can't say the same for. Maybe it's cause I've seen it done over and over again; Pocahontas, Dances With Wolves, The Last Samurai. I could already tell where the story was going 20 minutes in. So I say for no-brainer leave the world behind entertainment, see it in IMAX 3D.
B002PMV9FG|2.0|It's been a long time since I read the book so I can't comment on the many plot elements left out, so I am judging the movie as a movie.  As such I was not impressed.  I will admit that the visual darkness is appropriate to the darkness of the plot, but this seemed to extend into the very acting; EVERYTHING was overlaid by a blanket of darkness and slowness.  It seemed to me that the actors were all told to deliver their lines like apathetic depressed people.  There were so many pauses in the middle of sentences, lines that seemed not to convey their characters appropriately.  Hogwarts ceased to feel like Hogwarts with the removal of all color and light.  Even the most intense and emotional scenes (Harry and Dumbledore at the underground lake and onwards) felt limp and drained.  I hoped for something truly scary at the lake scene, but the book was more intense than what we got!  (OK, I just lapsed into comparing it to the book!)    Clearly a lot of book plot was left out, but even what remained was not cohesive and did not work for me.
B001QXE0OC|1.0|Ordered item for Christmas for my daughter, and have never received it even though I was sent an e-mail stating it had been shipping.  I contacted the seller and I have not received any reply from them.  I rate this item as a zero!

B002T9H2ME|5.0|\\"Moon\\", the 2009 sci-fi independent film written and directed by Duncan Jones is a multi-award winning film which was shot for $5 million.  Featuring a screenplay adaptation by Nathan Parker, composer Clint Mansell (\\"Blood: The Last Vampire\\", \\"Doom\\", \\"Sahara\\") and cinematography by Gary Shaw (\\"Space Chase\\").<br /><br />The film received positive reviews from critics and had a limited release in a few theaters worldwide but the film made over $7 million worldwide and now the film receives its Blu-ray and DVD release stateside on Jan. 12, 2010.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"Moon\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1) and with a budget of only $5 million for a sci-fi indie film (compared to \\"Sunrise\\", another indie sci-film made for $50 million), you can only wonder how the crew was going to pull this one off and sure enough, they managed quite well.<br /><br />Picture quality is quite solid as you can see the rocks and craters in the lunar surface with a very good amount of detail.  The CG work is quite impressive and skin tones are natural with one of the Sam's looking really sick and pale, while blacks are nice and deep.  You can see the skin pores and bruises of Sam Bell, blood stains on the skin to the stains and post-it note residue that can be seen on the surface of GERTY.  A good amount of detail inside the lunar base and outside in the lunar surface.<br /><br />There is a fine layer of grain and for the most part, the filmmakers managed to make things work with the budget that they had.  I was very impressed with the lunar sequences and the CG work.<br /><br />As for the lossless audio, audio is presented in English, French, Portuguese 5.1 DTS-HD MA and Spanish 5.1. Dialogue from Sam and GERTY are clear and understandable.  The soundtrack is very well done as you can hear the rovers and the harvesters on the lunar surface.  Each boom goes quite nicely via LFE and scenes that include surround and rear surround usage.<br /><br />The film really has a good amount of kick through the bass featured in the special effects and one can expect their subwoofer(s) to be put into use with this film.  Music by Clint Mansell is well done and definitely sets the mood for the scenes in the movie.  But for the most part, I was very amazed by the lossless soundtrack for this independent sci-fi film.  Well done!<br /><br />Subtitles are in English, English SDH, Spanish, Portuguese and French.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Moon\\" comes with the following special features in standard definition, English stereo and Spanish & Portuguese subtitles:<br /><br />  * Commentary with Writer/Director Duncan Jones, Director of Photography Gary Shaw, Concept Designer Gavin Rothery and Production Designer Tony Noble - An upbeat commentary that is more about the technical side of the film and the guys joking around about certain scenes.  A more in-depth talk about the scenes of the film, the props used and how certain scenes were shot.<br />  * Commentary with Writer/Director Duncan Jones and Producer Stuart Fenegan - A commentary that discusses the making of the film, how they would work with Sam Rockwell, the production side of the film and more.<br />  * \\"Whistle\\" a Short Film by Duncan Jones - (28:46) A short film by director Duncan Jones about an assassin that uses satellites to target his victims in London but then the assassin starts to feel remorse and ends up being the target.<br />  * The Making of Moon - (16:18) The making of \\"Moon\\" featuring director Duncan Jones, actor Sam Rockwell, other cast and crew discussing their experiences of making the film and behind-the-scenes footage.<br />  * Creating the Visual Effects - (11:08) Featuring the visual effects supervisor Simon Stanley-Clamp of Cinesite talking about the visual effects of the film.  From the creation of motion control,<br />  * Science Center Q&A with Director Duncan Jones - (20:40) A screening was given at the Science Center at NASA's Space Center Houston and the following Q&A is featured.<br />  * Filmmaker's Q&A at the Sundance Film Festival - (11:15) The intro by director Duncan Jones before the film screening and the Q&A session after the screening of \\"Moon\\" at the Sundance Film Festival.<br />  * Theatrical Trailer - (2:06) The original theatrical trailer for \\"Moon\\".<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />I have to admit that when I first saw the trailer, I thought that \\"Moon\\" would be a hybrid \\"2001: A Spacey Odyssey\\" and \\"Solaris\\" style of film and that it would lack originality.<br /><br />But after watching this film, I was quite impressed by the storyline and also how awesome this low budget independent sci-film looked.  This film really rivals a lot of the big budget sci-fi films through a wonderful performance by Sam Rockwell.  The fact that he has to act with himself and making sure the two are similar people but different in circumstances because one has been in space for three years alone, while the other has been there for only a week is pretty interesting.  Again Rockwell is amazing in this film.  Kevin Spacey's voice as GERTY definitely gave the film an eerie feeling and for the most part, it's the visual surrounding of the film and how the visual effects really played apart in creating that lonely lunar atmosphere was well-done.<br /><br />In fact, there are so many times throughout the film that I thought we were going to get the Solaris craziness, or crazy robot ala \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" or humans just losing it in space ala \\"Sunshine\\" and \\"Armageddon\\".  But Duncan Jones who was influenced by sci-fi films from the 70's and 80's really did a solid job of creating a film that may have borrowed some themes (or pay homage) from those classic sci-films but managed to make \\"Moon\\" his own sci-fi film.<br /><br />The whole concept of Helium-3 and harvesting it for energy for Earth was quite intriguing but also to learn that even in space, corporate greed is still in full-effect and the concept of long distance relationship (from Earth to the moon) was well-written.  And a few other important things that are part of the film that I don't want to spoil for anyone but Duncan Jones did a really good job in bringing his story to the big screen.<br /><br />And even with the $5 million dollar budget, I suppose I was not expecting too much from the film and thought everything would be shot outdoors.  But set design was pretty solid and the CG work, absolutely awesome looking and it all looks vibrant and detailed on Blu-ray.  And it was great to know there were a good number of special features including two major Q&A's included on this release.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Moon\\" was more than I expected and that is a great thing.  The film featured a solid performance by both Rockwell and Spacey, a solid screenplay and the right people to make this film look very awesome!<br /><br />An awesome independent sci-fi film and psychological thriller worth watching and even worth owning!  Highly recommended!15) The intro by director Duncan Jones before the film screening and the Q&A session after the screening of \\"Moon\\" at the Sundance Film Festival.      * Theatrical Trailer - (2:06) The original theatrical trailer for \\"Moon\\".

B00003CWRX|2.0|I just saw this movie last night, then read all these reviews.  I have to say, I wasn't too impressed.  Overdone, over-dramatic, way too self-important and smug - stereotypes of the good whistleblower and the evil corporations, I've had it with Hollywood, which has popularized the \\"coolness\\" of smoking since the 40's, maybe even the 30's.  The acting was good enough.  But to me, it's just another political message from Hollywood.  And what was the end result of all this angst?  A multi-billion dollar settlement, most of which went to lawyers, and the cigarette companies are still operating as usual. The government could have banned cigarettes, but they want the tax revenue. People smoke because they want to, and no one is going to stop them until they decide they want to stop. And come on, everyone knew way before this 'expose' that cigarettes caused cancer.  Did they beef up the nicotine properties?  I guess so, but again, if cigarettes cause cancer, they cause cancer, whether there is a little more or less nicotine per cigarette.  Hey, I hate cigarettes and never smoked.  But let's get real here.    By the way, I saw \\"Avatar\\" last week and again, the political message and stereotypes- evil Americans against hippie-tree worshipping pagans, ruined it for me.
1402521154|4.0|I echo the positive comments made by thousands of other readers, but must warn about the unabridged audio version.  A professional voice should have been chosen in place of the author.  After listening to several chapters the monotone was so difficult to follow I had to give up and buy the Kindle version. I hear that Stanley Tucci is incredible in the movie and look forward to that later this week.

B002SEW5WW|5.0|I'm with the majority. I love this album. It is hard to find a album that great from start to finish. If your a fan of up tempo music you may not like this. It does get to slow at times. If your laid back and love feeling in your music you will love this. It's all about your taste. The production is top notch and the song writing is very good. In closing, it is one of the best for 2009. The reviewers hit the nail on the head. Get this CD!!!

B002R0F3Q2|4.0|It's simple. Alicia is an incredible songwriter, and her talents are seriously showcased in \\"Try Sleeping With a Broken Heart,\\" \\"Love Is Blind,\\" \\"Empire State Of Mind (Part II) Broken Down\\" and \\"Put It In a Love Song.\\" And she sounds amazing. But personally, I think that the album is a little over-run with ballads and I definitely prefer her jazzy upbeat stuff (\\"Dragon Days,\\" anyone?), but if you're even a semi-Alicia fan, the album is a must for the songs listed above!
B001SN78JO|4.0|Just say YES to this movie!  Hilarious performance by Jim Carrey.  The Red Bull part was my favorite :)
B002VPE1AM|5.0|This movie is full of action, suspense, discovery, romance, the bad guys are punished, and faith is rewarded.  At the beginning, I was reminded of how much the Native Americans taught the settlers and how greed can destroy the most lush of paradices.  We are reminded that being different doesn't make us wrong.

0061537969|5.0|This is a very touching tale about life in a family from the perspective of the family dog. I know that, when put that way, it sounds cheesey.  That is far from the truth.      Enzo was adopted as a puppy by a simgle young man and takes us through the growth into a family that he experiences. I am a dog lover, but sometimes viewed our dog as a peripheral member of the family.  That changed after reading this story.  In many ways, Enzo was the glue that connected family members.  When bad things happen, as they do for us all, Enzo's role becomes more evident.  His perspective and spirituality (!!) allow us to view those events  from a new angle.    Our family dog passed away several months ago and this book has helped me deal with her passing.  Give yourself the gift of this book.  You will have a new respect for the canine soul.

After reading the book, you will undertans better why the band sound the way they do, why they sing about what they sing, make the music they do, play live the songs they play live and in general, all of their secrets.    5 stars
0375836675|2.0|This was fun to read and the story was mysterious enough to keep me interested. On the other hand, the whole plot and the characters are so artificial and pretentious. It  also tries to be moral in a preachy way. I often had the impression that there was a sermon lurking behind the facade of storytelling and \\"cool\\" characters. Then again, this is probably what so many like about it.
0385504225|3.0|I usually enjoy getting lost in Dan Brown's books, but this book, I felt, had way too much unnecessary information.  Sometimes it seemed to babble on & on & on.  Though it was a page turner for me, I really struggled towards the end. I was more excited about finishing the book then learning what happened; and even after finding out the ultimate end, it was extremely anti-climatic.  Dull. No expressions of \\"no way!!!\\" or \\"wow!\\"    Will I be purchasing other books written by Brown in the future, yes.  But this book is strike one for me.
0385504225|1.0|Have you ever had that burning sensation in your chest? No, not heart-burn. More deadly (if possible) than that. I mean the feeling when you are reading a novel, watching a movie, or playing a video game and you get SO impatient for it to move along. You start clenching your jaw. You crack your knuckles again, even though you just cracked them two minutes earlier. The feeling that is the perfect mix of annoyance and impatience burns in you. That's what reading THE LOST SYMBOL is like. It is excruciating. Yes. Excruciating...that is the word of choice to explain Dan Brown's latest \\"novel.\\" (Dear Dan Brown: Thank you for kindly putting the words, \\"A Novel\\" on the front cover of your book. Without them, I would have mistaken this book for a slush-pile reject.)    What a terrible, terrible book.    Six years ago, Dan Brown caused all sorts of controversy with his novel THE DA VINCI CODE. It sold a bajillion copies, and forced the whole \\"Religious Conspiracy\\" sub-genre into focus. It was also a really poorly written novel. I have read all of Dan Brown's work. From DIGITAL FORTRESS to the newly printed THE LOST SYMBOL, Dan Brown manages to do one thing with remarkable consistency:    Become a worse writer with each novel.    Don't worry, this novel is totally different from the prior two Langdon novels. See, Langdon goes to a famous national building, and receives a cryptic phone call about how he needs to solve a mystery that only LANGDON can solve! He then discovers a bloody clue in the middle of the building. Following a train of interweaving clues about the Freemasons, Langdon is joined by his lovely female companion, Kathleen, as they chase--or are they chased by?--the eeeeeevil Mal'akh. What they discover will change EVERYTHING! Nothing is as it seems...    Oh wait. Everything is exactly as it seems, because this is the same plot at ANGELS & DEMONS and THE DA VINCI CODE. America: what is wrong with you?    Robert Langdon. He marveled us with his professorial skillsin, what I consider the only enjoyable Langdon book, ANGELS & DEMONS. A lot has changed since that novel. In THE LOST SYMBOL, Langdon--in his third \\"adventure\\"--has managed to become dense and narrow-minded. He seems incapable of putting his famed intellect to use during the novel, and is relegated to responding to ANY question or situation with a bewildered, \\"What?!\\" Now before you ask, yes, the \\"?!\\" is actually used in the novel at least two or three times per chapter (there are 133 chapters...you do the math). If you have to use more than one punctuation type at the end of a sentence, the only thing you are showing the reader is that you have no real writing ability. Young writers take note.    Amidst the endless repetitive descriptions, we as readers are made to suffer an endless stream of \\"telling\\" instead of \\"showing.\\" The few times Brown manages to \\"show\\" us what is going on, he immediately precedes or follows it by telling us the exactly same thing. It became so infuriating, that by Chapter 9 I wanted to gouge my eyes out. To illustrate another example of formulaic writing that Brown has become famous for, here is his Dialogue Formula:    Person 1: \\"Have you heard of [insert topic here]?\\"  Person 2: \\"No, what is it?\\"  Person 1: \\"[insert poorly veiled information dump here]\\"  Person 2: \\"I don't understand.\\"  Person 1: \\"[insert the exact same explanation for a second time]\\"  Person 2: \\"So what you are saying is [insert 3rd identical explanation]\\"  Person 1: \\"No, you aren't listening. What I said was [insert 4th explanation-100% identical to the previous 3 explanations]\\"  Person 2: \\"Ah, I see.\\"  Person 1: \\"Good. Now have you heard of [insert topic here]?\\"    Repeat all steps for as many filler pages as needed.  Seriously.    How about pacing? Brown is known for his pacing isn't he? Two things here. First, his pacing is false. In order to create this false sense of \\"break-neck speed,\\" he ends each chapter on a cliff-hanger. I felt like there should have been a voice-over saying \\"dun-dun-DUUUN\\" playing as you turned the last page of every chapter. When Brown finally DOES manage to build up some sort of pace, he ruins it with a flashback.    In a particularly boring flashback early on (in the first few chapters), Langdon is RUSHING to give a speech (he only has THREE MINUTES TO GET THERE!), and he lapses into a flashback. In addition to bringing the pace to a screeching halt, we see, in an academic setting, that Langdon is supposed to be INSANELY smart. SO MUCH BETTER THAN EVERYONE! His students believe and hang on every word, no matter how ridiculous. So, if he is so smart, why is he such an idiot later, and so slow on the uptake? Why does he have to be told everything like he is a mentally deficient high-school student? The answer? Dan Brown's writing is so poor that this is the only way he knows how to express himself, and these sections serve as a vehicle for information dumps. It is also humorous that a security guard, early on in the story, makes the exact same observation of Langdon. Pro Tip: If the characters you are writing think your main PoV is stupid, so will the readers. This will undermine your work.    Logic flaws aside (if I stopped to mention all of them, I would be transcribing the full novel), and forgetting the PoV switching problems, one of the main problems is the plethora of clichés. We have the super-secret division of the CIA, and she is a four-foot tall Asian woman with a superiority complex. And she is deformed. How about the damsel in distress that is the target of a hideously disfigured super-villain? Yep, THE LOST SYMBOL has that too. Even James Bond movies have finally moved beyond these clichés.    I would be remiss if I didn't talk about the villain of the novel. Never-mind that his big reveal at the end of the novel is telegraphed from the moment certain characters are introduced. I don't want to talk about that. I want to talk about this:    How to Build a Cliché Villain the Dan Brown Way  1) Fall for every trick that the dumb hero/heroine throws at you.  2) After being outwitted somehow, point menacingly at the hero/heroine.  3) If you can manage, be a religious fanatic of some sort.  4) Tell the hero/heroine all your secret plans and/or your secret past in a dramatic moment.  5) Think--at least 3 times early in the novel--that destiny is guiding you. Feel free to think this up until the moment you are killed due to your stupidity (see point #8 below)  6) Make the hero/heroine think that they killed you years ago. It makes your entrance much more dramatic...especially when combined with point #4 above.  7) When given the opportunity, study yourself naked in a body-length mirror.  8) Don't actually kill the hero/heroine when you have the chance. Leave them to be discovered so they can come kill you later. Be sure to act surprised later when they show up.  9) Have a super-secret lair within your home--preferably hidden by a secret door. However, the key element here is to leave obvious evidence for people to find so they can enter the lair and discover all your plans in case they didn't catch them in point #4 above.    No, seriously, this all happens in THE LOST SYMBOL.    Don't worry citizens, Robert Langdon is here to save the day. Will he stun us with his intellect? Of course not. He WILL however use his experiences from prior novels to solve everything with the trusty anagram. And when that fails, blind luck will do, as will an epiphany--nothing will trigger the epiphany other than Brown deciding it is time to move the story along to the next idiotic conversation (see above formula).    Are you getting the drift here? Dan Brown's THE LOST SYMBOL should never have been printed. The writing skill is sub-6th Grade level, and his story is contrived and cliché. An interesting observation: When you talk to most people who have read Brown's Robert Langdon novels, they almost always like the first one they read most. Why? Because it is the same plot over and over again. It is like the mystery version of a Harlequin Romance Novel. So, it shouldn't be any surprise that this third novel is even worse. IT'S THE SAME NOVEL...AGAIN! Of course, when you stop to think about what the \\"Big Problem\\" was that everyone in the novel was trying to prevent, you realize just how terrible the \\"novel\\" is. So. Absurd.    Don't read this book. Ever. Wait for the inevitable movie. It has NO CHOICE but to be better than the novel. If you really want to know about all the Freemason stuff, go get a non-fiction book or two about them. They will be better paced, and more entertaining than THE LOST SYMBOL.
B0000524CY|5.0|this is a movie that sent chills down my spine when i was growing up. i had to have it for my collection and now that my daughter is grown it is one of her favorits also.
0446672653|5.0|OMG this book is sooo amazing....one of my favorite books I have ever read! It will thrust you into a \\"different reality\\" and you will just know that everything that you see in this world is not real. Only LOVE is real! Honestly a Hollywood movie needs to be made about the characters in this non-fiction book. Yes it is non-fiction! I started reading it because I was dating what I thought was a soul mate at the time. If you want to verify if someone is your soul mate, read this book! I could not put it down, I read it so quickly. Dr. Weiss' writing style is very easy to read as well. Buy (or read) this book, you will not be disappointed!
B001IAOEXU|4.0|After trying the control with one of these, you will feel that it's something natural. If you take it out, you'll probably notice that something is wrong with the controller. The only downside I've experienced is that sometimes while I'm playing (it has happened like 2-3 times in a week or so) it comes off (when using it), and it's not exactly that I'm pressing it that hard.
B002RSDW80|5.0|I thought this movie was wonderful. Meyrl Streep did an awesome job of portraying Julia with her distinct voice and manners. It is a great story of two women that live at two different times, whose lives are connected through a book. Their search for meaning in their ordinary lives is touching. I give the show five stars. It kept me smiling and laghing through out and left me with a warm feeling in the end.
B000WMFZMY|4.0|A great film! Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren give impressive performances in this rather long production. It may be long, but it is a BIG story.<br /><br />In the period in which this film is set Spain is divided between Moors and Christians. Christian kingdoms are gradually gaining the upper hand but the threat of a new Muslim invasion from North Africa hangs over Moor and Christian alike. The harangue of Beni Yusef at the beginning sounds like it could have come right out of an al-Qaida propaganda video.<br /><br />Charlton Heston plays el Cid, a Spanish noble who is respected by Christian and Moor alike. His is a struggle to fight the invaders while trying to make a king worthy of Spain.<br /><br />There are alliances and changes in allegiance and even I had trouble remembering which kingdom was which in this fragmented version of Spain. But the movie speaks to honor, courage and nobility and as such is a wonderful movie.
1439138311|5.0|Not really a story about Brooklyn as much as a story &lt;u>in&lt;/u> Brooklyn.  Think how terrifying it would be for a young girl to be sent off to American on her own with only one man to count on for a home, job, friends, and a life.  The man is Father Flood, a priest who said he knew Eilis' parents when they were young.  Eilis' mother can't remember him or his family but still they take him at his word, trust him because he's a priest,  and off she goes to find her way in the new world.  Luckily, he does produce: a boarding house, a job and funds for schooling.<br /><br />Eilis' is a perfect character as a passive young Irish girl, doing as she was told and not even considering arguing.  It's more the norm than you think.  The Irish of old were so used to being ordered around and tossed around and pushed around that the spirit is broken.  Eilis, as the youngest child and a girl, no doubt felt that doubly; self esteem just doesn't come with the package.  Only in these last few years of the economic Irish Tiger has the true strength of the Island's character emerged.<br /><br />Given a taste of her own worth and a chance to prove herself, Eilis knows what she really wants. She succeeds at her classes, at work and in quietly spurning her boss's lesbian advances.  When she meets a strong Italian man with a loving intact family, she's suddenly awakened to the other options in life. Of course her ties to Ireland break to the surface when she returns; we all long for the safety of the past.  Knowing where her future lies is the real proof of adulthood.<br /><br />I have not read any of Toibin's books, but I surely will.  He opened up a whole new vista of what it was like to emigrate.  Not the world of the coffin ships and fleeing the famine but now, here, in modern time.  You don't think such an adventure would occur in the middle of the 20th century, but there it is.
B0029O08WA|5.0|I love this soundtrack, it goes so well the scenes in the movies and this cd is on repeat play at work. Absolutely love it! It was a good way to get introduced to new music I have been searching for.
1416550542|4.0|Ordinarily I hate a book that lets me suss out the ending but Ms. Morton switches gears in so many directions & tosses in so many tangential twists that I can forgive her for using the most logical conclusion.  What fun, as she adds another branch to her plot and hangs up another curious character so easily and naturally connected.  Though I must say I still have a very hard time with a four year old left on a ship hiding behind barrels--even in 1913.  Abandoned?  Hardly.  But why would you leave so young a child alone in the first place?  At any rate, the story of each of the three generations of women captures your attention and makes it hard to put the book down.<br /><br />All of Ms. Morton's characters are so easy to read: the harridan Mrs. Swindell, Rose's loving husband/artist, Lord Montrachet's hopelessly protracted search for his lost sister, and the well-meaning, if incompetent, Dr. Matthews.  Even as you catch on to the machinations of Rose's evil mother, you can anticipate her next bit of nastiness. She does not disappoint, right to the very end.<br /><br />I'm betting money that the connection to Frances Hodgson-Burnett was the germ that brought this tale to the light.  Truly, it's the garden that holds the key, isn't it?  I'm always a sucker for fairies and characters who believe in them.  The Authoress, like many brought up in poverty, has that vivid imagination weaned on hunger and deprivation, which fairy stories require.  Who's to blame her for thinking that at last, her fairy tale might come true.  As Bloody Mary sang, \\"if you haven't got a dream, how you gonna have a dream come true\\".<br /><br />So the end of Nell's tale and the solution to her appearance in Australia reaches it's conclusion as expected.  She does indeed soften the conclusion in letting the garden tie the characters together.  It's not the ending I wanted but I kept reading in the desperate hope that it might not be so.  After all, I still believe in fairies.
B002ZMZBD2|4.0|As I settled into my seat enshrouded by the deepening darkness in the theater I fully expected that Guy Ritchie's film interpretation of the great sleuth of Baker Street, \\"Sherlock Holmes,\\" would be at times unusual, and indeed this proved true in many ways.  What caught me by surprise was Hans Zimmer's musical take on Holmes.  Perhaps expecting something closer to Miklos Rozsa's score for \\"The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes,\\" I must admit I was momentarily taken aback by what seemed jaunty and at times almost frenzied use of strings, orchestra and synthesizer (perhaps more than we know).  But it also worked very well with what was happening on the screen, again a bit of a different view of Holmes, and this was not to say it was bad or wrong.  Indeed, it all came off quiet well.  As to the film and Robert Downey, Jr.'s portrayal of Holmes and Jude Law's interpretation of Dr. Watson, well, it might not have been all that different from the original stories and books, after all, many of the stereotypes we have come to expect were born of the imagination of early illustrators and films rather that the original sources.  And who knows what Holmes' sounded like with his violin.  The music certainly fit the images of Holmes and Watson that were unfolded on film.  What did strike me as the film went on is that Zimmer's main thematic material reminded me very much of a John Barry theme for a late 1960s television production:  \\"The Persuaders.\\"  Indeed, I should think if Barry had done a full score for that series it may have turned out a bit like this.  This is not a comment made lightly or with intent to upset fans of Hans Zimmer, of which I am one, or this very talented composer.  It is meant as a compliment.  And compliments are due for a score that surprised and worked.  Solid production values and really tremendous packaging by Watertower Music with digital download extras should you wish.
B002R5V7MG|4.0|This is rated 5 for performance, 3 for sound.<br /><br />All in all, this is a terrfic interpretation of the Mahler 1st, lushly and thrillingly played by the LA Phil, which is long overdue its deserved recognition.<br /><br />However, DG seems intent on bringing us Maestro Dudamel largely through the medium of recorded live performances.  While that does cut the budget nicely, it can result in less than ideal quality of sound, which is the case here. On the positive side, the engineers turn up the volume during the quiet and slow sections, letting us hear details that are missing in typical symphonic recordings.  And the excessive reverberation provides a wonderfully warm patina over the entire performance.<br /><br />On the negative side, the reverb is way overdone. Brasses have an \\"otherwordly\\" sound to them like something out of Hearts of Space. Lower frequencies are reproduced not as the musical sound of drums and bass fiddles, but as some sort of generic rumble,like the sound of a passing subway train or railroad car.<br /><br />Much of the excitement that Maestro Dudamel is so clearly trying to establish is blunted by the tendency of the engineers to turn the volume way down during the louder and faster sections, particularly at the end of the first movement.  In the video we see the conductor clearly signal \\"forte\\" (louder) and we see the musicians digging in.  However, the sound on the recording actually gets quieter at that point. It is hoped that DG will provide better sound quality for the remaining recordings in Maestro Dudamel's Mahler cycle.<br /><br />If you are a Dudamel fan, this DVD provides a solid momento of an auspicious occassion. However, it does not replace Bernstein (Sony) or Walter (Sony) or Leinsdorf (London Phase 4 LP) as my favorite recordings of Mahler's magnificent symphony.
B00003CXSP|4.0|Guten Abend Mein Herrin,  I don't write spoilers. This is a very good movie, & a fine member of the SotL storyline. Really a nice expansion on the plot. One problem: Julianne Moore. I've nothing against her, but feel she let this film down badly. She simply didn't \\"Bring it.\\" I thought Foster was snubbed for this role when it was released. In order to have the money to pay for Hopkins. I was wrong. She took a pass on it. IMHO, Ms.Moore barely acted @all in this. An unemotional Poker Face through most of the film. You get little or no sense of her turmoil, motivation, or pain. Looks like this is the last in the series, a fine job.

0060555661|4.0|This book is very fundamental to the concept of investing but should be used together with books from real traders and portfolio managers. The works of Linda Raschke and Toby Crabel are the finest in terms of learning to trade and make money. If you fan find these on Amazon or Ebay - go for it, even that they may be out of print. The author of this book is academician and the book reads as such. Some people swear by it as classic, i think it is useless used by itself. You need to back it up with the insight of others professional investors. Happy reading.
0810982862|3.0|The artwork is pretty nice stuff, there are some unusual photoshop cut outs on pictures mixed media things that are sort of 'so-so' that don't really deserve a full page. however some of the pre-production painting are great. I wish there was more pencil work. Seems like a little thin on the variety of work. Looks like Cameron was afraid of anything being revealed that did not agree with his vision.     Please don't read the text in the book. It is the kind of self grandizement that makes you want to puke. \\"We invented a whole new world for the first time ever\\" and bla, bla, bla. I loved the film, effects, music, and storytelling. The story itself is pretty formulaic, but I'm alright with that too.     The thing that really bothers me is they seem to have escaped memory of all the influences that have gone into this artwork. I've been scouring over art books for 25 years, and there are not a whole lot of new ideas in this book or the movie. I can touch Syd Mead in the metal 'amps'. I can remember the first Azia album cover with 'dragons' that have very similar shape, coloring, and patterns. And I'm thinking about making a website to list all the stolen ideas that went into this movie, and apparantly into this pre-production art.
0446567337|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  It was different for me to read from the perspective of a man.  I kept reminding myself that it was John who was speaking, not Savannah.  I hated for the book to end.  It was bitter/sweet, but lovely.  To me it was just as good as The Notebook and a Walk to Remember.  Highly recommend it.
B00003CXC6|5.0|Rashomon, one of Kurosawa's masterpieces, is a deceptively clever and moving portrayal of human nature. You'll read many reviews and commentaries on how the film is about \\"the subjectivity of truth\\", but this couldn't be further from the truth! The film is about the human tendency to DENY the truth, which is both real and essential to the growth of the individual.<br /><br />Kurosawa himself said of the film's message: \\"Human beings are unable to be honest with themselves about themselves. They cannot talk about themselves without embellishing. This script portrays such human beings--the kind who cannot survive without lies to make them feel they are better people than they really are.\\"<br /><br />The film makes no statement about the reality of truth, or even its attainability, but instead about our unwillingness to take an objective look at ourselves. The films characters embody the variety of responses and choices we take in life: selfish cynicism to moral despair, to true responsibility in the face of an unpleasant view of our true natures. The characters are similar in that they lie to themselves, to \\"save face\\", and to see themselves as better than they actually are. And yet they differ in their willingness to suffer the pain of a view of themselves.<br /><br />It is in this willingness that the road to truth exists, and self-knowledge is the key in Kurosawa's vision. The final scene is hauntingly beautiful in its symbolism: the man who has taken the first step to self-knowledge bears the child - his own soul - into the world.<br /><br />An absolute classic and highly recommended!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I read this book after Rob Thomas tweeted about it, so I decided to check it out. I was thrown off a bit by the fact that it is written from a dogs point of view....but I am glad that did not sopt me from reading it. Any dog lover will LOVE this book. There are so many little life lessons wrapped up in the beautiful story. This should be a MUST read for everyone!  I haven't come across many books that are so good that it makes it hard to start reading another one, but this was one of them. I finished this book almost 3 months ago and I am still having a hard time.  Kudos to the author....and 2 thumbs up! You did an awesome job. :o)
B002IYEQR4|5.0|I decided to buy a blu-ray player and this was the first disc that I have bought in blu-ray. An excellent choice as the picture, sound etc is brilliant. I just have one question: I have not bothered with the digital copy yet and would like to know what happens when it reaches its expiry date? Does this mean that you can't download it anymore, but that you will still be able to watch the theatrical version on the disc.
0143116177|2.0|This book is a financial history which covers the history of money, bonds, stocks, property and China.  I think the book suffer from several weaknesses.  Firstly it covers many topics, some of which are clearly outside the author's core competency.  He describes confidence intervals thus \\" the statement that 40 per cent of the balls in the jar are white, at a confidence interval of 95 per cent, implies that the precise value lies somewhere between 35 and 45 per cent\\".  This demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the topic at hand and it causes the reader to wonder whether other sections of the book are afflicted with the same misunderstanding.  Secondly I'm left with the impression that the book stumbles from topic to topic.  At no point to I get the feeling that the author is presenting a piece of literature with a cohesive underlying thesis.  It just seems to be a bunch of facts thrown in together like an omelette.  Actual author insights are few and far between.  Lastly I find the writing style quite dry and not to my taste.  All in all there are better books out there for this topic.
B000NQRE0K|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. Yes, I know that it is not very historically accurate in the details, I was a European history major in university. However it is true in the broad strokes that it paints, and the quality of this production - the clarity, the sound, the extras - are absolutely outstanding, and well worth the ticket price.

B000A88EVE|1.0|I may not be the best one to review this movie as I saw it about 18 years ago. I was 12 and my mom rented it for me because she thought it was sci-fi and looked like something I might like. If she knew what she had rented she'd have been horrified. Now I'll admit I may have been too young to really \\"get\\" this movie, but I do remember it felt like it was five hours long and didn't hold my interest at all. The only reason I didn't turn it off was because I don't walk out on movies.  I kept waiting for something interesting to happen but it just dragged on. The main thing I remember about it is the multiple viewings of David Bowie's Penis. Now I'm not offended by male nudity, but this was kind of ridiculous. I would not suggest this movie to the average viewer and not even to the higher class viewer, which I consider myself to be. This is only for the real cult, art house followers so be warned.
B001NXDSLQ|5.0|The actual event of Woodstock goes beyond simple concert and music footage. The work of capturing history on film must have been daunting. Not only was history captured on film, it was filmed as documentary, too. When it's mentioned that this film won an Oscar as best documentary, \\"of course\\" is the only comment that comes to mind.     The extended version or director's cut is worth the time. When I got this film, I called my neighbors and had a Woodstock evening with food, drink, and, well whatever. It was wonderful to be that young, again, and listen to some of our musical heroes.     This should be required viewing for every generation in the foreseeable future. Enjoy.

B001E5FYS8|4.0|It's an inspiring story about a tight rope walker who pursues his dream of walking across the World Trade Center towers.  He (Philippe Petit) and others planned to do this feat even before the construction of the twin towers was complete.  I think that it's very inspiring in that it shows the power of the human spirit... to pursue your dreams no matter how rediculous it may seem to others.  Philippe obviously didn't do this for fame, money nor prestige only for the satisfaction of accomplishing his dream.    Not to be too critical of the film and the people who made it, because everybody is entitled to their own views.  I think however that  it would have been nice or polite to put in a message in the credits paying tribute to those who have lost their lives in the terrorist attacks of 9/11.  There where native New Yorkers who helped Philippe, including a man who used to have his office in the tower.
B00005JKZV|2.0|First, let me be positive.  The film has some occasionally good footage and a couple of touching moments.  But erg...that's it.<br /><br />So, what stinks:<br /><br />1) The story is dull.  Feels irrelevant.  No tension whatsoever.  A big snooze.  Waste of my time and energy---and clearly a huge waste of money to make the film.<br /><br />2) All the various \\"good\\" races (dwarves, elves, hobbits, men) look like people.  The hobbits look like small, adolescent guys, the dwarf looks like a hairy, small, middle aged man, the men all look like tall, J. Crew manly men, and the elf looks like a slim, blond, too-cool surfer guy.  I much prefer the mental pictures my imagination conjured while reading the book.  This was cheesy.<br /><br />3) The characters are all shallow and lacking in dimension.<br /><br />4) Gollum, who is brilliant in the book, is downright peculiar and not believable in the movie.<br /><br />5) Important plot material from the book is skipped, skimmed over, or changed in unnecessary ways.  I understand that the directors had a lot of material to fit into one movie, but still...they failed.<br /><br />6) The orcs didn't look real.  They looked foolish and bizarre.<br /><br />7) The voices of many of the creatures (orcs, Gollum, ents) didn't sound organic--they sounded annoyingly computer generated.<br /><br />8) The Wormtongue character was cookie-cutter evil.  Although he wasn't Tolkien's most realistic character in the book, the movie does an even worse job with him.<br /><br />9) It felt like the movie was geared for nine year olds...and undiscriminating nine years olds at that.<br /><br />So, my overall assessment:  they should never have made the film.  They should have left it in book form.  But...of course...they had to make it.  There's big money in this.  And let the artistry of the book be damned!

1594488843|5.0|I heard Daniel Pink on NPR and was excited to hear that he had a new book.  I LOVED A Whole New Mind and was hoping that this would be as good.      Pink says that financial incentives for good work are usually counter-productive.  For example - a researcher did an experiment giving people a box of matches, a candle, and a thumbtack and had them find a way to attach a lit candle to the wall.  For half the people they offered a cash reward for the fastest team, for the other half, there was no money involved - they asked them to do it for the fun of it.  Time after time, the people who were competing for cash got slower times than the people who were doing it for fun.      Pink's premise is that people can be extrinsically or intrinsically motivated.  The extrinsically motivated people, according to him, lack the creativity and drive as intrinsically motivated people.  So the key is to foster an intrinsic work force.  He cites study after study showing that when you take something that a person has a natural interest in and tie it to money, that it ceases to be interesting to them - it becomes work.  So the key is to have an environment where people think their jobs are fun.  When they do this they will work late hours, they will be highly creative, and they will be dedicated.      Back in the day when most of us worked in manufacturing, we could offer carrots and sticks to get people to produce more widgets.  We have tried to use the same systems of motivation from the old days of manufacturing to knowledge workers and it has not been effective.    He said that there are three things that are key for a successful company - people have to feel autonomy, they have to strive for mastery of what they do, and they have to feel a sense of purpose.      At the end of the book the author talks about compensation and how to pay people where it doesn't get in the way of their work.      If I could make an analogy about this book, A Whole New Mind is to Malcom Gladwell's Blinkas Drive is to Gladwell's Tipping Point.  What I mean by this is that Both A Whole New Mind as well as Blink are amazing general interest books.  It doesn't matter who you are or what you do, these books are absolutely fascinating.  Both Drive and The Tipping Point are still general interest, but are more focused on practical business applications.  If you are not in the business of motivating people (e.g. you are an entry-level worker bee), this is still a very interesting book, but not as interesting, IMHO, as A whole New Mind.      This said, I still give it an enthusiastic five stars!
B002TO1Z8Q|5.0|I was one of the lucky fans that attended (or experienced,witnessed,lived, etc.) the Final Two gig at Earls Court last August. George Michael was in top form, having fun throughout the evening and provided the ecstatic crowd with flawless performances from his huge catalog of hits. All eras of his 25-year long career were represented: From the Wham! days (\\"Everything She Wants\\" & \\"I'm Your Man\\") up to his latest offerings (\\"An Easier Affair\\" & \\"Feeling Good\\"). The technical setup was astonishing (sound, light, laser beams, the curving LCD Mega-Wall, etc.) but the performances he delivered were the real star of the night.     Don't seek out highlights of the show; the show in its entirety is the highlight of Mr. Michael's illustrative career. It may have taken too long for him to present a live DVD, but bearing in mind the kind of perfectionist he is, he did it the right way.     The only low point (if any) in my opinion is that two of the most distinctive performances of the show were not included in the DVD: \\"Praying for time\\" & \\"Star People\\". On the other hand we get a behind-the-scenes documentary!     I would definitely recommend!   5+ Stars.
B0031Q0XCA|1.0|How do I start with describing this crappy movie?  Romantic comedy - huh?  The movie was trying so hard to be interesting and not be a formulaic movie that it ended up being a choppy mess.  The whole movie seems like it was shot underwater and the dialog and plot seem to have been written by children.  Seriously, I wanted to like this movie . . . my wife and I had been waiting for it to come out on Amazon Downloads so we could rent it.  Too bad we won't ever get that time back.  Yuck!  If you HAVE to watch this movie, you will understand why I gave it 1 star.  Decent soundtrack, so perhaps just buy the CD Soundtrack and skip the movie.
B00006DEF9|5.0|You know, I saw this movie on TV when I was a kid and I loved it. I grew to love it more on the 1st anniversary of the Sept. 11th attacks. My room-mate and I rented it (he had never seen it before) and we watched it. We still paid our respects to those who were taken from us but we were also able to lift our spirits. We try to get together every year to watch it. Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds were phenomenal.
0670021652|5.0|Having read Eat, Pray, Love three times (!) some might consider me an Elizabeth Gilbert junkie.  I just love this woman's voice. I love the way she peels back her shell and lets us listen in to her monkey mind/internal dialogue -- neurosis and all.  I love that I now feel like I know Felipe/Jose and that I've been given a seat of honor at family events.  I'm sure there will be plenty of critics for this book but I won't be one of them.  This was a totally enjoyable read.  I would suggest that anyone considering marriage sit down and read this book -- the messages about the sound reasons one should and should not get married will certainly substitute for all those who haven't a clue what marriage is really about.

1592402690|4.0|First, let me say that I must have read a dozen books about the Beatles through the years and this is perhaps the best. It does something other books haven't managed: it gives a vivid sense of the individual Beatles as persons and how they interacted with one another. However, this real strength of the book is also, I think, its biggest weakness. I can almost imagine Mr. Emerick's editor telling him: \\"Geoff, you've got to spice this story up, give it some color and controversy.\\" Acting on this marketing advice, GE provides very colorful and candid assessments of the four people who were The Beatles.    Geoff Emerick was a junior sound engineer for EMI present during the early Beatles recordings. Unfortunately, he was not present during the recording of Help! and Rubber Soul. But in 1966 he was promoted and became the primary engineer for Revolver and then Sgt. Pepper and Magical Mystery Tour sessions. Unable to deal with the constant bickering, he resigned part way through the White Cover sessions, though he returned for Abbey Road. Because he was an eyewitness to these events, he was in a unique position to offer an inside look at the chemistry and artistry of The Beatles in the studio.    The problem is that he let his personal feelings color his descriptions of the four, or at least that's how it seemed to this reader. For example, he clearly had (and has) the warmest personal feelings for Paul. He even reports that he thought that the other Beatles saw him as \\"Paul's guy\\". At the same time, he clearly thought very little of both George Harrison and Ringo Starr, both personally and musically. Thus, his descriptions of them are often phrased in a gratuitously negative tone, especially in the case of Harrison.    Interestingly, I think that his most objective description is of Lennon. Unlike his take on the others, Emerick didn't seem to have strong personal feelings one way or the other about Lennon. The passages that discuss Lennon are often presented in the toneof an interested observer viewing a fascinating phenomenon with and almost scientific detachment. GE found Lennon fabulously talented and complicated who could be extremely moody, gyrating between kindness and rage, but difficult to interact with in a warm, genuine way.    When discussing Paul, he is almost always complimentary. He perceived Paul as the leader of the group, at least in the studio, and he also thought Paul was the most musically talented of the group, a claim that has been made by many others. However, even through the constant praise he heaps on McCartney, a few insightful criticisms barely emerge. For example, despite the fact that he describes McCartney as the most friendly of the four, he also lets it slip that--unlike Lennon who was receptive to constructive criticism--McCartney reacted poorly to any criticism from the others. So, too, when George needed help on a song, Paul was unavailable. John, on the other hand, though he often treated George as barely more than a little brother, would give a hand when asked. McCartney was also apparently quite assertive in asking his bandmates to play in a very particular way. One can easily see why this combination of qualities--bossy, unhelpful, and overly sensitive to criticism--might make for a not too pleasant combination.     However, the most pointed personal comments are reserved for his almost constant carping about George Harrison. I have collected a series of examples of Emerick's nearly unbounded hostility towards Harrison, and, to a lesser degree, Ringo Starr. I quote him exactly.      \\"The song being rehearsed was soulful and was sung with great feeling by John, but it had a very slow tempo and was marred by a clumsy phrase that George Harrison played over and over again on guitar, repetitive to the point of annoyance.\\"  On Please Please Me, p. 52-53.    \\"Once the vocals were recorded, however, there was another snag: Harrison's over-dubbed guitar solo, which was particularly uninspired.\\"   On That Boy, p. 75.    \\"The weak link that particular day was George Harrison, who seemed even more ham-fisted than usual as he gamely plowed his way through one mediocre guitar solo after another.\\"  On A Hard Day's Night P. 83    Here's an example of how a positive observation about Harrison gets turned into a back-hand criticism.  \\"I loved the added dimension George Harrison's twelve-string playing brought to their sound, and I was impressed with many of his guitar solos. Given the experience we'd had doing the title track, I wondered how long it took to record them. Probably the only reason George Martin allowed a less-than-sparkling solo to make it to record was that it was taking Harrison too long to get it right, and they must have just given up, settling for what they had.  On A Hard Day's Night album p. 86    \\"The stumbling block again was Harrison's guitar solo--not the notes he was playing, but the odd, sped-up tremolo sound he was using, in faithful imitation of the Dr. Feelgood version that had been a minor hit a couple of years previously. Lennon thought the unconventional sound was terrific-- and, personally, so did I--but George Martin insisted that it was simply too weird. After some discussion, it was decided to overdub a cheesy organ solo instead. Even though I loathed the sound, I was most impressed to see Paul playing it--up until that point, I'd had no idea that he could even play keyboards.\\"  On Mr. Moonlight p. 93    \\"But I found Harrison's simpleminded eight-note solo--not even a solo, really just the melody line--downright embarrassing. He wasn't even supposed to play that solo: for the first few takes, John did it, on acoustic guitar. Despite the overall good vibe of the day, George Harrison seemed annoyed, perhaps because he hadn't been given much to do. At one point he marched into the control room and complained loudly, \\"You know, I'd like to do the solo on this one. I am supposed to be the lead guitarist in this band, after all.\\"  I thought it was a pompous thing to say, but George Martin reluctantly gave his assent, pretty much just to get the pouting guitarist out of his hair. Paul and John went along with it good-naturedly, even though nobody was satisfied with the result--you can almost hear Harrison thinking about what note to play next. He wasn't happy either, and he wanted to make another attempt at it, but a weary and slightly annoyed George Martin finally put his foot down, saying, \\"No, we have to move on.\\"  Even as a seventeen-year-old sitting in the machine room who couldn't play a lick of guitar myself, I felt that George Harrison could have come up with something better than that.\\"  On I'll Follow the Sun p. 96    \\"He struck me as a dour, humorless man who complained a lot, and he always seemed suspicious of everyone outside of the Beatles' inner circle. He didn't interact or converse with me very much, even when we were working on one of his songs.\\"  On George's personality, p. 101    \\"George was more of a loner; he was the outsider in a way. As the \\"bottom tier\\" Beatles, he and Ringo seemed to have developed a strong friendship, and I often saw him huddled with Lennon, working out guitar parts, but I rarely noticed much positive interaction between George and Paul. Paul sometimes actually seemed a bit embarrassed by Harrison's musical limitations; certainly there were many instances of eye-rolling when poor George was wrestling unsuccessfully with a solo or lead part. I imagine in those circumstances that Paul was frustrated, probably thinking that he could have mastered the part faster and played it better.\\"  On George's musical limitations, p. 102    \\"Even from the earliest days, I always felt that the artist was John Lennon and Paul McCartney, not the Beatles. That seemed obvious in the recording studio, especially with the way that George Harrison would have difficulty with trying his guitar solos and Ringo would trip over drum fills.\\"  On George and Ringo's musical limitations p. 104    \\"I thought that George's strongest song on Revolver was \\"Taxman,\\" and George Martin must have agreed, since he decided to put it first on the album--the all-important spot generally reserved for the best song, since the idea is to try to capture the listener immediately. . . . There was a bit of tension on that session, though, because George had a great deal of trouble playing the solo-- in fact, he couldn't even do a proper job of it when we slowed the tape down to half speed.  After a couple of hours of watching him struggle, both Paul and George Martin started becoming quite frustrated--this was, after all, a Harrison song and therefore not something anyone was prepared to spend a whole lot of time on. So George Martin went into the studio and, as diplomatically as possible, announced that he wanted Paul to have a go at the solo instead. I could see from the look on Harrison's face that he didn't like the idea one bit, but he reluctantly agreed and then proceeded to disappear for a couple of hours. . . . Paul's solo was stunning in its ferocity--his guitar playing had a fire and energy that his younger bandmate's rarely matched--and was accomplished in just a take or two.\\"  On the Taxman guitar solo, p. 126    \\"The Sgt. Pepper theme song was completed in a remarkably short space of time--just two days, including all vocals--despite the fact that George Harrison spent hours try to nail down the guitar solo. In the end, Paul peremptorily replaced George's work with a stunning solo of his own, which Harrison was clearly not very happy about.\\"  On the Sgt Pepper theme song p. 151-152.    \\"None of us never really appreciated how difficult the sitar was to play. Despite the fact that George was quite accomplished, it did always seem to take a lot of time to get his parts recorded whenever he picked the instrument up.\\"  On Within You, Without You, p. 186    His complete lack of regard for Harrison is emphasized by the way he describes even those guitar solos he thought were good, such as Harrison's work on the live broadcast of \\"All You Need is Love\\". Even successful efforts are described in an extremely negative fashion.    \\"In an act of further defiance, John and Paul even talked George Harrison into doing his guitar solo live, which we all knew was a tricky proposition. To my surprise, Harrison gave in without a whole lot of argument; my sense was that he was afraid of being embarrassed in front of his bandmates.\\"  All you need is Love, p 205    \\"At one point during the camera rehearsals, I noticed George Harrison engaged in conversation with the television director for quite a long time. I had no idea what they were talking about, but I did notice during the broadcast that the camera was not trained on George during his guitar solo. Perhaps he requested that specifically, either because he didn't have confidence in his playing, or because he felt it was likely that he would replace the part later.\\"  All you need is love p., 207    \\"Paul's playing, as always, was solid, with no gaffes, and even George Harrison's solo was reasonably good, though he did hit a clunker at the end.\\"  All you need is love p. 209    \\"Ringo was just uptight all the time, or perhaps it was just an act to keep me at a distance. The problem was that I never knew if I was talking to the actual person underneath the veneer or not. He always seemed uncomfortable carrying on a conversation. He'd take it only so far and then he would inevitably back off, breaking things off in some abrupt or even nasty way. Ringo may have come across as lighthearted and jolly in his public appearances--or whenever there was a film camera rolling--but I never found him to be very genuine, or much fun to be around.\\"  On Ringo's personality p. 311    My bottom line? For Beatles aficionados this book is a must-read. However, be prepared to take the nearly constant swipes at Harrison with a rather large grain of salt.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I purchased each season. I have issues with some people that I just do not seem to get across. Then I find an appropriate episode of BBT, & have that person watch it with me. I copied & maintain the 'Friendship Algorithm', using it regularly. Its funny. It works. I don't pass out in high places though.     The Sheldon's in my life are all prepubescent. Teaching Computer Programming to each other & colleagues until they have a need for a script or 'DOS' command. Suddenly they are my friend. Funny the kind of things they offer, thinking I am really interested. Usually I give in, solve the problem, then go back to being largely ignored. Finding later they took credit for solving the problem with no reference to me. I understand, they cannot admit in front of their peers that they actually had to ask an old fogy for assistance.     I grew up with Spock & Kirk. Reviewing the original Star Trek show's, I am now realizing just how much humor was in them. Shatner is very funny. So was Shakespeare, but we have lost so much of the language, & knowledge of the time. I really never understood Hamlet until I saw Mel Gibson play the part so brilliantly.     This program is a real reflection of our time. The true test of genius is not the ability to understand the problem or even solve it. It is the ability to relate it to us who are not so gifted, and do it in a respectful manner, that really gives us a clue. Steven Hawking comes to mind. I also wonder just how much of Jim Parsons is in the character of Sheldon Cooper.    I just wish there were more 'Penny's'.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Once again Joss has found a new take on an old genre.<br /> The story is fun with unexpected turns, the 'verse is complex and satisfying and the writing, cast and visuals are first rate. I was a fan from the first viewing, but seeing it without commercial interruption gives a much better experience. You get to enjoy snappy dialog uninterrupted by diarrhea commercials, lying news pitches, and other mundane triviata.<br /> The entire show is fantastic and shows terrific vision, great chemistry, and cinematography second to none. The cast is all superb, so much that picking a favorite is impossible.<br />I recommend you buy it, watch it immediately, and if possible-each episode in succession. Terrific and inspiring, dark yet involving. great fun for all. Even my kids at seven and eleven loved it.

B001L0ZMJM|5.0|Ayn Rand is like no one else.  Her style of writing paints a beautiful picture, not only in her character studies, but in making sense in an insane world.  Her atheism is troubling because her worship of man and his abilities doesn't really have to conflict with a belief in God.  It is eerie how she saw how the US was changing even then.  Her first novel, \\"We The LIving\\" blasts the alligator sleep off all our preconceived ideas of what Russia must have been like up to the fall of the Iron Curtain.  \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is a must read for every citizen.  Written in 1957, this novel  is a perfect scenario, frightening in it's scope of how, bit by bit, our way of life in America  is stripped from us.
B0029LHW68|1.0|I rarely write album reviews, but this album disappointed me so much that I felt I had to warn others.  First off, it says there are 12 tracks; it's more like 9.  Two out of those 9 tracks sound like bad newer versions of two songs off of the Beautiful Lie album.  The rest of the tracks are ruined by audience harmonies, which sound like a children's choir.  The one song which could have been great, is ruined by Kanye West.  The lyrics are repetitive and the music is unoriginal and boring.  Jared's voice seems off on this album, maybe because he screams and whines a little too much.  I'm a huge fan of this band and their previous albums, especially A Beautiful Lie.  I'll admit I had high expectations for this album but trust me when I say that is not why I'm disappointed.  The band simply dropped the ball on this one.  I borrowed this cd from a friend and I'm so glad I did before purchasing it for myself.  Needless to say, I will not be spending my money on this one and I highly recommend you sample it before you buy.

B0019LY5IM|5.0|Lost has great acting and a really interesting storyline, but the first four seasons seemed to leave you with more questions than answers. For every piece of the puzzle that you discovered, two more mysteries would appear to take it's place. This technique keeps you coming back for more, but eventually becomes tiresome because you don't feel like you are getting anywhere with the story.<br /><br />Season five has finally broken that trend. New questions have been raised, but a lot of questions were answered and you feel like you are finally getting somewhere. The biggest mystery is still yet to be solved in my opinion. What is the real deal with the Island? Why are they there? What gives it the magical qualities? I have my own speculations, but will not ruin your watching experience by sharing them with you here.<br /><br />Great show. Great series. Great season.

0452295548|5.0|When she suffered a stroke, Jill Bolte Taylor, age 37, was a Harvard trained brain scientist. Her story about the stroke and her ultimate recovery is truly astonishing.  Especially amazing to me  was the fact that she knew so much of what was going on, during the stroke,  and even more amazing to me was the fact that she could remember her thoughts when she was well enough to write this book. Also amazing to me was the fact that she lost the left half of her brain, the part that thinks in language, but retained the right side, the side that thinks in pictures, the part that put her in the here and now with no past and no future. It took eight years to retrain her left brain to be fully functioning again.   It's an interesting story, an amazing story.  I liked what she said about encouraging our right brains to think in positive ways and so counteract the more critical side of our brain. She maintains that it is within our power to create more happiness and self esteem for ourselves through the intentional activation of our right brain.  My daughter also read this book. She's developed this simple mantra to chant when she's feeling low, or finding fault with herself and others: \\"Right Brain. Right Brain.\\"  Eunice Boeve

Every little sound, thump and bump make you wonder when a zombie's going to pop out of nowhere and devour one of the living. Keeping things even creepier is the Hive itself. It's location: a half mile below Raccoon City. Space is limited. Time is running out. You feel the tension all the way through, right from when Alice wakes up till the blood-soaked climax.<br /><br />I loved this movie. The only reason I'm knocking off half a point is because the plot is super simple (though they make you feel otherwise). However, this flick serves as an awesome back story for what's to come because there have been two sequels so far (Resident Evil: Apocalypse and Resident Evil: Extinction) and a fourth one to come in 2011, currently called Resident Evil: Afterlife.<br /><br />This movie definitely served its purpose of setting things up for the saga to come, and wasted no time going through zombie origin stuff before getting hardcore into the action, mystery and carnage. Director/writer Paul W.S. Anderson nailed it with this film. Though--according to my Mrs--this flick was different than the game, I enjoyed it big time and have been a fan of the franchise since. Guess I owe my wife one for introducing it to me back when this film came out.<br /><br />Zombie fans will love this movie and it's easy to see why Resident Evil has the following it does.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />A.P.

These abilities, known as Graces, might enable the ability to read minds, or to have an exceptional talent in music or cooking or in the arts.  The nature of the Grace may not always be clear, but the bearer of a Grace is clearly marked - by having eyes of different colours. Katsa has superhuman reflexes, is impervious to pain and has exceptional speed and endurance.  Katsa has the Grace of killing. Her Grace makes her particularly useful to her King Randa (her uncle) as his enforcer, but it is a skill with which Katsa is becoming increasingly uncomfortable.<br /><br />Katsa also uses her Grace to protect and avenge those beneath King Randa's notice.  One such mission brought Katsa to Sunder to rescue a kidnapped old man.  This man was a Prince of Lienid, and who kidnapped him and why is a mystery that Katsa and Prince Po of Lienid seek to solve.  Their journey is a difficult one and along the way, Katsa learns that the killing Grace is not her only strength.<br /><br />I enjoyed this novel.  The angry, conflicted Katsa is a fascinating character and in the course of the novel she learns to come to terms with her Grace.<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smith
045122499X|5.0|I loved this book. I loved the characters and plot, and I will reread it again sometime in the future. I was disappointed with some of the negative reviews that I read which claimed that the book - though \\"well researched\\" - was not historically accurate in its language or terminolgy. Who cares? This book was written about the 14th century, not for it; it was written for the audience of the 21st century, and to have a universal appeal to all kinds of readers.<br /><br />I read \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" shortly after it first came out, then reread it when my local book discussion group chose it as our December 2009 selection. I loved it even more than the first time I read it, and read \\"World Without End\\" immediately after. It took about a week after I finished both to come out of the \\"Kingsbridge daze\\" I was in.<br /><br />I think \\"World Without End\\" is even better than \\"Pillars\\" and that Follett's work has matured over the last two decades. His two 'good guys' in \\"Pillars\\" were lovable and human, but his two 'bad guys' in \\"WWE\\" are even more vivid and understandable, even if you love to hate 'em. Follett's comprehension of the psychological and sociological effects of war, politics, religion, famine, wide-spread contagion, and hopeless poverty deepen the reader's involvement with the characters' lives and interactions.<br /><br />\\"World Without End\\" is a wonderful read, either on its own or as a sequel to \\"Pillars of the Earth.\\"
B002XTBEDI|3.0|Beware!  SOME SPOILERS!<br /><br />Since Z. Hayes did an excellent job reviewing the general content of the film, I won't go over it again and I'm writing this review from the viewpoint that you, whom is reading this, have already seen the first Cranford.  This continuation does leave you wanting but not in a good way.  The film seems unfinished with a bunch of half attempts to cover potential plotholes (unless there is plan to make another continuation after \\"Return to Cranford\\" with further explanation as to what happens--if that's the case, I take back those last two sentences).<br /><br />While the original Cranford seemed to be light and fun, in spite of life's obvious tragedies, this film is far more dismal.  Some of the story, rather than building up anticipation for what's going to happen next seemed as if it were there as time filler.  Also there were way too many parts that were just plain cheesy.  Case in point, Mattie is awaiting her friends at the train station.  She has urged them to try out the train in view of the town's attempt at progression and modernization that has been a huge concern for our heroines.  No one has arrived.  The train pulls up and comes to a halt while smoke emerges from underneath the train and out of nowhere Matttie's four friends emerges from the smoke arm in arm.  LOL!<br /><br />What really saved Part 1 of this set is the appearance of Septimus, Lady Ludlow's long-awaited son, and his dealings with Harry Gregson, the beneficiary of Mr. Carter's estate.  Other than this, there's not much meat to the other storylines.  Of course, there is the inevitable love story (which is always a good thing) but still even that was predictable and not that all convincing.<br /><br />The beginning of Part 2 is much better with the discovery and agony of forbidden love affairs, a broken engagement, a defying of social expectations, and some of the fun gossipy deliciousness of the first Cranford but it starts get corny again towards the end.<br /><br />I hate somewhat comparing the two Cranfords but I'm sure that my being hopelessly prejudiced by the first (LOVED IT!!) dashed the high hopes to the second.  For me, the movie was just ok.two Cranfords but I'm sure that my being hopelessly prejudiced by the first (LOVED IT!!) dashed the high hopes to the second.  For me, the movie was just ok.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|What a concept for a series..a serial killer that uh, kills serial killers.  I must admit when i first heard this premise I was skeptical to say the least, but when I realized that Hall was going to be the lead, I knew it would rock.  Honestly, it takes a bit of getting used to this anti-hero Dexter, but Hall keeps your attention.  This season, the first, is the best I think, mainly because it's all new and original.  This season has some nice twists, mainly having to do with Dexter's nemisis, but I liked the ongoing side story of his romance with an insecure single mom.  The supporting characters on the whole are not that great, I despise the bald black dude, he is a ridiculous character, who would put up with his B.S.?..ever heard of workplace abuse laws?  I do like the Cuban detective, he is quite good, but Dexters sister is the limit.  She swears like a sailor and early on I really didnt like her, she was just too much, but later in this season I warmed to her.  I would suggest to anyone to give this series a try, personally I love it, but it's not to everyones taste so be forewarned.

B001C4CI8U|5.0|For anyone enamored of the quirky hit TV series \\"Fringe\\", this dvd set of season 1 is a must-have.    The transfer to disc (in my copy - Blu-Ray edition) is outstanding although I have heard that some people were less than thrilled with their \\"standard\\" editions.  I gave a copy of the standard edition to a friend as a Christmas present and he hasn't said anything negative to me about it.    Many people have posted reviews negatively assessing the acting abilities of the lead actress, Anna Torv, but with such limited exposure here in the U.S. (she's Australian...as his her supporting co-star John Noble as \\"Dr. Bishop\\") that I find it hard to fault her with her performance.  The character, and actress's role and performance grew throughout the first season and look even better into this, the second season.    The series requires a bit of \\"suspension of disbelief\\" from the viewer (as did most of the X-Files series) but if you can accept the basic premises (often delivered with hilarious aplomb by Noble) the series promises to be good for at least a couple more seasons.    All in all, a great transfer to DVD from the original format.

0679746323|5.0|I suspect that the Twentieth Century will be a genuinely memorable period for as long as humans ponder the past.  During that very short time span, more technological and scientific advances were made than in any previous era.  More people were killed too and, in contradistinction to past mass killings which were motivated by such mundane issues as food, land, tribalism and religion, these modern murders were lubricated by two relatively new developments:  1) Killing by mechanized means starting with the First World War and, 2). Killing justified and undertaken in the service of murderous ideologies, Communism and Fascism being the two primary examples.  Still, there was room for at least one major vicious, opportunistic, self-aggrandizing, megalomaniac murderer whose distinguishing feature was pure, unadulterated, lapidary lust for power; one who killed without high-technology and whose allegiance was only to himself:  that man was Mao Tse-Dung (Mao \\"To Shine on the East\\"), The Great Helmsman and The Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).<br /><br />The German historian Johannes Haller wrote in 1934 that, \\"For where myth had the word, history had nothing more to say\\" and, until the relatively recent past, the Myth of Mao indeed had the word in mainstream intellectual discourse.  The tenor of the Mao Myth was first set by Edgar Snow's adulatory, \\"Red Star Over China\\" and continued with Harrison E. Salisbury's, \\"The Long March\\".  While it can certainly be said of Snow that he was a \\"fellow-traveler\\", Salisbury (with The New York Times starting in 1949 and an authority on Stalin) was supposedly no such sucker.  Yet, both men filled their pages with eulogies glorifying Mao and his accomplishments, all of which was derived from CCP Potemkin Village-style propaganda.  In other words, Snow was an acolyte and Salisbury simply credulous.  Even a \\"no BS\\" contemporary character, General \\"Vinegar Joe\\" Stilwell was an advocate of relations with Mao's Yenan Regime, evidently believing in the syllogism that, while Communism is a demonstrably bad thing (USSR), it seemed to operate in many ways as a \\"good\\" thing (in China), therefore Mao's communism could not be orthodox Communism and so it wasn't too bad at all. Indeed, Stilwell directed most of his invective against Mao's flawed but principled nemesis, Chiang Kai-shek (who he derisively called, \\"The Peanut\\").  He and others who were less-knowledgeable but more influential viewed Mao as a modern Taiping. Despite evidence to the contrary, Mao still enjoys a good reputation right up through the present. This is really hard to explain:  Mao did not brush his teeth or believe in baths and he was fat making him less suited for college dormitory posters than his more handsome and romantic revolutionary contemporary, Che Guevara.<br /><br />An element of revisionism has, however crept into the scene in the relatively recent past. Around 1982, Fox Butterfield, another NYT correspondent, published \\"China: Alive in the Bitter Sea\\". Based on first-hand observations of life in early post-Mao China, Butterfield managed to rub some of the luster from Mao's public image. While the depredations of the \\"Cultural Revolution\\" were disguised from outsiders (who were almost entirely excluded from China since 1949), they could not be entirely concealed from an on-site journalist, at least one lacking an ideological prism through which to view events. More recently (2006), Roderick MacFarquhar and Michael Schoenhals published a dense and scholarly dissection of the Cultural Revolution (\\"Mao's Last Revolution\\") which meticulously demolished every last fanciful and cherished myth which tenaciously clung to Mao's memory. Still, it was not until Jung Chang and Jon Halliday published this book (also in 2006) that the \\"scales fell from the public's eyes\\".<br /><br />Briefly, Chang and Halliday show that Mao was in the service of Mao and nothing else. His fealty to \\"communism\\" was non-existent and his ostensibleallegiance to that ideology was matter of cynical opportunism, exclusively. His fetish for violence and penchant for inducing mass suffering is obvious from a young age. His complete lack of sympathy for anyone at all and his willingness to sacrifice anyone and anything to advance himself is a recurrent theme in his legacy. The contrast between Mao's self-indulgence and the hideous sufferings he knowingly and simultaneously inflicted on colleagues and \\"the masses\\" was enough to turn the sympathies of some of his most hardened collaborators. War was, in Mao's case, not an extension of goals of the nation-state or party ideology. Rather, it was a simple expedient undertaken to advance the power of Mao, alone. The common caricature of Mao as an ascetic is risible, as shown by his hedonistic indulgences, repeated throughout his unfortunately long life. While sometimes portrayed as a master of realpolitik, Mao appears as a semi-rational but largely unskilled poker player, one willing to plunge the world into nuclear war, the ramifications for the Chinese people meant nothing whatsoever to him. Stalin, Khrushchev, Ho Chi Minh and even Kim Il Sung recognized the danger: U. S. General George Marshall, Henry Kissinger and many more did not.<br /><br />Confucious, in the \\"Analects\\" wrote, \\"You may rob the Three Armies of their commander in chief, but you cannot deprive the humblest peasant of his opinion.\\" This, however, is precisely what Mao strove for in \\"The Great Cultural Revolution\\", the most significant totalitarian effort so far undertaken. This is, to my mind, his single worse offense, eclipsing even the famine-induced murders of over 70 million of his countrymen, his ignition of the Korean War, his efforts to become world hegemon, included.<br /><br />The Chang-Halliday book was exhaustively researched over more than a decade. Personal interviews were conducted with participants in many of the seminal events (e.g., \\"The Long March\\") and witnesses to Mao's early years (as far back as childhood), youth and rise to Red Emporer status were unearthed. Seemingly, every effort was made to construct as comprehensive and balanced a work as possible. It seems likely that this book will serve as the benchmark for further study of Mao and his system. Hopefully, it will also serve as a warning, as it painfully illustrates the truth of Nietzsche's aphorism, \\"...What is strong wins: that is the universal law.

B002ZMZBD2|4.0|Have not loved a Zimmer score this much since \\"Da Vinci Code\\".<br /><br />Just when you think you have Zimmer figured out and expect him to churn out his usual style of music he knocks you out with this fun and very strange score that features an amazing mix of synths and an unusual orchestra. According this interview I read they had the piano I think right side up or something like that on one of the cues. And I could have sworn I heard an alto flute on one of the tracks. Woodwinds in a Zimmer score? What's the world coming to.<br /><br />The album starts with the engaging and highly entertaining \\"Discombobulate\\" which is just blast to listen to. When the track started I was ready to yawn but then the trombones kicked in and the fun started. The track sets up what I imagine is the movie's theme, which is done with a banjo if I'm hearing right then joined by the rest of the very odd orchestra. Zimmer even throws in a solo violin towards the end and what I could have sworn was an accordion. This track alone is worth the purchase of the album, so much fun and craziness. And all this time I thought Zimmer was humorless.<br /><br />The humor doesn't stop with the first track, the 3rd track \\"I Never Woke Up in Handcuffs Before\\" is a crazy, crazy piece of music that sounds like something you'd hear an Indian bar. Zimmer pretty much has the unorthodox orchestra attempting to play the main theme and doing a very poor job of it. Sounds like a middle school band rehearsing for the main theme, which just makes it hilarious. Not sure if this was an aleatoric performance or actually written, but it's funny as all hell. Once again shocked that Zimmer has a sense of humor.<br /><br />But it's not all fun and games as there are some tender moments here and there which also works fine without feeling out of place. It's Zimmer allright, but just toned down without being too sweet or sounding like some clich&eacute; laced complicated romantic comedy music. A great example of this is the strange and beautiful \\"Not In Blood, But in Bond\\". It starts very odd but halfway through the strings kick in and it just gets very endearing but still maintaining that heavy handed Zimmer sound. \\"Ah Putrefaction\\" is another sweet moment on the album.<br /><br />Fans of Zimmer's action writing can rejoice, and those tired of his string ostinatos can also rejoice? His action writing here is some of his best in a while. It's not so far removed that you don't think it's Zimmer, but also not the same crap that he and his boys churn out all the time. It has the heavy strings, the synths doing the part, the light drum loops and so forth but Zimmer combines them very effectively and makes some pretty interesting action music.<br /><br />The lengthy and enjoyable \\"Psychological Recovery.....6 Months\\" contains the most action on the whole album. It's a long one but quite enjoyable and perfect for when you're stuck in traffic or waiting for your pharmacy to refill your anti depressants. One little touch that Zimmer employs here that I loved was this snyth piano sounding instrument, which I heard was a dulcimer? Other than LOTR I never even heard anyone else use it so it was refreshing to hear Zimmer use it along with the crazy array of sounds he got out of the orchestra which worked really well in the action material.<br /><br />The album ends with another highlight, which is \\"Catatonie\\". My personal favorite part starts at 3:17 till the end. It's a great ender to a great album that really caught me off guard. Was expecting Zimmer to be Zimmer, and instead he surprised.<br /><br />In an age when high profile composers are content to not do anything original it's nice to see that some still love the art enough to give it fresh material.<br /><br />Recommended.ood, But in Bond\\".

1400079594|5.0|This is IMHO Wodehouse's second-best novel, second only to RIGHT-HO, JEEVES.  The funny begins at the first line and never lets up.<br /><br />This book includes some outstanding slapstick involving a Bertie, a big bruiser, a bedsheet, Aunt Dahlia, and a cigarette.  The book introduces one of Wodehouses finest love-to-hate characters, Roderick Spode, and one of the strangest plot-central valuable-objects: the 18th-Century Silver Cow-Creamer.

B002HWRYJE|3.0|Wow. Does the Star Trek franchise have a problem with moving the storyline forward? I appreciate the prequel of Enterprise, but this? I understand this movie was made to draw in a younger crowd but, to me, this takes everthing us older Trekkies have appreciated over the years and rendered it mute. I agree with the comment that this is space action with the Star Trek name slapped on it. My only hope is that they might get the alternate time-line restored in the next movie (heaven forbid we have two Spocks running around!).
B000GBEWHA|5.0|Ive been a fan of this film since it came out back in 1978.  Its odd but its like the 70's version of the Wizard of Oz.  It appeals to all age groups and backgrounds.<br />I dont know anyone who actually sat down and watched the film from start to finish who didnt like it.<br /><br />My first copy was on CED, the old RCA disc system from the early 80's that died within about 5 years.  It still plays by the way and the colors really popped on that transfer.  Next was on laserdisc, the Pioneer disc system that lasted into the mid 90's.  That copy was ok, but not as a good as the CED. Both of those transfers were cropped.<br /><br />Since DVD came along this is by far the best transfer!  The picture is smooth and the grain is gone thankfully.  The colors pop and the image is sharp.  I have a Sony lcd projection tv and Sony dvd player.  Ive not jumped into bluray yet if I ever do.<br /><br />Its taken about 30 years for a home copy of this movie to come along that has a decent transfer of the original film!
B000093FLA|4.0|Snatch is a bit over the top but it is incredibly fun movie to watch for a number of reasons. First the combination of London gangsters, Gypsies , Jewish diamond merchants and dogs contribute to some of the sharpest and memorable exchanges that I've heard in a movie since Pulp Fiction. There are many funny lines that will stay with you a long time after watching this. Brad Pitt does a fabulous job as a gypsy bare knuckle boxing champ with an inscrutable accent. Dennis Farina is great as the only American character in the film. The rest of the cast is what makes the film tick Jason Straham as Turkish the narrator and small time hood is the glue that holds the whole thing together.<br />Snatch may not be for everybody but if you like Tarrantino you'll like Guy Ritchie as well.
B00004RHZU|5.0|can't take me home was my favorite era. i loved her dark pink hair and she looked her hottest. the first time i ever noticed her was when she was performing on Nickelodeon's Snick House. i saw her singing with this pink hair and knew there's something about her. she was my age. even though these days she's sporting her natural blonde hair and singing pop/rock music, she's still the same person she was back then...rebellious, crazy, wild, and funny. this album seems very underrated. do people even still remember \\"there u go\\" or \\"most girls\\"? it would be cool if she did r'n'b music again. she can really sing. in the beginning of her career, people had actually thought she was black. the theme of this album generally talks about relationships...bad ones. it has a typical r'n'b flavor that reflects the music of the early 2000s. lol. i don't care if anyone thought this album was her worst or what those stupid critics say, it's a great album and it's personally my fave. p!nk has the voice to sing any type of genre. i think pink is one of the artists out there who stays true to her image. she never portrayed this \\"good girl gone bad\\" image like britney, christina, and rihanna and that's what makes her more genuine and why people should take her more seriously.<br /><br />1. Split Personality (5/5)- i like the beats. pink explains that she has two different personalities thus you hear her talking to herself.<br /><br />2. Hell Wit Ya (5/5)- pink sees that her ex is treating this \\"new girl\\" with respect as opposed to her. \\"i hear you learned to open doors. when did you become such a damn gentleman\\"? haha. love that line.<br /><br />3. Most Girls (5/5)-i listened to this song alot on the radio back then. she says that most girls prefer to be with guys who have money while she just want the \\"real thing\\". the lyrics are so catchy. \\"so shorty got a job, shorty got a car, shorty can pay her own rent\\". i love this song. i'm sure \\"most girls\\" including myself can relate to this.<br /><br />4. There U Go (5/5)-this song brings memories from when she was just starting. \\"there u go..looking pitiful..just because i let u go\\". i love the video where she was wearing this white jumpsuit and made the bike run into her ex's apartment. then she gives the finger. epic.<br /><br />5. You Make Me Sick (5/5)-this song was my JAM back then!!! the video shows her fighting with her bf and i remember there was a part where she's all naked, being covered by rose petals. i remember this guy at my school singing this song \\"you make me sick\\" and the teacher was like \\"you make yourself sick\\". then he said \\"i wasnt talking to you\\". good times.<br /><br />6. Let Me Know Let You Know (5/5)- a very nice ballad on the album. i didn't know that robin thicke co-wrote this.<br /><br />7. Love is Such A Crazy Thing (4.5/5)- the piano playing and the background beats flow really nice together.<br /><br />8. Private Show (5/5)-great beats. brings back memories of the late 90s/early 00s.<br /><br />9. Can't Take Me Home (5/5)- shows off her rebellious/angry attitude. once again it talks about a relationship gone bad.<br /><br />10. Stop Falling (3/5)- it's too slow and boring..i'm not really feeling this. i would skip this one.<br /><br />11. Do What You Do (4.5/5)-i like the hip hop beats. it has a philosophy to live your own life and doing what pleases you.<br /><br />12. Hiccup (5/5)-pink is struggling to express her emotions when in a relationship by using the metaphors \\"hiccup\\".<br /><br />13. Is It Love (5/5)-not sure what's the meaning of this song. just listening to the lyrics, it could be about rape or falling in love with the wrong guy who only wanted her for sex. either way, it's a cutesy, innocent kind of song.this song brings memories from when she was just starting. \\"there u go..looking pitiful..just because i let u go\\". i love the video where she was wearing this white jumpsuit and made the bike run into her ex's apartment. then she gives the finger. epic.     5.

B000001GOZ|5.0|This disc was my first encounter with a Mahler symphony conducted by Pierre Boulez. Being a great admirer of this darkest of Mahler's symphonies (in my opinion, contending with no. 9 as his best symphony), I had heard multiple versions of the work before coming to this one - my first encounter was with the Philharmonia Orchestra version conducted by Sinopoli, and then the NYPO Bernstein version recorded in the 1960s. Both recordings I admired for different reasons - Sinopoli for the sheer bloom of the sound, and Bernstein for his typical ripe intensity (though I found Bernstein a little on the fast side).     You can't go wrong by purchasing this disc, one of the finest, if not the finest, of Boulez's mahler cycle. And without a doubt one of the finest recordings of this masterpiece to ever appear.    The first movement [23:07] begins at a relatively slow tempo compared to the NYPO Bernstein version, but progresses with great momentum, carrying a great militaristic thrill and drive which is unstoppable. The romantic second subject (or the \\"Alma theme\\") is treated by Boulez in a characteristically restrained way, though has terrific bloom and is played with miraculous attention to detail, usually obscured in other recordings. There is one gorgeously reflective moment (right on 18:00) where the Vienna Philharmonic's finesse and beauty of sound can only be marvelled at.    The second movement is the scherzo [12:19] in this version, with a perfectly judged tempo and impeccable orchestral balance assuming its own significance in driving the music along. There is no imposing of any emotional ego on the music by Boulez - nothing to disrupt the flow of the music and reveal its inherent character in a most astounding way.     But it is surely the meditative slow movement [14:47] which emerges as perhaps the most heartful and ravishingly beautiful version on record. Once again the orchestral musicians of the Vienna Philharmonic must take credit for exceptional musical finesse. The restrained beauty and breathtaking flow of the movement, from the reflective woodwind solos and solo horn dialogues to the no less awe-inspiring handling of the mournful climaxes places it in a class of its own. This needs to be heard to be believed.    Naturally the finale [29:10] brings similar reactions to the listener. Some may find the underplaying of the hammer blows (which emerge more like loud bass drums) not to their taste but for me, all the musical merits of the work are brought out in this performance, and gain significance because of it.    A must for any musical collection. Disappointed with other Boulez mahler recordings? I treat each recording in isolation, rather than branded by conductors. You may very well love this one.
B000ICM5IK|5.0|I will never forget that night in 1976 when i attended the showing of Rocky, It transformed my life and inspired me beyond words. I have never felt the impact from any movie as i did with Rocky. It still is the most inspirational film of all time for me. The music matched the intensity of the fight to go the distance in life. The story behind the story about Stallone writing the script and with nothing he refused thousands of dollars to sell it outright but rather stuck to his heart and dreams and negotiated to play the part himself was just as inspiring as the movie. Anyone who has a dream in their heart has to love Rocky because it's obvious that God does. This CD captures all the songs that move and stir your spirit just as the movie did. The original theme from Rocky will be played at my funeral.

B000031WD9|5.0|Budget at only 10 million dollars, \\"American Pie\\" has grossed over $235,000,000 since its release in 1999 making it the biggest teen comedy of all-time. Spawning several sequels, \\"American Pie\\" is simply a well-acted and funny film that all audiences will enjoy. The plot involves four teenagers attempting to lose their virginity before highschool graduation. The title refers to the fact that having sex actually feels like \\"apple pie\\": once you view the film you'll know more. Seanne William Scott, who plays the supporting role of Stifler, steals the film with his cuteness and brave acting chomps, and he would go on to actually star in other \\"American pie\\" films. The DVD is loaded with bonuses including on-location interviews, commentary, trailers, and more. There is also an informative booklet that accompanies the set. A perfect film to view on a Friday night!
B00000G3I2|2.0|Saw this again for the first time since 1983. I'm struck by how dated it feels. The hairstyles on the women are very Reagan-80s, all blow dried. The men don't fare much better. It's now a period piece. This was so big when it came out, and acquired a certain cache after awhile. But the soundtrack, innovative in its day, is very tired now, compared with all the copycats that have followed. I recently visited Beaufort, S.C., where this was filmed. They are still dining on it there, almost 30 years later. Watchable, but only to see how badly it's aged.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|It took me a while to \\"push the button\\" on buying this watch.  It wasn't the money. The price is a bit salty and other units out there are reported to perform well. But I wasn't keen on running with a cell-phone-sized monster strapped to my wrist so that I could save a few bucks.      No, my hesitation was because some of the online reviews I'd read were critical of the watches functioning - particularly the bezel interface.    I'm here to tell you - Don't Worry!  I've had an opportunity to put this thing through its paces on both ends of the climate spectrum, and it performed flawlessly.    In one week, thanks to a trip to South America, I was able to use the watch in 90 degree weather and 20 degree weather.  The watch performed well with sweat, with gloves, with cold fingers and hot - no issues.      You do have to know what you're doing, so as we in high-tech jobs say -  \\"RTFM.\\"  (Read the freakin' manual!).  I recommend establishing your nine key metrics (three each on three screens), set the watch to auto-scroll and lock the bezel after hitting the start button.  You're never more than a second or two from what you want to know, and if there's something you're particularly interested in, set it as a data point on more than one screen.    This watch can't be beat, and if you're even remotely serious about running, it's worth every penny.

I certainly hope not, but it seems likely) to the subject which he has built his fame and authorial career on: the theory of evolution. His previous evolution-centric writings have always (naturally) presumed the truth of evolution, and so focus on different aspects of it. This is no fault on his part. Teaching evolutionary biology is something that should ideally be accomplished in the K-12 classroom. Alas, science education is being assaulted non-stop lately by an international coalition of extremist Christians and Muslims who have made it their goal to systematically destroy the teaching of evolutionary biology by spreading misinformation and funding domestic propaganda vehicles. Perhaps due to the recent proliferation of Intelligent Design and Islamic creationism in Europe and the United States wrought by this, Dawkins has written a book on the evidence for evolution.    Or has he?    Certainly there is evidence here, but the title led me to believe this would be a rigorous and systematic presentation of the evidence for evolution. This is not what this book is. It is, rather, a chatty introduction to evolution. Specific examples are fairly scant, and instead of referencing technical articles, as one would expect from a former professor. he quotes more informal sources, many from the internet. If you're getting this because you're expecting a formal presentation of the evidence for evolution, I would give this a pass (while I have yet to read it, I hear Jerry Coyne's \\"Why Evolution is True\\" is excellent in this regard). If you want a relatively non-technicalintroduction to evolution, however, or if you just enjoy the good professor's style and find that he is always compelling, then I whole-heartedly recommend this book.    Do not read this expecting another \\"The God Delusion.\\" While he does take a fair number of shots at creationists in this (or \\"history deniers,\\" as he calls them, alluding to the ridiculous anti-semitic tendency to deny the Holocaust in the face of all contrary evidence and common-sense), this book is about evolution, not atheism. As he says in the book, he has already worn that T-shirt.    The beginning of the book is a 'softening-up' program, designed to lead the reader from the obvious (artificial selection) to the less obvious (natural selection). Dawkins explains how we know the age of the Earth. And then he gets into the meat of the book.    I think this will suffice as a brief overview of the book's content:        Only a Theory? - Evolution is just a theory in the same way the theory of heliocentrism is just a theory. Scientific theories are not mere conjectures.    Dogs, Cows, and Cabbages - Covers domestication and artificial selection by human breeders    The Primrose Path of Macroevolution - Artificial selection occurs in nature, too    Silence and Slow Time - The age of the Earth and how we know it    Before Our Very Eyes - Observable evolution of microbes    Missing Link, What Do You Mean Missing? - The fossil record and what it tells us    Missing Persons, Missing No Longer - Fossils relating to human evolution    You Did It Yourself in Nine Months - Bottom-up assembly in the womb    The Ark of the Continents - Continental drift and the geographical dispersion of different species    The Tree of Cousinship - The tree of life    History Written All Over Us - Clues to our evolutionary history in our bodies    Arms Races and Evolutionary Theodicy - Competition and the role of suffering in nature    There is Grandeur In This View of Life - In-depth examination of final paragraph of Darwin's On the Origin of Species and how it describes the natural world as a way to wrap up the book.      There is an appendix as well, which contains some frightening statistics about the spread of creationism throughout the world.    None of this is going to convince creationists, of course, and some people who have an adequate understanding of modern evolutionary biology will be bored by this rather simplistic overview, but this is perfect for the intelligent layman who doesn't really understand the science behind evolution and for the Dawkins fan who just appreciates getting another chance to read his clear and lucid prose.    EDIT: added 02/14/10 - I neglected to mention the BEAUTIFUL full-color photographs in this book. But they deserve mention. They're sublime.    EDIT(2): added 05/21/10 - I believe I neglected to mention just how condescending his language can be in this book. It becomes obnoxious on occasion, as when he advises his readers to \\"take a nap\\" before reading a section of the book that he feels might be difficult to understand. I understand he is targeting a very uninformed demographic with this book, but I think readers can decide for themselves when the optimal time to read his book is. This never amounts to more than a minor annoyance, however.
1401323820|4.0|As far as thrillers go, this one is not bad.  What really makes it work is the tie in to the series CASTLE on ABC.  This book is featured in the show as written by the lead character.  The book is an amazing tie in, simply because NOWHERE do they treat it as anything other than the latest Richard Castle novel.  (A neat trick considering he doesnt exist.) We get together with friends everyweek to watch the show.  And when I brought out my HEAT WAVE hardcover, man were they surprised and impressed.  Lot of fun for fans of the show, the plot feels very much like an episode of CASTLE.  Hard core mystery/thriller buffs may be disappointed, but I enjoyed it thouroughly.
0618918248|4.0|Not the best, most coherent book, but it is well needed as young adults like myself are finally free from the child indoctrination they experienced as a child. We need a book to turn to in order to rationalize the brainwashing process that occurs with most children born into a religious home.     The definition of God in the beginning may seem irrelevant at first, but after understanding how Einstein sees God and how other scientific figures in history viewed God, you begin to understand the separation between God in the religious sense and God in the scientific sense. As stated, Einstein didn't believe in the Christian God, or a God that would even interact with humans on a personal level, but rather he recognized that us humans understand so little about the universe that it would be irrational to ignore the laws put in place. Dawkins makes it clear that he is NOT against the proposal of an unexplainable entity or \\"thing\\" that has a profound effect on existence as we experience it, but against the idea that humans are special and that this entity (God) interacts with humans regularly because it experiences humanly emotions such as love, anger, and jealously. In short, dawkins explains that the difference between the two is one takes the stance of \\"we don't know, but we are learning new things every day\\" and the other is \\"humans have a destiny and are supposed to understand the meaning of life\\". The first four chapters were my favorite as they gave me the tools needed to rationalize the possibility that *gasp* humans DON'T know everything! In the same way ants will never understand 99% of human logic, humans will probably never understand most of logic used in the universe (assuming logic is a universal constant). We just don't have the senses to give us capability to do so.     Next, Dawkins goes into morality and the purpose of religion. I wasn't particularly interested in morality, but idea that morality would come out of survival instinct makes a lot of sense.Using the theory of evolution, it would make sense that life would evolve mentally to survive. (Many people don't understand that evolution consists of physical changes to the brain which change mental processes as well as the body). The next part of this book really hit home for me. When Dawkins started talking about child indoctrination, I disagreed with his lack of understanding of what goes through a parent's mind when they brainwash their children into their beliefs. The fact is that a Christian mother, who believes in hell, believes her child will go to hell unless that child believes in Jesus. NOT indoctrinating her child would be irrational to her as she is simply doing what she believes is best for the child. Therefore the blame isn't in the parents, its religion itself and the indoctrination of fear. (A subject Sam Harris tackles much more elegantly)     Overall, I know where a lot of these negative Christian reviews are coming from. I used to be in that position. It didn't matter what this book actually said or what logically conclusions I SHOULD follow, my faith/brainwashing was too strong. My anger over the negative perception of my religion clouded my judgment. It actually wasn't until I read Lee Strobel's A Case of a Creator when I began to question my faith. Dawkins tackles the subject of God without relying on the logical fallacies that turned me away from Christianity as found in every ID book I read while struggling to hold onto my faith. TGD is not perfect, but it is needed; not for the religious mind, but for the curious\open mind.
0802798225|5.0|This book was AMAZING. I got captivated by it instantly! Alex seemed so real, the way he talked. That's how a real Chicano speaks. A smile always crept up my face when I read about Alex. It's truly and amazing read. READ IT. You won't be disappointed!
B000RJO578|5.0|I love Simon Pegg, Shaun of the Dead, Hott fuzz and run fatboy run are all great movies. hes even great as Scotty in the Star trek reboot. Hot fuzz is a great movie, the pacing is great the funny is funny and the actors all mesh well.Be Forewarned however there are some gruesome death scenes and may not be for those with weak stomachs.I wasn't bother by these scenes however so I'll give it a 5/5.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|As far as crime/cop shows go, Castle can be standard.  But what lifts it WAY above everything else is the humor and chemestry of the cast.  Phenomenal.  Watch.
B000J10ERO|2.0|Superman is the man.  This movie is seeing the character on the big screen afetr a long time, but doesn;t reflect the complete character and his world.  Bryan Singer and his team seemed to have seen the first movie of Superman and that is it.  Watch the making of documentary and you will see one of his crew members reading \\"The Making Of Superman: The Movie\\" instead of a Superman comic book. This made me feel bad especially with my favorite superhero.  Why is it that the animated features and shows go full out with the enemies and stories until we hit film and there is this tied down feeling with only one villian, Lex Luthor...as if Braniac, Metallo, Darkseid, Toyman, Parasite, Titano, Lobo, Gog, Bloodsport, Atlas, Doomsday, and others would never be seen in Superman film universe (makes us feel lucky they used Zod for 1.2 films).  Also, switching the romance and add the child of _______ into the story makes no sense and illustrates no one did their homework.  Imagine if Peter Jackson made Lord of The Rings with only seeing the animated TV special Return Of The King in the 80s without reading any of the books, the trilogy would be a one movie deal and a musical.<br /><br />They did put a lot of hard work into the movie to make it look good, but I wish they tried more with the characters and the story.  That's difference with Batman Begins and Superman Returns...Christopher Nolan being more of a fan of the superhero's mythology rather than liking a few films of done in the past.<br /><br />The story is written from the outside looking into the character at a distance.  The movie is enjoyable to see Superman on the big screen but fails to give Superman the credit he has in the comic books.  It fails to take him to the next level of where he is now.  Smallville is doing a better job at the mythology.  Minus 2 stars for story and lack of work, but the movie is made well and may please anyone who doesn't know much about Superman but the basics to pass a Trivial Persuit game.  One golden rule is that Kryptonians cannot impregnate humans, this is not a hay wire sci fi world where different species genes can magically mix up.  This rule is broken.  Also Clark doesn't drink alcohol and Superman does appear in court...we even saw this in the Justice League animated series.<br /><br />I got this movie to support the Man Of Steel and the middle part is fun especially the airplane save & bullet eye shot.  Hang in there for the future for Superman and I highly recommend Superman: Doomsday and Superman/Batman: Public Enemies for those are way closer to the character and those great books.  Maybe in time DC and Warner Bros. will treat us with a wholesome Superman Motion Picture like Marvel made up for Hulk with Incredible Hulk.<br /><br />The makers of this film were clearly fans of the Superman movie and not Superman and it shows.rule is that Kryptonians cannot impregnate humans, this is not a hay wire sci fi world where different species genes can magically mix up.

B000NU2CY4|1.0|Note that this is a review for the Blu Ray release of Gladiator (Sapphire), NOT the movie itself. Watched it over the weekend having picked it up a few weeks ago when it was on sale at amazon. The negative press this release has been getting is WELL DESERVED. I am not exaggerating in the least when I say the video looks like a 480 source scaled to 1080 resolution with overly aggressive sharpening and digital filtering. Edges look enhanced and fine details get blurred over throughout, all of which takes away from the viewing experience. In my opinion, it is marginally better than the Extended Edition DVD scaled on my Toshiba HD-XA2, and nowhere near the quality that the Blu Ray medium is capable of. My recommendation would be to stay away from this release unless you absolutely must watch it in \\"high definition\\" today.
0385335997|5.0|I read through this book as quickly as I read through the first one! This book had a lot of action in it - which was very captivating to read - and also depicts the reunion of Jamie and Claire. I loved this book; there were a lot of surprises in it (the return of a character believed to be dead, the identity of a notorious killer), there were a lot of poignant and interesting flashbacks through the eyes of Claire and Jamie (I enjoyed these immensly), and the plot and writing were simply fabulous. I simply couldn't put this book down, and read it in the span of a few days! I would definately recommend this book to all who have read the first book and who wish to read the series.
B002KSPKRS|3.0|Update: After a little over a year of ownership, the mic is unusable. Additionally, using them in an apartment (with lots of Wi-Fi around) results in some unsettling popping. Removed a star.<br /><br />It is impossible to describe the quality of sound from this headset. It really does sound like it is coming from surround speakers and not from headphones sitting directly on your ears. The first time I turned them on, I initially complained they were not working and thought the sound was still coming from my sound system - only to realize my sound system was turned off at the time!<br /><br />Taking off one star because the piece which connects the headset to your xbox controller (for talking online) is not nearly as secure as it should be - I found myself having to change the position around before finally actually bending the input piece a bit to make it fit. Not a huge problem since I was able to \\"fix\\" it, but something that could be easily addressed in the design.<br /><br />Overall, if you frequently game online and your S.O. insists you stop bothering her with the constant gunshots and explosions coming out of your sound system, its definitely worth the price!
0670021652|3.0|I'm a big fan of Elizabeth Gilbert and loved Eat, Pray, Love as well as her talk on creativity at the TED conference circulating on YouTube.  Her blend of factual information, anecdote and creative interpretation is illuminating and entertaining.  And Committed has its share of humor and aha! moments.    In her preface to Committed, Gilbert says she originally wrote a 500-page version of this book, then discarded it.  She implies it was too pedantic, so the second time she wrote it imagining only an audience of close women friends.  I believe this gives the book a talky, chatty quality that does not translate well to the written page.  There are too many \\"anyways\\", redundancies and extraneous phrases.  If she were speaking this text to us, we could experience her gestures and facial expressions, inflection and dramatic pauses; the audiovisuals of conversation would keep us interested.  But on the two-dimensional page, I found myself growing impatient and wishing she had thinned the verbiage by 30 per cent.    I also felt uncomfortable with the amount of very personal information she revealed about her husband and her parents.  A confessional approach to one's own life by a memoirist is one thing; to expose and discuss other peoples' intimate feelings and issues seems exploitative.      Another problem was the lack of sourcing for her valuable factual data, particularly, her fascinating material on the evolution of marriage.  This information could be very useful to call out the \\"ancient tradition\\" excuse for social repression.  But without sources, it's much less useful.  She did list about 20 authors in one sentence in her acknowledgements but this doesn't help much.  Gilbert has one explanatory footnote in her book and says with seeming pride that it is \\"the only footnote in the book\\".  Again, I think she went overboard on veering away from pedantry.    The idea for this book and much of its information is interesting and valuable.  I wish Gilbert had imagined a wider, less personally familiar audience so that her writing might have been more pithy and vivid.  I believe this book packed a punch but it became buried and invisible in the rambling, chatty delivery.
B001P06GX4|5.0|Everyone in our family has become a fan of Blokus, from our three year old to grandma.  There is a reason for the four hundred plus positive reviews this game is easy to learn and is near limitless in play.  I highly recommend this game.
0618918248|4.0|Back in August, I wanted to do a deep dive on the origin of life. Well, my hectic 9 - 5 delayed this exercise by four months. Anyway, I started off by reading The God Delusion, a bestseller written by the famous Richard Dawkins. This book not only defends atheism, but it goes so far as to attack the religious position. Here are some of the main principles explained:    The God Hypothesis - Dawkins contends that if god really created life, then who created god in the first place? He goes on to remind us that the whole problem we started with was to explain the statistical improbability on the origin of life. Thus it makes no sense to take the god position because there is the larger problem of who designed the designer. In comparison, evolution by natural selection becomes a more probable and hence preferrable theory.    Evolution of complex organs is possible - creationists argue that complex organs like the eye could not have evolved in a piecemeal fashion over time. This is because the eye is made of several critical parts without one will cause the entire system to fail. Dawkins counters by pointing out that the eye could actually have started out as a simple light receptor. Having a light receptor is definitely better than nothing when you are in the wild searching for meals and trying to avoid becoming someone else's meal. What came next were the functions of focus, colour, etc., each of which brought additional advantages that were perpetuated by natural selection.    Abundance of Goldilocks planets in the universe - Creationists claim that the conditions necessary for life to exist on Earth are so unique that it must have been the work of a supernatural god. Earth is a Goldilocks planet, because we are at just the right distance from the sun to support carbon-based life forms. But Dawkins maintains the Earth is not that special after all. Contemporary astronomical data suggest there are about 1 billion stars in our galaxy. Orbiting these stars are another 1 billion to 30 billion planets. Look farther out and it is estimated that there are close to 100 billion galaxies in our universe. Let's err on the conservative side, knock a few zeros off, and say there are just 1 billion billion planets in our universe. Suppose the rise of life from spontaneous generation of DNA material, being highly improbable, only happens on one in a billion planets. With these odds, you can still expect to find life on a billion planets throughout the universe. Given the unbelievably large playing field the universe offers, it is almost illogical not to expect life on other planets.    Though none of the above concepts are bleeding edge, Dawkins does a great job using everyday language to argue his case. If you want to learn a few things on atheism vs theism, this is a good introductory read. Make sure you get your facts right however and not just rely on this one book. As the saying goes: when one person suffers from a delusion, it is called insanity. When many people suffer from a delusion it is called religion.      -PTS ([...])
B00008RH3L|3.0|This is a nice enough movie.  Byrne is well cast and Finney is splendid as always and that guy who played the hotheaded Italian stole all his scenes; excellent.  However, you're never convinced the Coens had a handle on how bosses really operated.  Furthermore, the events, break-ins, and crack downs seem contrived and orchestrated rather than actual.  The plot keeps you thinking, but there is too much vagueness, and the anti-hero survives by dumbluck or the incompetence of his dupes, rather than by real cleverness.  Too much of the love interest triangle is bland and feels phony as well.  Overall, the movie feels more cartoonish than cutting edge, a like too much Dick Tracy.  Just an average flick I'd say.
6305558167|5.0|Okay, first and formost - if you are buying this movie, you are buying it because you seen it!    If you haven't seen and you are buying it because someone recommended it, then my review is going to tell you to buy! Period!    This movie is a classic! Period!    I was 6 years old the first time I seen it and I have been trying to find this movie for years, I am 34 years old now and I finally found it and purchased it right here on Amazon!    What are you waiting for, put in your order right now!
B002P5XXR0|4.0|This beautiful soundtrack expertly combines classical instruments, electronic ones and human vocalizations. It does a good job at evoking feelings of discovery, harmony and awe. My favorite track, as you might have guessed from the title, is \\"The Bioluminescence of the Night\\".     However, there are several shortcomings, as other reviews have mentioned. There is the one main theme that is really memorable and is carried out throughout the other tracks, however, that is the only one. Horner should have better developed other themes too with more interesting and catchy melodies. Another drawback is that a lot of the soundtrack echoes Horner's previous work. He should have left the old things behind and brought newer music to the table. Lastly, although I can admire Leona Lewis' \\"I See You\\" song, it doesn't really evoke much emotion. It's a pretty song, but it does not surpass \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" from Titanic. I just don't see it climbing the charts much.    Despite all this, I did enjoy the soundtrack, perhaps not as much as Star Wars or Lord of the Rings, but I do like it and give it 4 out of 5.
B002VH6V9O|4.0|From my wife Sarah: The thing that struck me about this movie was that the young Victoria was played as a very real person. The acting was excellent, and the movie gave insight into what it was like to be a child waiting to be queen. Prior to her taking power she led an overly sheltered life, with intense attention paid to keeping her safe. The pros and cons of this were explored. Then when she became queen, this movie shows what it might have been like to be young, inexperienced and taking power, with everyone wanting to take control of her.<br /><br />Yet it was also a love story. What made this love story unusal was that the roles were reversed because the woman was a Queen, and so she was in charge as a man would have normally been then. The dynamics of this was very interesting, and the chemistry between Victoria and Albert was nicely played.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie, but it didn't keep my interest as much as other movies that I have given 5 stars to. Perhaps that's because the story itself was not that dramatic. Still, it's really worth seeing.
B002SJIO4A|2.0|I just about ejected this thing 3/4's of the way through, but the best part is at the end of the movie, so I hung on to finish it. This was basically a bunch of dribble built around some good CGI aliens that were caught on earth because they lost a piece of their spaceship that was (for some unknown reason) parked over the slums of Johannesburg. They actually showed the piece coming off the ship but could not find it???????????? and were magically stuck on earth for the next 20 years; give me a break!!!  The fooooking actors were bad, bad, bad in there Africani style, and in a lot of scenes, hard to understand (Duhhh). I had the distinction of watching this right after Inglourious  basterds; Oh my God, my brain is full of dribble and I need to flush it out with a good movie. GOOD LUCK
B002T45VX6|4.0|I bought the cd for a few songs.  Among them the track w/Lil Wayne, She Wolf, Loba (the Spanish version), Why Wait, Gypsy (the live version as well).  There are a couple more songs that i'm fond of in addition to the above listed ones.  \\"She Wolf\\" does have a pop sound to it, but it also has Shakira's own style of music as well.  I believe that is what gets me a bit more into it.  I didnt really feel it the first couple times that i listened to the cd.<br /><br />But a few more listens and it pulls you in just a little bit more.  This is the first Shakira cd that i've bought.  I'll probably go back and check out \\"Laundry Service\\" in the future.  But for now this one will more than hold me over until then.  Solid songwriting, beats and pretty decent vocals as well.
B002HRTMHQ|5.0|Something is wrong here, cause this album is actually pretty good.  you know what who am I kidding this album is great.  I listen to the samples of the album and fell in love instantly.  the Joe album Signature is pretty good too and was rated as the best album i've ever heard.  this album gets thumbs way up waaaaaaaaaayyyyyyy up!  as a detroit native, i am use to hearing music from motown and was wondering what would it take to bring some of that old sound back, you know pre-synth?  what i want to know is why is this guy being slept on i mean this stuff is great and sample worthy.  this sounds old with a hint of new technology, meaning that the lyrics and beats are classic but the crystal clarity of the songs leaves me without words, so.................
B002UXRH10|5.0|from the outset of Rihanna's fourth release \\"Rated R\\".  It is evident that Rihanna is going on a different journey with this one.  With a far more aggressive style of music and lyrics in her songs than a lot of people are probably used to.  But with what's happened no can blame her.  She needed to come out a little \\"hard\\"er this time around.  There might be a bump or two along the way through the cd.  But overall it's still Rihanna and it works throughout the record.  Whether it's \\"Hard\\" w/Jeezy, \\"Wait Your Turn\\", \\"G4L\\", \\"Rude Boy\\".<br /><br />It's all Rihanna just amped up a couple notches with attitude that flows through the songs.  You can't but take notice and while she might not be the strongest vocalist out there.  I feel she did a solid job in that department as well as writing a lot of her material on this release.  \\"Rated R\\" is just another solid step forward in the career of Rihanna and I for one want to be there the rest of the way.<br /><br />\\"Wait Your Turn\\" pretenders because Rih is back and taking it to the competition.
1416583408|2.0|I was really looking forward to this book but unfortunately, it's a struggle to finish. Was the author writing to her incoming class of freshman? She tries too hard to be cute and assumes the reader knows nothing about animal behavior let alone dogs. Her overuse of dashes in mid-sentence and asterisked footnotes is distracting to say the least. ADHD or a symptom of an age of text messaging and Twitter? She may have earned her credentials around zoo animals and dog parks, but I see no evidence that she has any credible understanding of livestock behaviors. Skip this book and go straight to Temple Grandin's chapter on dogs in \\"Animals Make Us Human\\" for a better written, more informative read.
B00200K2UG|5.0|Although a bit expensive, this bag is ABSOLUTELY worth the money. I have all my camera equipment in one bag now, which is something I have needed for quite a while. At present, I have my Canon 7D, Canon 30D, three lenses, one flash and a host of other miscellaneous items in this bag -- with PLENTY of room to spare!!     Before purchasing this bag, I was using three different cases to lug my equipment around. I'm keeping my Tamrac 5273 Expedition 3 SLR Photo Backpack, however, for vacations, hiking, etc., since the weight of the Ultra Pro 13 (loaded with equipment) doesn't lend itself to long walks.     In addition to its rugged design, I love having the ability to protect it (and my equipment) with the INCLUDED rain/weather protector. I also really like having the ability to attach my tripod to the lower carriage of the bag, as well.    I am now ready to buy some more equipment to put into this fine case, just don't tell the wife! :)
B0015HOFZI|5.0|Got this turntable for Christmas to turn some of my old vinyl into digital tracks. I've recorded 25 albums so far.  Overall, I'm extremely happy.  It does a surprising job cleaning up scratchy old albums; the software that comes with the turntable is excellent in this regard--it completely eliminates the pops.  I'm also amazed it plays even warped old albums--one album spent time in a hot car and skips on my Technics turntable--it played fine on this Sony and now it's on CD.  The software does not do a perfect job splitting an album into its tracks--for instance, it decided a scratchy old Rolling Stones album had only one track on the A side (it actually had 5).  In another case, one track was split into 3 pieces.  Still, the software DOES allow you to correct any tracks that are incorrectly separated, and it's easy to do--basically cut and paste. And about 75% of the time, the software gets it right.  I talked to a guy who bought a no-name machine and was disappointed.  This Sony, on the other hand, is definitely a 5-star machine.  One odd thing (maybe user error?)--I don't hear the album playing thru my computer speakers, and I must disconnect the USB turntable for my speakers to work.
B002T9H2L0|4.0|Part World War II movie, part revenge movie, \\"Inglorious Basterds\\" is basically the fulfillment of people's fantasy of seeing someone charging in to kill the Nazis responsible for so many heinous crimes. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) leads a platoon of Jewish American soldiers, also known as the basterds, who charge in and kill every Nazi they encounter. The movie also includes an interesting character-driven plot which intersects with the more direct fighting. Shosanna is a Jewish woman living in Paris as a theater owner whose family were killed. There she encounters Landa (Christoph Waltz), the \\"Jew Hunter\\" who was responsible for wiping out her family years ago.    The storyline with Pitt's character is both bloody and funny at times. The platoon is successful at killing Nazis and instilling fear into them. It includes a long scene in a bar where some of the basterds are set to meet with an undercover actress who has a plan to ambush the Nazi high command. The scene becomes very tense when the basterds disguised as Nazis are confronted by a real Nazi officer. Things don't turn out quite as intended, but they still get details on the ambush plan. The actress reveals that Hitler and other officials are scheduled to appear for a Nazi film premier at a small Paris theater. Naturally, the theater is owned by Shosanna, who - unbeknownst to the basterds - develops her own plan against the Nazis. Landa, who is partly in charge of orchestrating the film premier at the theater, manages to track down the basterds to the theater and devises his own plan.     Although the story itself is entirely fictional, Tarantino did make the film rather accurate in other ways. One of the funniest scenes is when Raine is undercover as an Italian and it becomes clear he doesn't really know much Italian. The acting is great, especially Christoph Waltz who deserves all the awards recognition he's gotten. The story and directing is what one has come to expect from Tarantino. He manages to make evenbloody scenes be fun and writes characters who are interesting and three-dimensional. The film succeeds in providing both entertaining action and intriguing characters.

B00275EGWY|4.0|You can't fault this film's tense, unpredictable atmosphere and the simple, but powerful plot. Nor is there anything wrong with the acting, direction, cinematography or length. But there was one aspect that stuck out like a sore thumb, for me anyway, and that was the portrayal of the main character, played by Jeremy Renner. While he is a fantastic actor and did a great job in this film, I felt his character was one huge cliché. I mean, how typical was his persona? Have we not seen this type of hot-shot character before? The macho, I'm-so-brave-and-unconcerned-and-I'm-going-to-ignore-all-the-rules-and commands.... His whole act felt very typical and unrealistic. Clearly, he loved doing what he did, and he knew he was good at it, but again, I couldn't help but feel like I've seen his character a million times before.     I'm usually not a fan of war films, but The Hurt Locker felt different, I think because it concentrated on a certain aspect of the Iraq war, or at least a certain division of it, which it made is slightly more interesting than other war films I've seen. There is not much fighting or battles, just those few tense scenes that have you on the edge of your seat, but it seems enough. For me this movie was more about the character than the Iraq war, and again, that's where my major gripe comes into play. All in all though, I would recommend this film just for its intensity and unpredictability.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|I was very amazed on how clear the sound was when I used it on my Kodak Zi8. I told my Fiance to wisper a letter I wrote to her and I could clearly hear every single word (Including her breathing).<br /><br />What I did not like was that the cables are way too long and skinny. So be very carefull when using this product by not stepping on it because it will break.<br /><br />Overall, if your looking for a great and clear sound this is a good pick. Just keep in mind the cables are very long and skinny.
B000OPOAJS|4.0|This is one of the most underated movies I have ever seen.  Not only does it have a phenomenal cast....but the acting and action are awesome.  I highly recommend this movie for anyone who enjoys a good suspense or action flick with more than a one line plot summary.
B000002C2E|5.0|1997's 'Time Out of Mind', despite critical praise and a Grammy Award win, is somewhat underrated when it comes to the general public opinion.  'Time Out of Mind' does not receive the same acclaim, as do Dylan's seminal works such as [[ASIN:B00026WU82 Highway 61 Revisited]], [[ASIN:B00026WU64 The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan]], [[ASIN:B00026WU8M Blonde on Blonde]], and [[ASIN:B00026WU7I Blood on the Tracks]], despite being a more than worthy contender.  Working with producer Daniel Lanois for the second time (1989's [[ASIN:B00026WU3M Oh Mercy]]), Dylan is content letting Lanois create a beautifully murky atmosphere that transforms the album into a truly original work of art unlike anything else in Dylan's large catalogue.  Lanois has produced many wonderful albums (Emmylou Harris's [[ASIN:B000002HKI Wrecking Ball]], Willie Nelson's [[ASIN:B00000AFB6 Teatro]], U2's [[ASIN:B000001FS3 The Joshua Tree]]) and his trademark sound effectively underscores the depth of Dylan's lyrics creating an effective blend of sonic and lyrical bliss.    From the beginning, Lanois's production steals the show.  The sharp staccato notes of an organ effectively, and eerily, punctuate the deep feeling expressed in \\"Love Sick\\", one of the many highlights.  Next up is \\"Dirt Road Blues\\", a country/blues romp more on a lighter note, yet gritty enough to make it sound like straight out of the Mississippi Delta.  \\"Standing in the Doorway\\" is one of the longer numbers on here (although all but 2 clock in at over five minutes) and is lyrically great, as is \\"Million Miles\\", however, things only get better from here.  \\"Trying to Get to Heaven\\" is another highlight, as is \\"`Til I Fell in Love with You\\".  \\"Not Dark Yet\\" is, in my opinion, the best song on the album.  Lyrically, it is unmatched, and gets my vote for Dylan's best song of the `90s.  The tempo picks up with \\"Cold Irons Bound\\".  It's great guitar-work by Lanois and he creates a fiery groove that never lets up.  \\"Make You Feel My Love\\" garnered some popularity by some covers by Trisha Yearwood and Garth Brooks from Hope Floats, but they don't hold a candle to the original.  His ragged voice creates a sincerity that makes it all the more beautiful.  \\"Can't Wait\\" is bluesy and up-tempo and similar to \\"Cold Irons Bound\\" in that respect with great guitar work.  \\"Highlands\\" is a 16-and-a-half minute story-song that is an interesting touch.  Comical and entertaining, if somewhat overlong, it nevertheless passes before you know it.      A great latter-day Dylan album that built upon the success of 'Oh Mercy' to jumpstart what would be a trio of 5-star albums [[[ASIN:B00005NI5Y \\"Love and Theft\\"]] (2001), and [[ASIN:B000GFLAI0 Modern Times]] (2005) would follow--definitely pick those up too!], 'Time Out of Mind' is a great collection of songs and is best appreciated in its entirety.  If you have any interest at all in Dylan, then pick this up right away!    NW
B000ZECQ08|5.0|My first copy sent was 'lost in shipment' so they sent another right away. I didn't get it when I wanted (1 day after the movie was released to DVD) but the quick service was nice.   I definitely like the darker tone set in this movie. Don't misunderstand, the first five are excellent, but this movie has the visuals I was waiting for. I am even more anxiously awaiting the last installment coming in July'10 and November '11.

I am at an intermediate level and find level 2 and level 3 are right for my needs. Time goes by fast and the sweat starts pouring pretty much from the beginning. If I have time, I do level 2 and level 3 together and feel like I got the best workout ever. Give this one a try for sure..you won't be disappointed.
1439138311|4.0|Brooklyn is a novel about a young Irish woman who moves to Brooklyn in the 1950's.<br /><br />This book wasn't really fun to read, but looking back, I did like it. The writing is not complicated, and simply tells the story of the woman's life in Brooklyn for a few years. She has roommates, a job, lots of people who want to give her advice. She starts a romance that she isn't completely sure about. She goes to night classes, and she has a mother and sister back in Ireland who she loves but feels tied to. Overall, it's a story about an ordinary girl with an ordinary life.<br /><br />Even though the writing is simple, each scene is evocative and detailed. The characters also are very realistic, though by the same token they are often not easy to like. Themes are present but subtle; for instance, the protagonist observes bias of many sorts in society around her, and must also confront it in herself.<br /><br />The author has a real talent - the ability to make the ordinary seem important, the plain seem meaningful and relevant.
B002GY9F9K|3.0|I have read all the books and found them to be excellent.  The series starts as a made for TV weekly program with the same script, but half way through starts drawing from the book and becomes better.  I have seen some of second season and can't wait of it to become available.  My advice to the user is to read the books first.
B000YY677W|5.0|Sure, it's a tough call. EXILE ON MAIN STREET, most often considered to be their best, is a phenomenal album although a few of its tracks don't quite measure up to its overall greatness in my view. For me, STICKY FINGERS ranks even higher. The playing on that album, thanks in no small part to new guitarist Mick Taylor, represents the Stones at the top of their game. But song for song, BEGGARS BANQUET comes out on top. It was the one that proved the Stones could get REALLY heavy. To most fans, it was also a welcome return to form after their SATANIC MAJESTY'S REQUEST detour into psychedelia. But more than anything, for the very first time the best songs on a Stones album (\\"Street Fighting Man,\\" \\"Stray Cat Blues\\") achieve the highest level of greatness they will ever reach - their hardest rocking, most original, most compelling songs.<br /><br />I still think the very best rock n' roll was made in the 60's. 1968 in particular was a tremendously exciting time and The Rolling Stones were a big part of that - they were surfing the edge of the zeitgeist. I'm no audiophile so I can't say which version sounds best although I'm willing to bet this is the version to get if you can afford it. I'm just here to make the case that this album is indispensable, quite possibly the best album they ever made, or even the best rock n' roll album anyone's made.<br /><br />\\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" - The ultimate expression of Jagger's demonic persona. He preens and taunts as if he really is the devil. Thousands of tightwad parents certainly thought he was, or close enough to it to ban their kids from hearing this record. The instantly recognizable bass riff is so melodic and busy, so insanely catchy as is the evocative African/Latin-flavored drumming. Only Keith's guitar solo doesn't quite rise to the occasion. But somehow, it still sounds cool and demonic, as if the say, \\"Hey, I'm Lucifer. I don't NEED to try that hard to sound cool.\\" Plus the metallic guitar tone is wicked. *****+<br /><br />\\"No Expectations\\" - A laid-back, acoustic ballad with sweet piano and slide guitar, this can be seen as a poignant anti-war song, even today, from someone losing faith in society. *****<br /><br />\\"Dear Doctor\\" - full-on country twang on guitar. Mick's mock Southern accent is hilarious as he gets sloshed while agonizing over his impending marriage. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Parachute Woman\\" - \\". . . land on me tonight.\\" This is a groovy, acoustic blues-rock shuffle that's pretty darn irresistible. For years now I've gotten sick of standard blues runs featuring the same old chord progressions. But the Stones can play any kind of music and chances are I'll love it. \\"Parachute Woman\\" sounds like a different kind of blues, even today, mostly because the Stones bring THE STONES to the table, a very powerful, very distinctive rock n' roll machine. *****<br /><br />\\"Jigsaw Puzzle\\" - This track never got the attention it deserved. It would sound great on classic rock radio (but no, those radio clowns prefer to stick to the same 5 or 6 Stones songs. Radio stations claim playlists prevent repetition but they actually create it. Screw corporate radio). The super cool lyrics paint vivid pictures of our troubled world while Jagger just tries to chill out and do his jigsaw puzzle.Great piano accompaniment and strident acoustic guitar slide, Charlie Watts spot-on, jazz inflected drumming - this one's a real winner. *****<br /><br />\\"Street Fighting Man\\" - This all-time classic is a tough, hard rage against society and a lament for the trials and tribulations of the poor man. There are so many layers of Keith's acoustic guitar overdubs that he was shocked to hear so many after the first remaster was made. Bill Wyman drives the song with some muscular bass-playing and Brian Jones, who was already on a drug-addled path to oblivion at this point, contributes some strangely effective mystical sitar touches. Exciting, Heart-wrenching heavy rock n' roll - this is the Stones at their best. *****+<br /><br />\\"Prodigal Son\\" - Written by a one Reverend Wilkins, this is the only song here not penned by Jagger/Richards. It's a strident, folky country shuffle of the old-school variety about the proverbial prodigal son of the Bible. ****<br /><br />\\"Stray Cat Blues\\" - This is the Stones at their nastiest and most menacing, my personal favorite Stones tune. \\"I can see that you're just 15 years old/ But I don't want your I.D.\\" Such an infectious rocker, a compelling rhythm and Keith riffing all over the place. *****+<br /><br />\\"Factory Girl\\" - a lovely little country/folk song featuring a fiddle and Jagger in full country drawl. He's waiting for his girlfriend to get off work to go party. I'm not much of a country fan, but I always love when the Stones do it. Just about every kind of music they touch turns to gold. *****<br /><br />\\"Salt of the Earth\\" - Mick sounds positively drunk as he proposes a toast to the common masses who take care of all the lowly grunt work which benefits us all. Some view this song as a sarcastic, cynical jab at those who are less fortunate, but I see it as more of a moving tribute. This loose, country-tinged rocker features female choruses, forcefully strummed acoustic guitar, full drum kit and pounding piano which slowly build up to a head-spinning climax. *****+Wilkins, this is the only song here not penned by Jagger/Richards.

B001U0HBPG|5.0|What an excellent movie.  I'm so glad I bought it.  Cate Blanchett and Brad Pitt are both exceptionally good in their roles.  The makeup artists did an amazing job and the 3 Acadamy Awards prove that this is a must see.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|This movie is very good and true to the the original series!There are a few deference from the series, but that the point of the rebuild movies. It has the original voice actors(in Japanese) which that alone is very cool and lets you get a true feelings of Neon Genesis Evangelion.<br />The Video and Sound Quality are great its has the Dolby TureHD 6.1 Audio sound track. The Visuals are good and the video quality is great.<br />I would highly recommend Evangelion: 1.11 You Are (Not) Alone to any anime fan!
B000ZECQ08|5.0|I have been a HUGE Harry Potter fan for awhile now and I found that this movie was done the best as far as book-to-movie adaptation. Some of the dialogue in the movie was even directly from the book.    I am a big fan of Ron/Hermione, but the Harry/Ginny scenes in this movie were working!!    I definitely recommend this movie!!
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I LOVE THE MOVIE! It was not perfect. But, what is perfect? The movie holds up with an open flame of excitement each time I have watched it now. It does not become less of a classic but a true gem of work that retells and explains in more detail from the imagination of Gene Roddenberry 's vision of our world finally coming together with race, creed, religion and even sex.     Now, for the review on this item. The Blu-Ray looks slick and flesh tones are very distinct throughout the movie. The blacks are solid and blend well when other primary colors fly out with no conflict to detect. The audio is great too! I had the pleasure of hearing without focusing with slight sounds that normally are unable to pierce through when in the theater.     The special features are expanded, detailed and first-rate on presentation, editing and evenflow of pace from beginning to end. I am looking forward to the next Star Trek movie and when it becomes available on BLU-RAY.
0143116177|4.0|The best explanation of the history and development of finance and financial instruments I have read, making complex derivatives as easy to understand as compound interest. Particularly interesting in its explanation of how most important world events since the Renaissance have had origins in financial decisions (eg want to know why the Confederates lost the war? At least one of the reasons was the decline of the Cotton Bond) and how financial instruments have generally been a power for good - perhaps the most continuous driver of positive change.   Ferguson writes in a down to earth style and seems to enjoy the smashing of shibolleths. Property the best bet? The figures don't back it up. Third world the cause of most financial problems? Generally its the UK and Europe that have caused most trouble. Financial modeling as the key to smooth flawless market predictions? Never underestimate the human capacity for delusion and stupidity.   Highly recommended
0930289234|5.0|Like so many people, I first read Watchmen when it dropped on the unsuspecting public so many years ago. At the time, I was more enamored with Miller's \\"Dark Knight Returns;\\" however, (with no slight to 'Dark Knight, which is, in itself a classic) I have found that as time passes, the brilliance of Alan Moore's superheroic deconstruction stands alone in the pantheon of graphic novel greatness. The storyline remains, sad to say, vigilant and pertinent - and the characters are classic archetypes that even the most discerning literati must appreciate. Watchmen is a disturbing look inside all of us, and the novel's message refuses to die, [despite being made into a crappy movie.] I TEACH Watchmen to my 10th grade gifted/talented class every year and they are, without fail, blown away. You will be, too.[[ASIN:1432748297 Why Are All the Good Teachers Crazy?]]
B00007G1ZC|3.0|Some dreams make better films than others. Japanese director Akira Kurosawa's are no exception. \\"Dreams\\" (1990) is a decidedly mixed bag from the master, whose breathtaking visual style has not deserted him in these eight vignettes. The highlight is Kurosawa's astonishing journey through the paintings and landscape of Vincent Van Gogh (well-played by director Martin Scorsese) - a tour de force punctuated by its inventive use of color. However, the remaining stories pale in comparison to this mini-masterpiece. Kurosawa's anti-nuclear railings dominate two heavy-handed segments unworthy of \\"The Twilight Zone.\\" Potentially intriguing episodes (such as a group of climbers trapped in a suffocating blizzard, followed by a \\"night of the living war dead\\" tale) emerge as sleep-inducing disappointments. Not all is lost. The first, second and last dreams are beautifully rendered ruminations on Kurosawa's childhood, nature and, inevitably, the graceful coda of death. If the director had pared down the self-indulgent segments, the overall film would have been far more effective.
B000002LVB|5.0|Just bought this back in December.  Bought the \\"Extra Loaded\\" when it came out back in 1997.  Maybe it was a little too bloated for me,  but the original album is a classic and fast-becoming my favorite  VU album.  I like the poppier sound just fine and it has arguably their two best-known songs in \\"Sweet Jane\\"  and \\"Rock N Roll.\\"  I have listened to this 4-5 times all the way through since I bought and really enjoy listening to the album as a whole.  It's not too hard and not too soft, it's Just Right.  Helps relax me and not as abrasive as their first two albums.
B002XTBEDI|1.0|The original BBC TV production of \\"Cranford,\\" based on the book by E Gaskell, is charm itself. This later production is not based on any work by Gaskell and was created from thin air and that's about what it is worth. It is so poorly written that it ruins the memory of the original series. By all means, get the original \\"Cranford,\\" but avoid this ersatz aberration altogether!
B0020MKTOS|5.0|Clint Eastwood stars and directs this film  He is a graying, craggy, cranky Korean War Vet.  He lives in a tough neighborhood all alone (widower, agnostic, angry) and loath to become neighborly to a teenage boy next door, and his Hmong immigrant family.<br /><br />The movie is set in Detroit.  The economics of the times are clear and Clint plays Walt Kowalski as a racist that knows all the slurs in the book.  He is wrathful, prideful, and refuses to leave a neighborhood he is familiar with.  He sees the neighborhood deteriorating, but perseveres in holding his place.  He was well-trained in war and alert and ready for the neighborhood gangs as attempts are made to steal his prized possession, a Pontiac Gran Torino.<br /><br />This is a racial morality story, but also about personal bonds that form as we learn to live together in a changing world. There is bitter humor and deep caring as the characters learn to know each other and forget stereotypes.<br /><br />In the end, Walt gives wisdom and strength to a struggling immigrant family, as well as his most powerful performance.<br /><br />A film you will not forget.

B002K0WBXW|4.0|This is a clever, funny, engaging comedy with Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds.  Because it is light-hearted and a predictable script, the romantic comedy would be best enjoyed by die-hard Sandra Bullock fans.  Bullock plays a career-driven, Top Publisher, Margaret Tate who also happens to be a Canadian citizen.  She is denied a visa and does not want to be sent back to Canada as it will ruin her career in the U.S.A.  Her assistant, Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds) has taken her whims and gruff treatment as a way to get into the publishing business.  In a very funny scene she is meeting with her superiors and realizes she can become a citizen if she marries an American Citizen.  She grabs her assistant Andrew and announces they are engaged.  She forces him to become her fiancee, and he goes along with it for other reasons.  He has a trip to Alaska planned and she goes with him to prove to U.S. Immigration that this is a valid marriage.  Betty White plays \\"grandma\\" and is delightful spirit.<br /><br />The acting and comedic timing is fun to watch - and the film is predictable but the film gives a great and funny entertaining two hours.

B001AVCFJM|3.0|first off... I talk too much!:  Before the long wind begins, I will say I did enjoy this film. It did indeed entertain me. The problem always comes with the noisy ruminations of its enthusiastic appreciators.I think that I could get with the prevailing assessment of the \\"greatness\\" of this film if there was a modicum of respect for the art that came before it. Like battlestar galactica, like star wars, like the recent installments of superman and batman (the slightly older newer batman - being batman begins actually - coming less than a full decade after the old incarnation) the passionate contemporary blows the loudest horn. The words \\"Younger\\" and \\"better\\", the word \\"sexier\\", the ill gotten word \\"hipper\\" are thrown around as justifications of the product's existence altogether. It's the hip sexiness that makes this new such and such a thousand times better than the old so and so. As if there were any better reason for sprucing up and old car or an old house, than the time honored pursuit of long green! New Money making marketeer barons would have us believe the fairytale that this new re-imagination trend of updating the old was the obligation of the young. It is not, as a matter of fact, to anyone listening, it is not not not! But this is the parlance they use, and no one asks..., yeah but... WHY? Why did it HAVE to happen? It didn't. The suits just thought they could make a buck off something. Yes yes, a built in audience! Excellent marketing savvy there, gentlemen, although if you proceed to change everything in order to make it \\"digest-able\\" to the A.D.D. in you and me, then aren't they effectively alienating those same supposedly built in devotees? Tis indeed a conundrum!     Hubris:  And how does this attitude of better come into the equation. This is such a throw away society that we have television shows that are dedicated to mocking the times and styles of decades past with amusingly clever video blubs and pop up commentary atop stock footage of Wham or the Beatles or President Kennedy and everyone giggles about hair styles and artsy gimmickry. However they're clearly oblivious to the fact that in time the right now will be the back then, and brand new snotties in hipster gear of tomorrow year will be mocking them just as vehemently and thinking themselves just as clever. Comparing the old Battlestar Galactica or Star trek to the new is ridiculously naïve and downright stupid. Of course with the benefit of 20 to 30 years of advancement the look of one thing from now will out shine the lack of gloss of the one thing then. No one looks at photography and says that they're modern Polaroid of their dog, or the digital download of their children in a playground are \\"BETTER\\" than old picture candids of grandma from 1947, it's the substance of the photo, not the quality of the make of the picture. I mean, That argument would be friggin' stupid, wouldn't it?!!! The special effects are a thousand times better, the look is crisper, the visuals stunning. So let that be written down, we all agree. But sorry kids, I can still separate pretty from nourishing. Just a plain pretty look and nothing much in the story department is the equivalent of empty calories. Something to think about.     About the film itself:  For something so new and improved we sure did manage to roll out the Sci Fi cliché machine front and center when we were jotting this three act extravaganza down on paper, didn't we?     MR.BRAIN: Well... first we need a villain, he should be deep and brooding and virtually wordless so we don't have any of those clichéd cartoon mustache twisting villain moments.   MR. PINKY: How can we make him menacing if n' he don't talk, though, boss?  MR.BRAIN: Easy, we'll put sinister looking tattoos all over his face and give him nasty looking serrated edged weapons he can use to slay hapless Starfleet officers!  MR. PINKY: Brilliant, sir! What do we call him?  MR.BRAIN: Darth Maul!  MR. PINKY: Uhh, sir? Seriously?  MR.BRAIN: Yeah you're right, that's been taken. Alright well Roddenberry templated the Romulans against the Romans, roll out the list of roman emperors, drop your finger on a name and let's just move on, ANYTHING BUT CAESAR! That's too obvious.   MR. PINKY: Of course, sir.   MR.BRAIN: Now we don't want Darth Maul...  MR. PINKY: Sir?!  MR.BRAIN: I mean Nero, to be one dimensional, do we? So we'll have to give him purpose, alright, I say page two paragraph six of the vile motivations handbook?  MR. PINKY: Dead wife, sir?  MR.BRAIN: Yes! It worked for Mr. Freeze, didn't it? But lets up the anti_ his whole planet's destroyed and so now he wants to destroy the federation.  MR. PINKY: So the federation destroyed his planet?  MR.BRAIN: Nahh, but we'll come up with some convoluted plot point that'll wrap that all up.  MR. PINKY: How's he try to destroy the federation, sir, Sabotage? Political intrigue?  MR.BRAIN: Are you nuts, that would take whole minutes to establish, and mostly done through dialog! Go to chapter one in the Vile Implementations handbook.  MR. PINKY: Oh sir, you don't mean....?  MR.BRAIN: Yes my friend, the vaunted planet destroying weapon!  MR. PINKY: Didn't we do that with V-Ger in the first film Kahn and the genesis device, or the hunchback whale probe, or with that weirdo nexus ribbon that required the destruction or worlds to be moved, or when that guy who killed Mozart needed a face lift and was willing to use some solar collector thingie on a planet, or that OTHER Romulan dude, Shinzon or whatever, didn't he have a super baddie weapon he planned to use against the federation? And didn't Vader have like two of those types of things?  MR.BRAIN: Your point? It works, don't it?     MR. PINKY: Alright, so we got the federation against a rogue madman with his very own planet destroying weapon and an axe to grind?  MR.BRAIN: Sounds like Gold, don't it?  MR. PINKY: But neither Romulos nor Vulcan were destroyed in Kirks time of star trek, sir, how do we fit this in?  MR.BRAIN: C'mon, use you head willya, Mirror mirror on the wall!  MR. PINKY: Ohh of course sir, an alternate universe! Meaning Nero's a time traveler! The sci Fi trifecta, you are an absolute genius of modern celluloid story crafting, sir.  MR.BRAIN: Yes, yes, you're quite right! Alright my nephew'll be getting home from high school any minute; I get him working on the script as soon as he puts the key in the door!    Get you-self an edu-ma-cation, son:  Sadly I must admit to a prejudice myself, toward these greasy new executive hipsters whom blow in, un-time-tested, with one or two hits under their belt and now suddenly their some prodigy that knows better than everyone.

Fast paced and not so heady.\\" Fair enough, you wanted one classic space opera to be more like another classic space opera more so than you wanted it to be like itself. Alright, knowing you boys the way I do that almost makes some sense. But then they keep talking and you hear things from their own lips like, \\"we took this out because it was too Set-up-ee.\\" And allowing the vocab felony just committed by the word `Set-up-ee', you think; alright, the hipster's panicked that his excuse for dialog is going on too long between explosions. So out comes potentially pertinent information for the sake expediency. (them film jockeys call this \\"pacing\\") You keep moving. Then you get like a twelve and a half minute featurette showing you how the crafty crafters stationed a man just within camera shot so he could shine a flashlight into the lens and give everything a glaring effect. And you go. Well alright, this is sorta like movie magic, I guess, and it...is...worthy of a....full...featurette...........Right? then they talk about the director and the praise his wisdomand how good he is at turning water to wine and making the sick well and the blind see and all that, and then he comes on the scene and claims absolute stupidity, saying he was never a fan of the original trek, he never watched the show, but he had some GREAT IDEAS when they handed the project to him! So now you're like, alright, well.... So the guy's not a fan and... WAIT, WHY THE HELL IS HE MAKING THIS DAMNED MOVIE THEN? And why does an obviously smart man whom makes A-list movies feel compelled to completely downplay his wit in order to put butts in the seats? Has this society become so cynical and paranoid and functionally illiterate that we are dismayed by even the indication of a higher intellect behind our entertainment, or running our COUNTRY?! Are we at a point where a smart man has to play dumb or keep his street credibility and be taken semi seriously on the internet machine? All be told, allowing for Abrams to come out and claim a willful lack of education for himself and also of the genre he's just reinvented, harkens to the new trend of the hapless hero whom is seemingly brilliant by divine intervention and never had to work for his wit or his talents like everyone else. This new Kirk in the movie is a snot nosed kid, subversive and compulsive and reckless, yet someone sees potential in him and urges him to sign up. He even cheats, breaks all the rules and though Spock is a commander while he's still a cadet he is suddenly elevated to captain on his first mission, rising past Spock and a host of others whom I must assume have all been in Starfleet longer and whom presumably did so without faking out the system. I know the original Kirk cheated at the Kobyashi test, but you never get the impression that this was anything more than just an adherence to his own personal ideology that he didn't believe in the no win scenario. The way this is depicted, without any example of otherwise academic achievement on Chris Pines' (his character, not him, I think the dudes a whip ;)) part, we imply that he just got there on the merits of being ballsy and cheating his way through it. Someone should really have a problem with their heroes being depicted this way, but I don't think people were compelled to pay that much attention to the light lunch of characterization they were being spoon fed with sugary visuals! Hmmmmm, wait a minute.... was this Kirk quark a little autobiographical license there by the young upstart in the director's chair? Coincidence? Nahhh!     All put together I began to think to yourself, DID REALLY I JUST FRICKEN SEE AND HEAR WHAT I THOUGHT I SAW AND HEARD? And thus the intellect crusades begin. And there I go off wondering, is it not more important to inspire those still un-jaded and inspirables to CREATING something new?!    Technicality peeves:  Oh and Warp Nacelles are not thrusters, guys. The point is that they WARP space and propel the ship faster than light. They're not Jet afterburners! FYI. There have been literally a zillion tech manuals written on the Trek science, whereas you might think that these details are ridiculous, remember you're making a star trek movie! Don't talk to me about being a geek, you're the head geek in charge now, Mister mister! Can we get a guy that knows a guy to work on getting a guy to work on that? Also, who jettisons a cadet from their ship to a Hoth just because there's a slight disagreement? Doesn't the new flag ship have a brig? Oh, what? Oh, they needed to do that so young Kirk could meet old Spock and Scotty so that act 2 could begin? I see, uhhh.... Alright.... I guess. ;)  BUT I DIGRESS!      Wrap it up!:  My point is for this film and its fans; it could not have been without the original. Mr. Abrams, for all his genuine brilliance, could not have done this without firmly standing on the shoulders of Mr. Roddenberry, without taking from a wealth of pre-established minutia that allowed him the luxury of picking and choosing and then casting the aforementioned\\"New Spin\\". What I fail to understand in this great society of ours is, why does anything new that happens to also be good, have to be good at the expense of what came before? Why does this have to be BETTER? Why would we mock he original actors and what they did and what they left us? I mean, remember acting, folks. True the Shat-inator was over-exuberant from time to time...to time, but there was genuine conveyance of wit and both intellect and emotion from these highly capable people. We're mocking that against modern characteristic development? Are you serious? I think it would be easier to agree that it was a fast paced, enjoyable film that allowed new perspectives and new directions to be taken with old favorites if there wasn't automatically this seeming inescapable negative slant against the old for the exaltation of the new. The new is pretty, the new is newer, stylized and kinetically meeting the manic short attention span standards of the eyes of today. It has not been proven, it has not been weighed or time tested at the moment, it should be given a chance, but exaltation waits until exaltation is earned. As we have clearly learned with the original trek movies, and the new star wars, and even the new dune novels, NOTHING IS AN ABSOLUTE WIN.     I liked the film, I liked it a lot. I want more of this, but I want substance with it too, and I am harsh because I can see the trend trending away from weight and further and further towards fluff, toward \\"easy\\". Visuals are easy. I can think of a visual: a giant octopus wrapped tight around the empire state building, swatting battle ships out of the river while whistling the star spangled banner!: doesn't make that visual compelling or intriguing, (well kinda...) it's just a visual! It's not the film; it's the new ideological hubris I feel it represents.         And.....................breath...
B00166BL6Y|5.0|This April 2008 40th Anniversary 2CD COLLECTOR'S EDITION of Jethro Tull's explosive 1968 debut album has been a long time coming - but the wait has been so worth it. Sound-wise this peach is simply off the charts good and as a reissue has breathed new life into a long forgotten and largely dismissed album. I suspect that even people who don't like Tull (and they are derided in certain circles) will enjoy this and be duly impressed. There's a lot on here, so here's a detailed breakdown first...<br /><br />DISC 1 (71:28 minutes):<br />1. My Sunday Feeling<br />2. Someday The Sun Won’t Shine<br />3. Beggar’s Farm<br />4. Move On Alone<br />5. Serenade To A Cuckoo<br />6. Dharma For One [Side 2]<br />7. It’s Breaking Me Up<br />8. Cat’s Squirrel<br />9. A Song For Jeffrey<br />10. Round<br />Tracks 1 to 10 are the MONO VERSION of the album &#34;This Was&#34; released 25 October 1968 in the UK on Island ILP 985. February 1969 saw the album released in the USA on Reprise RS 6336 but in Stereo only - the Stereo mix is on Disc 2.<br /><br />BONUS TRACKS:<br />11. So Much Trouble<br />12. My Sunday Feeling<br />13. Serenade To A Cuckoo<br />14. Cat’s Squirrel<br />15. A Song For Jeffrey<br />Tracks 11 to 15 are live-in-the-studio recordings made for John Peel's &#34;Top Gear&#34; Radio program on BBC 1, recorded 23 July 1968 in London (broadcast August & September 1968)<br />16. Love Story<br />17. Stormy Monday<br />18. Beggar’s Farm<br />19. Dharma For One<br />Tracks 16 to 19 are more live-in-the-studio recordings as per 11 to 15...recorded 5 November 1968 in London (broadcast December 1968)<br /><br />DISC 2 (55:18 minutes):<br />Tracks 1 to 10 are the STEREO VERSION of the album &#34;This Was&#34; released 25 October 1968 on Island ILPS 9085 [credited here as a &#34;New Stereo Mix&#34;]<br /><br />Tracks 11 and 12 are ADDITIONAL NEW STEREO MIXES of &#34;Love Story&#34; and &#34;Christmas Song&#34; [New to this set]<br /><br />Tracks 13 to 16 are ORIGINAL MONO RECORDINGS (UK Singles)<br />13 is &#34;Sunshine Day&#34;, their debut UK 7&#34; single issued 16 February 1968 on MGM Records 1348 [miscredited as Jethro Toe]<br />14 is &#34;One For John Gee&#34;, non-album B-side to &#34;A Song For Jeffrey&#34;, 2nd UK 7&#34; single issued September 1968 on Island WIP 6043<br />15 is &#34;Love Story&#34;, November 1968, Non-Album Track, A-side of their 3rd UK 7&#34; single on Island WIP 6048<br />16 is &#34;Christmas Song&#34;, also a non-album track on release, B-side to 15<br /><br />PETER MEW at Abbey Road has expertly remastered the 1st generation original masters tapes and the results are stupendous - the clarity is now unbelievable on both the old MONO MIX and the newly constructed STEREO MIX. Getting your hands on an original UK MONO vinyl copy of this album has always been an expensive and difficult affair - the STEREO version a little less so. So it's great to finally have both on a good CD.  The 12-page booklet is a little crammed (pictures of 45's you can barely make out due to their tiny size), but it does features new notes from both Ian Anderson and Mick Abrahams.<br /><br />Highlights - the opening track &#34;My Sunday Feeling&#34; (lyrics above) is classic Tull - rock with a flute jazz tint. Speaking of which - the track &#34;Serenade To A Cuckoo&#34; first appeared on Rahsaah Roland Kirk's 1964 album &#34;I Talk With The Spirits&#34;. Kirk's flute technique of humming and mouthing as you play the instrument clearly blew away the young Ian Anderson, because he's been aping that style ever since (it's also the only time a cover version has appeared on a Jethro Tull album). The bluesy &#34;Beggar's Farm&#34; is so clear now as are Clive Bunker's drums on &#34;Dharma For One&#34;. The Stereo Mix of &#34;Some Day The Sun Won't Shine&#34; absolutely leaps out of the speakers, while the harmonica and guitar duo intro on &#34;It's Breaking Me Up&#34; perfectly compliments the slinky bass line by Glenn Cornick. &#34;Cat's Squirrel&#34; just rocks like a monster too. The additional BBC stuff is very good (the band was still fresh) as are the properly remastered versions of the early Tull singles (most of which were non-album until the 2LP set &#34;Living In The Past&#34; in 1972).<br /><br />I'd have preferred a far more expanded booklet, but it's the great remaster that makes me come back to this reissue time and time again... Onwards from here to Mick Abraham's Blodwyn Pig and their stunning 1969 debut &#34;Ahead Rings Out&#34; (see separate review).<br /><br />EMI are to be praised for this - an absolute winner - recommended big time.<br /><br />PS: for Peter Mew's work see also Dr. Feelgood's &#34;Down By The Jetty&#34; DELUXE EDITION and Kevin Ayers' &#34;The Confessions Of Dr. Dream And Other Stories&#34; – both reviewed in my download book SOUNDS GOOD: 1970’s Rock and Pop…bum until the 2LP set &#34;Living In The Past&#34; in 1972).

B000E33W1W|4.0|Nobody takes the poor trio in the paranormal studies area of the university seriously.  So even after they first encounter a real ghost, Peter (Bill Murray), Ray (Dan Aykroyd), and Egon (Harold Ramis) are fired.  Suddenly on their own, they decide to open Ghostbusters.  Things get off to a slow start, but when word of their work picks up, the trio are soon extremely popular - and wealthy.<br /><br />One of their first clients was Dana (Sigourney Weaver), who claimed there was something in her apartment.  Peter investigates, mainly because she is beautiful.  But when something does start to happen, it is big.  We're talking end of the world big.  Can the Ghostbusters stop it?<br /><br />This 80's comedy includes just enough of the supernatural to have some menace.  But it never forgets that it is first and foremost a comedy.  There are some nice laughs throughout the film.  Even when things get more intense near the end, they include enough laughs to keep you from getting too scared.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the movie does show its age.  I just watched it for the first time, and I had to get past the heavy cheese factor.  We're talking major doses of 80's movie making here.  It's worth it, but do keep that in mind.  Also, the plot drops a couple of points and never really gets them back.<br /><br />And the effects are definitely dated.  A few were impressive, but most looked low budget even for then.  Then again, very few films have held up over the last 25 years.<br /><br />This is an entertaining movie that shows its age.  If you are new to it, you might not see it as a classic, but you'll still enjoy it.
B000NTPDSW|1.0|Bah! Don't waste your $$$ on this one. I bought it for my wife for a Christmas gift (she is a huge Godfather fan and we just got a new 52\\" Bravia and a PS3) and it was a HUGE disappointment! Maybe I misunderstood what was meant by 'restoration' but I thought the blu-ray would be comparable to other blu-ray movies, not so. The quality of the picture was, to us, indistinguishable from the DVD played through the PS3 (which upconverts). I wish I could return the thing, there are so many other movies for which I could shell out $59 (what it cost on Amazon when I bought it; the price dropped to $49 the next day but it had already shipped).
006074815X|3.0|Give Ken Follett credit; he really knows his stuff.  You can easily imagine yourself in wartime London in this very exciting thriller.  The characters are portrayed in a very lifelike way and it is a good read.  Unfortunately the plot itself is not remotely credible.  It relies on coincidence after coincidence, and everything falls into place just as it must in order for the German spy to be captured.  Written early in his career, it's not Follett's best.  Still, the book's historic accuracy, particularly in relating the lives of normal British citizens during the war salvages a few stars.
055357342X|5.0|I personally don't like fantasy books. I've tried reading them but I don't think I've ever finished one, including LOTR. Historical fiction is my preference. Bernard Cornwell's great Saxon series is one example. I asked a co-worker who reads fantasy almost exclusively to try the Saxon series. He enjoyed it and told me I would like the Song of Fire and Ice series. Well, he was wrong. I LOVE it! For some of you the lack of wizards and dragons etc is a disappointment but for me, Dani's storyline with the dragons is the weakest part of the series. But Martin has created a fantastic world and I can't seem to wait to read what happens next. A hint: it's probably not what you think will happen. Well I gotta go. Several \\"good\\" characters just got whacked at an otherwise festive occasion. Gotta see what happens next.
0446402397|5.0|This book is full of suspense, twists, turns, and action. I couldn't put it down. Would recommend to anyone who loves historical fiction!
B0021L8UPS|4.0|Just wanted to note this was a nice roller coaster ride full of<br />suspense, very well done, well acted, surprises. I thought it<br />was going to go in the direction of The Omen etc. but it didn't get into religion or the supernatural, more suspense, bad seed style evil.  I would recommend this one, it packs a good punch when you're looking for something late at night.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|As the title suggests i did not play ff7. In fact Advent Children was my introduction to the Final Fantasy line. That was maybe four years ago, i still have not gotten my hands on a copy of FF7 but i Advent Children is one of my favorite movies of all time. This complete version of it is even better. There are a lot of reviews with a lot of good comments so i won't repeat. But i do think its important to know that this movie is still fantastic without having played the game. And the complete version is much easier to follow considering that. Amazing movie. Definitly in my top two.
B001UV4XUG|4.0|Everything about this movie was quirky - the characters, the jobs, the setting, the romance, the wacky chronology. But it worked. I thought I would hate the non-linear (REALLY non-linear) telling of this story, but it did not bother me at all, which is very surprising.<br /><br />The casting of Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel was right on target for the roles they played. Great acting by these two, good chemistry.<br /><br />This is not as much about a romance as about a relationship and how it does and does not work, and why.<br /><br />The movie was smart and original and well worth seeing.
B001AVCFK6|4.0|STAR TREK<br /><br />STARRING: Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Bruce Greenwood, Leonard Nimoy, Eric Bana, John Cho, Karl Urban, Anton Yelchin, Zoe Saldana, Simon Pegg, Ben Cross Jennifer Morrison, Rachel Nichols, Tyler Perry (no, not as Madea) and Winona Ryder<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: J.J. Abrams<br /><br />Rated: PG-13<br />Genre: Action / Science Fiction<br />Release Date: 8 May 2009<br /><br />If you are worried that you won't like Star Trek because you hated the show, you can relax. I have never been a fan of the show yet I am here to tell you that the movie is a lot of fun.<br /><br />We meet up with the original characters so many have grown fond of over the years and each and every one of them was cast beautifully.<br /><br />\\"My name is James Tiberius Kirk\\", he announces dramatically when we meet him for the first time. He's maybe 10 and in trouble with the law for stealing his step-dad's nice car and `accidentally' driving it into a large quarry. I don't know why he needed to say his full name when the robot police officer asked him for it or why he had to shout it to all of us so triumphantly; oh wait, yeah I do folks, because it's a big Hollywood movie, that's why.<br /><br />Chris Pine plays the older than the 10-year-old but younger than Shatner version of James T. Kirk. His scenes made me feel like I was watching Saved by the Bell: In Space. He's like the new and improved Zack Morris. He seems to play Kirk virtually effortlessly and we enjoy every second of it.<br /><br />Simon Pegg is hilarious as Scotty and yes there are plenty of \\"Beam-me-up\\" one-liners to go around for everyone.<br /><br />Karl Urban may have been destined to play Bones. He fits like Hugh Jackman fits as Wolverine. There are some very well timed comedic moments exchanged between him and Kirk. I wish there were time for a few more of them.<br /><br />The performance in the film I was the least satisfied with was surprisingly Eric Bana. Bana is consistently very good but was not at all properly cast here. He plays the villain Nero, who in my opinion is too lame even for the old television show. I was repeatedly annoyed by this character and found him to be a pathetic excuse for a lead villain. He wounded the film severely.<br /><br />I'm not forgetting anyone, am I? Oh wait, who was that strange pointy eared fellow in desperate need of a sense of humor. Oh yes, Spock!<br /><br />Who would have thought that Star Trek would have a possible candidate for an Oscar nomination in acting? I sure didn't. But thanks to the amazing performance of Zachary Quinto as Spock, it could very well be looked at for more than just its amazing special effects.<br /><br />This kid has got something. He really dove into the role of Spock and blew me away. He out-acts everyone in every scene and remember, I said the others did a good job too. He's every bit as good as Leonard Nimoy, if not better. I have yet to watch the show Heroes, but have heard many great things about his role and after seeing him in Star Trek; I will definitely be checking it out soon.<br /><br />This is clearly a starter film so there's not much of a plot. Basically, that horrible villain Nero I told you about, is upset at everyone and plans on taking over the galaxy, I guess was his point? Our good guys all board the Enterprise and they duke it out with Nero and his men. That's pretty much it in a nutshell folks.<br /><br />Don't take that as a bad thing though. While the plot isn't that thick, the movie is still well written. Including the way characters enter each frame and the great deal of humor. We get to know all of the characters and enjoy their interactions with one-another more than the plot anyway. There were even a few moments where you were really moved as well.<br /><br />I was moved early in the film when Kirk takes on a group of guys in a bar fight in an attempt to impress a girl. There's more to it than that though. The writers are showing us a lot about his personality and we get the sense that he would have still picked that fight had she not been there. He doesn't take crap from anyone and these guys clearly deserved to get their heads knocked in.<br /><br />The scene continues as Kirk is approached by the Captain of the Enterprise, Pike, (Bruce Greenwood) who leaves him with choice words to ponder. I strongly believe Bruce Greenwood could carry a movie by himself; just as well as he carried the second half of this scene and several others in Star Trek. I don't know if Hollywood will ever give him a leading role, but I would love it if they did.<br /><br />J.J. Abrams is a great director and excels at action and suspense driven scenes. You get amazing shots through space of the new Enterprise gliding and some great action sequences. I particularly enjoyed the scene where Kirk visited another planet and was chased by a huge creature.<br /><br />Had they put the same energy into Nero that they did into the other characters it would have been a lot better. But also keep in mind, I'm not a real fan of Star Trek, so if you are then you may very well love it.there.

B002VPE1AM|2.0|boy they made a big deal about all the visual effects in this movie, and they are pretty amazing. but it seems like a really long roundabout way to cg a movie. capturing the actors actual facial expressions and rendering them on a computer seems like alot of work for a little pay off.<br /><br />honestly my biggest complaint about this movie has to do with where the emphasis was placed on the production. for a movie with a budget the likes of which has never been seen before they went with a schlock story with a predictable curve and no pay off. seriously the whole spectacle of it all is overshadowed by how mediocre the plot is. it's not a bad plot mind, but it's so basic it really feels empty. they couldn't have spent maybe one of those millions on something original?<br /><br />thats where it really gets me, for such stunning visuals the whole movie isn't very original. the horses they ride are pretty much horses. the bows are just bows, and with a few exeptions the florra of pandora is mostly things you can find watching a decent underwater documentary. the closest they get to original are the dragons, which were kinda cool but original creatures are not hard to invent.<br /><br />i also thought they missed alotta oportunities with the little stories. jake sully is a wheelchair bound marine, and he has no trouble picking walking back up at all once his legs are restored by the avatar process. and after spending weeks in the new body he is still an extremely capable cripple. they never once show him have a moment where he struggles with pulling his dead legs out of the machine.<br /><br />sigourney weever plays a marine hating pocket protector wearing environmentalist nerd. who hates jake imediatly because he's a marine, big surprise, but the second he puts on the avatar body she warms up to him. and really without much trouble she continues warming up to him almost regardless of jakes actual actions.<br /><br />overall, the story is bland, the characters are pretty poorly built up and the beastiary is pretty familair if brightly colored. but hey, the movie looks great. thats about the best thing i can say for it. boring but beautiful.is pretty familair if brightly colored. but hey, the movie looks great. thats about the best thing i can say for it. boring but beautiful.
B00005QXDD|5.0|JB and KG have outdone themselves with this album. The album creates a great musical paradox, and that is what I like about it. The lyrics, are some of the most pointless, stupid, and funny lyrics you will ever hear. The music though, is actually rather deep and powerful. These two factors combine to make a very unique listening experience. The humor tracks that are thrown in, like Inward Singing and the Drive Through, are hilarious additions that will not disappoint you. The parental advisory sticker does not lie. Just about every track has vulgar language throughout, but I do not mind the language that bad, and I feel that it actually adds to the fun of the lyrics.   If you have not checked out Tenacious D yet, I highly recomend that you do. Great music and ridiculous lyrics combine to create a truly unique musical experience.
B0026P3G12|2.0|Wow, what a disappointment.<br /><br />Anyone who heard Susan Boyle on \\"Britain's Got Talent\\" when she shocked the world and caused many a tear to fall with her incredible voice was undoubtedly looking forward to her debut CD.  Sad to say, and through no fault of her own, there wasn't much to look forward to in the end.<br /><br />This CD would be better suited as music to snooze with, not revel at.  On songs like \\"Cry Me a River\\" and \\"How Great Thou Art\\" when you would expect to be shaken out of your shoes with some rafter-reaching vocals, Boyle barely extends her diaphragm above a whisper.  With \\"You'll See\\", a Madonna tune, Boyle didn't bring anything new to her rendition.  It's a pretty cover but a boring one, which appears to be the theme of this album.  A voice worthy of long-standing Broadway showtunes was subjected to the sort of treatment that a manufactured pop star would receive.<br /><br />\\"Who I Was Born to Be\\" is a nice tune, probably the best on the album, although her consistent vibrato here, (as well as on the rest of the album), is so overdone that you can't appreciate it.  Other classics such as \\"The End of the World\\" and \\"Daydream Believer\\" are not done any justice by what could have been some of the best cover versions performed.  Plus, they chose to end the album with \\"Silent Night\\".  A Christmas track?  Really?  How random.  That's fine for this time of year but are you really going to want to listen to that in June?  At least they made it the last track for easier skipping.  And something seems really wrong with a priviledged white woman singing \\"Amazing Grace\\", especially when she's not singing it with gusto.  The beauty of this song is to express an appreciation of relief from a long-standing suffering.  It's supposed to be sung with passion and fire and again, we get barely more than a whisper.<br /><br />It's a shame that someone as seemingly deserving as Boyle of letting her talents be showcased to the world was short-changed on such a lackluster collection of what could have been some beautiful music.ld have been some beautiful music.
B002VH7P4O|2.0|EDIT - I have created a more detailed explanation/follow up of my review in the associated comments section. There I go into more detail as to why I consider the 24>16 thing to be a giant waste of time.  Feel free to chime in!    This review is coming from someone who has both the Beatles USB box set and the Stereo Box Set released a few months earlier.  I purchased the USB box set though I KNEW deep down that the simple differences between a 24-bit recording and the 16-bit dithering from that recording would be completely undetectable to human ears.  Now owning both, I can say with full confidence that I shouldn't have bothered.    Here's the thing - we humans are naturally suggestible. It's called expectation bias, placebo effect, whatever you want to call it. We will almost always think wine from a nice bottle with a high price tag will taste better than the SAME wine from a 7-11 with a twist off top. It's not that we're idiots, we're human. Our brain decides what it SHOULD like better and then makes it happen for us.  When it comes to audio these tendencies are amplified. People waste millions on superfluous junk WANTING to believe that it makes their audio experience richer. When they pay the bill and plug it in, their brain justifies the purchase.    Releasing the 24-bit FLAC files of the Beatles remastered stereo catalog is a shameless attempt at double-dipping the same people who bought the Stereo Box Set a few months earlier. Other customers have verified that these are from the same masters used to cut the 16 bit stereo disc.  The fact is, in double blind tests, people simply CANNOT TELL THE DIFFERENCE between 16 bit resolution (~65,536 bit step values) and 24-bit (16,777,216 step values.) Again, we see the numbers, we WANT to believe they sound better, but to ask your speakers or heck, your eardrums to REALLY sense that level of microscopic difference is a pipe dream.    I know other reviewers have claimed to score 100% on double blind tests discerning these 24 bit files from the 16 bit equivalents.  Either they're using horribly-configured tests, or they're exaggerating things, I promise you.  For an EXPERT listener to discern a difference on even a small percentage of these recordings, they would need to be listening at absolute ear-bleeding volume levels, lest the differences be totally obliterated in the analog \\"dithering\\" process imposed by your volume knob.    So if you have yet to take the plunge on the Beatles remasters, go for the USB.  It's compact and it sounds great.    If you already have the Stereo set, skip this.  It sounds just as great.  That is, unless you like purposefully paying more for wine out of a nice bottle.

B000I2MRHE|5.0|In order to get my baby into the \\"front to play, back to sleep,\\" I bought this toy. My daughter HATED tummy-time, but the spinner elevated her, so tummy-time became bearable for a couple minutes, then 5 minutes, then 10 minutes, etc. Two days ago, she was happily on the spinner for 20 mins. However, yesterday, she started turning over, so we removed the spinner. The mat is fun too, lots of contrasting colors to catch baby's attention!

0439023483|5.0|I debated whether to get this book because of some of the negative reviews regarding the subject matter. On a friend's insistance I bought it and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />1. This is a YA book appropriate for 13 and up I would guess. The writing is very engaging and thought provoking and would appeal to many adults, especially women (the lead character is female) and those who like futuristic, survivalist, apocalyptic tales. It reminded me of Logan's Run if you are old enough to remember the 1970's film and tv show.<br /><br />2. It gets 5 stars not because it is groundbreakingly inventive or the best book ever written but because it is a simple tale constructd incredibly well. It is a page turner and I finished it in 2 days.<br /><br />3. Regarding the subject matter: I will try not to be a spoiler here. It is not as gruesome and barbaric as I thought it would be. Killings are justified on behalf of the lead character - we are with her in spirit when she does what she has to do. Nothing is gratuitous.<br /><br />4. I did laugh a few times at the plot, especially in the first third of the book. But if you can get over some of the over the top stuff, it is an enjoyable ride. and for any thinking person, there's a real trilogy here and you can begin to guess and wonder on how it will unfold in future books.
B002S9DRAG|5.0|I subscribe to the Angel Records monthly newsletter and this month they featured a free download from this new pianist. Here's the[...]<br /><br />Anyway - I downloaded the track and instantly fell in love with Mr. Tharaud. I did some research on him and found out that he's one of today's most individual and thoughtful pianists. I think it's perfect that this French pianist is making his debut with a collection of his favourite pieces from the ever popular Polish composer, Chopin - whom spent a good amount of time in Paris during his career. Alex plays with superlative technique and the CD is breathtaking. This is definitely not your ordinary Chopin disc.
B001AVCFK6|1.0|I put Abrams in the same league as Bay.  The new Star Trek creators talk about \\"reboot\\", \\"pace\\", \\"Star Wars\\"... I see an edited \\"Starship Troopers\\".  What made the futuristic Star Trek a \\"science-fiction\\" versus a fantasy is that it tries to stay true to science and common sense as much as possible and only makes a leap where required.  There are so many things wrong with this \\"reboot\\" right off the get go almost minute by minute, that it's just painful.  I'll try to just add to what others have already mentioned and not to repeat what have already been said:      --It took the Romulans a couple of minutes to destroy a whole fleet of starships, but took an eternity to destroy one ship that carried Kirk's father, long enough for 800 people to escape by shuttle crafts through presumably one exit--just calculate how many shuttle crafts it takes to carry 5 to 10 people at a time and how much time required for them all to leave 1 shuttle at a time.  Those people who know Star Trek know that a starship such as the Enterprise is lucky to carry a few shuttle crafts.  --Spock, in the mind-meld with Kirk said, \\"129 years from now, a star will explode, and threatens to destroy the galaxy\\".  Ouch.  And to make Spock, one of the most beloved Trek characters, a science officer no less, say it.  That hurts.  --Isn't it kind of weird that they can drill a giant hole to the center of a planet and no molten lava comes out?  Oh, and those planets that are close enough to the sun to be warm and have a solid core don't have an intact atmosphere either.  --So, they create a black hole at the center of Vulcan.  Yet people, including Spock's human mother, are walking, talking, running around like normal?  And all this time, I thought higher G's make your body heavier, damage your internal organs, that kind of thing.  And we're talking about a black hole where sensors measured gravity that were \\"off the scale\\".  Same applies to the black hole that was created at the center of the Romulan ship.  --Let's ignore the substance of the magical and deadly red paint for a moment.  I wonder why the elder Spock carried an entire tank of the stuff when all he needed was one drop to destroy the sun.  It's analogous to carrying all the most destructive weapons of all the worlds to do a mission that requires a knife.  But then maybe if things make Vulcan sense, the entire movie's premise would be DOA.  --I wonder why these advanced future races think they can save a planet and its people by destroying the sun via a black hole on its surface.  So many problems with this one scenario, that we don't need the other problems to make it worse.  --Once the Enterprise found itself caught in the black hole's gravity, it ejected the warp core to create an explosion that pushes the Enterprise away from the black hole.  In the world Star Trek created, warp core explosions destroys a starship--not just envelopes the ship then gently pushes it away.  But let's ignore this fantasy for a moment.  What we know about waves such as shock waves or ocean waves, is that when it hits you, it beats you up in your place and move on at its original speed.  In Abrams's world, when a wave hits the ship, it leaves the ship intact and propels the ship forward at even greater speed.      I love the original Trek and have the blu-rays.  It's the original Trek that gave Abrams and Paramount this chance, but neither seems to have any appreciation for the original, other than the chance to exploit its name.  It's unfortunately literal when they talk about \\"pulling all the stops\\" to make this movie, because they have yanked science and common sense, along with the Star Trek history and replace the creativity required to work within this confine with simple eye-candy.  It makes perfect sense why they love \\"pace\\" so much.  The \\"action\\" they use in this movie is just a cheap way for them to cover up their short-comings and total lack of creativity.  Most movie watchers who let down their guards and do not remain alert would simply be oblivious to the fact that they are being bombarded with total b.s.  If this movie is so good that it could stand on its own, they really should have named the characters and the movie something else (like Abrams's World\\" for instance), and leave the Enterprise and the \\"Star Trek\\" name alone, because whatever it is, it's not Star Trek anyways.  But then maybe this reboot means that Paramount is sending out the message to all the Star Trek fans that they don't really care whether any fans would purchase past Star Trek movies or memorabilia now that they have all been made obsolete.  While we're in the rebooting mode, maybe all the studios should consider rebooting the Batman series, Spiderman, X-men (maybe Logan could be a scientist instead of the costume wearing Wolverine) and don't forget Star Wars.  Oh possibilities, and all it takes is a simple leap back in time with a drop of red paint that turns into a black hole that magically let's one travel through time instead of maybe crushing one to a tiny bit.

B002VH7P4O|3.0|The Beatles' USB is everything it says it is.  You get the entire stereo catalogue in both 320 Kbps MP3 format and 24-bit FLAC format.  As can be expected, the compressed MP3 files sound worse than the recently released remastered stereo CDs, while the 24-bit FLAC versions have slightly better sound than their 16-bit CD counterparts.  Is the 24-bit sound quality a major improvement?  In my opinion, not really.  If doing blind comparisons between the 16-bit CD and the 24-bit FLAC songs, I would probably not be able to discern which was which for many of the songs.  Yet there are times when the difference is noticeable, and if given the choice of having only one or the other, naturally I would choose the 24-bit.    The Beatles USB is not without its problems.  iTunes, the most popular digital media manager/player in use today, cannot recognize the FLAC files.  So iTunes users must turn elsewhere for a player that can utilize the 24-bit files.  Windows users can reportedly use Winamp.  I use Macs and so I went with Songbird as my FLAC media player.  Its user interface is more robust than that of Play (another FLAC-compatible player) but more awkward than iTunes in my opinion.  I tried importing my entire iTunes library into Songbird, but the clunky interface soon made me change my mind - now it's ONLY for my 24-bit Beatles.    Some USB owners report down-converting the 24-bit FLAC files to a 16-bit or lower (like MP3) format just to get these to work on iTunes.  This seems like a pointless waste of time.  Most casual iPod users will be content with the 320-Kbps MP3 files that come on the USB, and more snobbish types like myself will rip uncompressed from their CDs in lossless 16-bit format into iTunes, and use the FLAC files on a third-party player for home listening on a high-end set of headphones.  I did convert the FLAC files to 24-bit AIFF using Max, and they play in iTunes, but my brand-new iPod Classic 160GB won't play them.  So except for home use, my best option is using the 16-bit tracks from the CDs anyway.    One could debate whether the 24-bit FLAC files not having support in iTunes is the fault of Apple Computers or Apple Records.  I am on the side of The Beatles.  Apple Computers needs to quit resting on their laurels and add FLAC support for iTunes, and 24-bit support for iPods.  I sent them an email and told them such.  In the mean time, however, it is an inconvenience for Apple users.    I own both the stereo and mono box sets, and there are numerous songs on which I prefer the mono version over the stereo.  As advertized, this USB contains only the stereo catalogue so if you are looking for the mono remasters, you'll have to get the Mono Box Set.  Oh yeah, one guarantee - the stem will break off of the apple before you can get the USB into your computer.
B002RVZV9K|4.0|It's a good idea: three separate generations of rock guitarists sharing their love of the guitar, reminiscing about starting out, and then jamming. And the first two parts work nicely. Alas and sadly, the end jam goes nowhere fast and is rather anti-climactic. But by then I was picking along on an unplugged Strat, like any player who watches this is almost forced to do early on, and smiling at how much joy these stringed planks of wood have brought into my life. Famous or unknown, we all love that instrument dearly, and this love letter to it rings true despite its faults.<br /><br />Still, any real fan of one or more of these guys will dig it, even if just for the pleasant tours through their past. I learned to play electric mainly from the riffs of Jimi and Jimmy, so walking through Page's guitar/instrument vault (good God, the Pauls he must have) was worth the viewing alone for me. Insert Tufnel reference here. He also comes off as a wise and gentlemanly fellow, and the tour through Headley Grange is a true treat for the Zep fans as he shows the hallway where Bonzo tracked Levee (which is also by far the most sampled drum sound in hip-hop, times ten).<br /><br />I've never been a huge U2 fan, but I respect their stamina and love some of their early albums. I saw their Unforgettable Fire tour and was amazed at how Edge did so much with so little playing; as a minimalist he is a genius, I'll give him that. And he admits as much here, crediting his effects with most of his inspiration. He too comes off as a very decent fellow.<br /><br />Jack White seems the odd man out; no legend by a long shot, his love of old school country blues is his only real link here to my mind, and he seems like a bit of a poser at times next to the relaxed demeanor of the other two. Still, he's a decent player, if hardly in Page's league (listen to the best Stripes/Raconteurs, then listen to Zep 3, 4, etc.). But he is the weak link here. I think he was included to get the \\"alternative\\" crowd into the theatre, but many other young players would have made more sense; Corgan might have been perfect, or even John Mayer, who can really play the blues when he feels like it.<br /><br />But after all the trips down memory lane from each, the end jam is flaccid. Too many cooks produce little broth here; a rhythm section would have been a real treat, say Simon Phillips and Tal Oakenfeld, and the jam might have exploded a little or a lot. As it is, there's no major sparks, just some okay playing on one of Page's most derivative blues workouts, In My Time Of Dying, and a few other weak strolls through riffs by each, but never a well-paced full tune. A very typical rock jam, in fact!<br /><br />But the highlight here might be when Page starts playing the uber-dinosaur riff from Whole Lotta Love (thank you Willie Dixon), and Edge jumps up from his chair to watch his fingers. You can almost see him and White thinking, \\"Ah, it's in fifth and seventh position, no open E at the nut, wow, there it is, the classic great dumb riff of them all!\\" That, and the generally artistic and intelligent tone, make It Might Get Loud well worth watching for fans of these guys, and the electric guitar in general. But if you're looking for smokin' geetar playing, get the Zep dvd set, or the latest Jeff Beck dvd, etc.<br /><br />This film is more about the love of music than music itself...and that's just fine. Any film that lets a Zep fan sit with Page as he plays some of his favorite old records, smiling in glee (and wiping his nose over and over, some things never change!), well, that's a film made by a fellow who understands the hold that the electric guitar will always have.<br /><br />If they remade this with Beck, Eddie V, and Corgan or Mayer, I'd hardly complain!but many other young players would have made more sense; Corgan might have been perfect, or even John Mayer, who can really play the blues when he feels like it.

B00275EGWY|5.0|This movie is simply my favorite war movie of all time. I saw it 4 times in the theatre and now own it as my own on dvd. I am a military movie enthusiast and pick them apart for mistakes and in this movie I saw none. Just an extremely well made, very detailed, honest account of war. No politics in there, just soldiers doing their job which is the most intense job a soldier can have if you ask me. Great moviemaking here, simple and pure! You will enjoy!  8-)
B001HN69AO|4.0|The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus is first and foremost a Terry Gilliam film, which could make or break the overall experience for you. Gilliam has a very specific style that is best described as an LSD trip with a more cohesive story. His films are usually incredibly visual, are wrapped around a unique story, and above all else spectacularly weird. The one thing his films can always guarantee though is originality. Doctor Parnassus is very similar to Gilliam's The Brother's Grimm, which also starred Heath Ledger. At least as far as visuals go. So if you're not a fan of other Gilliam films like Time Bandits, Baron Manchausen, Twelve Monkeys, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, The Brothers Grimm, or Tideland among others, then it's safe to say you probably won't enjoy this film.<br /><br />The other piece of information that's worth knowing going into this is to not expect much Heath Ledger. Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell were brought in for a reason. You're left wanting more, which is probably a good thing. It's not a stab at Depp, Law, or Ferrell as they all portrayed Tony pretty flawlessly. Ledger is around long enough to show potential. He has a few standout scenes and a great speech or two. Then he's gone. Out of the three actors that also played Tony, Depp did the best job. When you first see Johnny Depp as Tony, he still looks like Heath Ledger. His actions, his body language, his dialogue, it all feels like the same character. Without giving too much away, it feels as if Tony changed every time he stepped through the mirror. Well, that's not entirely true. It's more like Tony's true nature was revealed more and more with each transformation. Depp seemed to be the Tony we were first introduced to while Jude Law was the version of Tony that was swept away in Doctor Parnassus' imagination. He wanted to escape. To reach the clouds. Then there's Colin Ferrell who is the true Tony. Despite the fact that four different actors played the same character, it all still felt like the same person.<br /><br />The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus isn't a film for everyone. It's incredibly bizarre and it takes a while for things to actually get rolling. People who see this film solely for Heath Ledger's appearance will probably be disappointed and those who aren't a fan of Gilliam's work most likely won't have their minds changed with this film. But if you're willing to give a different kind of film a chance, a film that winds up capturing your imagination, then step through the mirror and enjoy the eccentric journey to The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus.l felt like the same person.

B00275EGX8|5.0|Critically hailed since its theatrical release, The Hurt Locker in all honestly would not have attracted much attention from me were it not for the fact that it is directed by Kathryn Bigelow, the critically underrated filmmaker who crafted a genre classic with Near Dark, a guilty pleasure action flick with Point Break, and an underrated opus with Strange Days just to name a few.  This time around, Bigelow gives the viewer an inside view of the Iraq war with The Hurt Locker, which details the inner-workings of an Army bomb squad EOD unit, led by the newly transfered Sgt. Will James (Jeremy Renner) and rounded out by Sgt. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Spc. Eldridge (Brian Geraghty).  What could easily fall under the category of being \\"another war movie\\" is something that The Hurt Locker is certainly not, as Bigelow puts to use so many great moments of action, suspense, tension, and jaw dropping moments that you cannot help but admire the total package that the film winds up becoming.  Added to that are the performances from all the actors involved, with Renner in particular as the reckless, daredevil, freewheeling adrenaline-junkie soldier whose humanity manages to shine through; this is truly a star-making performance for the actor indeed.  There's cameo roles from Guy Pearce, Ralph Fiennes, Evangeline Lilly, and David Morse as well; rounding out a surprisingly solid cast, but it's Mackie and definitely Renner that steal the show.  All in all, The Hurt Locker is by and far the finest war-related film to see the light of day in some time, and regardless of how you may feel about this particular film genre, missing this film is truly missing out on something special.  Maybe now Kathryn Bigelow will receive the credit and recognition that she has been deserving of all this time.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Well worth the money.  Very informative for children and grown ups (Hope they all will will learn from it!).
B00275EGX8|3.0|This movie was good, but comes nowhere near living up to the hype the critics have created for it. If you are expecting a story, then forget it- there is none. This movie is simply a depiction of a series of missions of a bomb disposal unit in Iraq. These missions vary greatly in their intensity and interest, and surprise!- some of the missions do not involve bomb disposal at all. With a running time of over 2 hours this film becomes somewhat monotonous, and you will likely be checking your watch to see how much longer you have to go. This movie, contrary to what you may have been led to believe, does not offer anything new or insightful to say about the psychology of soldiers or war's damaging effects. Maybe critics have been tricked into thinking this movie is better than it actually is because the first 20-30 minutes is terrific and gets the adrenaline pumping and I willingly admit to that. But really folks, it's all downhill from there, and at the end I was disappointed that the whole thing never went anywhere. If you lower your expectations going in, you might enjoy this good, but certainly not great, movie.
B00135EUPC|5.0|This is an incredible soundtrack. [[ASIN:B000004286 Braveheart: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]] has beautiful and emotive music.

B001KOFH2G|4.0|This is a great continuation/ending of the TV show - Firefly. The same cast is back and it's great to see them all together again! The chemistry is still there! Fans of Firefly, you won't be disappointed (well - maybe, you will be disappointed since this is the end of Firefly and some of the incidents that happens in the movie!). If you are a true fan of Firefly, you can't miss this.    If you have a Blue-Ray Player, by all means, get the Blue-Ray version. Picture quality is excellent. I first watched this as Video on Demand (not the best way to watch it as video kept on buffering (and I don't think I have slow internet connection)). It was on TV afterward on SyFy. Finally, Blue-Ray of this went on sale and I snatched it up. I am glad I did.     Only one complaint is the sound quality of the blue-ray. The background music is louder than the people speaking. If you turn it up to hear the actors/actresses better, the background music is even louder. (Hence, the 4 stars.)    Overall, would I buy Serenity Blue-Ray version again? Yes. It's a great movie. Yes, the audio quality isn't the best but the great video quality overrules it.      (Here comes my plug for Firefly.)     Firefly is even better. Just head over to the \\"Firefly\\" Amazon page and see for yourself the great reviews it has on it. I was somewhat hesitant b/c of the great reviews but they are all well deserved (if you are a Sci-Fi fan)! If you haven't seen Serenity, Firefly gives you a brief background and history of the crews of Serenity. If you haven't watch Firefly, you will still understand the movie but only  miss the great storyline of the show!     Cheers~  Joei

B001BGTWXI|5.0|I was a child of the 80s and loved Metallica, Megadeath, and even some \\"hair rock.\\"  I thought there was no good metal these days.  After my friend pointed me to All Hope Is Gone, I realized I was wrong.    First off all, these gentlemen have skills.  They're tight.  Great vocals, amazing percussion, quality guitar work.  Secondly, they are immensely creative and different.  Thirdly, they're perfectly heavy for me.  Parts are extremely hard (\\"Psychosocial\\"), but not too hard to give you a headache.  I need some kind of rhythm to my metal, and if it's flat out speed metal with no variation, I don't enjoy it much.  The way the switch tempo actually works, breaking up the song quite well and making it more \\"catchy\\" (I use that as a compliment).  \\"Sulfur\\" is the best tune on the album, but \\"Vendetta,\\" \\"Psychosocial,\\" and \\"Dead Memories\\" are all excellent tracks.    I've since went back and purchased the earlier Slipknot efforts.  Although they're still good, some is a bit raw and some sounds too much like Korn.  All Hope Is Gone is clearly their best album. They've matured and grown in good ways. I used to see kids with Slipknot T-shirts and I didn't think these guys would be this good.  I stand corrected and I'd recommend this album to any metal fan.
B001FB55HQ|4.0|ever since i was a kid i have loved the terminator movies.i remember back in the early 80s being upset at the idea of never having a terminator 2.i remember in the early 90s,being estatic when they made a second part.i remember in the early part of the 2000s loving the 3rd part.               but there were 2 things i really wanted.the first was to not have to wait a decade in between parts.the second was to see the actual man vs machine war.a whole movie dedicated to just that and not existing only in flashes and memories.                 well,here it is!it only took about 5 years,maybe less and the war is on!i really liked this movie a lot.it is not nearly as good as the first 3,but it is definately a good movie.                    i didnt like a few things but they are minor.one was that i kept seein john connor as bruce wayne.a silly quirk i know.2 of the main characters looked a lot alike.it confused me a bit.the only real issue i had with the story was the innefficient death camp.                       john connor,the best hope for mankind and terminator hater extrordinaire,makes a deal with a terminator.that rubbed me the wrong way.hes supposed to hate them so much.                       i also didnt like that arnold swarzanegger was in the movie.he was ranked as the number one enemy against guns in the u.s. .  now the hypocrite plays in a movie full of guns?ive lost all respect for that guy.                         the general consensus is that this movie is a let down.i say it is NOT a let down,only not as good as it predecessers.    one of the female soldiers kisses a  terminator at the end.if machines get her hot,she couldve just stuck her tongue in a toaster.

B001GCUO1Q|3.0|well,for 2009,it was between this movie,the t4 and watchmen for movie of the year and this one lost.i liked it.dont get me wrong.its just that there were a bunch of errors.i guess i should expect that since not one comic book movie has been accurate yet.                most of this movie was in the x-men trilogy.so all the answers were taken care of already.sabretooth was actualy wolverines dad.im pretty sure the xmen were the original mutant team.wolverine was dropped with one bullet in xmen 2 but absorbs hundreds in the first few minutes of this film.this dead pool guy showed up much later i thought too.                 these facts aside,the movie was pretty cool.the opening fight scenes were memorable.how old wolverine is ,is staggering.the action is cool.dead pool is awesome.there are a few lesser known mutants all through it in the later parts.                   this movie rocked!id give it second place for 2009 behind the watchmen and slightly above terminator salvation.

B000K15VSA|5.0|Just thought I'd give a heads up on the packaging Amazon provides with this one. The case is plastic. Amazon shipped mine with packing protecting up and down movements, but did not protect against forward/back movements. I'd unwrapped the case before I'd noticed a big chink of plastic missing. The dent in the delivery box should've alerted me. So either pay for insured shipping or (unlike me) be very thorough in reviewing the item's condition upon receipt.

B0016OM3TU|1.0|I love jazz, but this movie did nothing for me.    Dexter Gordon is a great musician but someone needed to tell him that mumbling isn't acting.  I found it easier to follow the French subtitles than I did understanding what he was saying.      Also, consider the character Dexter Gordon plays.  Yes, he's a great musician, but he's portrayed as someone completely incapable of taking care of himself.  He's not allowed to drink at the club he plays in.  He has a woman who literally tucks him in bed.  The young Frenchman who idolizes him *does* everything for him. ... Is this a respectful way of establishing a character who the audience is supposed to respect?    This movie is supposed to be based on real-life events, but I doubt it.  Irwin Winkler, the producer, did the same thingg with his 1991 movie about the Hollywood blacklist, \\"Guilt By Suspicion\\" -- he Hollywoodized a certain reality that, in effect, comes out as highly *un*realistic.     I applaud the movie for trying to be intelligent and insightful, and there are scenes in it that are interesting, but as a whole the film is tedious and pretentious.    As for Martin Scorsese's small part in the movie, it should have been smaller to the point of nonexistent.

B0000041Z6|5.0|I have this set and relish every moment of it (in fact, it is about all I listen to, and, according to iTunes, I have 73.4 days of music!--11.2 hours of that include this set).  Solti and the Chicago Symphony create a marvelous affect and it is musical in every sense of the word.  Sure, there are grazed notes and some intonation issues along the way, and it is nothing like the recordings of Rattle that are \\"perfect\\" in not missing a note in a live performance.  However, who wants to hear something that is perfect and devoid of musicality and a true sense of what Mahler is (which is not only a tall order, but also something simply ineffable)?  As per the \\"editor's\\" comments--Solti has equal empathy toward Mahler as Bernstein--they are just different (alas the editor needs to invest in a version of the Oxford English Dictionary for his word usage).  Nevertheless, I highly recommend this to all Mahler fans.  And, I might add, that the organs used are splendid (being an organist!).  The Second uses an Austin that no longer exists and the Eighth uses a dubbed-in Sauer!  Dubbed-in or not, Sauer organs are stunning instruments and where THE organ of the day in Mahler's time, and the climax of the Alles vergängliche is simply unparalleled (not to mention the use of the stunning Vienna Knabenchor!).  In short--GET THIS SET!!!  You will never regret it!

B002LLE3PY|5.0|Robert Fripp provides some skeptical and cynical notes about this album.  In 2009, he wrote of \\"Lizard\\":  \\"Labour and laboring, mostly joyous, strive effortfully to present appearance of cohesion\\".  He also reminds us that \\"Lizard\\" was both not as commercially successful as other King Crimson albums and that he doesn't feel it is the most critically accomplished of his albums.  That's a lot to say about your work.  All the more amazing that Steven Wilson was able to convince Fripp to release this 5.1 surround sound version.  This is even more surprising when you realize that \\"In The Wake Of Poseidon\\" was skipped temporarily.<br /><br />Always an amazing mix of progressive rock and jazz, \\"Lizard\\" arguably stands out among the best King Crimson accomplishments.  Noted for a variety of distortions/effects of different vocals, Wilson manages to extract them and balance them so they stand out clearly and crisply.  In fact, all the instrumentals on every track are separated or enhanced to truly bring attention to every detail.  These are things that are often missed on the stereo mixes.<br /><br />\\"Cirkus\\" flat out rattles your senses with its mix of rock and freeform blasts.  Fripp's mellotron is so powerful, it's stunning.  Andy McCulloch on drums is dizzying and emphatic.  These tracks (along with others here) take Pete Sinfield's lyrics and elevate the entire song to a nearly psychedelic level.  \\"Happy Family\\", allegedly a comment on the Beatles break-up is one of the few songs that get muddied in the new mix, but not for great effort from Wilson.  The original tracks and \\"scraps and fragments of stuff\\" were meticulously remixed.  As Sid Smith notes: \\"For me `Lizard' has always been an album that was too big for stereo to contain.\\"  In terms of fusing free-jazz with progressive rock for me, there's almost no parallel.\\"  \\"Lady of the Dancing Water\\" contains some of the prettiest flute work available anywhere, in fact, all the horns and woodwinds are clearly pronounced.  The immense song, \\"Lizard\\" with its bridges, alterations and variations is one of the most interesting and strongest songs on the album.  With virtually eight songs connected with a barrage of ingenious methods, it becomes an easy favorite.  Jon Anderson's vocals on the section, `Prince Rupert Awakes' is alive with strength and beauty complimented by Fripp's stinging mellotron.  The album closes with `Big Top', an amusing and somewhat demented climax.<br /><br />This package contains the CD with a new 2009 stereo mix and three bonus tracks, (an alternate take of \\"Lady of the Dancing Water\\", another remix of \\"Bolero\\" and a `studio run through with guide vocal from original session' of \\"Cirkus\\".  These tracks are great to have, but only \\"Bolero\\" stands out as something truly worthy, although this version of \\"Cirkus\\" is interesting to hear if only for the improvisation of the vocals.<br /><br />The DVD contains the album in 5.1 surround sound, the new 2009 stereo mix, the original album (1999 remastered version) and the three bonus tracks.  Robert Fripp and Sid Smith's notes make for a very interesting contrast in perspective of \\"Lizard\\".  If not for the persuasion of Steven Wilson, we might not have ever heard this album in its purest form, that is, every instrument clearly marked out and placed and a sensory experience that you could only hope from any band.  \\"Lizard\\" ranks up there with \\"In The Court of the Crimson King\\".<br /><br />The two latest 5.1 surround sound CD/DVD King Crimson packages, [[ASIN:B002M3GPOS In the Court of the Crimson King (Deluxe)]] and [[ASIN:B002GYVRRI Red]] are available now.e song, \\"Lizard\\" with its bridges, alterations and variations is one of the most interesting and strongest songs on the album.

B002VKE0XA|1.0|So I remember watching Blair Wich Project when I was younger.  As an avid camper & a backpacker I thought it would get me even more horrified than an average moviegoer.  It was so terrible that I'd rather watch the grass grow or watch the paint dry on the wall!  I don't know why people get so scared watching these 'reality' type looking movies?    Yea, yea, people who wrote 5 star recommendations would defend by saying \\"use your imagination.  Imagine if you are in these situations etc..\\", or I don't have enough intelligence or mind to get myself scared.  Sorry.  I REALLY tried to get into this one.  Several of my coworkers STRONGLY recommended this Paranormal Activity.    So I watched this thing.  Started watching at 1AM, sitting front of my 60inch plasma with all the lights out, listening through a high end Sennheiser headphone(HD 600) to immerse into the movie even more, alone while rest of my family were sleeping.    This is one of the most boring, pathetic, time waster of a movie I have seen in a long, long time!  It's worse than the Blair Witch!     The alternate ending is even worse!**spoiler alert**  How can this woman in catatonic state NOT urinate for 2 days!!!  So it's a movie that's trying to be realistic.  How big is her bladder?  Can you hold your urine for 2 days?  Does she have acute renal failure?  I just don't get it...

B0026RHR6K|3.0|Battlestar Galactica is in my opinion, one of the best shows to grace our viewing screens for a very long time. Interesting story lines, compelling characters, splendid effects, out-of-this-world performances by many world class performers and of course, the soundtrack. All of these solid \\"A\\"'s. Then this collection comes out.    I'll admit, the packaging concept is very creative; perhaps even inventive. As a practical matter, it is a disaster. The disk folios are hard to use. It is impossible to gets disks in and out. It is impossible to see which disk you have unless you pull the disk out to look at it. In these regards this collection is a disaster. Perhaps they were more interested in creating a collectible than a user friendly presentation of this show?    I also must speak up about the transferred quality of the episodes. The DVD image quality is at best fair and too often poor. Not to mention, if you hate being forced to watch FBI warnings and copyright notices and previews and long drawn out artistic menu lead-ins, you're going to hate using these disks. Many, not all of them force you to sit through such things.    The disks themselves do not appear to have been mastered for this set. It seems as if they used whatever they did previously and then stuffed them into this package. There is inconsistency in how the different disks are presented.    As to the picture quality, I would have much preferred disk space be used to provide the best possible image quality and less space wasted on \\"extras\\". While the extras are nice, they are certainly not necessary.    In total, if you love the show; this is the only game in town. You'll have to live with the shortcomings of the \\"collection\\".

B002T45VX6|1.0|Since the beginning of her musical career, I realized that Shakira wanted to become \\"somebody\\" in the nowadays very competitive International Music Star market.<br /><br />A Latin version of Madonna???...  A different option when compared with other blond long-haired, good looking music 'Stars' like Britney Spears???...  Or perhaps, a 'light' Christina Aguilera???... Make up your own choice!!!<br /><br />Honestly speaking, since I heard her first Hits (sung mostly in Spanish), every time she yelled her repeated falsettos, I found her singing quite similar to... Alanis Morrisette.<br /><br />That's it!!! Shakira has not been able to develop her own vocal identity.<br /><br />Therefore, she's a sub-standard musical product. Period!

006056251X|5.0|Oh my gosh, this book was amazing!  I found it on the same page as Derek Craven's story (Dreaming of You) and I seriously did not think it would be possible for me to love a book just as much!  I adored Evie and Sebastian was such a wonderful character. I had just finished \\"It Happened one Autumn\\" and could not wait to read about Sebastian and Evie.  I didn't hate him at all for what he did at the end of \\"Autumn\\"--he had his back up against the wall.  Anyhow, back to this book, I loved how he took control of the gaming house and started to work.  And Evie!  So glad she came out of her shell and matched him pound for pound--she was no wallflower.  It was great seeing this story unfold and all the little sweet things Sebastian did were so swoon worthy (such as the brick and how he wore the ring!).  I especially loved it when Evie told him he was going to lose the wager.  Read this book and you will not be disappointed.  I totally loved it :)

1439157383|5.0|This was such a powerful book! I'm not sure why I waited so long to read it. It's been sitting on my shelf for over a year, and I just kept putting it off and putting it off.  I wanted to see the movie, and figured that I should probably read the book first.<br /><br />Jodi Picoult did a wonderful job of exploring a topic that has so many sides and opinions. It was a book that truly made you question and think about things. But she never pushed you to agree with one viewpoint or another. Instead, she did an amazing job of showing so many different sides of the story so that you could decide for yourself what you feel was right or wrong in the situation.<br /><br />Without giving away any spoilers, I just have to say that I really liked the way that she chose to end the book.  I know that there is some debate over the ending, but personally, I think that it made a fantastic point.  Perfect!<br /><br />I listened to the audiobook. And for fans of audiobooks, I recommend it. I loved having different people reading the sections told from each persons point of view. One caution though is that there are some real tear jerker sections, so you probably don't want to be listening to it anywhere that you would be embarrassed to start crying!<br /><br />This was an all around amazing read!
B000002UB2|4.0|I know this wasn't a first-run or even limited-edition copy of the album yet they still need to find a better way to ship vinyl.  My album was received in a 2'x3' cardboard box.  It was strategically placed under the lips inside the box.  There were no styrofoam peanuts nor airpacks for protection.  Out of all the things I've purchased from Amazon this had to be the worse packaged.  I'm sure it was just a one-time thing (I hope).  I think that better care needs to be taken next time considering vinyl albums are very succeptible to damage.    Review of the album:  It's the Beatles' best.  What else can I say?
B000002GBB|5.0|Generally acknowledged as Styx's most enduring album, very few of the reviews so far have mentioned anything about the album's overall concept. Released in September 1978, there's much more to this collection than cheery vocal harmonies and a few classic rock radio hits. While the individual songs of DeYoung, Shaw, and Young are all very different, there is a recurring theme behind the lyrics.    The band's eighth studio album, Pieces of Eight's concept is the illusions of modern day living. The previous album, 1977's The Grand Illusion, also touched on this topic, but did not carry it through on every single song. (\\"Come Sail Away\\" and \\"Castle Walls\\" are seemingly just fantasy pieces, without any underlying theme.) Take a look at the songs of Pieces of Eight:    \\"Great White Hope\\": the illusion of America as the fastest gun in the west, or the undefeated champ.  \\"I'm Okay\\": the illusions behind the late 1970s self-esteem movement.  \\"Sing for the Day\\": the illusion of eternal youth.  \\"The Message/Lords of the Ring\\": nothing to do with Tolkein, but rather with the illusion of celebrity and \\"making it\\". The \\"ring\\" is the \\"brass ring\\" of success. The last verse intones: \\"And though the legend was pure fantasy - we still need the hope it brings.\\"  \\"Blue Collar Man\\": the illusion of \\"job security\\".  \\"Queen of Spades\\": not about gambling (as many people suppose), but the illusion of luck and good fortune. \\"Luck is a lady whose smile is as cold as a stone.\\"  \\"Renegade\\": the illusion of escape and the so-called glamour of life on the lam.  \\"Pieces of Eight\\": the illusion of wealth, and the alleged power and happiness it brings. This song also brings home the overall theme of not trading reality for unreachable fantasy. (Enron/Broadcom moguls, are you listening?)    The album then closes with perhaps the most beautiful piece the band has ever recorded, the ethereal, dreamy \\"Aku Aku\\", music to float away on. Named after the ancestral spirits of the people of Easter Island, italso ties in with Hypgnosis' outer-cover and gatefold photography. That Easter Island was chosen is also appropriate to the concept because rather than being an idyllic South Seas isle, the local history is one of people who divided into groups and almost completely destroyed each other fighting over dwindling natural resources. In other words, there are no island paradises.    Most will agree this is the last album Styx recorded before moving into their lighter, Broadway-style period. Later albums were also conceptual, but were either too elusive (Paradise Theater) or hammered home too hard (Kilroy was Here). On Pieces of Eight, the production, musicianship, and songwriting were never better, and the concept has proved even more appropriate with the passage of time. Because of the dynamic contrasts between the celestial synths/acoustic guitars and the heavy guitar rock/cathedral organ, this album was very popular with the \\"half-speed mastered virgin-vinyl\\" audiophile movement among late 1970s LP buyers (I still have mine). Pieces of Eight still sounds great today in any format, and while Styx will always be dismissed by the roots-rock crowd, it has proved to be their most outstanding achievement musically, lyrically, and conceptually. Easter Island, indeed.

159562015X|5.0|This book was required reading by a career coach, and I'm glad it was.  STRENGTHS FINDER 2.0 was written by Tom Rath, a leader in the Gallup organization.  Each book comes with a sealed code which may be used on their website to establish your online account.  (For this reason, it is better to buy this book brand new and not used.)  SF 2.0 uses behavioral testing similar to the DISC profile.  But instead of only 4 characteristic and 16 possible outcomes, it offers 5 top strengths (out of 34) and a tremendous variety of outcomes.    My advice to anyone who takes the online test is to take your time on each question and think about each question thoroughly.  This may sound like common sense, but one tends to rush through tests like this (especially when they're online).      Also remember that SF 2.0 is not the Bible.  It's simply a very reliable guideline for discovering your true God-given strengths and how to use them effectively at work, home, play, church, etc.  So, don't get nervous or uptight (like I did) if it shows a strength that is totally not you.  It's not a perfect system, nor does it claim to be.  But as my career coach pointed out, everyone has at least a little of all 34 strengths.    I recommend that one read up to the 34 themes, then take the test.  When you are given your top 5, then read through each of those 5.  Then I recommend reading all the rest of the strengths (or themes) and find other that match you.  When I did this I was surprised not only by the fact that there were a few very accurate themes that the test seemed to have missed, but also by the fact that all of the other themes were for the most part very unlike me.  Therefore the test - for the most part - was very accurate.    I highly recommend STRENGTHS FINDER 2.0.    Intellection  Connectedness  Input  Context  Learner

It is more about starting a business division within a large corporate company. Good book for the right reader....
0142410314|5.0|I had never read this wonderful tale for myself until recently.  My primary questions beginning the novel were, Will it be like Gene Wilder or Johnny Depp?  What a surprise when it turned out to be neither.  It was Roald Dahl.  With respect to both of the fine aforementioned cinema performances, no film can properly reproduce the uncanny and extremely paradoxical character of Willy Wonka, as he intertwines the outlines of Roald Dahl's immortal classic.    Another question I had was whether this book would leave me disappointed in its overall quality (like several others of his have done).  Would it be grotesque?  Would the absurdity overshadow the delight and even the plot?     Alas, no.    CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY possesses practically every motif - virtually every quality one could wish for in a classic children's novel.  And not just for children.  Just like Willy Wonka himself, just like the Chocolate Factory itself - there is almost a certain maturity wrapped up in all the whimsical mischief that abounds in the book.  And sometimes you can't tell the kids from the grown-ups.    But fun is the key ingredient here.  And CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY will guarantee a mouthful of it with the turn of every page.
0385504225|1.0|I got this book a long time ago for my birthday. Like others, I had read The Da Vinci Code, and I found it interesting, really I did. It interested me in secret societies for a while and I think sparked a greater interest in symbolism, and intrigued with with the carefully tied concept, and the beautiful art, architecture, and scenery. Then I read Angels and Demons, the prequel, and literally could not put it down. The plot was so pulse pounding, the theme was awesome, and the setting was great. That's not to say I didn't detect less than stellar quality in the writing itself. That's obvious. But I was happy.<br /><br />Spoilers ahead!<br /><br />I waited patiently for \\"The Lost Symbol\\" aka Solomon's Key and frowned at the delay. Then I get it...and I was hit by trash. The first line by the villian \\"I am a masterpiece\\" just made me hate him, and to be honest, the villian did not interest me or stimulate my imagination, he made me convulse in disgust and he made my imagination feel dirty. I mean ICK. I really wanted him to die but he kept on going in his idiotic ramblings.<br /><br />Langdon's lecturing tone was really bad here, an understandable problem but one that needs toning down. Other charatcers also displayed encyclopedic dialogue that was uninteresting. The descriptions of noetic science were underwhelming in what was said with no big possibilities given. So a bunch of people could potentially move the tide, that sounds inefficient. So you made molecular crystal formations. Big deal. Some nerd may be excited somewhere but I yawn, and I am familiar with New Age concepts, though I don't believe them. The first real substantial possibility suggested for the powers of Noetic Science and the abilities of the mind (aka psychic ability) is a reference to the power of faith healers. That's something significant, giving weight to the intangible power they believe in. But that comes on a page in the 300s, WAY too late.<br /><br />The architecture wasn't properly worked in, Dan Brown seems like he rushed, the end was idiotic. Dan Brown spends so long defending Masons he takes no time to build them into something else, which he could. He got caught up in their \\"no religion\\" policy. In fact he makes the Masons, including the oh so incredible (sarcasm) Peter Solomon look like Morons. This thing was so bad I had to skip a lot to get to the end, which I hardly ever do, and have never with Brown.<br /><br />I am being very gracious in giving the thing shelf space but Dan Brown has forever lost me. I will never look at a book of his with a critical eye. Dan Brown: minus one trusting fan.<br /><br />Don't buy this pile of garbage and give him more money. It's not worth it.rushed, the end was idiotic. Dan Brown spends so long defending Masons he takes no time to build them into something else, which he could.

0060594896|5.0|Just as chapter 55, Be A Class Act discusses, Jack Canfield is a class act, and his book resonates that page in and page out. Being a positive person, I love the underlying theme: what you focus on expands. In addition to the great material in the content of the book, there are numerous resources and tools provided in the last pages.<br /><br />The Success Principles is one of my go-to books. I highly recommend purchasing your own copy, as you'll want it on your shelf to reference over and over again.

0385504225|2.0|On one hand, I have read every Dan Brown work of fiction. On the other, I have not really enjoyed any of them. In a lot of ways, I think that the Lost Symbol is a strong work. Its enjoyable to see an author piecing together complex puzzles. But it ultimately fails in a resounding fashion due in a large part to the restraints placed upon the author to use Robert Langdon once again. The character is a known quantity, he Brown cant very easily add to the limited character study, and is very very constrained in how he sets up this plot.<br /><br />Angels and Demons was a hard book to stomach for me. The plot got pretty loopy and was so far out there at times that I was groaning in pain. Lost Symbol never quite gets to that point, but it pushes the envelope as far as credibility goes. Every aspect here kind of is over board silly.<br /><br />I did not really like that Langdon knows EVERYTHING. Its a hard sell when your main character has every single snippet of knowledge at his finger tips due to his photographic memory. Their is not a huge amount of struggle to uncover any of the mysteries along the way.<br /><br />Shoot, their is too much goofiness going on here for any self respecting reader to truly love this work. The characters are very limited, the story is a re-hash of past works, the writing is fairly forced in several places, the editing is not very good... Id skip this one if I were you...
B002RI9ZPY|4.0|This is a flawed, but very exciting conclusion to Larsson's trilogy.  It's a remarkable achievement that there is so little physical action in the novel.  Mostly it's secret meetings and hospital rooms, but you can't wait to find out what happens next.  There are a couple of subplots that Larsson would have been better off not exploring because their resolutions are not dramatic (like Berger's stalker, and that's not a spoiler) so they end up being distractions, but the main narrative keeps the story moving at a good clip.  And where the previous novels' climaxes were filled with action and danger, this novel's long climax is set entirely in the courtroom.  That Larsson keeps you on the edge of your seat is a testament to his gifts as a story teller.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|Matilda is an extraordinary girl, a child of wonderous intelligence. Unfortunately, her neglectful and deeply stupid parents, Harry and Zinnia Wormwood are too wrapped up in their own little lives to care, or even to notice that their daughter is a budding genius, in love with books and with learning. When the Wormwoods finally grant Matilda's wish to attend school, they bundle her off to Crunchem Hall, a bleak brick prison where students cower before the whip-hand and fist of a hulking monster, principal Agatha Trunchbull. Amid Crunchem's darkness, Matilda finds a single light in warm-hearted Miss Honey, the first-grade teacher who recognizes the girl's remarkable skills including a very special talent that allows the spirited girl to turn the tables on the wicked grown-ups in her world. Matilda is a charming little movie that will delite both children and adults. Adorable and heartwarming movie.
B002VKE1K2|1.0|The only thing remotely scary and somewhat mystifying about this movie is why any man on the planet would put up with this type of woman.  \\"Bee-otch\\" doesn't even begin to cover it.  It is a stupid movie, badly filmed and boring beyond belief.  But having to view her little tantrums and unforgiving attitude toward her well-intentioned boyfriend is the ONLY disturbing thing about this movie.  She is the proverbial \\"Hey it's my time of the month every day so I'm entitled to behave this way\\" sort of woman who gives the rest of us a bad name.  Someone please medicate her.  Heavily.  Oh for a truly scary movie.  Like radical Muslims taking over Europe while the Europeans sleep on in disbelief...now that's scary.
B0007LXPBI|5.0|The tale of identical twin sisters who were separated shortly after birth by the break-up of their different continents by their two successful parents. Hallie is growing up in Napa Valley with her vineyard-owner father, Nick Parker. Annie is raised in fashionable London by her mother, Elizabeth James, a reknowned wedding gown designer. Unaware of each other's existence, fate intervenes when the girls coincidentally meet at summer camp in Maine. Eager to meet their respective parents, the girls devise a scheme to switch places and ultimately, reunite their mom and dad. Their plan takes on urgent proportions when they learn their father has fallen for the young, beautiful and opportunistic Meredith Blake. This is a movie that you can sit down  with your family, and watch over and over Lohan Does a great job doing both Anne and Haliey. This is a fun movie to watch.
B002NOAF9W|4.0|This box set is not for casual Rolling Stones fans--it's for hardcore fans who also appreciate the blues of B.B. King and the rockin' soul of Ike and Tina Turner. Anyone who rented or bought the video release of Gimme Shelter will be familiar with the Maysles brothers film footage and the acoustic set by Mick and Keith. The box set may be worth the price just for the five tracks on CD #2. My original LP that I've been playing on my turntable for decades is worn out. So I figured it might be time to get the remastered CD plus the bonus material. Anyone who appreciates great rock 'n' roll guitar playing will love hearing Mick Taylor's solos on \\"I'm Free\\" and \\"Satisfaction.\\" Is it worth $46.49? That depends on how much you love real rock 'n' roll. If you already have a copy of Ya-Ya's that you're happy with, and you're not interested in B.B. King or Ike & Tina, just download the 5 MP3s that are on CD #2 for $4.95.
B0002JP4L4|5.0|When a city kid is forced to move to a conservative midwestern town, his tastes in rock music and his gyrating dance moves turn his high school upside-down and send the town and it's local preacher into a frenzy. This movie is a 1980's classic I think, where you can relax and watch a movie that is about good fun and great music. Kevin Bacon is great. The choreography iconic and the music symbolises a generation. A very entertaining movie.
B000ZN802W|1.0|I can honestly say this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I liked how the movie was filmed which is why there is a star at all, but the story is just awful!<br /><br />So, a young man is disenchanted with his privileged life, so he wants to make a break for it--great. Instead of figuring out what he wants to do and studying whatever it is/learning every freaking thing he can about his new pursuit,he takes off. This kid has nothing, not even a pot to p--- in, yet he's off and running. Then, he ends up dead because in not preparing for this massive, life altering experience, he winds up starving to death because of eating plants and wildlife that are basically poisonous to the human body.<br /><br />So, I am left with a \\"huh\\" expression on my face because somehow I am supposed to see this young man as a hero, as someone to look up to. I am about the same age he was when he died and all I can think about is how stupid and reckless he was with his family's emotions and his life. I understand wanting to find yourself, wanting to be someone/something different, and wanting to shrug off the system. On the other hand, what I cannot and could not understand was the complete lack of judgment McCandless displayed.

B001974DG0|3.0|Some of his best characters but NOT his best work.   Although, it seems this book is one of the closest to Koontz's heart with a wonderful dog named Einstein, it struggles with pacing.   Nice story ... just not up to what I expected from Koontz.
B000031EGV|5.0|Because of the magically surreal and potentially lethal aspects of Jumanji, a board game that's intrigued its players for hundreds of years, few people want to play a second time. For you see, unless you complete the game, Jumanji takes over your world. Young Alan Parris discoverd the ornate Jumanji board in 1969, when he was just twelve. When he sits down to play it for the first time with his reluctant friend Sarah, he's transported into the jungle realm of Jumanji, disappearing before Sarah's startled eyes. Jumanji is a priceless tale that I loved growing up. Williams gives a flawless performance and the story sweeps you off your feet. A great family movie.

It was flat out boring and one of the worst books I have ever picked up. I forced myself to finish it because I kept hoping for something....a story, some new people she met, her travels and it never happened. I hope she does better with the next one.

With the words \\"The Teacher will never leave this room alive,\\" in an instant, Silvia's life is turned upside down as she becomes a hunted target of the killers. This is an extremely fearful movie, with a mood, tone and cascade of plot twists. A solid entertainment.
B0029LHW68|5.0|There has been a lot said about 30 Seconds to Mars and no doubt you've heard or read mostly the negative stuff.  Musical taste is a subjective thing, but all I ask is that you actually listen to the previews you can hear here on Amazon.  Most likely you'll be very surprised.      This is the 3rd album from the band, and the growth in sound and style is obvious.  It's very different from their previous albums, 2001's 30 Seconds to Mars and 2005's A Beautiful Lie, but at the same time, there's no question that this is 30 Seconds to Mars.      The vocals are stronger.  The drums are more apparent.  They keyboards are reminiscent of some of the best music in the 80s, most likely due at least in part to the use of producers Flood and Steve Lilywhite (U2, Depeche Mode, Nine Inch Nails).  The anthemic nature of many of the songs showcases the struggles and triumphs, both personal and professional, that the band has gone through since their last release.      If you like alternative rock music, chances are good that you'll enjoy this album - just give it a listen.
0780626966|5.0|\\"Freddy Krueger\\", an evil being from another world who gets to his victims by entering their dreams and killing them with gloves that have knife blades attached to each finger. I think Freddy Krueger is one of the most famous characters of horror movies of all times. Wes Craven was inspired by a series of newspaper articles to create A Nightmare on Elm Street movies. This collection is a fun and scary journey into the black heart of a ruthless serial killer and cultural phenomenon, you cannot escape. This collection is a revolutionary horror classic.

1582701709|2.0|OK, this book has been reviewed like crazy, and I'm doubtful that anyone will read this, but there's something I have to say that I don't find anyone else saying:<br /><br />I believe there is great power in believing and expecting certain things will happen. A simple example, if a runner believe she can win a race, it makes all the work leading up to the race a lot easier. If she believes she cannot win the race, she may not work as hard or may not train at all. Self-fulfilling prophecy. It's clear that this concept can extend to many areas of life.<br /><br />The problem with this book is that they claim that everything in your life is a manifestation of your beliefs. Therefore, you are the cause of all the good and bad in your life. In other words, JFK was asking for it. As were MLK, Jr. and my 9-month old cancer-stricken nephew and his parents. And think how the world would be different if every single one of those 3000+ people, and all their friends and family, didn't have their minds focused having their lives taken violently by a group of airplane-hijacking al Qaeda terrorists! C'mon!<br /><br />So, read this with skepticism. You'll probably get some good ideas and motivation out of it.

Working his way up the ranks, John comes home to Wilmington, North Carolina out of obligation rather than a genuine desire to see his father. On one such leave, John happens to be in the right place at the right time as a young co-ed's purse is knocked into the ocean and he rushes to assist the \\"damsel in distress\\". So begins his relationship with Savannah Lynn Curtis, who is in the area building homes for Habitat for Humanity.<br /><br />Despite the short duration of their stays in town, John and Savannah feel drawn to each other and are quickly spending every free moment together. Savannah is young, at times naive, and attached to her family, while John is old beyond his years and accustomed to short, meaningless flings. Their differences aside, both are swept away by their feelings and find themselves declaring their love for each other as the few weeks of their stays wind down. Savannah promises to write and wait for John to return from his tour of duty and they count down days to his next leave and his discharge from the Army. Then September 11th happens...<br /><br />John is torn between the duty to his country and his desire to go home to Savannah, and hopes that she understands his ultimate decision to re-enlist.

B00275EGWY|4.0|Well, I thought the movie was great, one of the best of 2009 that I have seen. Of all the hyped movies that I bought blindly (Public Enemies, Paranormal Activity, and to a lessor extent District 9), I thought this was the best. Probably of all the movies made of the wars in the Gulf, this is one of the most realistic. When you compare this to films like [[ASIN:B00003CX74 Three Kings (Snap Case)]], [[ASIN:B00003CXGV Rules of Engagement]] or [[ASIN:B00005JA9F Courage Under Fire]] its less Hollywood \\"drama\\" and more documentary in presentation. The only supplement featurette included says that they chose the director of photography because of his documentary style. Casting is superb too. I can see this movie raking in big at the Academy Awards. But while the movie has an engaging storyline, lots of action, exposes the audience to a new subject, Hollywood has again just churned out a Blu-ray offering sorely lacking in extras. A commentary and short featurette is something you would expect for a grade B movie, not one that people are talking Best Picture Academy Award nominations. I guess the  public needs to stop buying these bare extras offerings([[ASIN:B002VKE0XA Paranormal Activity (2-Disc Digital Copy Edition) [Blu-ray]]] was even worse) and either wait for the price to drop below $10 or until an extras packed edition is released to send a message to the studios. So yes, if you are into realistic war movies, I highly recommend The Hurt Locker, one move the buzz is deserved for, but I recommend you wait for a price drop.

B000RZIGSG|5.0|In Adrian Lyne's FLASHDANCE, a young woman, Alex (Jennifer Beals), strives to achieve success as a classical dancer, but economic forces require her to work as a welder by day and an exotic dancer by night. Standing in her way is an abundance of profound social obstacles, not the least of which is her boss at the welding factory, Nick (Michael Nouri), who is also her boyfriend. Alex strives to be accepted into a prestigious ballet academy, and she is furious when she realizes that her boyfriend might be pulling strings for her behind the scenes. Along the road to self-discovery and independence, Alex also struggles to accept love, come to terms with her own stubbornness, and find the inner strength to turn her lofty dreams into reality. Flashdance, really surprised me, It has a great storyline with even better music and dancing. Jennifer Beals, at her best. The highlight of the movie is definitly when Jennifer dances to Flashdance(What a feeling), by Irene Cara. A great movie for all ages.

B00000DQSZ|1.0|I'm really not sure why Kraftwerk has such a high reputation.  There's little to impress here.  Some tracks border on being OK or slightly good, but many are very bad and annoying.  People will talk a lot about how they were groundbreaking in their use of synthesizers and in creating the electronic music genre, but that doesn't change the fact that it fails utterly to please the ear.    The melodies, as is the case with much mediocre electronic music, are usually made up of extremely short themes that simply repeat and repeat to the point of nausea.  Some alternation of layers, and a 10 minute song is created out of about 30 seconds of actual music.    Even when the music could be relatively good, the synthesizer tones are often unpleasant and ruin it.  While I'm sure they were skilled considering the state of synthesizer technology at the time, the simple fact is that few of the sounds created by Kraftwerk are enjoyable to listen to, especially in context of the arrangements they create.    The vocals are horrible, sung completely without any feeling or sense of tunefulness.  Some may object that that's the point--they were trying to even use their voices to fit in with the \\"machine music\\" they were creating.  But such explanations and excuses do not magically make the music better.  These people need to stop rationalizing and use their ears.    I really wanted to like Kraftwerk.  I've had this album for years, originally buying it when I began getting interested in electronic music and friends insisted it was a seminal work in the genre.  I told myself I liked it, but once the novelty wore off, I rarely listened to it.  Now that I'm cleaning out my CD collection, I gave it another listen to see whether it was worth keeping.  The answer is a resounding \\"no.\\"    I think if anyone was presented this music without being told anything about it, having no preconceptions most would reject it as amateurish and not worth a second listen.  But instead, most who hear this have been prepped and told it's something great, and who wants to look stupid by not liking what your hip friends think is cool?  As I said, there are some snippets here and there that are OK, perhaps even enjoyable, but in a world over-saturated with music, why spend time on this when there is so much better?    Of course, music is largely a matter of taste, but sometimes things just really are bad.  I can imagine music in the STYLE of Kraftwerk done well, but Kraftwerk themselves just do not make good music.  Like I said above, people that \\"like\\" Kraftwerk should really try to use their ears and see if they aren't just rationalizing that this is good.  Go to \\"Hall of Mirrors\\" for example, and skip to 1:30 and listen.  Can you honestly say there is anything good about that singing?  The only thing positive that I can say about it is that I can recognize the notes he is trying to sing.  But his voice lacks any musical quality at all.  I'm willing to tolerate some imperfection in technique if the music is inspired, but this is a complete lack of technique combined with incredibly unmoving music.    Here are some track by track comments:    Europe Endless - it starts like being in a vaguely pleasant purgatory... after a while, you'd rather just go to hell than stay any longer.    The Hall of Mirrors - why do they think they can sing?  Seriously.    Showroom Dummies - very grating.    Trans-Europe Express - it sounds cool when you first hear the main theme, but then it just goes on and on, and it's so harsh.  The vocoder effect just sounds like they are whispering loudly into a tin can.    Metal on Metal - uh... more of Trans-Europe Express, basically.    Franz Schubert - basically a reprise of Europe Endless.  God knows why they chose to call this \\"Franz Schubert.\\"  Anyone that thinks this is \\"beautiful music\\" should go and get some real Schubert compositions, for example the Trout Quintet.  It may not be recorded with cool synthesizers and electronic beats, but you'llhear what real melodies sound like--melodies that actually span considerable time and aren't just made up of tiny phrases looped together--and you'll hear rhythmic complexity that makes Kraftwerk's beats sound like a 2 year old child banging wood blocks together.    Endless Endless - and yet more recycling.  Out of seven tracks, one pair and one group of three are basically just rehashing the same material.  Not exactly musical geniuses, are they?
B002AOWXQ8|3.0|I heard the song \\"Home\\" on a mix tape and really liked it. It was fun and sweet and had an intricate simplicity I really enjoyed. I got the full album and it starts off amazing. Lots of interesting and catchy tunes. About half way through though, this album loses all steam. It gets thin and boring and somber. The happiness that made me pick the album up disappeared. I found myself wondering how much longer the songs were because they were just dragging on forever. To me, this would be a great album if it was cut in half. It feels like the first chunk is fun and original, and the latter is just unneeded filler.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|Scriptwriter, Dean Craig, has cleverly woven character threads together to create hilarious and absurd juxtapositions in \\"Death at a Funeral\\".  The cast is a strong group of actors who pull off the comedy brilliantly, with Matthew Macfadyen's straight-faced character the focal point and glue that holds it all together.  What a gem! You'll want to watch it more than once.
B002K0WBY6|4.0|THE PROPOSAL as written by Pete Chiarelli and directed by Anne Fletcher looks on the surface (posters, promos. trailer) like yet another version of tough woman manipulates subservient guy in a toss that ends up in a role reversal.  And in many ways that is what this film is about: hard-as-rocks but beautiful editor Margaret (Sandra Bullock) verbally abuses her assistant, wannabe author Andrew (Ryan Reynolds), until her employers discover her visa is expired and she is to be deported to her native Canada. A fast thought drives her to claim that she and Andrew are engaged in a ploy to avoid deportation.  Shocked at first, Andrew decides to make this ultimate blow to his ego work for him and takes Margaret to his home in Sitka, Alaska to meet his family  - mother (Mary Steenburgen), father (Craig T. Nelson) and wildly alive grandmother (Betty White) - where Margaret must play the charade.  Of course in the beauty of Alaska and under the influence of the warmth of a family Margaret never had, the expected  magic happens and ... you know the rest.<br /><br />Sandra Bullock is good and creates a solid character, but it is Ryan Reynolds who proves his chops as one of the best comedic actors on the screen today.  It is a fun outing.  Whether or not it deserves the Golden Globe attention mush less Oscar attention is up for question, but it is a pleasant diversion for some very fine comedians.

B002T9H2ME|5.0|I anticipated for this to be released on Blu Ray, never showed to my local movie theater. I quickly picked it up at Best Buy, just watched it.<br /><br />Wow, haven't seen an engrossing film like this one in a while. After reading many reviews, the director pays a lot of homage to 2001 Space odyssey and many other thought engrossing sci fi movies. At first to be honest, thought this might be along the lines of Solaris, the original movie and the George Clooney remake which was engrossing, slow paced but thought provoking movie as well, sadly have not seen the original Solaris yet.<br /><br />Anyways back to this movie, it was very good, what can I say plot wise that others have not typed? If you like science fiction like Kubrick's 2001 Space Odyssey, Phillip K Dick stories, this echoes blade runner-- rent this one, the special effects are flawless for such a low budget film, you don't see miniatures being used any more or rarely, now a days all CGI. The subject matter dealt in the film, alienation, solitude, self realization, corporation cover- ups. This is a character driven movie performed by perfection by Sam Rockwell, a man who just wants to go home after doing a 3 year tour with Lunar Industries harvesting Helium something off the moon for energy consumption on earth, so with 2 weeks to go everything starts to unravel, Sam finds another man who looks exactly like himself where he is stationed, is Sam hallucinating? Is he starting show signs of dementia and going crazy, his only companion throughout this whole deal is gertie, a robot voiced by Kevin spacey, reminiscent of Hal from 2001, and now this look alike. I have to say this is  Rockwell's Best performance since Confessions of a Dangerous Mind in my most humble opinion. This will deserve a second viewing. The plot is pretty straight forward from what I have just mentioned previously, briskly paced for a 90 something min movie. The music score, felt just right for the science fiction genre.<br />This is a must see, recommend it highly, if you like engrossing films, nice visuals, great performances. 5 stars all the way.t highly, if you like engrossing films, nice visuals, great performances. 5 stars all the way.

B000ZELISO|4.0|Realizing that you can't possibly cram every moment from the book into a movie short enough for theater owners to want to show or that most people (especially kids) will sit through I think they did a good enough job. The whole issue of the horcruxes was handled well enough as were the romances and Malfoy's angst over having been ordered to kill Dumbledore. I'm a little hazy on why they burned down the Burrow. Maybe to highlight Molly's growing fear of losing her husband or one of the kids but it seems to me they could have done that without the pyro.    That said I do have a couple of issues to vent. The editing was choppy at best. Certain conversations such as Dumbledore/Riddle at the orphanage seemed to have been cut and reassembled in a sloppy manner. It didn't sound natural. My other complaint lies with the omission of the memory dealing with the cup and locket. They're going to have to find a way for them to discover the existence of the cup in the last two movies although it seems to me it could have been handled here in about 90 seconds. Perhaps they're uncomfortable with the CGI of elves.    Anyway I'm not as big a fanatic as a lot of other reviewers so I'm not as easily frustrated. I started collecting these because of my daughter and have only read the last 3 books. She was 10 at the time and we've seen every episode in the theater since the first one. We had a laugh about how she'll be twenty recently about how she'll be twenty by the time we finish up.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|This is my first Jane Austen novel.  It did not dissapoint!!  New Years Resolution to read as many of the \\"classics\\" as I could.  I have been pleasently surprised by this book.

142313494X|4.0|If you know anything about Greek mythology, you'll know that their gods had a tendency to produce demigod kids by the dozen.  So it's not too hard to guess what \\"The Lightning Thief\\" is about -- a boy who discovers that he's the offspring of a god, and the other demi-god kids that he gets to know at a very, very special camp. While the introduction is a bit rocky, Rick Riordan spins a clever fast-moving adventure that mines ancient mythology and gives it a modern spin.<br /><br />Percy Jackson has always been a troublemaker, but he's shocked when some truly strange things begin to happen in his life -- and especially when a minotaur appears and attacks his car. When he comes to, he learns that he's at a special training camp called Camp Half-Blood intended for demi-god children, and that his best friend Grover is actually a satyr bodyguard. Though Percy is understandably resistant to the idea, he soon makes friends in the sharp Annabeth and the bitter Luke (and enemies with the kids from Cabin Ares).<br /><br />Oh yes, and he finds that he's the son of the god Poseidon... which is a problem since the \\"Big Three\\" gods have sworn an oath not to father any more kids, due to a rather ominous prophecy.<br /><br />The problem is that Zeus and Poseidon are also having a feud at the moment, due to the loss of Zeus's master lightning bolt -- and Zeus believes that Percy is the culprit. And if things aren't patched up by the summer solstice, the forces of sky and sea will go to war. To save civilization -- and someone dear to him -- Percy must venture into the world of the dead...<br /><br />\\"The Lightning Thief\\" is all a little Harry Potter in concept -- ordinary kid discovers he has magical powers, and is taught in a specialized school/camp with other kids like him. Rick Riordan spends the first half of the book exploring the nature of Camp Half-blood and the various demi-god kids, as well as dropping hints about Percy's parentage. Although, given the number of times he makes water misbehave, you would think someone would have guessed.<br /><br />Fortunately the plot picks up about halfway through, when the whole matter of the bolt and thieving gods comes into play. Riordan has a snappy fast-moving style, and he peppers the story with plenty of plot twists and monstrous action. And he has quite a sharp-edged sense of humor -- the snarkiness is a bit annoying in the first chapter, but after that he produces some fun dialogue (\\"Spontaneous combustion is a form of harm.\\" \\"Nonsense. Boy wouldn't feel a thing\\").<br /><br />And he does a good job with the concept of gods and monster surviving over the center of the western world, as well as spoking some fun at the gods' behavior. Example: Dionysius whining \\"Father loves to punish me. The first time, Prohibition. Ghastly!\\"<br /><br />I found Percy rather annoying in the first couple chapters, but Riordan slowly evolves him from a rather bratty, rebellious kid to a reluctant budding hero. Annabeth is an excellent counterpart to Percy, smart and measured if rather haughty in attitude, while Grover is a likable little sidekick who is chewing his nails over the possibility of losing his job. And the supporting cast of gods and demigods is pretty well-drawn, especially the paternal Chiron and embittered Luke.<br /><br />It's not brilliant, but \\"The Lightning Thief\\" is a solidly written fantasy/adventure yarn, which leaves the door open for more adventures from Perseus Jackson.

Perfect for Modern Warfare 2 to give you a whole new experience.
0393324818|5.0|This book burst on the scene in 2003 to spark an intense debate about how and why some Major League Baseball teams succeed and others seem hapless in their efforts to build a winning franchise. Using as his model the Oakland A's, author Michael Lewis emphasizes the efforts of General Manager Billy Beane to use sophisticated statistical models to draft, trade for, and employ talent on a tight budget. This approach asserts that baseball is a business and that the conventional wisdom of how to create a successful MLB franchise is incorrect for teams without extensive monetary resources. At the time Lewis was writing, of course, the A's were an exceptionally successful team, making the playoffs each year between 2000 and 2003, and again in 2006, with one of the lowest payrolls in MLB. The message of \\"Moneyball\\" was clear: the old adage that large market teams would dominate was outmoded--read the New York Yankees as the poster child for large market teams and the Kansas City Royals as the poster child for small market franchises--and the A's broke the mold.<br /><br />Of course, the \\"Moneyball\\" approach of cagey signings, clever trades, and strategic dumping of established stars for handfuls of prospects became the cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre of MLB management in the middle part of the decade just passed. It all seemed so new and remarkable. Indeed, the fact that a number of small market teams won the World Series between 2001 and 2009 suggested this approach might have salience. After all, during that period the small market Diamondbacks (2001), Marlins (2003), and Cardinals (2006) won the World Series. But then so did the Angels (2002), Red Sox (2004 and 2007), White Sox (2005), Phillies (2008), and Yankees (2009), certainly not small market teams.<br /><br />No question Michael Lewis pinpointed an important trend in the strategic processes of building winning MLB teams. \\"Moneyball\\" has received considerable discussion, appropriately so, but was what Lewis describes all that new? Let me suggest that much of what \\"Moneyball\\" documented had been pioneered nearly three decades earlier by Charlie Finley, owner of the Oakland A's, who with the rise of free agency in the 1970s sold and traded his star players to restock his farm system with excellent prospects. While the A's won three straight World Series between 1972 and 1974, his team collapsed as he sold off or saw players leave through free agency thereafter. Then by 1980 he was back with a new crop of players just off the farm, the great of them was Rickey Henderson.<br /><br />Charlie Finley probably deserves some credit for pioneering the \\"moneyball\\" approach of small market teams in putting winners on the field in the 1970s. Like the later celebrated A's management, Finley scouted, signed, and developed young talent that can then compete successfully against richer competitors. Using the rules of player compensation established in MLB, he grew young superstars and pay them only modestly until the players' seniority in the system allowed them to depart as free agents. Before their departure, however, he often dealt them for top prospects to restock their farm system. Absent the emphasis on ornate statistical analysis undertaken in the more recent \\"moneyball\\" era, Charlie Finley was the godfather of this approach to running his franchise as free agency became the norm. He deserves credit for pioneering this approach.<br /><br />\\"Moneyball\\" is a fascinating book; a benchmark in the study of history of MLB as a business.

B001PU8N0I|3.0|I found Little Dorrit to be... somewhat irksome. I read the book before I watched this miniseries, and honestly I didn't care for it either. The book was lengthy and tiresome... and I found the bbc production to be much the same. They did a wonderful job with making the book come to life, and it was more exciting then the book... but much darker. The movie was bleak, dark, strange, and depressing... it was hardly enjoyable at all. The father was annoying- just as he was in the book- and I was actually quite thankful when he finally died. The frenchman was disgusting... much more vulgar and disturbing than the man described by Charles Dickens. I believe the film maker felt that he needed to make the movie more morbid to attract modern day audiences, which really just turned me off. I finished the series with mixed feelings... it was by no means a masterpiece- but it was a vast improvement to the book.<br /><br />However, for its shortcomings, it is worth watching- once. Matthew MacFayden was as dreamy as ever, and was casted perfectly. The actress who portrayed Little Dorrit did an excellent job... she brought Any Dorrit to life. I thought Amy was rather dull in the book, but in the movie she was quite interesting.<br /><br />I would never buy the series... but it was worth watching that one time at least. I love period movies, and I love Charles Dickens, so if for no other reason than that, I'm glad I did watch it. But I will probably never do so again.

B000OCXF0Q|5.0|I loved Avril when she first came out, but disliked her second album so much that I stopped buying her music. Which is why I didn't even look into The Best Damn Thing until late 2009. Well, I was blown away. I love the upbeat spunky feel (I really hated how moody and depressing her second album was). I also love the energy  and the catchy cadences -- it's great music to go jogging to.    She's also matured a lot in both her songwriting and her singing. I love the complex harmonies in Hot, and When You're Gone and Keep Holding On are beautiful. When I listen to her third cd compared to her first (think Sk8er Boi), it's really amazing how far she's come.    My favorite tracks? The Best Damn Thing, Hot, Keep Holding On, and to a lesser extent Girlfriend (immature content, but great music).

B002VPE1AM|4.0|This film is a visually appealing CGI-fest, with a fairly banal plot involving a corrupt group of developers intent on plundering an alien planet of natural resources. Enter Jake Sully, ex-marine, who is hired to pilot an Avatar, an alien body which will allow him to interact with the locals and try to convince them to abandon their ancestral lands so that the developers can mine \\"Unobtanium.\\"<br /><br />What I liked most about the film, was the CGI. The alien race was visually stunning, appealing, and attractively portrayed. The romance between Jake and the princess of the local tribe was cute, but a bit trite.<br /><br />Unfortunately, where Avatar failed most for me was in the plot. The storyline was simply not that good. I felt Jake as he was portrayed and implemented was not satisfying. He is in fact a traitor to both Na'vi and to his own species. Instead of helping to broker some sort of truce, or trade deal, or at the very least, work for a more bloodless outcome, Jake goes native, turns traitor and kills his own people. The Na'vi's acceptance of Jake after his betrayal was too convenient. Jake's lack of angst at killing his own species seemed too callous.<br /><br />I felt Jake to an extent had become a VR junky like those who play WOW for 24 hrs a day.  Instead of reaching internal acceptance of his own humanity, in order to become accepted and happy, Jake embraces his role as a big blue elf and leave humanity behind.<br /><br />The Na'vi themself were quite Mary-suish. All cultures have flaws, and yet the Na'vi seem too perfect. Even the princesses' boyfriend seems to accept Jake ruining his betrothal with far more grace than warranted. The parallels between the Na'vi and Native populations have been mentioned numerous times, but it is so glaringly obvious almost to the point of being irritating. Cameron's creation entirely lacks subtlety and goes directly for the sledgehammer.  I would've liked to see the Na'vi have a few flaws.  Instead it was Saintly Na'vi vs. Corrupt humanity which equaled a rather simplistic and Ferngully-ish plot.<br /><br />Still, as films go, I was vastly entertained by the CGI, the na'vi and the world of Pandora. Although the soapboxing also annoyed me.equaled a rather simplistic and Ferngully-ish plot.    Still, as films go, I was vastly entertained by the CGI, the na'vi and the world of Pandora.

B0015HOFZI|4.0|Over the last year or so I had been wanting to get back into vinyl. I was aware of the resurgence and had seen many of my old favs being put back out remastered and on high quality 180 gram vinyl. Back in 2007 I really wasn't even aware of what all those terms meant. My experience with vinyl was from when I was 14 and could pick up a copy of Def Lepards Pyromania from the local grocery store while my mom was shopping. I can still remember her face when I picked up Motley Crue's Shot at the Devil and put it in the shopping cart with the eggs. Funny... So in terms of record quality I couldn't really have told you the difference between 180 gram or 120 back in 07 when I started looking for a new LP player. I had done all the research and was really leaning toward either a used Thorens or Dual if I could even find one or a new Pro-Ject. I was really set on the Pro-Ject too. It looks cool and it had a USB so I could rip my vinyl to mp3.     *** Fast Forward to Anniversary Time 2008 ***    My little sister of all people was nice enough to listen and actually get me what I really wanted for my present that year. She did not get me a Pro-Ject turntable though. What I ended up with was a brand new release of Gun's and Roses Chinese Democracy on Vinyl and a Sony PS-LX300USB turntable. To be honest my expectations weren't super high. I mean come on, I had already done all the research and had kind of set my sites on something a little more expensive. To my surprise though the Sony turned out to be a very good performer. Overall I have been very please with the performance, sound, and ease of use. I have collected around 80 records or so over the last two years and am happy to report that many of the new reissues and even the old records I've picked up at various places sound fantastic. I would recommend this player to anybody wanting to get back into vinyl and say work your way up from there if necessary. For me that means that the Pro-Ject I had my sites set on will continuesitting over at the store and not on my shelf for a long time.    Thanks,
B001FB4W0W|2.0|I never read the books,  but said OK to watching this series with my girlfriend.  Now the premise sounded cool enough,  vampires in Louisiana how cool is that?  But I unfortunately found myself hating all of the characters as they were all annoying, whiny, and self centered. Actually I'll take an exception to Terry the war vet, I thought he was well done. And even more annoying was the lack of believable accents.  I'm from the south and have spent a fair bit of time in Louisiana, and most of these actors don't have the accent even close.  Several were indeed \\"southern\\" sounding accents,  but saying a Louisianan accent sounds the same as someone from Texas is as dumb as saying a New Yorker sounds just like a Mainer. I mean Sookie sounded like she just popped up from \\"Gone with the Wind\\", no one talks like that anymore. Rene's was actually pretty good,  but you'll see why that's kind of ironic as you progress through the series.<br /><br />Regardless,  it's lots of drama between the characters that leads to death, mayhem, and loveless sex.  If that's your thing then go for it,  but I just couldn't get into it myself.  I couldn't help but wish that the vampires would just kill the main characters because they just didn't deserve much better.
0446698342|5.0|This is the only Nicholas Sparks book I've ever read (seen the Notebook & a Walk to Remember), I picked it up in an airport bookstore while traveling internationally. I thought it was a great book, though I do have to admit that the fact that Logan was a Marine and that the areas of North Carolina he always writes about are very familiar to me is what kept me hooked through the slow beginning so that I could get interested enough in the actual story. I do have to say that I really disliked the ending, it was rather predictable..I would have liked to have seen it played out a bit differently. (Though I won't spoil the ending, by saying how)    Overall - \\"The Lucky One\\" was a good read, especially on a long flight.
0805091742|5.0|Contrary to some of the negative reviews, I found this book to be very helpful. While the concept is quite intuitive, we make mistakes in many of the things we do simply because of the distractions we face, the ever-increasing complexity of our lives, and human nature. The stories in the book are helpful and definitely illustrate the point. The only thing that I would have liked to see more of is some specific recommendations for using checklists in places other than the cockpit and the operating room. In the end, though, it was a book that I needed to read as I take on a great deal more responsibility in my career. I highly recommend it.

B002UZCJP2|3.0|Honestly, I've forgotten most of SURROGATES already. Let me see what I can dredge up. Bruce Willis is an FBI agent in a future where almost everyone has a tele-operated robotic double. These robots are called SURROGATES, and they can look however you want them to look. Bruce's looks younger and has Don Johnson's hair. The idea is that no one leaves home anymore. Their SURROGATES do that. So when Bruce's surrogate takes a bullet, no sweat. It's just a robot. Only someone has a weapon that fry both the surrogate and the operator. Bruce has to stop him.<br /><br />But, the problem is that SURROGATES is boring, and you see the ending coming miles and miles away. It felt like the David Brin novel, The Kiln People, although in that book, the SURROGATES were disposable clones. But the stories are similar.<br /><br />To call SURROGATES science fiction is really just a technicality. The premise certainly is Sci-Fi, but their future looks awfully contemporary. And there was no guessing who the final five were - EVERYONE was a robot. Or so we're told. There were no outward signs of that. They didn't even append an `r' to the front of their names.<br /><br />I have managed to remember more, but it was hardly worth the effort. SURROGATES is a movie to watch when there is nothing else on. NOT RECOMMENDED.

B002KVSJ64|4.0|Dear Agony came out around the time that Three Day's Grace's latest, Life Starts Now, was released.  I bought TDG's CD first because I'm a big fan of that band, but was disappointed in the album.  I then bought Dear Agony.  If there is some sort of emo competition between those two bands, Breaking Benjamin won this round!  \\"Lights Out,\\" alone, is awesome!  One of the best songs I've heard in a while.  The brutality of the lyrics, the power of the music; it's great!  The CD is also pretty solid, for the most part. It has a fresh, accessible sound that does not lose its edge--well, except maybe during the title track which, surprisingly, is the weakest song on the album.  I hope it won't be getting a ton of radio play.  Currently \\"I Will Not Bow,\\" a much better song, has been dominating the airwaves.  BB reminds me of Ill Nino with the screaming vocals within the catchy tracks.  The packaging is also superior to Life Starts Now.  There are glossy, color photos of all the band members.  Benjamin Burnley and Aaron Fink are good-looking guys.  There is a photo of Burnley's late grandfather to whom the album is dedicated.  He is wearing a uniform and there is at least an indirect soldier theme with some of these songs with lyrics like \\"carry the wounded and shut your eyes\\" (Into The Nothing), \\"leave the lost and dead behind\\" (I Will Not Bow), and \\"Live! Fight! Crawl back inside\\" (Crawl).      1. \\"Fade Away\\"--Killer opening with a futuristic sound.  2. \\"I Will Not Bow\\"--I've been hearing this on the radio a lot lately.  It has a blistering heavy opening but then tones down to become more accessible.  3. \\"Crawl\\"--Ill Nino-esque with blood-curdling screams in between catchy heavy rock riffs.  Actually, I could hear Ill Nino doing this track.  4. \\"Give Me A Sign\\"--Slower rocker with a dark romantic side, I guess, (\\"I'll keep you alive if you show me the way\\").  It is rather repetitive.  There's a line in the chorus where it sounds like it's going to end only to start up again.  It is not one of my favorites.  5. \\"Hopeless\\"--Another blistering, screaming hard rocker like \\"Crawl.\\"  6. \\"What Lies Beneath\\"--The lyrics belie the pleasant melody: \\"Your sick, twisted smile...your cold, jaded eyes...you're the devil in disguise.\\"  I like that.  Still, even with all those faults, \\"I will always be here for the rest of my life.\\"    7. \\"Anthem of the Angels\\"--As the title suggests, there is some pretty orchestration in this track.  It doesn't lose its edge, though.  I like the chorus and the guitar during the bridge.  8. \\"Lights Out\\"--Awesome! Powerful, angry lyrics and a brutal, yet catchy, melody.  This song is definitely the highlight of the CD.  Check out these lyrics: \\"After the lights go out on you / After your worthless life is through / I will remember how your scream.\\" Wow!  9. \\"Dear Agony\\"--As incredibly powerful as the last track was, it is followed by a remarkably lame-sounding track.  It is the title track so, since the band thought enough of it to name the whole CD after it,  it should be the highlight, right? Well, IMO, it is actually the weakest song on the album.  It reminds me of \\"Lost In You,\\" the lamest song on Three Days Grace's latest CD.  10. \\"Into The Nothing\\"--Now, back to the program: a good, straight-forward, power rocker.  11. \\"Without You\\"--Nice ending.  The usual dark, desperate emo lyrics but I really like the line \\"Sing something new / I have nothing left.\\"  Orchestra closes it out.
B002VKE1K2|4.0|Helplessness. That pretty much sums up why I feel like this movie is scary. Obviously there are many people who didn't enjoy it. Thats ok though because no one said they had to. I also enjoyed the Blair Witch Project. I'm a horror movie fan. There are films both old and new that I enjoy.  Paranormal Activity has some freaky moments for sure. The home video style does even more to add to the suspense.
0316069906|5.0|I finished this book last night and then saw someone reading it on the subway this morning and thought to myself that everyone on the planet should be reading this book. As difficult as it was at times to learn about specifics of factory farming and case by case situations, I read it overall feeling empowered that maybe this will be the book to hit home for many individuals. I am already a vegan but I think this is a book that will affect my friends and relatives and i am more than comfortable recommending it to everyone i know whereas I would not do that for other books on the same subject. This was a very quick read, kept my attention from start to end.
0316069906|4.0|This book along with last year's documentary \\"Food, Inc.\\" does a great job of beginning to expose the hidden world of factory farming. I've read some objections that it doesn't contain anything \\"new\\", but that seems to me irrelevant, since Foer doesn't present the book as groundbreaking. What he learned is merely new to him. And to many others, due to the secrecy of these horrific practices. Which are kept out of the public eye for good reason--public awareness would be bad for business.    The value of the book then isn't in its presentation of new material, but rather in its timeliness and accessibility. It's an easy, straightforward, and compelling read.    I have also seen objections that Foer doesn't talk about this or that--dairy and eggs for example. This doesn't matter I think--no book can cover all these topics. Having said that however I wish he had shined more light on the alternative. A final chapter containing specific advice about how, once having made the decision, his family was actually able to move to a plant-based diet, would have helped. Cold turkey as it were, gradually cutting down? Is there an addictive component? Did he experience meat \\"withdrawal\\"? What were the easiest and most difficult parts of the change for his family. How much effort did it take to expand their culinary repertoire to replace the meat. Or did they. I've seen some vegetarians, particularly teenagers, who have terrible diets--relying on mac and cheese etc. I presume Foers are doing better than that. Many people I think approve of the notion in the abstract, but lack signposts guiding them to the new path. And since he had readers in hand at book's end anyway, it was an opportunity, in addition to leading away \\"from\\", to point the way \\"to\\" the alternative.
B0025KVLTC|5.0|Revolver was the last album the Beatles released before they stopped touring. None of the songs from the album were included, as far as I know, on the group's live repertoire - apart from \\"Paperback Writer\\" which was recorded during the same sessions, but which was not included on the album.<br /><br />Musically it is a very varied album, spanning over many different genres, a development which should continue on the next album \\"Sgt Pepper\\". The new psychedelic wave which emerged around 1966 is apparent on several tracks, especially on Harrison's and Lennon's songs. McCartney's songs range widely from Motown (\\"Got to Get You Into My Life\\"), over classic-inspired pop(\\"Eleanor Rigby\\") , to pure-pop balladry (\\"Here, There and Everywhere\\")<br /><br />Harrison, in charge of opening track \\"Taxman\\", demonstrates many places on the album his recent interest in Indian music, not least his own \\"Love You To.\\" Among Harrison's three contributions, I find \\"Taxman\\" by far the greatest, though one must acknowledge his ability and desire to seek new paths with his two other songs.<br /><br />Psychedelia is evident on Lennon's songs \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" and \\"She Said, She Said\\". Both are among the most important songs on the album, without being melodically as strong as Lennon's best. The other three Lennon songs, \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\", \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" and \\"Dr. Robert\\" are more classic rock / blues, - though with very innovative guitar solo on \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\".<br /><br />McCartney's songs are especially ranging far. His love of sentimental ballads is reflected on the beautiful \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" and \\"Here There and Everywhere\\".  It is worth noting that McCartney with \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" demonstrates ability of lyrics with food for thought. McCartney vocally displays great form on the Motown-inspired \\"Got To Get You Into My Life\\". \\"Good Day Sunshine\\" is also a good number, with elements from both the music-hall and Motwn.<br /><br />Ringo sings the silly \\"Yellow Submarine\\", which of course was extremely popular at its time, and even today is a popular melody for football chants.<br /><br />Despite the album's versatility, it works fine as a whole, and like most of the group's output, it has become a milestone in rock history.at its time, and even today is a popular melody for football chants.

B002QE3CTY|5.0|amazing! I read the first half of the book over the course of a week or so, then just hit this point where I absolutely could NOT put it down! Halfway through it becomes like the season finale of &#34;Lost&#34; and yet, like the show, we are still left in the dark! WTF?! When is book 2 coming out???
B001ASIRZG|5.0|Okay so I bought this due to the fact I am a die hard a'ha fan...then I read the only two reviews on here and was worried but to my delight this set is wonderful.  I realize the dvd is not zoned for us here in good ole California but luckily my computer was willing to run it for me and its fantastic!!! love it love it love it. The CD quality was excellent quality.  This could only be better if the cd was zoned for the states.  Other than that you couldn't really ask for anything more.  You wont regret this purchase.
B002VKE1K2|1.0|We quickly realized we wasted our time and money.  We skimmed through it, having managed to watch perhaps 15 minutes in sequence, at the most.  One of the worst things we've ever seen.  On scale of 1-5, wouldn't even give it a 1.
B00005RIKI|5.0|\\"Pronounced\\", Skynyrd's debut, the \\"Second Helping\\" album, the raw \\"Muscle Shoals\\" recordings are the band's definitive essentials. It's been said the early work of any artist are usually the best, all three of these recordings reveal the true colors of Ronnie Van Zant and the band as a whole. The instrumentation is tight with Billy Powell's piano notes are right on key, Powell's style is very similar to Professor Longhair, the New Orleans singer/piano player. \\"Pronounced\\" contains eight classic songs with some of their strongest material, \\"Gimme Three Steps\\", \\"Free Bird\\", \\"Tuesday's Gone\\", and \\"Simple Man\\", you gotta love the blues/rock oriented , \\"Things Goin' On\\", \\"Mississippi Kid\\", \\"I Ain't The One\\". The extra tracks on this version are also excellent, including the demos of \\"Mr. Banker\\" another blues number, included also are the rockin' \\"Down South Jukin'\\", \\"Tuesday's Gone\\", \\"Gimme Three Steps\\", and an eleven minute jam session of the anthem, Free Bird. This band with the \\"southern sounds\\" of the past knew how to flat out rock in every sense of the word, \\"Skynyrd\\".
014241493X|4.0|Quentin Jacobsen believes that everyone gets one true miracle in their life. For him, the miracle was growing up next door to awesome, adventurous Margo Roth Spiegelman. Although Q and Margo haven't really hung out together since elementary school, Q has loved Margo, loved the very idea of Margo, for most of his eighteen years.<br /><br />Just a few weeks before graduation, Margo reconnects with Quentin in the most surprising way: she shows up outside his bedroom window at midnight and asks him to drive her around while she performs eleven acts of mayhem & vengeance. Quentin agrees reluctantly, but the ensuing hours turn out to be some of the best of his life. He can't help thinking that things are going to change between him and Margo Roth Spiegelman and they do, just not in the way that Q expects. The next day, Margo disappears.<br /><br />After a few days pass, it is clear that Margo is not just away on one of the adventures that have made her a legend at Winter Park High School. Wherever she has run to this time, it looks like she's not planning on coming back. As he follows the clues Margo left behind, Quentin comes to believe two things. First, it's his mission to find Margo, she meant for him to find her. And second, he never really knew Margo Roth Spiegelman at all. Maybe nobody did.
B002ZMZBD2|5.0|As of Jan 2010, I have seen this movie three times and I absolutely love the music in it.

0385737947|5.0|\\"He began his new life standing up, surrounded by cold darkness and stale, dusty air.\\"<br /><br />When Thomas comes to his senses, riding upward in a cold, dark metal box, he remembers his name and nothing else about his own life. He has knowledge - knows what a flashlight is, knows the story of Hansel and Gretel, knows millions of other things - but he has no recollection of how that knowledge applies to his own life. His memory has been completely, if selectively, wiped.<br /><br />The box - an elevator of sorts - carries Thomas upward to the Glade, an oasis in the center of a huge maze. The Gladers are a group of close to 60 boys who were delivered via the box before Thomas arrived and like him, they have no memories of their lives before. All they know is the Glade (where they have created a self-sustaining community) the box (which delivers supplies once a week and a new boy once a month) and the Maze.<br /><br />Every day the Gladers send Runners into the Maze, attempting to solve the ever changing puzzle of the Maze and find their way out. Every night the Runners race back to the Glade, desperate to return to its safety before the massive doors that surround the Glade close, protecting the boys from the monstrous killing machines that roam the Maze by night.<br /><br />This is the reality that Thomas is delivered into but it is a reality that is altered by his arrival. The day after Thomas enters the Glade, a girl is delivered in the box. Then the parameters of the Gladers' world begin to change. Things become even more dangerous, unpredictably so. Thomas and the rest of the Gladers realize that escape from the Maze has become less a goal and more of a necessity for survival.
B000VALY54|5.0|I have just recently been on a Robert Downey Jr. kick (feeling the need to go out and watch all his movies).  This one is by far one of my top movies.<br /><br />Downey plays Harry Lockhart, a criminal who is mistaken for an actor and finds himself in LA, getting detective lessons from Detective \\"Gay Perry\\" (Val Kilmer), in preperation for the part that Lockhart landed.  Things start getting weird when the two of them stumble upon an actual murder and the bodies continue to pile up around them.<br /><br />This movie kept me laughing and I loved Downey's humorous narration through the movie.  Some people would say that this movie has some unbelievable parts, but those parts just fit the movie so well.  Cussing?  Yeah, there's alot of F**ks, but after a little while it didn't bother me.<br /><br />At least rent this movie.  I never say that you should run out and buy a movie, because I know not everyone has the same taste in movies as me.  But, I defnintly say that you should rent it.  You should see it once, at least.
0545123267|5.0|Six years ago - in the dead of winter - wolves pulled Grace Brisbane off her backyard tire swing and dragged her into the woods. As they began to maul her, their intent was clear. They meant to tear her to pieces. They would have succeeded if it weren't for him - the wolf Grace now thinks of as hers. The wolf with the golden eyes. Every winter she watches for him in the woods behind her house, watches and feels a haunting longing she cannot define.<br /><br />Sam Roth was bitten when he was seven years old. After a horrific, tragic separation from his parents, he was raised by Beck and the rest of his pack. Human in the summer and wolves as soon as the air turns cold, the members of the pack know that with each passing year they are closer to the time when they will no longer return to their true human selves, even in the warmest weather. So Sam keeps silent, lupine company with Grace all winter and dreams of speaking to her in the summer but never quite dares.<br /><br />Their lives are lived together and yet apart for six years, until fate and a hunter's bullet brings Sam and Grace together in what might be his last time in his human form. Now neither wants to face the lonely winter and the inevitable separation that it will bring. Brilliantly written and intensely romantic, Shiver is everything you could ask for in a novel. Do not miss this one!
0385504225|1.0|In just a few short sentences, please allow me to express that this book was just plain garbage. From a subject perspective - not interesting. From a style perspective - elementary (it reads like a high school student wrote this). The tension in the book - based solely on McGuffins - if you can believe that! The characters - somehow are all unintelligent. Not only unintelligent, but stubborn and irrational as well. The plot was also unbelievable and on the border of insulting. For example, we're expected to believe that a character can attack a CIA director, with a weapon, and assist in the escape of a suspect, resist arrest, and a few chapters later become a part of the team (with said CIA director) to help solve a national crisis (which, incidentally, is the release of a video to the news)! In another act of incredulity, we're expected to believe that after a man is held captive for days, gets his hand chopped off, witnesses several attempted murders and the death of a loved one, and once said man is freed, he will casually travel around the city imparting lessons of wisdom and marvels to another man (who died of drowning hours earlier but was revived because he drowned in miracle fluid). Pure rubbish.     I found myself rolling my eyes and saying \\"Aw, come on!\\" so many times throughout this book. If you value your time, and expect for authors to respect your sensibilities, don't go near this one.

0156027321|5.0|I finished reading Life of Pi only yesterday. Clearly, I am reading it long after all the hype from the book has died and those about the movie are yet to catch up. I found the book amazing. There are plenty of good things to be said- the richness of details, the matured yet lucid writing style, the spectacular imagination that makes one feel as if it is not a book, but a pair of virtual reality eye-wear that she is holding, and I can go on forever. The reviewers before me all have pointed out these excellent atributes about the book, I refrain from reiterating them. What I wanted to write about, is slightly different and very much off a book review.     The story is supposed to be one that should make one believe in God. I was already a believer and continue to be so. However, I feel like I missed the whole point. The story did not reinforce my faith in God. Not because my mind discounted it as a story; I am completely ready to believe that something like this really happened to someone. But even then, I do not see how my faith in God is to be confirmed by this account.     I can anticipate that some of you would suggest that the very fact that the boy survived after spending 227 days on a life boat with a tiger in the Pacific Ocean is a miracle, and miracles are proof that God exists. But there is my problem. I do not see a miracle, precisely because I have read the story. Had this just been a newspaper headline, like about some people who survive after being buried in the earthquake rubble for a week, I would have felt that this was a miracle. But \\"Life of Pi\\" confirmed and reinforced my faith in human ability, capability and tenacity. This book makes you think that humans can survive anything- as long as they apply their thinking, their knowledge and their will. Reason triumphs here, not faith. The boy was a natural believer in God and found a lot of solace in praying. He naturally adopted the ways of all major religions. This is evidence that his faith and belief were Himalayan, in that, nothing could probably shake them. Even a tragedy on this scale. But the fact that he survived, was not because he prayed, but because he was smart, hard-working, alert and was a quick-learner with a presence of mind. If you suggest that God's hand is to be seen in all of this because God created us, I will not disagree, but I will say that I knew it and believed it even before reading the book.     In my opinion, Life of Pi, is all about being human even in the most animal-like circumstances, even with an animal, and that one should never lose faith in his or her abilities.
B002HWRYJE|2.0|What is it when J.J. Abrahms has a great cast he saddles them with a terrible script. He had Phillip Seymour Hoffman in Mission Impossible 3 and that movie was terrible and PSH's awesome acting couldn't save the film. It is the same thing with Star Trek. Let's never mind that it destroys Vulcan, something totally out of sync with everything else in Star Trek, but he makes the characters almost cartoonish in how they act.     All of this great acting talent almost overcomes one of the worst scripts of the past five years but it fails because the script runs like a roller coaster from point to point and there is no point to any of it.  Spock's father, a major figure in his own right, is like a fly on the wall.  It is really just such a shame that all this talent was wasted and what could have been a great movie is very, very weak.
B002LLE3PY|5.0|Marty posted a great review, and I would like to add some points.  I'm one of those King Crimson fans that was a huge fan years ago (even before CD's), and I'm getting back to them again.  What I remember of this album is that it was my least played Crimson album (and I had all of them), with the possible execption of Earthbound, which just sounded crappy - and even Fripp will admit that!<br /><br />My used copy of the Lizard LP was bought around 1987.  It has a lovely shiny cover with a horribly scratched record - So scratched I had to add a gram of weight to the needle to overcome a skip in the title track.  I made a point to play this old record before I listened to this 5.1 DTS version that arrived in the mail last night.  What a huge, huge contrast.  On this new DVD you can pick up every instrument's tiny little nuance.  And every instument has it's place in the 3D space of your listening room - and sometimes they move about in a natural manor consistant with the orignal stereo recording.  Just like DVD-A of \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\", the recording is clear, crisp, and detailed, with no pops, hiss, hum, wow or flutter.  Amazing since the tapes used were 40 years old.  I have to add that I'm having a hard time believing what I'm hearing - I'm hearing detail and instruments that were completely lost in that old scratchy record of mine.  Just for fun, pull down the levels on all but one rear speaker and you will see what I mean.<br /><br />I certantly have a new appreciation for this underdog Crimson album.  It really is a great disk - it's like I've discovered it for the first time.  I'm seriously impressed with everthing about this re-issue.  The sound, especially, but the packaging, booklet, and bonus tracks on the disks are great. The only thing missing is a concert video like Red 5.1 has - of course there may not be one available since this lineup broke up soon after the recording was made.<br /><br />A really top-notch product here.  I highly recommend it!end it!
B002NXSRVG|3.0|OK you have to make a big decision before watching this movie.  Do you really want something that will make you think and wonder if the world can be saved? Do you want to sit back and say it's impossible to build a huge city under the North Pole with no one watching, or that missile technology which eats everything? If you were want to be a scientist than this movie isn't for you.     If you want to just enjoy a silly and fun action movie which celebrates being cheesy then this is more your speed. This is supposed to be fun and if you can relax and enjoy it you will be fine.  Yes it has bad dialogue and enough plot holes to make Swiss Cheese look rock solid by comparison.  But it works because the cast is obviously having fun and hamming it up.  They're in on the joke and I would recommend people relax and get in on it too.  Not a great movie, but what's wrong with just having some fun?
B002NXSRVG|4.0|all of you who are bashing this movie need to go to hell. if you went into a live action g.i.joe movie expecting saving private ryan or black hawk down then you are a fool. as with transformers, the story for a g.i.joe movie is almost irrelavent. it's not about story and great acting, it's about seeing the 3\\" toys we played with as kids on the big screen. there were no other toys that i was anywhere near as loyal to when i was a kid(legos and transformers were a very distant 2nd and 3rd). expecting a brilliant story out of g.i.joe is like expecting the ramones to write blonde on blonde(and i know that would be impossible as 3 of them are dead but you get the point and this is in no way meant as a knock on the ramones). i will admit i was a little disappointed when i first watched this movie but that was because i have wanted this movie for 25 years so there was no way it could ever live up to my expectations. i hope for more g.i.joe and transformer movies because they are like living a little bit of childhood all over again and i had a great childhood thanks in large part to snake eyes,duke,destro,the crimson guard,serpentor,zartan,tomax and xamot,jinx,quick kick,sgt.slaughter,storm shadow(g.i.joe and cobra versions),firefly,lady jane,scarlet,cobra commander,the many forms of vipers,bar-b-que, and the effing mobile command center. and by the way i am wearing my g.i.joe-a real american hero t-shirt as i write this review, god i'm a nerd. enjoy this movie for what it is and don't listen to the a-holes tearing it down

I probably would have liked it a lot, but my military experience (which predates the Iraq War but did involve Yugoslavia, Saudi Arabia and Iraq in 1990 and 1991, and Panama in 1989 made the departures from realism (that were invisible to a lot of reviewers here) stand out like blinking neon signs:<br /><br />1.  I thought the idea of the \\"cowboy\\" EOD technician sneaking out of the base to go on his own into downtown Baghdad at night in 2004 was laughable, when you think about the fact that I'm sure every soldier over there knows that if they fell into enemy hands, they could expect extremely unpleasant deaths.<br /><br />2.  Set aside the unrealism in item 1, the fact that the cowboy didn't get in trouble for doing something so outrageously stupid and criminal (since he did force an Iraqi at gunpoint to take him downtown) was also ludicrous.<br /><br />3.  I will defer to soldiers and Marines who have served over there and especially to EOD technicians, but I found myself extremely dubious that those guys would be out by themselves in such a dangerous environment.  No, they would have had security with them in the form of infantry who would keep watch and protect them while they did their work.<br /><br />4.

0307454541|5.0|I heard so many wonderful things about this book and I agree with all of them.  This book is long, but it is well worth it.  The author has an odd style that takes a little getting used to but once you get into it you cannot put it down.  I love the bizarre characters and the complicated, twisting plot.  All in all a great thriller!
B002QGUFWE|5.0|The Fame came out in 2008 so if you already got it don't bother getting this that will be a waste of money plus you can get the ep by itself for like 8 bucks.The fame monster has 2 disc the first disc is the fame monster which has 8 new tracks such as bad romance ,monster,so happy I could die,which are flavs for me,this album marks the bad side of the fame,what happens after you have so much of it and the results are you become a monster,so I guess it was needed.The second disc is the original the fame from 08,You'll basically getting just dance,poker face my flav which is starstruck and etc,its great 2 have both in one case and these songs are highly addictive pops songs.Lady Gaga's vocals are great and strong,but also listen to her lyrics and I mean not poker face but other tracks where her lyrics shine.    The producing is also what makes her music great,believe me if she didn't have them the fame itself wouldn't be this good,at the end of the day you must buy this album it just has to be in your best cd collection,plus you just might buy it anyway since lady gaga can't stop promoting it.
0307346617|4.0|This is my third \\"zombie novel\\".  It was pretty good.  I liked how the author takes you around the world talking to various people and their role in the war.  This book started off really hot and it was very hard to put down.  However, as another reviewer mentioned it started to become more tactical.  For me it started to drag.  I did wonder how the zombies survived a lot of situations, like underwater; I'd have thought they should have detoriated quickly in the water.  Also, I don't remember how this started.  How did this \\"virus\\" come about?  I honestly don't remember if this was every mentioned/explained in the book, as it went on, I started getting a little bored.<br /><br />Over all, this is a really good book, not good enough to re-read or keep.  Also I'd have liked it much more if the print was a little larger in the book.  As the boredom started, the tiny print, made it very hard to read let alone finish.<br /><br />This is a page turner at the beginning, but due to the small print and how the story just doesn't keep you going, it took me too many days to read this book.  I am tired of zombies for a while.

B000UPSKO8|5.0|This live recording of a performance in Baden-Baden in 2007 is just the thing for explaining to friends why you like beautiful singing and \\"the finer things in life.\\" Nearly twenty arias, duets, and more provide a variety of great moments from favorite operas.<br /><br />Anna Netrebko and Elina Garanca treat the audience to scenes from Bellini's Norma, and the hauntingly light and ethereal flower duet from Delibes' Lakme. Ramon Vargas and Ludovic Tezier follow with a deliriously successful rendition of the duet from The Pearl Fishers, and the audience goes wild with appreciation.<br /><br />Among other delightful scenes is the \\"O soave fanciulla\\" duet from La Boheme, done lovingly by Vargas and Netrebko. Another unforgettable event was what I call the \\"through the window\\" quartet from Rigoletto, with Vargas crooning the \\"Bella figlia dell'amore.\\" It is the juxtaposition of the two couples in the same scene that sets opera apart (and above?) the other arts, and they sing it so well here.<br /><br />But for me, the best piece in the program is Anna Netrebko's \\"Meine Lippen, sie kussen so heiss\\" from Lehar's Giuditta. I thought her performance in the earlier Berlin concert could never again be equaled, but she outdoes herself here! When she reaches the part of the song telling of her beautiful mother, the dancer, Netrebko kicks off her shoes and whirls, dancing across the stage. How rarely do we see an opera singer who can not only sing and act, but is also graceful on her feet. As she delivers each line, she picks roses out of her bouquet and tosses them to members of the admiring audience. OK--I know some will say this is playing to the crowd, but when you're that beautiful, graceful, AND can sing so well--she can do whatever she wants!! It's a delightful concert. You'd enjoy inviting friends to watch it with you.
0316069906|5.0|I have been vegetarian since 2008, but still ate seafood.   Now, I won't eat any seafood either.  This book gave me that final push to stop eating anything that had a heartbeat, eyes, etc....This book is written in a style that both a meateater and vegans/vegetarians can appreciate and even though the author is vegetarian I think it was written in such an unbiased way as to not feel like you were being preached at and it was not an attempt to \\"convert\\" you.  All I can say is that if you read this book and can then justify the need to put even a single piece of factory farmed meat in your mouth then you really need to look at your own ethical core and decide if you dont care about 1) health of people living near these \\"farms\\", 2) the animals being so cruelly raised and slaughtered, or 3) the planet that you and you children/grand children live on....then what is the meaning of your life?
044654146X|5.0|This is a very lucid and easy read, telling the story of Israel's high tech success.  As someone that grow up in Israel during the 80's, it is nice to see that Israel has managed to create a successful private industry (which barely existed beforehand), creating innovative technology companies across a myriad of fields, focusing specifically on semiconductors, lasers, software security, and the Internet.  However, none of this would have been possible without one central figure -- Dov Frohman.  In my opinion, Frohman is only behind Herzl and Ben-Gurion as a measure of contribution to the success of the state of Israel.      Dov was the first General Manager of Intel Israel, and the reason Intel agreed to establish an R&D center and later a fabrication base in Israel.  The success of Intel Israel brought the country respectability and opened the gates for every other technology multinational to establish similar R&D centers, such as Motorola, HP, Microsoft, Applied Materials, Cisco, Google, and many others.    Israelis should be more appreciative to the invaluable contribution that Dov Frohman has made to what many hope will be Israel's economic success going forward.
B00000GAIW|5.0|in high school one of my friends said you have to hear this album by some guy named jethro tull.  very off the wall, but something you could listen to.  then i got into the lyrics.  and found out the truth about that guy jethro.  ian anderson had his mojo going.  quirky in some places, downright indignant in others, the album was absolutely great for someone in high school in those days.  moving forward a few years.  mungle in the jungle is out (not a fav of mine).  i tried to get tickets to see led zepplin and the guy at the ticket counter laughed at me.  who else was touring?  jethro tull.  aqualung.  let me have two tickets.  the day of the concert i was fighting a field fire for over eight hours (volunteered in my youth) and was exhausted, but was able to make the show.  all i wanted to hear was \\"locomotive breath\\" and i would have considered it a worthwhile venture.  the band played the entire \\"aqualung\\" album.  i was blown away.  it was great.  i couldn't have asked for any more.  to this day, that concert (and album) is one of my favorites.  here is my kicker.  the album came out in 1972.  the concert was in, what, 1975-76?  and i still love it.  hell, i insist i sing lead on rock band when locomotive breath is playing.  yeah, i'm 54 years old.  sue me.
B002QEXN2K|4.0|A collection of love/break-up songs(mostly), \\"Battle Studies\\"  is a near-solid album. However, John Mayer has produced better in the scope of his career. The lyrics are top-notch, and John's guitar is excellent through most of the songs. His strings only lack a bit on \\"Assassin\\", which includes an average guitar solo.    All songs on \\"Battle Studies\\" hold their own. \\"Heartbreak Warfare\\" is a great straight-forward rock tune. \\"All We Ever Do Is Say Goodbye\\" is a slow ballad and has amazing harmonizing during the chorus...almost makes the song for me. I like how \\"Half of My Heart\\" features Taylor Swift dueting only modestly with John, which is a wise decision because it adds emotion to the song without overdoing it. \\"Who Says\\" is a simple folk-inspired tune with a great care-free attitude. \\"Perfectly Lonely\\" is a great, steady rock song with a good blues guitar riff. Another track worth mentioning is \\"Do You Know Me\\", which is a low-key tune with great guitar work. \\"Friends, Lovers or Nothing\\" is a great closer to the album.    \\"Battle Studies\\" is mostly a slow burner, but shouldn't be overlooked by any means...a smart release from John Mayer!    4 Stars.

031606792X|1.0|Let me start by saying, I've never written a review.  I became a recent, fast, huge fan of Twilight just before the release of New Moon.  I am an adult reader and fell in love with the imperfection of Bella, the gentleman like qualities of Edward coupled with trials of the world.  How can you not enjoy young, innocent love. It was easy to relate to. It was perfect and it literally made you smile and sometimes laugh at loud. ...So I was simply disappointed to read Breaking Dawn.  I felt like the essence of Bella and Edward no longer existed here.  For three books you wait for the build of their love only to have it glossed over lightly.  Now I don't think we need any sort of explicit sex scene.  I thought the past descriptions were just fine.  However in Breaking Dawn there's absolutely no description of their first encouter.  Making things worse, Bella goes from this still blossoming child to a mother.  Why?  Never once did Bella ever mention any sort of desire for children.  It seemed very random and you never truly picked up a motherly bond from her.  She still appears to be a child herself.  I also found it surprising that the author went into the gross, bloody details of child birth complete w/ Edward ripping her uterus open with his teeth.  She could have saved that for the love making between the two.  Finally, the love triangle involving Jacob was ended....only when Jacob imprints Bella's infant daughter.  I understand this is fiction, but I could not get on board with Jacob falling for a baby....by the woman he first loved.  This book simply ended the innocence of young love and traded with with sci-fi demon babies. You barely even recognize the characters.  Edward has nothing to protect, Jacob has nothing to fight for and Bella has nothing to long for. Even Charlie who for months made Edward's visits unsettling suddently could care less if his daughter was a vampire.  If you're a true fan, please stop with book 3 - Eclilpse.   That way you'll always remember Bella and Edward.
B000WGWQG8|2.0|I have a bachelor's degree in history and love McCullough's works.  The book was so masterful and insightful, inspired, really-- one of my favorite books of all time.    I don't disagree that the movie itself is well-made.  The acting is amazing, it is very well cast, and attention to detail is great.  Where the disappointment lies, for me, is in the distortion of the facts.  First, I was disgusted with how Adams has been mis-represented.  One of the wonderful things about the book is it shows a remarkable, yet human man whose role in history until now has been under-represented.  The movie focuses mainly on his shortcomings, making those central, while leaving out the good and/or distorting it.  This is not true of Abigail, who is much more accurately portrayed, but in this case it is almost as if it were done at the expense of her husband.    My husband had not read the book but watched the series with me, and he thought Adams appeared to be a jerk, to put it mildly.  The relationship he had with his kids was a good one, but for theatrical purposes Adams was portrayed as a nearly abusive father with little or no compassion for his children.  This simply was not so.      Not only have they distorted the goodness of the main character, but the filmmakers felt they needed to alter certain details to make the story more compelling.  The story itself was so compelling I couldn't put the book down, as if I were reading a novel.  In this case, the truth needed no embellishment, and sadly, some very compelling pieces of the story were left out.      I wish they had just chosen to show this wonderful story as it occurred, instead of putting a \\"modern\\" spin on it.  Mainly left out were the details of John and Abigail's tremendous faith and moral rectitude, as well as John's true passion for learning and liberty (the movie portrays him only joining the American cause for liberty after he sees a man tarred and feathered by a mob, and he is enticed to give the rebellion some much-needed moderation).  The frontal male nudity was unnecessary, as were a few other gruesome scenes.      This series was extremely well executed and had great potential, but was very disappointing in its representation of history and its Hollywood-ization.    One John Adams main disappointments in life was that all his sacrifice for liberty and country were somehow lost and forgotten.  He felt he had been misunderstood and misrepresented, and yet his character had at all times been impeccable.  If he could see this film, I can't help but think how disappointed he would be to find that the masses are deluded yet again as to the real greatness of a great man.
B000001FKY|5.0|With Def Leppard you must like harmonizing because this is what they do. They are very good at it. This CD was done after the drummer had a tragic accident and lost his left arm. Did they fire him... nope. Did they find another drummer... nope. They release the biggest selling CD they have ever had!!! To have this kind of tragic event and then release this piece of art work says a lot about the talent of this band. This album is a little more \\"pop\\" sounding than \\"Pyromania\\" but it still has a very distinctive sound. Each one of Def Leppards albums has a different sound which is why you never get bored with them. They are very creative. This CD is also \\"a must own\\" because of it's rythym and great lyrics. You just feel good when listening to this CD.
B0029NY9YO|3.0|Special effects were good...storyline was not clear at the beginning and a bit slow..picked up at the end.  Dr. Manhattan showed excessive nudity which could have been averted by having him wear trunks.

B00004BZ16|5.0|Sadly many want to pigeon hole a group into what they want them to be. This was an incredible follow up to their best so far London Calling. Certainly, in those days when the big record companies would milk every second of music into profit, a three-disk LP for the price of one must have irked them. The Clash are certainly at their peak and on the move exploring music styles that some narrow minded pogo sticks simply could not understand  .... these are muscians who enjoy making music. Yes they had things they wanted to say, but the bottom line is they wanted to make the best music they could. Of course now with CD's the Record Labels are making a killing. The clash easily move from one musical genre to another revealling their muscianship, as much as I love all their previous ventures, the band continued to move forward  ... certainly in my view this is their best.

1416955070|5.0|Fifteen-year-old Clary Fray is almost content with her boring real life in Brooklyn. Trips to the Pandemonium Club for dancing and people watching with her best friend Simon add enough excitement, even if Clary is too shy to talk to anyone.<br /><br />That changes when Clary witnesses three teenagers with mysterious tattoos murder another boy in the club. Clary is ready to report the murder until she watches the body disappear into thin air. The murderers being invisible to everyone but Clary also complicates matters.<br /><br />But nothing is as it seems when the murderers explain themselves to her. Not murderers at all, the teens are part of the hidden world of Shadowhunters--warriors who fight to rid the world of demons.<br /><br />Clary is drawn deeper into the Shadowhunter world when her mother disappears and demons start to attack. Suddenly Clary's boring real life is anything but in City of Bones (2005) by Cassandra Clare.<br /><br />The book itself is also anything but ordinary. Reviews have cited City of Bones as an unoriginal pastiche of other fantasies--a claim that, after finishing the novel, seems unfounded.<br /><br />Clare blends elements of biblical myth, urban fantasy and suspense to create a truly unique story. The writing is snappy with wit and verve that might explain the comparisons between the book and the Buffy TV series.<br /><br />As Clary delves deeper into the world of the Shadowhunters and the demons they hunt, Clare creates a richly developed world filled with vivid characters that readers will look forward to seeing again.<br /><br />City of Bones is the first of Clare's Mortal Instruments books. Clary's adventure continues in City of Ashes. The first three of the series are already published with a fourth due out in 2011. Clare is also working on a prequel trilogy called The Infernal Devices. The first of the prequels, The Clockwork Angel will be published in 2010.<br /><br />Possible Pairings: The Demon's Lexicon by Sarah Rees Brennan, Hush, Hush by Becca Fitzpatrick, Beautiful Creatures by Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl, Paradise Lost by John Milton, The Descent by William Carlos Williams, Hush, Hush by Becca Fitzpatrick, Beautiful Creatures by Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl, Paradise Lost by John Milton, The Descent by William Carlos Williams

B00275EGWY|2.0|I wanted to like this movie...I really, really did.  I had seen and read alot of hype for it, rave reviews, and alot of talk of Oscars.  After watching it however, I can't see why.<br /><br />There have been alot of war movies over the years, but there has yet to be anything worthwhile watching for Iraq.  This is not Platoon, the Dirty Dozen, the Battle of the Bulge, it isn't even Inglorious Basterds.  True, other Iraq fair has fallen flat or just plain sucked.  This wasn't as bad (Over There) and didn't have an idiotic and misguided political statement (Redacted...Marc Cuban burn in hell) but it wasn't all that good.<br /><br />There's the typical military irregularities, such as uniforms (US flags are worn on the right shoulder of soldiers but in the movie they're either on both or none), equipment (magazines disappear and reappear between scenes, and the 6 wheeled APC used by US soldiers is in fact an APC used by the South Africans, not Americans) and overall impossible situations (a single vehicle by itself? REALLY?).  These SERIOUSLY detract from the movie, so anyone not familiar with anything military get a somewhat twisted inaccurate view of operations in country.<br /><br />The storyline overall really has no point, as all it is are daily missions, almost vignettes, of the EOD team's daily ops.<br /><br />The last 15 minutes is the only thing that saves this movie and gives it a star.  the acting, emotion and theme (I won't spoil it) would've made this an AMAZING movie, had it been a constant throughout.  Sure, there's small snippets of emotion and feeling, but at times too brief to really feel it.<br /><br />Yes, I can see this movie receiving some nominations, such as best actor for Jeremy Renner, but to win it I think is a bit much.  As an active duty soldier with over 8 years service and 2 deployments, this movie just seemed lackluster and some of the situations too far fetched to really appreciate the movie, although it wasn't the total crapfest of other movies (Home of the Brave)

B002VECMAY|4.0|Sometimes karma can be a real b***h.  Take Ryan Bingham, who works for a company that specializes in firing other companies' employees.  Yet, despite the harshness of what he's paid to do, Ryan genuinely loves his job and the confirmed-bachelor lifestyle it allows him to lead.  He loves being away from home 270 days out of the year.  He loves flying on planes - to the point where he's about to crack the magical 10 million-mile mark on his Frequent Flyer plan.  He even loves the place he officially calls home: a sterile motel room in Omaha where he barely gets time to shower and shave and unpack his bags before heading off to another destination.<br /><br />The problem is that all these business trips are placing an onerous financial burden on the company.  The solution the bigwigs have come up with is to simply remove the human-contact element from the firing process altogether and replace it with the impersonality of the dreaded teleconference.  For Ryan, this means that his days of flying the friendly skies may well be numbered.  Before that happens, however, Ryan is determined to make one last stand with his boss, agreeing to take Natalie Keener, the young woman who came up with the idea, on the road with him to demonstrate just how crucially important the \\"personal-touch\\" can be when terminating an employee.  Meanwhile, despite his avowals about how much he loves the bachelor life, a crack in his armor may be starting to show, for Ryan may in fact be falling for Alex, a 30-something fellow-traveler he meets in a bar one night and with whom he begins an initially \\"casual,\\" typically no-strings-attached romance.  But will it stay that way?<br /><br />\\"Up in the Air\\" is the latest work by Jason Reitman, the director who gave us \\"Thank You for Smoking\\" and \\"Juno\\" in recent years.  Like those earlier efforts, \\"Up in the Air\\" is a subtle, thought-provoking comedy/drama that explores not only the complexities of romance and human relationships but the destructive effect rampant corporate downsizing has on the shell-shocked individuals who are its victims and on the fabric of society as a whole.<br /><br />Reitman is scrupulously evenhanded in his depiction of the protagonist.  Ryan may not crave an ongoing relationship with that one \\"special\\" individual, but he doesn't inflict his values on other people and doesn't expect everyone to agree with how he lives his life.  For Ryan, living alone is simply a lifestyle choice that seems to be working for him.  He isn't even particularly callous in the way he treats those he's in the process of lowering the employment-ending boom on.  Ryan knows that someone has to do his job and it might as well be him.  It certainly beats doing it in the new highly impersonal way Natalie has come up with.  The cosmic question becomes is Ryan's eternal bachelor mindset truly endemic to his personality, or could he find true happiness with another person if he just gave it the old college try?<br /><br />Reitman's wryly humorous screenplay (co-authored with Sheldon Turner and based on the book by Walter Kim) explores Ryan's relationship - one platonic, the other not - with two women:  the brash but actually quite naïve Natalie who, despite her seeming emotional detachment, believes in happily-ever-after storybook endings and long-term marital bliss, and the more seasoned Alex who has few illusions about what life has to offer in either of those two regards.  The movie hears out all sides on the issue without casting judgment and without settling for easy answers.  For that very reason, the movie also earns points for refusing to cater to the audience's expectations for a stereotypical, copout ending.<br /><br />As Ryan, George Clooney really makes his rugged good looks and laid back charm work for him in this role, and Anna Kendrick and Vera Farmiga, as the two women in his life, match him every step of the way in their performances.<br /><br />Given the hard economic times in which we live, \\"Up in theAir\\" could not be more topical in its treatment of unemployment and the devastating effect it has on the people who suffer the ravages of it.  The movie may not blow you away as other social dramas do, but it will get you to thinking about your own life - and provide you with a few good laughs to lighten the load.eatment of unemployment and the devastating effect it has on the people who suffer the ravages of it.

0786868724|5.0|Of course Mitch Albom is a great writer.  We've been reading his stuff for over 25 years.  We lived in the Detroit area and were privileged to have him as a sportswriter.  But he is indeed so much more.    This book explores faith in such a different and touching way.  It is beautifully written and will tug (? yank) at your heartstrings as Mitch looks at his faith and compares his Jewish background with a marvelous Christian minister in inner city Detroit.    You see, he's been asked by his childhood Rabbi to deliver his eulogy.  He thinks he'd better get to know the Rabbi before attempting this formidable task.  The result is this book. I'd love to sit with Mitch and discuss his experience.  He draws you in with his honesty and keeps you reading way past your bedtime.    Both my husband and I feel this is the best book of the year and perhaps the best we've ever read.  I hope you enjoy it too.

031606792X|5.0|I am probably one of the older readers of this series of books. I would like to see the series extended. As for Breaking Dawn, it just is the BEST of the series. However, you have to really read all the other three books to appreciate this one. There is nothing boring in this book, not one thing. I cannot believe anyone would find it borning, if they read the three books prior. I almost blew it, when I picked the book up, and read a few pages, getting hooked on the fourth book. Thanks to my Grandson, I was informed no, no, no, not that one. It is the fourth book. LOL I stopped reading and started with the first book, Twilight. I am curious how they can make a movie with all the things that need to be said and shown in a movie to accurately reflect this book.

B0015DYIH2|5.0|ok Im starting to get a little worried about myself. I have become so consumed by this whole twilight thing its embarassing. When I first heard about the books I just wrote it off as some kinds of teenage type books.  After I saw the second movie new moon. I started reading the books. I was so captured by the it was so seducing the way Edward said I dont have the strength to stay away from you anymore. Oh my gosh who says that! These books are the most erotic I have ever read without anyone having sex. It really is not for teenagers that dont have the experience to realize what they are reading. That is why us older women just swoon over Edward. He says everything every woman would ever want to hear. It is so seductive. It is hard for me to break away. I am on my second reading of all the books now. Do all young adult authors write this way? What have I been missing?   Guys tell me is anyone out there as good as Stephanie Meyer at this? Man, it has really flipped my switch. It even made me look at my marriage in a whole different way. Never has a series of books affected me quite like this. More so the books than the movies. The actors in the movies are so immature they dont even get it.
B001BKG9SK|5.0|I was weaned on Pink Floyd but have just come to appreciate how great David Gilmour is as a musician and live performer.  This set will leave Floyd fans with a new appreciation of his overall skill set (I know it did for me!).  Don't be misled by those that pan On an Island - it is a fantastic album which was introduced to me via this live set.  Buy this if you are a Gilmour fan and you won't be disappointed in the least.
0812550706|5.0|This book is truly wonderful.  Scott Card has created a true classic in this, the first of the Ender Quartet.      First off, Card's style is magnificent.  I've heard complaints that his style is too blunt, too direct.  However, in addition to this style making him a master of dialogue, it lends his writing an immediacy hard to find in other books.  You travel with the characters, trade punches as they do, and this makes the blunt and direct nature of the book totally worth it.    Second, the plot is enthralling and completely engrossing.  The novel is well paced as Card walks us through Ender's beginning struggles, his painful descisions concerning his leaving his home and those he loves, his arrival at Battle School, and the way he progresses there.  The end is astonishing, shocking, and unexpected, and yet it all becomes obvious that Card planned this all the way through, and the clues were there for those astute enough to find them.    And finally, Ender's personal journey was inspiring and thought provoking in itself.  When you take genius kids and make them fight wars, humanity comes to its worst, best, and strongest.      I definetly reccomend this book to all those seeking cool action scenes, good dialogue, and a deeply ingrained sense of humanity.
B000ZELISO|5.0|Firstly, I am tired of everyone wanting the movies to be exactly like the books. No movie based on any book is an exact replica. And people should be used to the fact that none of the HP movies have included everything from the book... including the first two shortest books.    I believe the viewer needs to distance themselves from the books before entering the theater or putting any of the HP discs in their home theater. Movies and books are different, and should be treated as such. Now, I am a huge Harry Potter nerd and read at least the book the movie is based on before entering the theater (sometimes I read all the subsequent books) but this is for my own enjoyment. Yes, I compare what is different. But a good movie is a good movie. And Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is that.     Hands down this is the best Harry Potter film, even with the book-slashing changes. The kiddos are growing up not just in the story and real-life, but their acting skills have improved immensely, which makes this film easier for an adult-fan to enjoy. There's a lot of comedy relating to teen romance and crushes. I personally thought Lavender Brown was a great addition and does a great job showing how it feels to be a teen and in love. You delve deeper into the Dark Lord's history through Dumbledoore's memory and experience. And it's action-packed from the beginning. In addition, casting Jim Broadbent as Professor Slughorn was genious--he deserves an oscar nod. Malfoy has a more prominent role, as does Professor Snape.    People who haven't read the books may be confused. I found myself explaining some of the details left out to my younger sisters (after they asked me) who find the books boring. But they would have been fine had I not been there. Honestly, I was shocked by some of the absent book parts, but not anymore shocked than I felt after seeing the other movies.    This is my favorite Harry Potter film (previously the Prisoner of Azkanban had been my favorite). Now, I do wonder how they are going to explain a lot of important stuff in the final installments, but perhaps that is why they finally decided to do two parts--one part for book seven, and the other part to tie all the strings together, but combine them so they work as one? Yes, they should have planned better, but the books were only just finished in the summer 2007.    So go out and enjoy this movie as a movie, not as a movie made from a book.
