B004MC8CA2|5.0|My favorite feature is being able to view parallel versions and to change which versions to view together. Really great.
B0063M22QO|4.0|It's a great memory game. Even my daughter likes to play it. Have gotten some people addicted to it as well.
B0053FANRC|4.0|I like how its in Tokyo and its not really racing it &#34;Drifting Style&#34;. It's funny that the kid from a America has to learn about what is Drifting and how to do it successfully.
B00013M6NK|4.0|Good battery, doesn't quite have the capacity of original but for the price it's worthwhile and an excellent backup.  Great value
B00B4FU6KE|3.0|I couldn't get through it, I am a huge animal lover and some of the cruelty described about the testing of animals was too much for me.  Well written, good story line, but again, I couldn't finish it, I know, a very mixed review.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I've never played a found object game before, this one has me up late!  I think the mouth movement is hilarious, like old Japanese voice dubbing!
B000JQUZCI|4.0|Very good classic reading. Dark characters and timely narrative using epistographic style. Highly recommended for any vivd reader. Probably not for younger readers.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|It works but I find it to have too many ads. I think this software needs to get rid of some ads.  No longer working on my kindle.
B004KPQK2S|5.0|It's been out for a while, but I was glad to finally see it for myself! Love the realistic family drama in it.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Great read.  This book really is for everyone, yes everyone.  Ok this might spark major debate, make it required reading for schools....let the debates begin:).  I gave this book to high school and college graduates this summer.  I wish I had it twenty plus years ago when I started my career in engineering.  I have worked in male dominated environments and have had my share of unpleasant encounters.  By far, my most difficult encounters were with women in my office.  It baffled me and quite frankly hurt. I will be sure to arm my one daughter and three sons with this knowledge before they leave the nest.  Until we really face and address the sexism and racism that plagues  our workplace/home/country we will not reach our full potential as a nation.
B001NOQI3U|4.0|Love the story AND the music!  However, it kept pausing about every 15 minutes, saying I didn't have enough memory on my Kindle.  Not sure why.
B007GE2H3G|3.0|Since it was done by Spelburg I was disappointed in Tintin. Certainly not a movie for children. The movies characters are all big nosed, which I find to be weird and unattractive except for TinTin himself and his dog Snow. One of the main characters, the ship's Captain, is a drunkard which I found to be annoying and unappealing in a children's movie. I never find drunkiness to be funny as a comicdic form.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Being a fan of Queensryche ever since I got the album Empire. I bought this because I like their music and I don't buy music that much and this album is great.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|At first it was fun to get the levels. When I did all I realized almost ALL the challenges had 4 ways to play for a CROWN! I felt bad when the game ended! But that was before the HD and I got to start over and like a new game because I forgot most I had done before! LOVE THE GAME!
B0089Q1TPM|5.0|I liked this movie and my DVD was showing signs of ware so I decide to up grade to the Blu-ray. The blu-ray is so much better. The pitcher is brighter and the sound is great.
B006ICOK00|4.0|This camera is so easy to use. I have shot several test videos to find the best playback quality. That is my best advice, just shoot at different angles and frame rates and find what is best for you. The playback in Windows is a snap. Have fun!
B000W453KQ|5.0|Love the movie, never seen it before! I would love to buy the movie sometime soon. Thanks for option of streaming it.
B0084HJE0S|4.0|Very good clarification of the future for JavaScript and HTML5.  After reading this you will understand how these languages tie together under asp.
B002GHHHP6|1.0|Wrong region, do not buy in United States. I purchased twice and got the wrong region both times. After the first mistake I contacted amazon and they assured me I would get th correct DVD the second time. I did not, I strongly recommend you do not buy this.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|so cool teaches kids responsible and what it takes to own a horse. It sure took my Knowsley to a mother level.
0385523386|2.0|When I picked up this book from my local library, I was hoping for a book that detailed the daily rituals of life in a women's prison.  I would have liked to have seen some diary style entries and some coherent stories that flowed together in a chronologic and cohesive manner.<br /><br />This book was, sadly, none of these things.  I found the author to be smug, whiny, and wholly unlikeable.  She never lets you forget that she is blond, white, well educated, and good looking.  Her biggest problems in prison seem to be that she is too popular with her prison cohorts and her friends on the outside.  She gets \\"embarrassed\\" by the amount of mail and books she receives.  She has so many more than the allowed 25 approved visitors on her list but luckily for her because she is blond, white, educated, and good looking she is allowed to have as many people on her list as she wants.  She bemoans all of the stupid prison rules, the crappy food, her cubicle in the \\"ghetto\\" dorm, and that she had to wait months to buy a pair of crappy headphones.  The author seems to have a hard time understanding that she is in prison and that prison sucks.<br /><br />I hope that someone writes a much better book about life inside a women's prison because this book was terrible.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I know very little about this game I have not seen my granddaughter play this so I guess she would rate it high.
B00A50PBEA|5.0|This updated version of the old favorite is excitingly original and gives you renewed pleasure in revisitng the classic. I agree with other reviewers who raved about the Queen of the Night scene.  However, unless you are familiar with the story, it will be hard to follow as there are no subtitles to clarify the sung English libretto.  Moreover, even if you are an opera buff, Stephen Frye and Kenneth Branagh have taken liberties with the original.  Their genius only burnishes the magic of Mozart's Flute!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it's amazing, simple,  and most of all useful when there's a problem on your math homework that you can't figure out no matter how many times you try to redo the problem.:)) I would highly recommend it over all the other calculator apps!!!! :))
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This was a gift to my sister who absolutely loved it.  She was so thrilled that I sent it to her, but I was thrilled that<br />it got there so quickly.  Perfect service for the Perfect Gift.  Thank you
B00CFO7PK2|4.0|For those seeking a more pop-jazz format like Buika had in previous albums, you may be a bit disappointed. Was more of a jazz-flamenco-fusion in this album than others. I enjoyed it, but it might've been nice to have a slightly straight forward version of La nave del olvido. Still, it was interesting and fresh.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Like so many iPad owners, I couldn't figure out why the USB charger in my car didn't charge my iPad 3.  That's because and iPad needs at least two amps and most built in car chargers are only one amp.  This little gem has two outlets.  One is 2 amps and designed specifically for Apple and it has plenty of power for my iPad.  I tried it out and it recharged my iPad nicely in a couple of hours.  I now use it with my iPhone, too and it really speeds up the charging on it.  It's nice, looking, too.  I have two of them now.
B009MYARIK|5.0|Great story from Sophie Kinsella. I'm a big fan of humor romance and love stories, and I loved this one.  I've enjoyed most of her stories.  Worth the money and time
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I've read complaints about the puzzles being too hard or too easy the game has too much talking, etc. But, it's just plain fun. I played Mysteryvile 2 (another FAOTD by Nevosoft) and it was just as hokey, but just as fun. So, don't let the haters keep you from trying this game. It really is lots of fun!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|My 10 year old gives it 3.5 stars, and my 7 year old gives it 5 stars, they seem to enjoy it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not believe how shocked I was at how compelling and exciting this book was for me. At first I couldn't believe what I was reading. Then as the book went on I was trapped by the thought process of both parties in this unusual hunt. Surprised and exciting experience in reading.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|A joy to watch and the imagery is vivid.  All the characters are especially believable for children and the story keeps their attention.
1451696191|4.0|It took me a month to read this small book. That's not exactly accurate. In actuality, I read this before bed over 3 nights...a little at a time. Those three nights were really spread out. It's not that I didn't like the book, the writing or the characters. I actually really liked all of them. It's that I wasn't in a place in my life for a book with this \\"tone\\".<br /><br />There's a dark cloud hanging over all of the characters. They are all wonderful, lovable people. But they all real life problems and concerns. The writing, for me, was so real that it was just hitting too close to home.  It's summertime!  I want to be happy and cheery!  That just goes to show how good the author was at developing his characters and his story.  So real!<br /><br />I'm going to straight out admit that I saw the movie first. That's not something that I usually do. I have so many books on my \\"to read\\" list that I thought it would take forever to get around to this one, my husband wanted to watch the movie, etc. Then it was picked for my book club about 2 months after seeing the movie. Far enough that it's not totally fresh in my mind but not far enough away to be forgotten.<br /><br />I felt the movie followed the book a lot better than most do. My book club was split between those that saw the movie first and those that read the book first. There are two major downfalls to having seen the movie first. Apparently, those that didn't say they pictured Sam totally different in their mind. Also, you already know Charlie's secret that he doesn't even know himself.<br /><br />So, without giving away any spoilers and to stop my rambling...this book was beautiful. It will make you smile and weep, even at the same time. If possible, read it before you see it. Unlike most book to movies, it doesn't totally ruin it if you already saw the movie so read it anyway.
B004SVM7BW|5.0|I tested 6 PDF viewers before choosing this one and chose Repligo because it does a better job caching. We have some huge documents to view and don't want to keep waiting for the image to pop up when we display the page.<br /><br />It does take a moment to pre-cache the document but after that you can read the document pretty much smoothly.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I had just downloaded this book on my Kindle (best  $3.99 I ever spent)  when a 16 year old friend, who's a voracious reader asked me if I'd ever read the book or heard of the author.  She told me it was the best book she'd ever read and that she read it straight through in four hours without stopping except to refresh her kleenex supply.  I was honestly not thrilled about the subject matter since I have a special needs grand daughter and spend a lot of time in the company of these amazing children who are dealing with extraordinary adversity.  I was, however, very happy that I'd purchased this book once I began the journey and that was the case throughout, to the end.  The characters have been tagged by some of the other reviewers as not being typical of teenagers but they've obviously not spent time with many young persons bearing the heavy burdens of cancer, CP, MS, etc.  This is a gritty look at the hardships involved for the children and the parents of terminal illness, yet first & foremost, it's a love story which transcends your expectations.  Love of self, love of that one special person many times described as our soul-mate and love of parents who sacrifice daily to care for these special children.  It's all here in what is obviously a fictional representation of the reality of many.  Bravo,  Mr. Green.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Beautiful writing again, did not want it to end. Looking forward to his next novel. Unbelievable skill and wordsmithing, so real
B00CATSONE|5.0|I really enjoyed this short book. As a teacher I want to inspire my students. This is very compatible to Carol Dwecks book called Mindset. Imagination plus hard work is essential for success. Pam Young
B001K3KK0Q|5.0|I gave the move 4 stars  because of the story plot and I also love Robert Redford and Mia Farrow. I think they are very good actors. It was a movie about hope and  a tragic love. I would recommend this movie to all who want to see a good love story.
B00AHHODH2|2.0|I was completely suckered in by the end of the first chapter and was looking forward to the rest of the book.  It went downhill from there.  There wasn't one character I cared about; not one I would have wanted to know. I kept reading, hoping it would get better.  It didn't.
B004P8A7J2|5.0|Depressing accurate! One of the best movies, for anyone who has been on drugs, or knows anyone who has a problem with drugs.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Loved this book! Could not put it down.  This is my favorite novel of his thus far. I highly recommend.

B00DJFIMW6|1.0|reviews look awesome but sadly I haven't been able to play the game. I downloaded it, watched the cute little video, then it gets stuck on a loading page. sat there for almost half and hour, uninstalled and re installed...but still cant play it. how unfortunate.
B005PWPUW6|5.0|This works perfectly for connecting my flatscreen tv with my wireless headphones. (Optical audio cable not included)<br />I would recommend to anyone.
B002H3T3TM|5.0|I had the dvd and have played it over and over.......the Blu-ray is like your sitting in the concert with him.......Love it....A MUST buy!
030758836X|1.0|The characters are not likable; few people would stay in their marriage.  Their actions are unrealistic.  The guy, under suspicion, does things that nobody under suspicion would ever do.  I can't read this amateurish book about those distasteful characters.
B00A6X9Z8E|4.0|I like this CD. Just wish there were newer songs on it.  They are her greatest hits just nothing real new.  Also has a Christmas song on it which is alittle weird since its August.
B008TT7CXW|5.0|Simple, awesome product. Very slim, durable, and solid. Cards seem to &#34;click&#34; into place. Nice to have 2 full size SD slots and 4 micros.
B0089LOG02|4.0|This book was wonderful. I learned a great deal, laughed, cried and recommended it to friends who also enjoyed it.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Engaging characters, smart writing, intriguing plot twists - what is not to like?  A great series for binge watching or slow and steady enjoyment.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|When I first got this game I thought it would be dumb but it is trickier than I thought it would be fun to play. You definitely need to try it. It is fun and harder than I thought it was gonna be.
B00847KFDS|5.0|I heard him talk about his album, saw him in the band w his son, so I sent ti to my ex husband who collects tons of CDs he loves it! thanks for having such a fabulous range of everything available to us!

B001NHNG64|4.0|This Jack Reacher novel is a political thriller, dealing with the politics of extremist militia groups.  I liked having a strong female character who partnered with Reacher and like that both &#34;save the day&#34; at different points in the story - not just a damsel in distress story.  As with the first Reacher novel, this story has very quick pacing, with no wasted storylines.  It is one action packed cliffhanger after another, but in an enjoyable way.  I did sometimes have trouble keeping track of who's who's as the action picked up and more characters were involved in each scene, but this is a small quibble.  I enjoy the Reacher novels when I want to jump completely into an exciting thriller with an interesting angle to &#34;the bad guys&#34;.  Great for a rainy weekend!
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I would like the old app back.  The new app is not as friendly user as the old one.  Look for a more user friendly app.

0385341008|4.0|Juliet Ashton, writer, goes to Guernsey to interview people for an article she's writing. Immediately, she falls in love with the area and the people there. She sets out learning what the The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is, how it began and each of the members. One by one they talk to Juliet about the books they have read and their experiences when the Germans took over their island in WW11. This story is told through letters between Juliet, the Society members and Juliet's friends in London. It's a wonderful idea. We get a much deeper feel for each member than if Juliet just talked about them and Mary Ann Shaffer laces the story with charm and gentle wit. If you like character studies, you will love this book.
B003NEQ75W|4.0|It's good to be able to get hold of a quality DVD of this after years of trying to catch it on TV. I first saw this as a youngster and while it hasn't stood the test of time perfectly, it's still an imaginative and original comedy horror caper.<br /><br />Grace Jones, one suspects, was one of the central selling points for the film originally, but while she does a fine job (mostly non-speaking) of leading a coven of blood sucking harpies, it's other elements of the film that hold the attention. The set design and lighting are both imaginative. It might not be the only film from the 1980s to have used pink and green neon lights, but it's certainly a fine example of how to make the city by night even more alien and disorientating.<br /><br />Following on from this, the way the neighbourhood around the After Dark club is set up as something of a world unto itself is a nice touch. The seedy hotel, the diner, the grungy street gangs who somewhat confusingly seem to be both vampires and in conflict with vampires at the same time... Taking this further, the vampires' backstory is mentioned in a scene towards the end of the film, although like the characters, is never really properly developed.<br /><br />Still, the film has at least some kind of, er, logic to it. Vamp is mainly about visual style, and when you add in the fact that Keith Haring contributed to the look of some of the club scenes (Grace Jones' body paint), it's fair to say that this is a quintessential 80s horror film: All fangs and no knickers!
1853261580|5.0|*****  An amazing book for all ages! The Little Prince has come to earth to try to solve the problem of a baobab grown too big on his planet. He comes upon a man fixing his broken plane 1,000 miles from any habitation. Through asked (and some answered) questions, the man and the prince learn everything they need to know about what is important in life and why. This is an extraordinary book, one of 20 or so that belong in everyone's library.<br />The wonderful minimalist illustrations by the author are completely appropriate for this tale.
B0063FQREO|4.0|I wanted to see this film after seeing the trailer on telly. That's not usually reason enough, but it seemed to have crept into my subconscious... The film is well acted, well directed, and based on a popular and well conceived novel, so far as I can make out. There are two things that elevate the film from this to four star status.<br /><br />The first is the production design. The dystopian future is realised as a cross between Nazi Germany and renaissance France. The social divisions are drawn in a way that makes the central theme - the hunger games themselves - both more believable and more frightening.<br /><br />This brings us on to the second thing. The whole idea of the games, the inevitability, the ruthlessness, the horror, comes through in a way that creates a pervading sense of dread. It's not a horror film per se, but the idea of being part of a society both so venal and so callous, is somehow more horrifying than masked slashers or killer aliens etc.<br /><br />A clever, absorbing film that lingers in the memory.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|A great read, and havent gone into the series yet, but if they are like this one, ill have a stellar time.
0765348276|4.0|In the future, mankind has finally spread out into the stars.  Humans from overpopulated countries around the world taking to the stars routinely to found colonies on numerous worlds.  There has been no new \\"renaissance\\" from this otherworldly exodus on mother Earth however.  No change in the sociopolitical norms.  Nothing different in the daily life of an average citizens of the United States or any other industrialized country.  Indeed, most pay little attention to the news that comes from beyond the globe.  It does not affect their daily lives, which revolve around the normal things:  getting married, going to work, raising children, and hoping to have enough savings to enjoy their old age.<br /><br />And, really, there is no need for people of Earth to concern themselves with \\"out there\\" anyway.  That is what  the Colonial Defense Force (CDF) does.  It manages and controls everything to do with other world colonization.  It is their bureaucrats who decide upon the individuals who take to the stars.  Their space station which orbits the Earth.  Their skip drive ships that leave from that station to transport both people and materials out into the vastness of space.  The CDF even controls the flow of information from those colonies back to mother Earth.  Under their supervision, the spread of mankind to the stars has become almost hoo-hum; nothing to get excited about at all.<br /><br />The only time when a citizen of a rich country even concerns themselves with the CDF is at age seventy-five.  For at that age, you have finally become old enough to join the colonial armed forces.  Why sit at home, feeling death creeping up upon you, and using up valuable resources when you could join the proud, the few, the colonial defense force!.  You'll never see Earth again, but in return, you will experience the unknown wonders of the galaxy and be given back your youth.  How the CDF restores you back to twenty years old is a mystery, but it is a great incentive for seniors to get out of their recliners and head to their local CDF recruiter.<br /><br />John Perry is one of those seniors who sees nothing for himself on Earth but a countdown to the grave.  His beloved wife has already died, his only son is grown, and hanging around to be a granddad on traditional holidays doesn't hold any allure.  Thus, he heads off to the CDF to see something of the colonies and - more importantly - to recapture his lost youth.  Maybe his second chance at life will produce as much happiness as his first trip did.<br /><br />Once he rockets off into space for the nearest human colony, John begins to understand exactly what he has signed up for.  The CDF was not lying when they intimated that he would be given back his youth.  However, his old, worn out body must be discarded for a young, superhuman body that has been thoroughly tested and patented by the CDF technology division.  This new body is genetically modified and enhanced by nano-technology and alien dna.  (Not to mention that it is green.)  But the worst part is that all these modifications of his frail, human form have been made for the simple reason that otherwise he would have no chance to survive his tour of duty in the CDF!<br /><br />The galaxy is a very dangers place if you are a human, John learns.  The CDF has been guarding the Earth all these centuries, protecting it not only from the aliens' menace but also from the realization that the majority of the galaxy views mankind as a tasty snack.  An animal to be  captured, breed, fattened up and then savored at dinner with a nice, white wine.  That is why the CDF has hidden the truth from people on Earth.  Why they only recruit old people who have already had a chance to live their life.  The reason John Perry and his friends \\"The Old Farts\\" onboard their outbound ship have to shed their ignorant bliss and become soldiers.  Because now that Earth is in the rear view mirror, they are not on top of the food chain anymore!<br /><br />I'm surethis sounds eerily similar to Heinlein's Starship Troopers for many of you, but Old Man's War is very different than that revered novel.  Scalzi's work would be better labeled a military science fiction novel for readers who do not like reading military fiction or trying to understand scientific theory.  Oh, there is a bit of both here: chapters dealing with military training and skirmishes and others where \\"theoretical\\" explanations are given to some basic, future technology.  However, Mr. Scalzi never spends much time with either subject, merely introduces enough information to keep you in the \\"know\\" and continuing on with the story of John Perry.<br /><br />And a wonderful story it is.  John Perry quickly becomes one of those ordinary guys who turns into a natural \\"hero,\\" not because he is gifted above his friends or finds some alien technology that gives him an edge but because he uses his wits and is lucky.  He alternates between grieving for his beloved wife who died years ago to being a good friend to the other \\"Old Farts\\" whom he met on his recruitment ship to trying to survive as a grunt in the trenches of a war with countless aliens.  Mr. Scalzi writes each facet of our heroes story superbly, making a reader both understand and empathize with him all along the way.<br /><br />Of course, there are problems with this novel; there always are.  Here Perry becomes the person who always has the epiphany which saves the day.  He is the guy who always survives the grenade event though he was closest to it.  The foot soldier that is honored by his enemies even though he is a nobody in the trenches.  When a  plot line late in the novel involves a person from John's past, it doesn't surprise anyone that once again fortune has smiled upon him.  Simply put, it is good to be John Perry in Old Man's War, and that does distract from the overall tone of the narrative a bit.<br /><br />Even with these annoyances, Old Man's War was a joy to read.  The writing was clear and concise, easy to consume, and John Perry's journey from ignorant, protected Earthman to wise, veteran soldier of the Colonial Defense Force was a joy to read.  I could barely put it down when I read it, and I am sure you will do the same if you give it a try.  So stop reading this review already and go get a copy of the book.this sounds eerily similar to Heinlein's Starship Troopers for many of you, but Old Man's War is very different than that revered novel.

B009DCOU9S|4.0|The game was fun and took a few hours to work through but there is just way too much dialogue. I kept hoping it would give me an edge but it never did so I just skipped through everything and did just fine. I'm glad you can skip, that's why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 3.

B0066WJLU6|5.0|Love it, thanks so much & a life and toe saver when power went out!  Love the versatility and ease of use.
B002XXPNXG|1.0|What more can you do to take a sequel and screw it up completely. What a waste of time this was. Just awful!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|great series fun watching and interesting character development.<br />hope to watch all 7 seasons  . watched while i was out of the state and it was fun
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I was talked into getting this game by all of my &quot;Apple&quot; friends.  It is a lot of fun and is great to play competively with friends.  My only complaint is that it locks up my Kindle and I have to do a hard boot.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|good time sink if you like to play Magic The Gathering. Wish some of the UI with regards to assigning damage were more intuitive
B004GQLJTA|5.0|He requested this video for his birthday and I was more than happy to get it for him.  It's a fun movie and I enjoyed watching it with him.  Looking forward to getting Despicable Me 2 that he wants for Christmas.
B004OZOTSQ|2.0|I might like it if I could figure out how to use it. I believe the concept is great and perhaps I am not enough of a geek to understand how to use it but I doubt very much if I am the only one.
B005HEDI3K|5.0|It's Star Trek - How Could It Be Other Than Great. The HD version of the classic series helps alleviate some of the set restrictions imposed by budget constraints and technology of the day. Data screens and consoles in the background show more realistic displays. The CGI version of the Enterprise and the space it flies in is much improved. But these serve only to lessen the distraction from the classic interplay of Kirk, Spock, Bones and the supporting cast that has become famous through the years. If you are a Trekkie, you are predisposed to love this. If you are a Trekker, you can pay homage to the generation that the Next Generation is &#34;Next&#34; of. If you are neither Trekkie nor Trekker, it is a must watch as there is still hope for you yet.
B00CL8D83U|4.0|Showing nothing if not incredible resilience, Pet Shop Boys continue their third decade with \\"Electric,\\" an album pointed directly at arty dance floors. Coming of the mostly down-tempo chill of \\"Elysium,\\" \\"Electric\\" should thrill old fans who weren't quite sure what to make of the more introspective point of view on that particular disc. Forget that for now. Spinning with the electronic chill of producer Stuart Price (who helped Madonna mine this same field) and the always dry wit of Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe, they just keep the beat pumping and toss in reminders of past glories and all-night parties to come.<br /><br />So when you hear reminders of earlier songs in the likes of \\"Love Is A Bourgeois Construct\\" while Tennant sardonically tells an ex that he's \\"Talking tough and feeling bitter,\\" you know that the Boys are feeling old juices flowing. Even more so, there isn't a slow-down number here. This could almost be mistaken for one of the \\"Disco\\" series of albums in that the pace never lets up. I do miss that moment of reflection that many other Pet Shop Boys albums would sneak in, like \\"Happiness is an Option\\" (from \\"Nightlife\\") or \\"To Speak is a Sin\\" (from \\"Very\\"), which always felt like a moment of deeper thought slipped in between the moments of ecstatic dancing.<br /><br />Where \\"Electric\\" makes up for that in a stunning manner is the album's cover song, \\"The Last To Die.\\" Maybe back in the \\"Born In The USA\\" days, when Springsteen's singles were remodeled into dance mixes would this seem possible, but The Pet Shop Boys take a protest song about the Irag/Afghanistan wars and whip it up as a dance anthem. It is the most subversive thing on the entire album and proof that Neil and Chris have not forsaken the brilliant irony that made classic albums like \\"Very,\\" \\"Actually\\" and \\"Behavior\\" (to this day, \\"Being Boring\\" can bring a tear) on an album that all but dares you to get on your feet.<br /><br />\\"Electric\\" is something of a triumph. It became the Pet Shop Boys' highest American charting album in nearly twenty years (hitting #26, with \\"Very\\" coming in at #20, and their last album, \\"Elysium\\" peaking at #44), and only three other albums charting higher in their whole discography. They've never really gone away, but when you get hit with the line in \\"Vocal,\\" exuberantly proclaiming \\"everything about tonight feels right and so young,\\" it's enough to make you glad that they've stuck to their guns for so long.Boys' highest American charting album in nearly twenty years (hitting #26, with \\"Very\\" coming in at #20, and their last album, \\"Elysium\\" peaking at #44), and only three other albums charting higher in their whole discography.

B0019NG73G|5.0|Gettysburg is blueray was a replacement from a VHS enjoy listing to history war movies I watch it every year around the July 4
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I really like the plot, characters, and the time frame.  I was disappointed with the death of Mathew, as I had not gotten over the death of Sybil. It will be interesting where the story goes in season 4.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I usually do not play hidden object games very often, but when this one was offered as the free app of the day, I decided to give it a try. I am so glad I did! I have really enjoyed the story and games. Easy enough to enjoy, difficult enough to be a challenge.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's not a five star game but it is really good. The constant monthly updates keep it interesting. However when you play the game you really don't run into any tough challenges most of the time you know what's coming up. The obstacles appear over an over again in the same style and often the same place. The developers do a good job disguising the monotony by the monthly updates, the missions, and the hidden items that you have to find a certain amount of every week in order to unlock a cool prize. Competing against your friends on Facebook makes it fun too but once you beat everyone on your friends list it's not very fun anymore. I do love the fact that  You do not need real money to enjoy this game. This game is definitely 4 stars if they would add some turns or some bridges maybe some different scenery and different style trains not just different color trains this could be a 5 star.
B00E8UKY3Q|1.0|Look, I like smurfs.<br /><br />I love the iPhone app, the original French cartoons and comics, and the TV show is good too. What I do NOT like are lame jokes, thinly-masked foul language, poor acting, and no semblance of a script.<br /><br />To me, there is no more embarrassing job than being forced to act with small, computer generated animals. See: Alvin and the Chipmunks (somehow I managed to like that movie), The Smurfs, and Yogi Bear. Watching Neil Patrick Harris, a good comedic actor who had the ONLY funny scenes in the first movie, act like a complete idiot with these CGI creatures crawling around...well, it's just sad.<br /><br />And what about the thinly veiled foul language? &#34;I almost smurfed myself&#34;, &#34;That was ducked up&#34;, &#34;Are you smurfing kidding?&#34;, &#34;holy smurf,&#34; &#34;we're smurfed,&#34; &#34;I really smurfed myself,&#34; &#34;son of a smurf&#34;, &#34;where the smurf are we?&#34; &#34;up the smurfing creek without a paddle,&#34; &#34;smurf me!&#34; and &#34;I'll be smurfed!&#34;<br /><br />You know, before you know it, your kids will be coming home saying &#34;I don't want my smurfing dinner, you smurfing SMURF!&#34; What would you reply to that?<br /><br />In conclusion, and to speak in a more relevant fashion, Smurfs 2 is pure smurfing smurf. I wouldn't smurfing watch this smurf if my smurf was on fire. It's just smurfity smurf smurf, and what a smurf it smurfing is! I give this 1 Smurf out of 5 Smurfs.<br /><br />PROS: I guess the least demanding of all kids will like this. Better take them to see this then 2 Guns. And Neil Patrick Harris and Hank Azaria are game as usual. And fans of the first movie will like it too. Just not any one who fancies themselves a fan of good cinema.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is a good game to play and its really fun. You should play it to.l! Its great for all horse lover's.
B00E8S2GJI|5.0|WHAT WILL WE SEE IN THE EXTENDED EDITION:<br /><br />1. More of DALE, including the BLACK ARROWS. Director Peter Jackson mentions a previously unseen character: \\"Girion, who is defending [the city of] Dale using black arrows against Smaug. And the black arrows play a part in an ongoing story, for they are the one thing that can pierce the dragon's hide.\\"<br /><br />2. More king of the wood elves; THRANDUIL. Peter Jackson: \\"There are also issues with Thranduil. We get some of the reason why he and the dwarves had a falling out - to do with these white gems...\\"<br /><br />3. More of HOBBITON. Producer Phillipa Boyens: \\"You are going to get more of Hobbiton. We always wanted to wend our way through Hobbiton, but in the end Bilbo has to run out of the door.\\"<br /><br />4. The OLD TOOK'S PARTY: In which we see a younger Gandalf meet Bilbo Baggins as a young child, convincing the wizard of the young hobbit's bravery and courage. I won't spoil it for you, but it involves a dragon and a bit of magic.<br /><br />5. Dwarf antics at RIVENDELL. Peter Jackson: \\"You are going to get some serious Dwarvish disrespect of the elves at Rivendell.\\"<br /><br />6. The SONG of the GOBLIN KING. Producer Fran Walsh: \\"You are going to get more Goblin Town, and the Great Goblin singing his song. It is a great song, but it was just another delay in terms of moving the story along.\\" Peter Jackson: \\"A number one hit from the Goblin King. Barry Humphries is going to rise up the charts!\\"<br /><br />Well, all looking good on these fronts! The roads lead ever on and on...
B00DU74U74|4.0|The storyline is really amazing and the actors new and fresh. Thank you Stefanie Meyers for another wonderful story with all it's turns and surprises. Are we alone in this universe????
B00CEQ1JOO|5.0|Granddaughter wanted this doll and she loves it. Glad that I was able to buy her before the stores in our area of Berkekey, Calif. had her in stock.
B002APU580|5.0|What can you say? The 1940 version is still my most favorite version of this Jane Austin novel and this 2005 my favorite remake. Both versions are wonderful and make my heart skip a beat every time I watch them. Who doesn't want a Mr. Darcy in their lives?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|As soon as my friend showed me this game i could not put it down. But the real cool part is that it is free!
B00AYDC5HY|3.0|I was disappointed in this movie. The premise is good, but the story is not developed well. It drags in places
B004ZQBOK0|5.0|Sound quality is amazing, lyrics were correct in the booklet, it helped me realze something that I need to blog about on youtube..Controversial topic.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Janet Robinson<br />This book had a lot of twists and turns. Kept you wanting to read to find out the end.
B000VWYNNW|4.0|After all these years I think that these live Zep tracks still hold up real well. Yes, I know that Plant was not at his pentultimate best, but damn, he still sounds good! For those that are outraged at Page's editing of some songs (see No Quarter), get over it! It still rocks, and brings back some great memories of days gone past. Also, nice addition of new tracks (The Ocean, Misty Mountain Hop, etc.). Nobody did it better folks!
B005MMY9A8|5.0|I  really enjoyed this movie. It had plenty of action scenes! Watching this movie in HD was great! Thank you.
B0012YYZYK|4.0|The music still holds up, and Page and Plant play the part of Rock and Roll Gods to the tee!
1490313370|5.0|If you are an entrepreneur, or someone who is simply looking for freedom in your everyday existence, 'Choose Yourself' is a game changer. It is, by far, one of the most interesting, matter-of-fact, honest books I have read in a long while. I like the 'tell-it-like-it-is' writing style of James Altucher. Everything about you should be exposed to James' ideas and self-care instructions.  The book is filled with practical advise for creating a life you will love.  This book not only shares practical ways to enhance your life, it teaches you 'how to become an Idea Machine'.  We all live in a sea of endless possibilities, James shows us how to tap into that sea and bring our possibilities into manifested reality.<br />\\"Every day is an adventure even though you might not realize the specifics of it until years later.\\"  ~James Altucher
B005QJZ5FA|2.0|I was disappointed by Lana's CD.  The music is such a mix. Some songs  reflect her talents and I enjoyed them..  Some are a mess: an attempt, I suppose, to sound  like today's questionable  hit music. There's no consistency.  Some good ballads.  Some trash.
B00CFA227C|3.0|It's pretty much a traditionally told fairy tale.  Because of some not great reviews, thought it was going to be awful, but really not bad.  Favorite part was seeing solid actors in some of the supporting roles.  Story is missing bits here and there, but it was pleasant enough.  It's Jack & the Beanstalk so most in the audience will know what to expect.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|I AM A CAT LOVER AND THIS MOVIE HAS MADE ME LAUGH SO MUCH. BANDERAS'S VOICE IS PERFECT FOR PUSS IN BOOTS. EVERYONE SHOULD SEE IT AT LEAST ONCE...
B0047WJ12K|3.0|Inception is an exploration of dream science set in the future. There a person's knowledge can be extracted against their will using techniques developed by Dominick (Leonardo DiCaprio). Basically he takes a team of trained dream thieves into a person's dream, then convinces the person in the dream to reveal their secret(s). Sometimes in the dream the person is put to sleep; this sets up a second dreamscape to operate within (hence the need for a dream team). Problem is, when one of the team dies in a multi-layered dream, he or she might never wake up. If all goes well, a big thump (&#34;kick&#34;) will either awaken everyone or alert them to start wrapping things up. The ultimate inception is five-layers deep and highly charged with action and drama. Will Dominick succeed, thereby being reunited with his children? Or will he fail and drift into Limbo forever while dreaming he's free? We gotta pay to find out!
B00D0OR5EC|4.0|Unlike the dramatic (and wonderful) narrative movie of the same title, Susanna Kaysen's book is a collection of little vignettes sprinkled with her intelligent self-examination and philosophical musings. It can be read in small chunks, each of which is thought-provoking. I particularly appreciated her characterizations of the therapists, who weren't any saner than Ms. Kaysen (and that's perfectly realistic given that a significant percentage of people enter the study of psychiatry/psychology for a better understanding of their own maladjustments.) I wish this book was about twice as long, because I read it in a single short sitting and found myself wanting more. Oh, and as to the diagnosis of &#34;borderline personality - recovered,&#34; I shared that diagnosis and don't understand it any better than Ms. Kaysen and perhaps her therapists do. I think it represents the intelligent, sensitive person who questions the world around her and finds it wanting.
B0035S996U|3.0|An O.K. Classic.  It's was great way back then , but  by todays standards it's better to stick to the memories ....
B005D0RDKW|5.0|Excellent renditions to some of their greatest hits set on a Cleveland stage. Like the functioning washing machines in the background.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|I was looking online for educational games for kids, and this popped up! So I went to my Kindle immediately and downloaded on my device. My 5 yr old LOVED it. He played it for all of his daily thirty minute Kindle time! I decided to even push it up to an hour since he keeps begging me for more time! Whenever my son sees more to download, I get it for him. He's even saving up from his allowance to buy more games! He certainly loves it, and I've even caught myself playing a few times....
B00B935SUY|5.0|The whole family watched it beginning to end with great interest.<br /><br />Maybe the one fault I'd find in it is that it seems to go abruptly from how great the Studio A space was to this great mixing board.<br /><br />All the different bands that made great works of art there along with the studio's satff nicely tied everything together though.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love that it lets me accumulate my lives! This game is very entertaining! You will have a lot of fun with it.
140006922X|1.0|Shocker that the Muslim Aslan wrote a book discrediting Jesus as divine that is an entire rewrite of what the Bible says. Yes, it generated a reaction.<br /><br />Imagine if a Christian had written that Mohammed was a fraud. We already know that answer. Even the guys from \\"South Park\\" got death threats just for depicting Mohammed.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I tend not to subscribe to  &#34;pack leader&#34; hype so did not read this when everybody else was.To be perfectly honest I never intended reading this book at all but I'm  pleased I did.<br /><br />I read my first erotica novels about three months ago more out of curiosity than anything else. Even though I read titles billed as raunchy and dark, I was for the most part hugely disappointed that few moved me in any way at all. In fact reading the stock exchange report was more entertaining in comparison.<br /><br />Frankly I simply didn't understand what all the genre fuss was about. My own sex life which I would hardly describe as &#34;on the edge&#34; was far more exciting than what I was reading.<br /><br />I decided to read Fifty Shades because I was curious to find out whether it would be as bland. It certainly isn't.  Many may think it's easy to capture sexual tension using words but I don't believe it is.  Compare this work with most others and the difference is staggering.<br /><br />I guess the greatest impact for me has been realising that in this easy to self publish world we now live in, it's becoming more and more difficult to find genuine quality to read, no matter the genre. Unfortunately the Internet is incredibly polluted by far too many slick marketers  touting crap for a buck.<br /><br />I fully understand why this book created the stampede it did and what a shame it led to so much rubbish in its wake.
B003TTMFCK|5.0|Never watched this show till this year and we are powering through all the seasons.  Up to season 7 and the writing is very consistently good.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|There is not much to say except I read thus book in one day not even and that is how much I lived it .....I was getting frustrated with the characters but it was well worth the end.
159463176X|5.0|This takes &#34; The Kite Runner&#34; up a notch in my opinion. It is just a great read for those who should understand a different culture and life. Have been recommending it to all may friends.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is a wonderful book to read.The DR. that the story is about has been given a view of the future  of life after death so beautiful .He  also had people to be able to tell him what happend threw everything that his his body went threw.And the most wonderful experience was to understand what a real family was to have and was told by the heavenly voice to tell him that he has that.His Family was with him always threw it all. Read this and remember the Lord is always there.Thank you I will read this over again and really experience a wonderful time.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I see no practical use for this App. It shows pictures of levels that users who would need hints and tips, like me would be able to reach in a life time.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|This New Superman was a big movie and I was Literally Blown Away at how Awesome and Action Packed it was,also the Acting was Pretty Good to and as for the guy who plays General Zod he was Good at Playing Him but I forget what his name is and the Special Effects were Pretty Awesome as well as the StoryLine,now as for the Girl who plays Lois Lane she was Blonde and I thought she really didn't look the part but hey the whole movie was BADASS! and im giving it 5 Big Thumbs Up.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very entertaining and creative. I have a note 2. Works great.  My whole family plays this game and all enjoy it.
B00B9LNLTQ|4.0|80's pop meets the Velvet Underground. Kinda reminds me of the Talking Heads first album. One song sounds suspiciously like Ah Ha's &#34;Take On Me&#34;. A decent album. More similar to Angles then their earlier stripped down garage rock sound.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|My daughters both love this series.  The talked me into reading them and they are very addictive.  A must read.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|they kinda talk a lot but I like the story. fun game so far. more that just a hidden object game. definitely worth the free download
B005COO1X6|4.0|I liked this single very much. I found it hard to put down. It was a great quick read. Highly recommended
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Great movie form start to finish, the cinematography, each character had a great performance that kept you engrossed with each scene. I can't wait to see the next sequel to this trilogy.  Great job very true rendering of the book.
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|Love the music. It was cheaper to buy the CD used than to pay for all the songs I wanted from ITunes.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|I could not get into this, for me it was to blah, nothing to make me want to figure out the clues, dull!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I love playing the game and I had all these great minions and scores and then I tried to get back into the app and it erased all my scores and minions I was so devastated!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Gator Is missing<br />That's missing alligator some Dino<br /><br />I don't know why but  funny<br />I love those Dion games<br /><br /> I lohve
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I like the game, however I would have given it 5 stars if it worked better on my kindle. great game otherwise!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|a very fun game. nice graphics. all ages suitable, not a difficult game though it goes gradually from easy to difficult
B00AHHODH2|1.0|I ordered this book by mistake while learning to use by new Kindle.  The plot is okay.  The writing is insipid and could have been written by a high school soph.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Can't get enough of this show! Superb writing with excellent acting. Maggie Smith is a hoot! Very very addicting and always looking forward to next season.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I loved the movie. The movie made me laugh as well as cry through the entire movie. I have not gotten &#34;lost&#34; (engaged) in a movie since I was a child in the Saturday matinee.  I lost myself completely in the movie....LOL!!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|It gives me the basics. I find what I need, when I need it. Weather can be simple. Thank you. -
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Love every minute of it! The cast and writing of this show are amazing.  Ready for season eleven would be better with Ziva all season though.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|The app is concise, user friendly and dependable. I refer to it almost daily for daily life and my work. Its one of my few must-haves and its my preferred weather app by far.
B004LWZW24|5.0|I have only bought one DVD in the past 10 years and this is the one. If you watch it alone it will really scare the heck out of you.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The book was very intriguing. I loved it and I am excited for the House of Hades to come out! I will be recommending the series.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|Scott's mind is beautiful and sound. There's wisdom and insight in every chapter. Even though I'm not a vegan myself, Scott defends his eating philosophy in a very honorable way; he never shames people who choose to eat animal protein. In the end, I think that being a vegan makes his journey even more remarkable.<br /><br />This is one of the best books I've read this year.
B008MR1PDE|5.0|GoneMAD is a very capable music player. It efficiently reads and imports music files (including playlists) from your phone's internal or external storage.  It allows you to edit the music files' tags, to customize sorting and many other options in the interface (under \\"Preferences\\"), to create and edit Playlists, and to perform many other useful tasks. In short, GoneMAD is a very robust and versatile player perfect for those with larger music libraries and/or OCD users.
B008220BLG|5.0|This is a good movie. I really like the premise. The violence is on the mild side. The story is well told and actually has a moral.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is worth more than it is but glad it isn't just got on my kindle fire HD<br />And sad it only has 12 Campaign missions but they are long so that's good. There are lots of maps and  multiplayer loads a little slow and lots of weapons and perks(armourand stuff) and military aids(drones turets etc) GET TJIS GAME NOW !!!!!! People NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00A8KJK7G|5.0|Sometimes the love of our pets makes us wish we could do this! A good lesson on why this would not be the best idea. I would not recommend for very young children but those over 9 or 10 could easily enjoy this. Of course, I still cry during &#34;Lady & the Tramp&#34;.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|It has various oral stories about the zombie war, and THE story has a different perspective In every small story WHICH broadens your knowledge. Therefore this makes it a fun book since you can compare different perspectives.
B00AS1Q93S|3.0|I don't know what to say, but going to give it a shot. Well written movie with good action and followed the story to a good degree. But no matter what I saw, Tom Cruise did not make me forget that Jack Reacher is a 6'6&#34;, 225# blond. So much of the books is based on his size and intimidation factor. Cruise is a good, even great, actor but he just doesn't have that vibe. He is more of the &#34;surprise, I am quick and fast and good&#34; fighter, not the &#34;are you kidding me, you really don't want to do this&#34; kind of fighter Reacher has been portrayed in the books.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was amazing, just like the two books before it were. What I loved (and hated really) was all of the deaths. I almost cried when Finnick died. I definitely cried when Prim died. The one thing I didn't like was the fact that Katniss completely cut Gale out of her life.
B009AMAGQM|4.0|Another supernatural movie. I did enjoy it as it wasn't over the top with monsters and violence. Low on the gore element. It did have a good story to it and left the door open for future sequels. Good for older teens.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Good Bye Google Reader, I am so much happier with Feedly. I do not miss Google Reader, thanks to Feedly and DevHD.
B001DF68MA|5.0|Love it. Easy to install and remove.  Our daughter loves riding in it and it's easy to talk to her and point things out
B004MC0FO8|5.0|I use this apps to find out what music everyone is playing.  As I walk around town, businesses, coffee houses and book stores.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is an awesome app runs awesome not glitchy good for keeping the kids occupied<br /><br />Is a great game just relax and play
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|This credible and effective s story explains well the culture changes that are required as the foundation for transformation to a high velocity with high reliability IT change organization. It is not as simple as those tire changing while rolling YouTube videos.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|takes some thinking and observing everything around you. very fun and addictive. did get stuck on level 10,  but found solution on utube.... cant believe I didn't figure it out! lots of fun for all.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Riggs took a &#34;peculiar&#34; topic and spun the most endearing yet suspenseful tale around it.  Filled with unexpected twists & turns, the story draws the reader in and never lets go!  Great for young adults and young at heart!
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|This app works well on the Kindle Fire HD. Make sure you download the correct version in order for it to work properly. There are multiple versions available. I have had no problems with this version since downloading and installing it. This works just like Google does on a regular computer...type your search and choose your item.  What more needs to be said.  A great app. I recommend this to family and friends.
0062238310|5.0|I think that the person who came up with this idea is a genius.  I read through it as though a book.  Because I am hard of hearing I miss some words (the British accent doesn't help either); but reading this script book is wonderful.  I wish they would hurry of with Season 2 and 3 Script books.  Can't understand the delay.
B003QTUQGU|4.0|Different take on the old Alice in Wonderland.  Enjoyable to watch.  Good acting for Depp.  Good scenery for the imagination.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great games to keep you sharp.  I particularly enjoy the challenge of solving the winning games.  Winning them all  is my goal.
B00BC5FN2C|5.0|If you are a political junkie... and who isn't... this is the show for you! Now I have never been a fan of Netflix.. especially when they made that lame attempt to separate video streaming and movie rentals... but I have to say they got this series right. By the recent Emmy nominations it would seem that the critics agree! The plot lines and dramatic twists are superb but by far it is the acting that gives this drama it's credentials. I love all the characters but Kevin Spacey, Robin Wright, Kate Mara, and Cory Stoll carry the show!<br />Whether you have the patience to watch it on a fixed schedule or in the new &#34;binge&#34; viewing that is becoming so popular do NOT miss this series. This is the best drama I have seen in years and I can't wait for season two!
1401938906|5.0|Just started \\"E Squared\\" by Pam Grout and fell in love with the simple but profound explanations of the \\"FP\\" (field of potentialities) and quantum physics. Dense scientific subjects turned into easy to understand concepts. The best part is that you demonstrate to yourself how these principles work - and you experience your own results!<br /><br />As a lawyer, trained to look for (and assemble) evidence, I was immediately entranced by the premise of this book. The subtitle is \\"Nine Do-It-Yourself Energy Experiments that Prove Your Thoughts Create Your Reality.\\" That is a compelling statement of fact that spoke to my \\"attorney mind.\\"<br /><br />The real question is -- do the experiments work as promised?<br /><br />To discover the answer to that question, you will have to jump on over to my blog (kathryneriksen.wordpress.com).<br /><br />For now, take my word for it. If you are interested in learning about the energy that surrounds and connects you, READ THIS BOOK.
B000JMLFLW|4.0|It is hard not to like this classic by Jane Austen. Takes a while to read, but is very good.  All should read this one.
B00932A4XE|3.0|Fun movie to watch as we remember our expecting days of 50 yrs ago and prepare for our 1st great-grandchild in early 2014
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Take the time to watch this, you will not regret it. Start with Season 1 and watch one a night, great entertainment.
B004SVM7BW|3.0|Reading about the app, permisions, &amp; the &quot;most helpful reviews&quot; (Robert reeves &amp; the others) I get why the dev wants to access your full accounts list &amp; you have to be online to use the app. The dev wants you (like bill gates w windows) to purchase a seperate copy of this app for each of your devices (in the EULA). To make sure you do this instead of you getting a serial code or key &amp; making an account for each key they see your accounts. If you try to install the app on 2 or more devices their servers probably see this &amp; may possibly lock the app or stop you from using it in some way.<br /><br />That said Im only giving the app 3 stars, but not due to the app itself which seems great but for the devs greed. This is a pdf app not software to make your device run. True its a great little app. Even parental control or antivirus software devs only make you buy their software once.<br /><br />If you want a nice app have 1 device or you have more than 1 Amazon account &amp; get this on each account as the FAOTD (free app of the day) go for it. Otherwise, if your like me &amp; got the Office suite when it was the FAOTD Id stick w it for reading pdfs or get a diff app until the dev gets over worshiping the almighty dollar.

B00AESN8XY|5.0|Video games could give you any power. However, Plague, Inc. creates a hyper-realistic simulation game that allows you to have any power of infection you could imagine. A great challenge and funny news stories creates a diverse and unique game. Worth $2.99 rather than the inexpensive $.99.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love these type of games.  I just wish there was more levels. I am always looking for more of these types.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love this game great time killer but it does crash sometimes when it loads up otherwise this game is the best well done gameloft !!
B004XD03RK|5.0|Brutal beauty at its best!!!  Chuck was at the height of his majesty... He assembled one of the greatest ensembles ever to record!  I had the immense privilege of witnessing this team of musicians in live performance- I can say in all honesty that I knew I was experiencing something so profound that it bordered on the surreal.  The performance by all members was amazing, and Mr. Schuldiners spirit conveyed tortured brilliance softened by humility and utter gratitude. I had been to hundreds of shows at that point late in 1991, and never had I been so completely absorbed by what I was seeing and most of all, hearing. This re-master does justice to the pinnacle of death metal we know as &#34;HUMAN&#34;!  The performance was unassailable in the first place, and this mix only clarifies the eminence of this singularity in the annals of METAL!!!!!!!!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I LOVED THE  MOVIES BUT NOW THEY HAVE A GAME ITS A DREAM COME TRUE EVERYONE IN MAY HOUSE HAS IT AND COMPETING AGAINST EACH OTHER IS THE BEST. EVEN THE TWO YEAR OLD AND BABY LOVES IT!
B00DAXXO98|5.0|Love the style.  A very different but delightfully evil side of Spacey.  His asides to the audience are really great.
B003LQ3YXU|3.0|It's a little hokey, IMO. I do like the actors, but the writing, sets & special effects have much to be desired. My 9 & 12 year olds thoroughly enjoy it though.
B003ELKNH2|5.0|This is one great movie, of those times and the US involvement in Vietnam. I am of this era, and was in the US Army at the time of this horrible war and conflict. I see this film as a sort of Reunion of all those I served with.
6305511055|5.0|My husband had this movie before but where along the way he misplaced it or loan it out,whatever the case we both enjoyed it
B00COHAUD4|4.0|One of the best, more creepy, sophisticated scary movies I've seen lately.  Jessica Chastain is awesome.  I'd seen her in &#34;The Help&#34; and couldn't believe it was the same actress, she is so versatile.
B001R3YRG2|5.0|My husband can almost tell you the story word for word it just tickles him when he watches this movie,it does hold your interest
B00CF34B2I|3.0|Thought it would be a good deal for $10 but the campaign only lasted hours. The other game modes are fun but I cant connect to multiplayer. Not worth it without having some way to unlock more cards.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|This was a decent game, not super exciting or challenging but a good waste of time. Not something I played for more than about 30 minutes total but probably not for everyone.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|The game is fun and keeps you busy for hours looking for all the things u need to find and to complete your mission.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It takes quite a while to load in the begging but after that it works great!! Great graphics! The only thing ill complain about is the cost of some horses! They cost like 10 gems
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Love  this game !!! But really need to give lots more free plays. Not as much fun when you can only play a couple of hands at a time.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is a great game for everyone who love to bingo or even just play slots. There are daily freebies given based on your progress. Free tournament and daily slots for items. Gifts to and from friends and chat with friends.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|So far it's pretty interesting, I like the searches!<br />I' m intrigued by the mystery of the story&middot; I like the game &amp; Don't want to put it down!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great calculator. It fills the screen on my Kindle Fire. No more squinting at the numbers or symbols. And best of all it's free.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Love this game it makes you use your brain. Makes think about what's going on a must have game. Looking forward to some of your games
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I was delightfully surprised when I saw Star Trek, because I went into the film with absolutely zero expectations. Having not seen a single episode of Star Trek in my entire life I thought that I would be lost confused and even bored for most of the film, even though the spectacular display of graphics seemed at risk overwhelm. Action films can sometimes have the opposite effect on me, becoming so Overstimulating that I actually get so bored I fall asleep. But this film was true to his character, and the casting was superb. Audiences are not only engaged through action but also through the interactions between characters and engaged in storylines that everyone is able to understand even if Star Trek is a new adventure for them.<br /><br />Theres Only one thing to say about the blue Ray product itself: It. Is. Phenomenal.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I had this game back when I had many iPhone and I fell in love with it then. If you love city building games as much as I do then there's no reason you shouldn't fall head over heels for this game. I cannot even say how excited I was when I found out I could get this game for my kindle fire HD because this is one of the few games I missed playing when I swore off all Apple products. Now if only I could get games from last day of work, then my kindle truly would be complete. I hope you find this review helpful and I hope you enjoy this game as much as I do
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|this game is a blast when it is working.  there have been quite a few glitches where the game will freeze while the sound keeps playing on a loop. i have to restart my kindle to get out of the frozen screen.  Today there was some sort of automatic update and now it won't even load past the page with all the minions. tried uninstalling and reinstalling... still no luck<br /><br />please fix. i love the minions
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I LIKE THIS GAME VERY MUCH IT COOL. AND FUN AND I WILL PLAY IT ALL THE TIME AND EVERY DAY WHEN I GET FINISH WITH MY HOMEWORK.
B002APU580|5.0|Great Movie and Love Story! I watch it every chance I get!<br />Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfaden are a perfect match in this movie!
B00AFEY7QO|5.0|Just saw Swing Out Sister in performance locally and it was nice to find this as a reminder - both the CD and the DVD are excellent and the DVD reminds me of their stellar performance.  Corinne is amazing after all these years, and their band is top-notch.  Can't go wrong with this dual set.
B00004C8TC|5.0|This 1973 entry in the short series of 'legends' remastered by Decca at 24 bits fully deserves its inclusion. Lupu was notoriously and increasingly reluctant to make recordings and also to take on concert engagements and this rarity value has been added to his inherent musical value.<br /><br />This disc from early in his recording career is of equal musical satisfaction as his later discs of Schubert for example but, coming from earlier in his career, there is a vitality here as well which was not always so apparent on later discs.<br /><br />Both concertos recorded here have that degree of thoughtful introspection that is a characteristic of his playing. However some listeners, coming to his music making from later in his career, may not always be aware that he had previously tackled more showy repertoire such as the Liszt concertos and with all the necessary bravura. These two relatively early performances therefore display a possibly surprising degree of additional outwardness and technical bravura that is most refreshing and which is  also a basic requirement of such pieces, particularly that by Grieg.<br /><br />Both Previn and the LSO prove to be sympathetic partners and the recording delivers exemplary balance. The 24 bit remastering is completely successful and serves to show just how much more was to be found on analogue tapes and the resultant LPs than could be transferred to the more limited range possible on the early generation CDs.<br /><br />This fine pair of performances, especially in their improved remastering, take their rightful place among other performances of note such as Curzon for the Greig and Cliburn for the Schumann. Others offering the same coupling must include Fleisher, Kovacevich and from more recent times, Andsnes.<br /><br />It is not possible, or a desirable idea, to refer to any recording of such staple repertoire as definitive. However, it is certainly possible to identify those which stand out as of special merit. This disc is certainly one of that elite number.<br /><br />I would therefore suggest that this disc deserves to be seriously considered for purchase by either those looking for a single example of these two concertos or for those collectors of larger libraries who take pleasure in collecting recordings to enjoy alternative performances of the greatest merit.certainly one of that elite number.<br /><br />I would therefore suggest that this disc deserves to be seriously considered for purchase by either those looking for a single example of these two concertos or for those collectors of larger libraries who take pleasure in collecting recordings to enjoy alternative performances of the greatest merit.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Reacher gets himself involved in yet another interesting adventure.  His analytical brain with hie fearless belief in himself is always a great read.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|Original, clever. Great movie all around if you like comic-book feel movies.<br /><br />It's a pretty violent film though so definitely not for kids.
B000JMKNVK|5.0|I love Boston and I love anything Dennis Lehane writes. But when he writes about these two he really shines. The best thing is there is a series so you can enjoy more than one.

B008IJT0CE|5.0|I was really surprised by how many sounds there are in this app. The saved playlists are nice and so is the ability to save your own playlist. Overall great app.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Works great!!It allows me to stream vid @ a place where they blocked Youtube online thru XP etc. WORKS well.
B0080SZ0V8|1.0|It started out fun, but not what I expected later in the game.  I have removed it from my device.
B004UNX1LS|2.0|Im sure for others using better tabs and/or android, it works great. I can not seem to get it to work that great on my org Kindle.
B00DP3IESY|5.0|All the actors are so fabulous, especially american newcomer Andrea Riseborough who is so captivating. Tom Cruise's professional career culminates in this film. Also the views and CG are truly fabulous.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Loved this movie. To see this true life heart warming story was well worth the time. I could feel for the characters.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|I enjoyed this movie a lot.  I rated it 4 stars because it does have bad language throughout and I do not understand the necessity of it. The movie is full of action and heroism.
B00CWVFZ8W|2.0|Nothing too impressive.<br />Why does this require so many words to be written before it will accept my simple review????
B00BVYKWJI|5.0|Fantastic historical drama and writing. Great acting and undeniable chemistry between Cesare and Lucrezia which made it great to watch. Disappointed the show was cancelled.
B005LAII44|1.0|In the first few minutes the rock puts these little glove things on that leave his fingers exposed. They then begin to glow red hot and he is able to melt a fence by just putting his hands near it. The parts that are putting off all that heat are closer to his fingers than to the fence, yet his fingers don't even get singed... The movie just goes down hill from there. While the first GI Joe was a bad movie, it is a work of art compared to this garbage. How did they suck Bruce Willis into this movie?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Grate game cute little guys and very challenging levels to choose from we play it all the time all the kids and adults loveit
B0012HCASA|1.0|Acting was bad, writing was bad, special effects were bad. Don't know how anyone could have watched this. Obviously not may people did, because it did not last very long.
B00AFPTSI0|4.0|I am an avid reader of books, specifically books on personal and corporate  leadership.  Every now and than a book emerges  that paints reality in a way that few had ever contemplated before.  If you want a fresh perspective, and, dare I say new awareness,then this fits the bill.  9 powerful chapters.  Read it. Share it.  Live it.
B006RXPSLK|2.0|This was not for someone over 70..it really went no where. not worth looking at it -we stopped watching after 15 minutes
B005MMJ84K|5.0|This second book of the Delirium trilogy was just as full of excitement as the first. I really did like the way it was wrote with each chapter going back and forth between then and now. It was like two stories connecting as one. I enjoyed learning more about the people of the wilds and how they struggled to survive the harsh environment. It was also interesting reading about the new identity and what goes on back in the land of the cured. There is a lot of depth to this story and now I am happy to dig into book 3!
B002BVQU5A|5.0|anything with Johnny Depp in it is good.. very good story. it be seen by people today who have social problems.
B008ALAHA4|4.0|Quite expensive. but cheaper than another power adapter.<br />The good thing is that it works. The bad thing is that looks awful... doesn't look that something made by apple when you plug this to your MagSafe and then to your laptop.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app rocks!!! If I had to choose the #1 app in the entire world, this would be it. This app is a must have for any Despicable Me fan. You can unlock a bunch of characters from the movies, like the alarm, the firefighter, and the baby!!! You can run in Gru's lab, on the streets and even El Macho's lair!!! You unlock power ups like the freeze ray, the unicorn, and banana vacuum! If you like Despicable Me, then this is a definite must have and the app for you!
B008KE3960|5.0|This is a great app, but limit the time if your child has seizures. Constant movement, never gets boring a lot of fun!
B003B5DNJQ|5.0|Apparently all the newer cameras have switched to a generic size memory card which is too big for my Olympus camera. As long as Amazon will stock this size memory card, I can continue to enjoy my camera which takes great pictures, is compact & easy to use.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Visually pleasant. User friendly. Accurate. It's fun to keep track of the weather in the different places my family lives.
B00122N0GQ|5.0|Love this album! Anything Dave Gahan does is amazing!
B007THA4FI|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read, although I almost gave up on it for good - twice.  Keep on reading and the story eventually, while admittedly quite dark, ends up turning absolutely brilliant and uplifting.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Great Book! Buy it-you will not be disappointed! I could not put this book down-it was exciting from start to finish!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it I think it's awesome fun and vary good at keeping you busy just get it trust me it will be Worth it
B00CATSONE|3.0|Nothing new here. There was even plenty of information that wasn't re-printed in this volume. As an item for debate was Tesla's earthquake machine.
B000PWQPAC|4.0|A &#34;solid&#34; movie that gives us just a little more Kenji Kamiyama 'Ghost'. Good animation proves I.G, Productions still one of the best animation studios.
B00C2FFJFM|5.0|I love the unique quality of Selena's voice. A couple of the songs are not all that great but the rest I really like. Seems like a lot of dance type music, very well done.
B004EC5IUW|4.0|The second movie of reboot lets loose the crazy and it is a enjoyable but man I worried were this is going.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I really love Pinterest, it's one of my favorite apps. However, it is sometimes difficult to open it on my Kindle Fire. Every now and then the app will freeze when I'm trying to open it and I have to 'force close' it. Usually what I do is reinstall the app when it acts up. It is inconvenient, but it works. Again, I love this app, but if the glitches were straightened out, it would make it much better.
B0030ZOYHC|3.0|This movie is basically a the sums up the first eight episode. The 2D animation is great in this update but the CGI Eva's look odd on occasion but the action looks fine.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Didn't think I would like the story line. Read book one tentatively and thought it was ok.  Wasn't going to read book two but was finally persuaded. Glad I did. Looking forward to book three.
B000T00PE2|5.0|love the musik. found out about it after watching &#34;House&#34; (it's the them song). i've discovered that alot of newer musik lists them as the inspiration and roots of their musik. there's a reason for this. listen to it and love it...
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Absolutely captivating. Rothfuss easily gives JK Rowling and George RR Martin a run for their money. Buying book 2 now!
B00CH26TL8|3.0|Help! I would like to download this product to my kindle on my home pc, how do you download Bubble Witch Saga to your kindle on your PC?
B009XIXVU6|5.0|What I liked about the book was it told a great story. I also liked the short chapters. I liked overall.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I've always enjoyed history and historical novels.  So I was surprised to learn about the Orphan Trains.  I'd like to know more about the rational behind the program.  Was it conceived of simply to get the orphans off the streets of New York and to relinquish responsibility, or did someone think this was really a way to give them a better life?  In any case, why was this not mentioned in any of the many American history courses I've taken?
B000SEJHRA|5.0|This is the first book I've read from David Sedaris and he has become one of my favorite authors. The book is very enjoyable.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I am a big fan of Stephen King, but in his last books i felt he was repeating himself.<br />With 11/22/63 the old magic is back, I devoured it in a few days because it kept me in the edge of my seat.<br />Great investigation and great images about a non-JFK assassination America.<br />I hope we will have SK for a long time...

B00CM9JKQM|4.0|I can say that after Empire I became a big QR fan, consuming all records that this incredible band has already released, even after peaks and valeys I am still listening almost daily QR in my way to office. What I can say of the last release? I dont miss Geof Tate, in fact LaTorre is a great singer replacing and passing over Tate's voice and arrogance. Now, QR is back after tha dedicate to caos album
B00CL1SR7O|5.0|Another awesome album from an awesome group! Keep it up BTR! If you don't have it yet, buy it now!
B005MLOOJA|5.0|The best show on t.v.!!  I love the entire cast individually and together.  The best ensemble I've seen so far!
B004SVM7BW|3.0|[UPDATE: Despite the abusive EULA, I did activate this for testing. Since then, I've used this quite a bit, and now it is my go-to PDF annotator on my tablet. If the developer didn't have such a nasty EULA, didn't get Account info, and didn't require network access to 'activate', I'd give it 5 stars.]<br /><br />Games are fun, but what I really use my Android devices for is getting things done.  Fewer file formats are more prevalent than PDF, so having a useful PDF reader is a necessity.  Unfortunately, this isn't a good choice.  In fact, given the many PDF readers available, I'd put this one close to the bottom of the list.<br /><br />Why is this such a bad piece of software?  Simple.  The developer is, in my opinion, rather abusive.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was that this app requires access to your accounts AND internet access.  That's bad enough.  However, many apps that access your accounts can be blocked from internet access and they'll still function.  Not this one.  So you are left with the possibility of this app transmitting your precious accounts information back to the mother server and the awaiting developers, or you can't use it.<br /><br />What that means is that if you don't have access to the internet, you can't read PDFs.  In what way does that make sense?  There are dozens of excellent PDF readers and annotators out there that don't require internet access.  Heck, many of them don't require access to your accounts, either.  In fact, all four of the office suites I own have no trouble with PDFs.  Adobe itself offers a free PDF reader for Android: [[ASIN:B004SD5GZ4 Adobe Reader]].  Even [[ASIN:B004R13U6Y ezPDF Reader PDF Annotate Form]] works well enough and is a better choice than this one.<br /><br />Regarding LICENSING: the EULA (End-User License Agreement) for this states that you can only put this on one of your devices.  That's abysmal in this day and age of mobile computing devices that need to work in orchestra to handle our data needs.  But this app requires you to pay for each device on which you install it.  That's unfortunate, because if you have three devices then you'll have to shell out $9 to use this on each of them.  Oh, and don't forget, all three of those devices must be on the internet for the software to work properly.  What's this app doing with the internet access on each of your devices, as well as the accounts on each of those devices?  I sure as heck don't want to find out.<br /><br />This app isn't worth the $3 asking price.  Given what I've seen, as well as its competition, I would pass on it even if it were free and instead choose something better.  By the way, the app did earn a second star by not having worse offending spyware permissions like some others have.  On the other hand, no telling what the future holds; I, for one, am skeptical.<br /><br />My advice?  Don't bother.  The competition for PDF reader is fierce, so find another app that doesn't want your accounts and doesn't abuse the internet access or licensing. [UPDATE: it's very good, after all, so if you don't mind the abuses then you might find it worthwhile.]<br /><br />[UPDATE: Some folks are reporting that they are able to accept the EULA and operate the software in airplane mode.  While I am experiencing a loss of functionality, your mileage may vary.  As a result, I am increasing my rating to three stars pending further information from the developer should he/she/they choose to contact me.]needs.

B0081J9OWC|4.0|Great sound, unique artists, definitely worth the purchase. Phenomenal act live. Looking forward to investing in some of their earlier albums.
B00CDSIMI4|5.0|The game itself is amazing but it wouldn't be NEARLY as emotional if not for this soundtrack.  All of the songs are beautiful and drive every moment they derive from in the game straight into you.  The main theme is beautiful and each iteration of it used is just as good.  It was interesting to see certain themes redone with twists to fit the new scene.  Absolutely amazing.  I have no disappointments about this soundtrack except that it isn't longer.
B00DFFI7K2|5.0|a little lame that the bulk of joes are wiped out after the first action scenes, but the small group of comeback kids is a fun ride.
B007FROGME|4.0|unbelievable - if only half of what is told is close to what is was like - living in the USSR was hell on earth.
B004XWLIJS|5.0|he's cool calm and collected, while kicking a$$. The story of an outed assassin has been done many times, and this one brings enough new twists and turns with great action to make it worth watching another take on a classic arc.
B00CMYRVAO|5.0|I had heard one song from the DVD and knew that i wanted to hear more.  And this DVD doesn't disappoint.  His songs remind me of when singers sang!  This is my first Joe DVD and certaily will not be my last.  I am now a fan for life.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great fun awesome game. fun for entire family. I love minions and grub and kids and purple minions are all great fun and I laugh and cuss at them
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Unlike the first one, there are items hidden behind doors, secret panels, and the like. It makes it more like a simplified escape the room game than a hidden item game.
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|This is the best app I've ever downloaded for my kindle fire. Keep up the good work.. I f you DJ or if you are interested in the concept of dj ing, you need to check this out.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I like the series. It is essentially a period soap opera. This season's biggest flaw is that it imposes current social sensibilities on an earlier decade. I don't feel the women &#34;downstairs&#34; would have had a clue what homosexuality was all about. It wasn't talked about or written about. It was easy to be innocent about such things back then. The men would likely have been outraged by the very idea. Today, it is quite different. As gays come out of the closet, we know them and know their humanity and thus accepting. It would not have been likely to happen back then. Also, they have muddled Thomas's character. He is basically unlikeable for many reasons. Then the writers have tried to soften his image so that a gay man is shown to be likeable. But it is too late for those of us who have known his treachery through previous episodes. But, despite these flaws in the writing, I still like the show.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I'm really sad that this game won't load. It worked just fine till the last update. I have tried uninstalling it and reinstalling the game.  Boo face.  :(
B009YN2M7S|5.0|never disappointed with a Nicholas spark story. i don't know how he keeps them coming.<br />he is an writer that I lover to read
B008K8VDPU|1.0|This app is terrible!!!! I got this app because I thought it was like Magic Piano on the IPhone so I got it but it ended up to be terrible the only songs I knew weren't the whole sons or didn't even sound like it. I wouldn't rate it if didn't have to.D:&lt;
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|This is the second in a long line of novels based on his character Honor Harrington.  It is necessary that you read them in order or you will miss why things are happening.  I have read everyone of these books at least twice and they never grow old.<br /><br />Jim Phillips

B00E7SID9G|4.0|Reza Aslan has written an engaging narrative about Christ the man, as he can be reconstructed from the Bible and other historical sources. None of this will come as a surprise to anyone who is abreast of the scholarly consensus around Jesus as it has stood post Albert Schweitzer since 1906. However, what this book does is create a narrative around this consensus that is accessible to the layman. In some ways, this book is the Cliff's Notes of historical studies into Christ. Reza is best when he links the evolution of the Jesus movement to the socio-political realities of first century Palestine, in particular the antagonism between Judaism and Rome. With a series of arguments well founded in passages from the Bible and other sources from the time, he shows how any portrait of Jesus devoid of the political climate of the time is false and misleading. Jesus was a product of his time and his time saw a perfect storm of collision between an aggressive Roman occupation and an increasingly assertive Jewish resistance that found in the long awaited Messianic figure a symbol of their desired deliverance from the Roman yoke. Jesus was one of many itinerant claimants to this title and his end was similar to the others, executed by the might of Rome. This is where the history of the real Jesus ends. The following two thousand years have been about Jesus Christ, an abstract construct who bars no resemblance to the real person who walked this earth. Reza Aslan's single biggest achievement has been to prove that through a well researched and thoroughly enjoyable book
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I enjoyed this book because it was well written and the message was one of self empowerment and hope. Anita was able to allow me to share her journey in an honest and beautiful way.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Good app great viewing but when down loading a video it doesn't show u the status. The status on the down load restarts when u watch something else, not big but annoying. Also every time I find a problem u seem to fix it so u will most likely fix it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|great game I love fighting zombies and creepers it's also fun to build houses but I don't like how they took endermen out of the game
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|The best game ever. The emojis are easy. It's really not that diffcult. The game is just fun all the way around.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I would have never thought that I like a zombie show but I am so obsessed with the show.  it's the best!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|For a my little pony game it is pretty good just a little problem with the store prices are a little high with bids and gems. I play it all the time.
B004SVM7BW|4.0|I have the Nexus 7. When I edit a PDF that I've opened through the Downloads tab it will not save the edited version. But if I open the file through my ES Explorer, then it will save the edited version.<br /> I wish I could change the foldea it opens in the open tab to my documents folder.<br />then I wouldn't have to navigate through all my folders when I want to open a new file.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book sooo much I didn't want it to end, although at times it was confusing to read it was still a good book. I wish there was another one in the series. And I wish Gale and Katniss were still friends at the end... And remember, may the odds be ever in your favor!
B000HIVOI2|1.0|How can a seller ship a known defective product? There are no subtitles for the movie (Most of the important dialog is in the ancient [Egyptian?] language) and the feature to turn them on is disabled. Don't buy the Extended Cut unless you are assured it has subtitles available.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|This book had me laughing out loud at times.  The story was really quirky and so far out that spoke volumes for the author's creativity.  It was easy to read and follow.  A real can't put down book.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Dr. Who is a true pleaser - this series is very much superior to the drivel that is frequently shown on TV!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think that this game is amizing for kid beacause  &quot;it is 1of a kind&quot; and super fun and i love it this game is soooooooo much fun for  kids i am only 11and i play it every day so you should get this app !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!
B002B8ELGS|4.0|It should be better with subtitles, but... ok<br />Thank you very much<br />Maybe to a next time Bye Bye Bye
B00C7JGDBW|3.0|Bought this to watch with my 6 year old as we had just completed reading the book.  Follows the book very closely.  The movie isn't great and would rent it if I had the choice, versus buy it.
B008R14YBK|5.0|I'm a 39 year old mom of two teenage girls and I LOVE this cd!  Great job, Bridgit!  Ready for the next cd!
B00847KFDS|5.0|I'm usually a bit leery of rehash albums featuring guest artists but this CD is great; most arrangements are better than the original CCR versions and there is major energy flowing here. The guitar playing by guests (including Brad Paisley with whom Fogerty can trade chops on an equal footing) and the man himself is exceptional and the tone to die for - excellent studio engineering job. All-in-all, a lot of fun to listen to. What could be better?
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|The game was my daughter's favorite until three days ago. When she attempted to play, it just locks up at the downloading screen with the 'game tip' displayed. I downloaded and reinstalled and it still locks up. Enjoy it while you can.
0486448843|2.0|I love Waterhouse and wanted some small cards to frame for a wall gallery; however, the printing quality on these cards is very disappointing. Some pictures seem out of focus, but more than that, none of the cards have the vibrant colors they should. Some have a very orange hue, others too green. They look pretty bad. Also, the prints are glossy, so perhaps that may be why. Maybe I got a bad batch. The shipping was fast, however, and this won't necessarily prevent me from purchasing from this store again. In retrospect, I probably could have contacted the seller, but after I put them away in a shelf, I just forgot.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|This game is a bad copycat of beekeeper. Played a little while then ditched it. Someone yo uhh anger might enjoy this not much of a challenge
B00CWY76CC|3.0|for a free game cant complain. it would be nice if there was a way to screen shot some areas because pieces of clues are everywhere but not have it saved to device.
B00AEJM6H2|3.0|I think This game is okay but it Only keeps my attention for a little while. After about 2/3levels I'm bored
B009DCOU9S|5.0|Interesting game,like the designs,the tone, the plot ,not too difficult but worth to try. Spent some happy hours with it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Visually stunning. Intelligent with subtle humor. Characters that you love to love (Matthew, Anna, Mrs. Hughes) and love to hate (Thomas, O'Brien). Maggie Smith is an absolute jewel as Violet!!  Period costumes and automobiles lend authenticity to the production.
B00CLIJ9A6|5.0|The story is like an English version of Golden Pond with a good plot and excellent acting and good music.
1607066017|5.0|Love LOVE the storytelling. Color, and art is beautiful. The facial expressions are so clear. the character drawings are so creative. I'm glad the series is continuing. Must have for BKV fan.

B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Amazing book. Words can't describe it. I want to read it again. You must read this book. I demand you to.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|This was an awesome movie and very funny!  I am glad I did not listen to the bad reviews. Just watch it you will enjoy it!
B0026KX5PO|4.0|Not my cup of tea when it comes to movies, but I cannot ignore the quality of the movie. If you have someone that wants to watch the film, and you aren't interested, it's worth sitting through :)
B004WMKSH2|5.0|When this film first came out I watched it in the theater soon after reading Deathly Hallows.  The movie disappointed me because it left the book and provided only surface referrals to my favorite parts of the reading.<br /><br />BUT, watching it a few years later, more removed from the book, I found this film totally delightful.  It was fun on its own.  And it was fun to be reminded through excellent visuals of the original read.<br /><br />Joanna Poppink, MFT<br />Los Angeles psychotherapist<br />Eating Disorder Recovery for adult women<br />author of: Healing Your Hungry Heart: recovering from your eating disorder
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|This was a great movie. Engrossing easy to follow plot. With an all star cast. It made you think deeply while being able to truly get into the them
B005UG542S|5.0|Different from the book. Once I got past the changes I enjoyed this as a fun ride with terrific visuals.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Super fun and super addicting!! At first i downloaded it on my phone and it didn't work, but it works like a charm on my kindle.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|My 5 year old specifically asked to purchase this movie AND soundtrack. It has a good theme and is age appropriate. Our whole family enjoys watching it together.
B005LAIGLE|5.0|Having only seen trailers for this movie, I was not sure it would be as good as promoted. Once more Amaazon provide a quality product quickly.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|A great love story in the backdrop of an action movie!  An interesting way to weave in a unique and under-told part of American history with elements that are necessary for a great movie.
B000006OS2|5.0|TRhis is one of John Wayne's best movies that I was looking for my collection. Amazon once again was able to provide this easily at a great price.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Very good movie.  Really enjoyed watching it with the kids.  I hope the sequel is just as good as the original.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I wish it came with more instructions so you could understand the game easier. It's a lot of trial and error to understand the game
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I love books that make my think long after the actual reading is finished.  This is one such novel.  I enjoyed it immensely for the poetic prose as well as for the introspection it inspired.
1939416019|2.0|I bought this book honestly because it was inexpensive and sounded like it had potential.  Unfortunately as I started reading it I was blown away with how predictable the storyline was.  As you continue to read you begin to feel like you've read this story before multiple times, I mean a good example of this is the sword that is stuck in stone, waiting for the 'chosen one' to pull it out and rid the world of evil.  The writing style itself was very easy to read, and may be a good read for a young child, but was very disappointing for a slightly older reader.
B009GIPDQS|3.0|Ok but not very believable. A good fast flowing yarn that could have been improved with more realism and authenticity.
B00B7HQ1DA|5.0|great job with every song. boz scaggs has always been a great talent. his arrangements are the best. love it.
B00D6SBOWG|3.0|I play this on my I pod and was excited to get it on the Kindle but I haven't found where I can use my same account. It started me all over from the beginning. Other than that it seems to work the same.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|I am 68 years old and saw this for the first time.  I think it's hilarious and recommend it to people who are older as well as younger
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I like young reader books even though I'm 60.  This had a good moving story to it and a happy ending.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was such a good book for kids like August who are one of a kind and have to fight through that is just wonderful😂😆😃
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I just love this game but I have to be careful, LOL, I won't get anything done all day once I get started.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This game is awesome!!! The graphics are really good and the storyline makes sense. It's not cheesy or too creepy also. Love it
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Beautiful graphics, wonderful choices, all over really the best I have found.  Download it and try it. You will love it too.
B006IGZWB2|4.0|I was a bit disappointed with the movie because, unless you read the book before, you would be quite a bit confused because the movie jumps in and there's no continuity with anything.  I would have liked the movie to have followed the book more closely at the beginning to clarify who's who, what's what, etc.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Just started playing this game and I like it so far. Each floor gets more challenging. Ask me when I am stuck if I still like it. Is there hints in this game if needed?
B002WV5A9G|5.0|This movie is also better than any modern Star Wars movie, and to me, better than almost any other action flick out there. You can never beat Die Hard 1 though, just saying.
0770437400|4.0|Movie and book have no relationship. Too bad the book would have been better! Not all books are better than movie.
0553801473|5.0|I can't wait to read the series conclusion...whenever George gets around to finishing it. Which I think is his point: He's had so much fun torturing the characters and his audience that he's just going to draw the suspense out until we all go nuts.
1400049628|2.0|This is only for real Zombie lovers, and I am not one of them. Good Zombie stories have been released with real scares in them. Save your money for those-

B008XKSW7M|5.0|I was rolling on the floor laughing at this movie. The love story and reality of some of the stories throughout the movie is wonderful.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|The writing is superb! You know and love the characters and want to know every detail, which Martin delivers. The books fills in the gaps from the HBO series and brings Westeros to life.
B004EPYZOY|4.0|This is the best Ghost Rider movie Nic Cage has made. Very over the top and campy, but a lot of fun. Highly recommend if you're a fan on Nicholas Cage.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|My middle-schooler and high-schooler and I all really like this game!  Trying to figure out how to make the ball look like the sample really can make you use your brain!  Fun!
B005LAII12|3.0|It was a bit on the vulgar side.  Not my type of entertainment.  I would not have bought this had I known.
B00CFA227C|5.0|Another fun movie, a witty spin on an old tale; great animation on the giants. Sit back and enjoy the ride.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Not big on App games, as they can be addictive, time consuming and get you in trouble at work. This game is played by my 6 yr old, 14 yr old and 16 yr old. At 36, I'm hooked too by the 3 mini  in game goals that are given. Good play.
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|We saw the movie at the theater and when it came out on DVD/Blue Ray had to have it. That pretty much sums up my review of the film. You can read the critical reviews if you want.  I believe it is a fun prequel to the &#34;Wizard of Oz.&#34; On certain movies I can suspend disbelief if they don't insult my intelligence (too much?) after all, though we loved &#34;Schindler's List&#34; my wife and I go to movies generally to get away from our problems. Where better to escape than Oz?

B00005JMJ4|5.0|Bill Murray at his best as a dramatic actor. Love the plot. One very risqu&eacute; scene which I believe should have been omitted. Love the ending.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|It was a really entertaining there is some funny moments and a lot of action. They add some more actors which add value to the movie.
B003UESJH4|5.0|What a great film. Wonderful story told beautifully. FAB actors. I tell everyone one to buiy this movie.  I watch it at least once a month.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|good family fun!!!  my daughter loves bores and it helps her to see what is all involved in caring for them.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Love that it so descriptive and seemingly accurate for as much as I know.  The characters are developed and mature amazingly well
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I am not a very tech savvy person and had a little hiccup installing. initially had no problems installing everything was going as planed until I ran into a problem with the router. It had to do with something called VPN (which I have no idea what it is). It took me a good 20-30 minutes trying to figure out what I needed to disable on my router but once I figured it out the installation process was completed. Also, you do need to plug the thing in to power it up. It also does not work from a desk top. I know it does not mention desk top but like I said I am not the most tech savvy person and I though I would give it a shot.<br /><br />My primary use for this was so that the kids could watch Netflix in their room and this device does just that and it does it well. Casting from Google Chrome also works for me without any problems to this point. People have complained about the capabilities but I just think they may be asking too much of this product. I have also seen complaints about the 3 free months of Netflix. I ordered mine hours after the announcement and I did get my code and I did receive the credit to my account. If you ordered your device after a specific time you will not get the code as this was a limited time offer.
B001B92E5I|5.0|Great music and brilliant storytelling! Haunting, timeless and perfect. It never gets old. Everyone should own this record! Especially on vinyl!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Obviously I loved the first book for the main reason everyone else did.... coming off the 50shades of grey high..... the 2nd book made me want more this 3rd book I felt I was only reading to know what happens.....Obviously excitement in the 3rd book doesn't even hit till the end.... not a huge fan!
B003M6FGTE|5.0|I love the talent, energy and story lines of the show.  Nice! Keeps me engaged with each episode!<br />Can't wait for next season!
B004S49YEM|5.0|I have previously read Follet's more recent works and awaiting the third of his latest trilogy I decided to explore his earlier works. Not at all disappinted.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|This game is really fun.  It takes me forever to stump the genie.  Must have a extra big database because when it guesses correctly,  it tells you how many times that subject was used.

B00006AW2F|1.0|I have no idea why this crap album was even agreed too.  2 good songs all the rest are songs even the best Stones fan has never heard, and there is a reason for it too.  All crap
B00BC5I6Q2|1.0|Couldn't watch it - gave me a headache after the first episode.  Shot with some kind of filters, I guess - who knows - but too much shadow for me.  Could also tell by the end of the first episode that it in no way compared with the original British series starring Ian Richardson.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This product installs in minutes, as long as you can get to your TV HDMI port. It was a little frustrating to figure out how to connect the image to the TV, but that was probably me. If you watch the shows it supports this is a must for you. I can watch my iphone on a 65 in TV.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|the drama, the performance  true to reality, the colors, the actors & actresses , the historic settings, the life between the nobility and  its servants.
B009DCOU9S|3.0|The puzzles are unique and not difficult for the sake of being difficult! However when you have to combine items they have to be placed in a very specific spot otherwise it doesn't connect. Makes the game frustrating to say the least.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|I adored this book.  It wasn't as fast paced or jam packed with near tragic incidents like the first two, but it bought some peace of mind and was easy to read.  I was shocked to find out it wasn't the last book though.
B00A7W29BE|2.0|This is not the best app out there.  I got it on the free app of the day promotion and I'm glad I didn't pay for it.  It does not do a good job of scanning a document clearly, resizing it, etc.

B00DUCXFUC|1.0|Dear Fellow Dark Knight Fans and Amazon Customers,<br /><br /> Based upon WB's product details, this box set would likely be worth a 5ive-star rating, that is, if you do not already own The Dark Knight movies. But if you do own them, then this item deserves only a one-star rating, especially without a current rebate offer for it. And yet, there is a way to resolve the problem of us having to engage in a rather costly double-dip if we are to ever see the coveted new exclusive The Fire Rises Bonus Extras 6th Blu-ray Disc from The Dark Knight Trilogy--Ultimate Collector's Edition.<br /><br />  This would be the second time that this method of resolution has worked, following my review of U2 360*: Live at the Rose Bowl--Super Deluxe Limited Edition, which asked key people at Universal/Interscope Records to include a Blu-ray Disc. This Box Set had only been planned to contain 2-DVDs and other memorabilia, but no Blu-ray. Sure enough, after a month, and thanks to all of you who participated in a simple petition, the U2360 product content was upgraded to include Blu-ray.<br /><br />  Warner Bros. has probably already been considering offering a rebate for The Ultimate Dark Knight. Just look at their $5 Upgrade from DVD 2 Blu-ray trade-in program and the fact the studio with the most Blu-ray hit movies that retail for $10 or under is Warner Bros. A few years ago, even Paramount was offering $10 rebate checks by mail for current owners of Braveheart and/or Gladiator DVDs, who had bought the Sapphire Series Blu-ray 2-Disc Sets of those titles.<br /><br />  The following are the 6ix filmmakers whose names appear the most in the end credits of the various Dark Knight Trilogy Blu-ray & DVD Special Features, and who also happen to be members on Facebook, listed in order of credit prominence:<br /><br />JORDAN GOLDBERG in Los Angeles, Trilogy producer<br />WILL HYDE in San Francisco, Batman Begins/Dark Knight associate producer<br />JOHN LIMPERT, in Los Angeles, Warner Bros. Entertainment Vice-President<br />MICHAEL FALLAVOLLITA in CA, The Dark Knight & Rises editor<br />RICK HULL in Los Angeles, Technology & Psychology of The Dark Knight Unmasked  producer at Prometheus Entertainment<br />ROKO BELIC, Happy director & Batmobile director/writer/cameraman<br /><br /> I strongly implore you to please take just a few minutes copy and paste the following message and send it via Facebook too as many of these creative individuals as possible. You may also choose to print it out out and mail it to them:<br /><br /> c/o Warner Bros. Home Video Entertainment Inc.<br /> 4000 Warner Blvd.<br /> Burbank, CA  91522.<br /><br /> Feel free to write your own message on this matter. With enough of you participating in this petition, we WILL achieve the results that we deserve! Thank You!<br /><br />Dear FILL IN FILMMAKER's NAME HERE,<br /><br /> You have done a magnificent job on The Dark Knight Trilogy Special Features from previous DVD and Blu-ray Editions. My name is TYPE IN YOUR NAME HERE. I am an avid cinema aficiando and collector of BDs and DVDs. Warner Bros. is my favourite studio. I regard The Dark Knight franchise to be the greatest comic book superhero movies ever made.<br /><br /> I am writing to you concerning the forthcoming Dark Knight Trilogy--Blu-ray 6ix-Disc Ultimate Collector's Edition Box Set to respectfully request that some sort of rebate be offered to current owners of any or all of these three movies on DVD and/or Blu-ray. The refund would allow for your consumers to save money if they choose to purchase The DK Trilogy--Ultimate Collector's Edition.<br /><br /> Most folks who would be interested in buying the Ultimate Collector's Edition already own previous editions of these three movies. The majority of Dark Knight fans have loved these films so much that they have already sought out to be able to watch them whenever they pleased and were likely not patient enough to endure the long wait for this Trilogy--Ultimate Collector's Edition, especially considering that Christopher Nolan and his filmmaking team initially had no plans for any further sequels when they first made and released Batman Begins in 2005 or The Dark Knight in 2008.<br /><br />  Most enthusiasts would undoubtedly much appreciate having the new content and memorabilia of the Ultimate Trilogy: 3 Mattel Hot Wheels Bat-vehicle toys, a 48-page hardcover book, several premium art cards, and especially the 6th Bonus Special Features Blu-ray Disc. However, most of us fans simply cannot justify paying for this new box set, due to its current retail price of $80 being a bit too high combined with the matter that its exclusive new items, while enticing, are not necessarily compelling enough of a a need-to-own vibe amongst collectors at the cost of an unfortunate double-dip. If you do not believe me, please check out the advance customer reviews at Amazon and other websites.<br /><br /> Without any rebate, it really seems that pretty much the only people who would succumb to dishing out their hard-earned money for this box set are financially well-off, Bat-fan uber-nerds who have the compulsive need to possess it. While such individuals may be fascinating, evaluate just how very small their demographic percentage of the population must actually be.<br /><br /> It is quite clear that Warner Bros. Home Video would sell vastly more copies of the Ultimate Edition IF only a fair rebate was offered to current DVD and/or Blu-ray owners of the 3 Dark Knight movies. Such generosity would allow Warner Bros. to earn more profits and would also best serve the mania and middle-class or lower stature of the majority of fans. Such kindness would further instill our trust and faith in the greatest movie studio in the world.<br /><br /> Here is our proposal for an ideal rebate offer:<br /> Customers are sent a refund check after they mail out proof-of-purchase ISBN-UPC barcodes and/or their actual video discs of any or all of the three movies. A rebate formsheet has designated sectors for taping or gluing ISBN-UPC barcodes. The sales receipt for new box set would also be required.<br /><br /> In every rebate dollar-level, each movie would be of a different title. For example: within the $2-level, customers may receive a $4 rebate for Batman Begins and The Dark Knight with either being in single or Two-DVDisc Editions, but sending 2 Dark Knight ISBN barcodes, one from the movie-only edition and the other from the 2-Disc Special Edition, will disqualify one of these submittals and they shall only receive a rebate of $2. This general rule applies for all subsequent dollar-levels, including for returning discs.<br /> Rebates for Proof-of-Purchase barcodes are limited to no more than 7 items total.<br /><br /> $2 each for up to any 3 different movie title UPCs in 1-DVDisc or Two-DVD Special Editions.<br /> $3 each for up to any 2 different titles of The Dark Knight  and Batman Begins on HDDVD, or on Blu-ray in regular, Special Edition, Steelbook or in +DVD Combo Pack.<br /> $4 each for up to any 2 different titles: any The Dark Knight Rises--Blu-ray Disc, The Trilogy--DVD Set and/or Begins in 2-DVD + Comic Book Deluxe Edition or Limited Edition 2-DVD Gift Set with Flash Drive.<br /> $5 each for up to any 3 different titles: Begins--Limited Edition Blu-ray Gift Set with Flash Drive, Trilogy--Blu-ray Set and/or any 1 Dark Knight--Limited Edition: Bat-Pod Display Case, Target Exclusive Bat-Mask Case or Best Buy Exclusive Clown Mask or Bat-Cowl Bobble Heads.<br /><br /> The rebate form is affixed to a prepaid-postage return envelope that can hold up to 8 discs, which is the total limit for disc rebates.<br /><br />$6 each for up to any 6 different DVDs including Bonus Extras 2nd Discs.<br />$7 each for up to any 5 different HDDVD and/or Blu-rays including Special Features 2nd Discs.<br /><br /> Customers would have the option of returning either the disc they already own, OR the corresponding disc found within the new box set. Current online product images do not let us see with clarity whether or not the label side of the discs from the new set have been printed with artwork that is cooler and more attractive than on previously released discs. Assuming that the actual video content on previous and new discs is the same, consumers should be able to keep the discs which bear the artwork that they prefer.<br /><br /> Furthermore, the Special Features Bonus 2nd Blu-ray Disc  from The Dark Knight Rises--Best Buy Exclusive Steelbook 2-BD + DVD Combo Pack contained The Dark Knight Reborn 37-minute documentary, which was no included on any other edition. If the Ultimate Trilogy does not contain Dark Knight Reborn, customers should be able to return the DKR Special Features disc from the new set.<br /><br /> If it is simply too late in the manufacturing process to have this rebate form inserted within the box sets, then a small sticker may be posted outside the front of the box sets upon the factory-seal wrap, with basic directions for customers to go to a special website address, from which they may print out the rebate form and follow simple instructions on how to claim their refund by mail. They would, of course, also supply their own envelopes for returning discs.<br /><br /> Yet an even better method of appeasing collectors would be  for Warner Bros. to sell the Ultimate Box Set directly from their official online shop site, with the options of ordering it in every possible combination of discs and other items not to be included, depending on the customer's needs and priced accordingly. We the fans will not mind if the factory-wrap is missing, if that makes it easier on the distribution end.<br /><br /> Some customers may not require the hardcover book, as they may already own The Art and Making of the Dark Knight Trilogy giant book. Some may not want the Mattel Hot Wheels, as they may already own them. Most, however, will probably want to order the box set with all items intact except forthose five movie and bonus discs that have already been released. Most will covet the new memorabilia, especially the exclusive Special Features BD.<br /><br /> Assuming that the over-priced retail cost of $79.99 does not go down any lower by the time of the September 24th release date, here is a suggestion example of how the various items may be valued accordingly for these customized consumer orders:<br /><br /> $9 per Blu-ray Disc<br /> $4 per 1 of the 3 Mattel Hot Wheels Bat-vehicles<br /> $6 for the hardback book<br /> $5 for the set of premium art cards<br /> $3 for the box and packaging therein only<br /><br /> If the release date for the Ultimate Edition needs to be postponed in order to fulfill any of the aforementioned accommodations, so be it. We the fans would be happy to wait longer.<br /><br /> At the very least, that exclusive 6th bonus BDisc should be available for individual sale. It is the main reason that anyone would want the Ultimate Trilogy and the main reason that we have written this letter. We must believe that we are gifted with so many special features about the creation of great films because the powers-that-be at movie studios and home video distribution truly do care about inspiring and educating the future generations of filmmakers, and that we deserve to be able to acquire the art of cinema at a reasonable price.<br /><br />Thank You So Much for Hearing Us!<br />Sincerely,<br /><br />TYPE IN YOUR NAME HERE
B0000VCZKM|5.0|My daughter loved it 25 years ago and my grand daughter loves it now. She is seven and watches Annie in the car DVD player and sings along with every song and loves it, has watched at least ten times so far. Great Investment on a long trip.
B001MEJY8W|4.0|This movie was out there and I loved it. Everything about it seemed twisted. It was nothing nice and yes there was a plot and what a plot.
B0063IH60K|5.0|it's the best part of my kindle!! i can take this with me where ever i go. i don't need access to wi-fi.
B0041KKYCY|4.0|Not too different than the original. I did have more sympathy for this female character and enjoyed her ingenious and ruthless methods of revenge and that final smirk was perfect.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Easy to use and greatest way I know of to view and download YouTube videos to your smart phone. Awesome
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Fantastic show. I hope it keeps going. Good acting, the timeline and setting fit together well. I hope more seasons to come.
B005544V6A|5.0|Luckily, I started watching this when there were 2 seasons readily available at my finger tips!!  I'm so addicted!  I love this show - new favorite!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game got updated and I updated it and more characters is better I have the world record legitimate score quickest goofy auklet but back to the game the game gets harder the more you go which I like a challenge
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Fun action movie, with a good sense of humor. I would watch it again, and I am looking forward to the sequel.
B00973DDN2|5.0|The Killers, hot diggity dang, they are fantastic.<br />This album has some of their best work to date, I'm stunned.
1449320104|5.0|I always keep my books clean and in a very good condition because most of the time they are sleeping on the shelves :) This book is an exception, its condition now is horrible since I take it wherever I go and I use it as a quick reference for those topics that I hate bear in mind such as regular expressions and XML.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I literally could not put this book down.  It was captivating from beginning to end.  Fitting final chapter in the wheel of time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Such a great fun game to play! The minions are entertaining and the challenges are a good mix of easy and hard things to do
0743435729|3.0|This is the second book of this series I read and, while the first book also had a relatively simple story line, it was still interesting.  Here I feel like the author wanted to write a book about sexism and went out of his way to bend an established character to that purpose.  That, by itself, is no crime, of course- in fact I expected it with the main character being a high ranking female military person.  I just felt like here the handling of it detracted from rather than added to the story line.  Still, that isn't all there is to the book and, in general, it was ok.  I like my books to be better than ok but I am going on to the third book in the series so it probably fulfilled its purpose in that regard.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I thought the story was good but was long and drawn out. A few good surprises helped a lot and at the end of the book I couldn't wait for the next one. I have it pre-ordered but it seems to be taking a long time to receive it.
B005LAII4E|1.0|They killed the Duke (Channing Tatum) and made The Rock the star of the movie, but he sat there like a rock. The Rock's acting is as bad as when he wrestles.  The movie is just one mess; scritp, plot, acting, music, etc..
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I absolutely love this game. My family and I all play it all the time. Great challenges and obstacles, never ending fun. And who doesn't love the minions?!??!!
B0002BO0US|5.0|This band and album belong in the same category and deserves the same critical recognition as anything released during the same era as The Beatles and The Beach Boys.  Yes....it IS that good! And the core of the original Zombies: Colin Blunstone and Rod Argent are still performing and recording...and are still truly amazing.  Don't call yourself a fan of 60's British rock of you are unaware this album!
B003IKMR0U|5.0|This is a fun game that can be played in a short amount of time.  Usually we play this when we aren't quite ready to quit our game play, but we don't want to get into another long board game.  It is easy to learn and you can risk as much or as little as you want--just beware of the shotguns...
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I love this game. Its fun for all ages. I play it all the time and it really occupies me. I definitely recommend this game. Princess Salon rocks!
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|I'm not exactly a teen. I'm raising a house full though. I don't know why I liked this book so much. Maybe because I was the new kid more than once and didn't always fit it. Maybe it was Eleanor's heartbreaking circumstances that were so similiar to my own as a teen. But I love this book and want to read it again. What Eleanor goes through is very real. Emotionally heartbreaking. Park with his own difficulties trying to figure out who he is and how he feels about the girl that sits next to him every day on the bus just drew me in. I adored him too by the end of the book.<br /><br />I had one issue and it was not the story itself. My Kindle version was missing a complete chapter at a critical part near the end of the book and couldn't find a way to contact Amazon about this issue.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I've loved this movie for at least a decade. The case and disc are both new and well made, not cheap knock off or post productions. The video and audio quality are great. It also comes with literal translation for that authentic engrish feel, or subtitles for the actual english dialog for the hard of hearing.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|The Movie Character Despicable Me, Has an Abusive Mother.<br />The Three Kids He Adopts to Steal a Weapon Grow on Him:<br />&, Soon He Becomes a Doting Father.  They Show Him Love<br />&, He Reciprocates by Reforming Himself.  Very, Very Funny:<br />Cannot Wait for &#34;Despicable Me 2&#34; !  My 5 Year Old Nephew,<br />Abraham, Wailed with Laughter, & So Did I !<br />Sincerely:  Kevin
B00785P2QC|4.0|Lots of fun! A easy to play to. Be careful not to make it a habit. More interactive than a lot of the games like it.
B00BB22GQM|5.0|I am a &#34;baby boomer&#34; who loves all types of music.  I saw an interview on CBS with the members of this band.  I was very impressed with them and decided to buy the CD.  I love this CD because it reminds me of bands from my era but with a fresh modern sound.  The CD is not &#34;overproduced&#34; with timely meaningful lyrics.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Very interesting story line.<br />Liked the cars, costumes and ending of the season.<br /><br />Anxiously waiting for the the next heir.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|my oldest son is 6 and he loves this app. they play it all the time. It is well worth downloading for all ages.
B002JI94J4|5.0|For a blue ray, you would expect perfect picture to go with the perfect sound, but this is not the case here. Apparently Miramax did not want to put out the expense and time to clean this movie up frame by frame like SONY did with the James Bond films. It's worth having in your collection nonetheless.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|James is a very clever fellow and quite original. I read this book in a few hours over two days, though I'm normally easily bored, but this book kept me turning pages. Often I laughed out loud and had to explain why to my wife. A few of the ideas seemed wrong for me, but I immediately saw wisdom in most, yet rarely had I read any of them elsewhere. Well worth the time.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|As  far as Facebook apps go this has been one of the most frustrating to use, it hardly ever loads properly and my wall is annoying
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Never got into British TV before, but, based on really enjoying the Engish series &#34;The Tudors,&#34; decided to give this a try. What a discovery! Ate thie entire series in about two weeks. If you enjoy wonderfully written, extravagant TV, this is a must! Enjoy!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is great for people of all ages and works even without wifi this game is dispicably awesome I love it so much fun.
B00A7CI82I|3.0|Lots of action and a good story but similar to the first.  Perhaps this was necessary to build a new trilogy. I still think they should continue the franchise but the next one really has to deliver some retribution.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is really fun i really enjoy playing this the only down side is i didn't get to pick a name for my horse or what kind i wanted but this is still really fun
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|I didn't see this in the theater, prices of soda and popcorn keep me home from movies and I take the money usually spent on Soda and Popcorn and spend it to buy the Blu Ray copy of the film.<br /><br />This Blu Ray does not disappoint.  The transition from B/w to color is astounding, the color of the entry into oz is breathtaking and the rest of the movie is everything that I would have wanted.<br /><br />Great job, and I see where a sequel could be made.  Lets do it.
0763619612|5.0|The Dot is a wonderfully story of seeing the art in things that may not obviously be art and not getting discouraged.
B0097EWK3A|1.0|It's annoying to get through most of a game you've paid for only to be stopped by a bug. In this one you get to the runes place the object get the code from the evidence but when you enter the code the game does' t take it. No money no game but a lot of wasted time. This is a 5-star game but the Polish systems house rushed the conversion to an HD Kindle and left bugs. They should have put a Skip It here like the rest of the puzzles so you could at least finish the game instead of leaving a lot of frustrated and annoyed people. You should Skip It!
B00D6BU8GG|4.0|A typical Die Hard.  Not believable but a lot of fun.  Lived up to past movies.  My entire family enjoyed it.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Downloaded, but game never finished loading!  Sounds like a lot of fun but I guess I'll never know.  Wonder what happens after Dave FETs rp the doors. Could someome let me know, cause I can't do it myself.....<br />  :(
B007SYWFRM|5.0|if you are looking for a building game just play this game and you will never want to stop playing
1469259273|5.0|Normally just listen to audio books in the car. With this book I would sit in the car and wait for chapter to finish. Even brought it in the house and listen for hours. And by hours I mean days and finish the book. It is excellent!!
B009DCOU9S|5.0|The game is fun to play. Some of the challenges are tough but most just take careful thinking and/or searching. There is a lot of talking between challenges, but the creators have made the characters fun to look at and the mouth-o-matic animation is worth the time. There are a few minor bugs in the dialogue scenes but overall an enjoyable game.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It does just what you'd expect it too. The biggest complaint I have is the notifications on new message didn't always come through.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|First time ever hearing of this series. It was very good.  I wish this was still on t v but sadly it's only a couple of seasons.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|even though you have to earn coins to unlock games it gives you skill and strategy to finish the game. great game
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|What a great perk of Amazon Prime membership!! Thanks for offering such a great show as part of the free choices. I've loved catching up on the shows I missed the first time around.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I think minion rush is a great way to pass the time. I play minion rush when I`m bored or have nothing to do. It's really fun.
1554512115|5.0|My daughter loves this story. \\"It is true?\\" became one of her first phrases that she would say at random.<br /><br />But we decided to buy a copy for a friend's child and went with the board book because we thought it would be more durable. Unfortunately, the text has been abbreviated and mangled in the board book version. I honestly don't understand the editorial decisions behind the choices they made, but by all means buy the original version and avoid the abridged board book, which should just be pulled off the market.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Extremely easy to setup. Took me less than two minutes to set it up and start using.<br />Works like magic<br />Nice packaging
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|AN INCREDIBLY ADDICTIVE GAME.. AND MY SON LOVES IT..  SO, I CAN KEEP HIM ENTERTAINED WHICH IS SOMETIMES NEEDED.. LOL
B00C28J2VQ|3.0|GI Joe retaliation is a fun,action film,which verges on the territory of a Saturday morning cartoon,and perhaps that's just what the film makers where going for. I never saw the first film but was still able to follow this movie without feeling as if I had really missed a lot, which was nice.<br /><br />The film did surprise me in at least one major part towards the beginning and though I felt the addition of \\"The Rock\\" was solid casting choice I didn't care much for the fact Road Block pretty much took over the film.<br /><br />The 3D has a few very nice pop out scenes,though 3D depth is pretty much obsolete for most of the film. A few scenes looked brilliant in 3D,while others appeared as missed opprotunities. It's almost worth giving the 3D a 4 out of 5 but it falls just short of being something great,which is a shame.<br /><br />If you're a fan of action films you can't go wrong here. GI Joe Retaliation has it all. Fist to fist,blade to blade,bullet to bullet. The only falter in the action is that while it has it all,it still leaves you wanting more by not having nearly enough of it.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Fun to play by yourself or with friends. I really like the Emojis. This was fun to play with my teen and toddler.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|It was difficult to find the 3rd season of Downton online. Not on Netflix or HuluPlus; only on Amazon. Worth finding it and worth the time. Shocked at the ending. Can't wait for Season 4.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|Recommended for every young girl, teen, and young woman for its depiction of respectable young ladies in spite of their own individual faults and shortcomings. An awesome story of four beautiful women \\"coming of age\\" with the greatest supporters being that of mother and father, and their one true friend,  Laurie.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging, baffling and addictive.  You will anxiously await additional rooms to challenge you abilities to think out of the box.  You won't be sorry or bored with this one.
B005HED08I|5.0|Love live steam! Quality was great! Classic Star Trek! Can't wait to see them all! Being part of prime, I got them free. What a great perk!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|If you like Masterpiece Theater and/or British TV this is a must see show.  This show really makes you root for the haves and the have nots.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|LOVE this  - -  I loved watching each episode without interruption.  I would recommend to anyone who likes the classics.  Very well done!
B009GX69RK|5.0|Very well written sitcom with a lot of 80's references! Very witty and you fall in love with the characters!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great basic calculator, accurate and nicely arraigned.  No problems with my Kindle fire.  Only suggestions would be multiple memories and programmable button.
0525953728|5.0|Wonderful read!!! I recommend for anyone who is a true Patriot. Well written and easy read....  This should be required reading in all public schools.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is simple and easy to use. I love it. I would recommend it to any one that wants to read or study God's word.
B00BY9GQHM|5.0|One of the best hidden object games for the kindle practically perfect for your kindle a must have.great gameplay and a great example of how a hidden object game should be made.recommend to all fans and friends.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|That was a awesomeness game my high score is over 3million and I'm goin to beat the world record so remember the name Kennedy
B00BJ9VBLI|1.0|A trilogy terrible game that I can't see the point in although I am sure some young yin would like , just as much as a lobotomy.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book was a call to action for me and the women I know in leadership. It inspires and informs women with careers in a way no other book has before.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|crashed the ipod, then tried it on the kindle fire and crashed that too, don't know what the issue is, deleted it!
B001AP11L6|2.0|This one turned out to be a disappointment. I'd rate it overall as average at best, and after repeated listening it's obvious that the production quality isn't great. I'd recommend figuring out which tracks you really like and picking up those one by one instead.
B00003CXS4|5.0|I can't say the physical product I received was any better or worse than any other you could buy. This movie is great and in a time of buying DVDs this was a great move on my part. Now, you can just stream it.
0486284735|4.0|Very good but if you don't have a wide vocabulary it'll be a little hard to read. Don't recommend to people looking for too much romance but overall wonderful.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Loved this game and looking forward to more. Challenging yet not so difficult to be frustrating. Nice graphics too. Woot!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|What a treat! A fantastic crew and a fun story. Malkovich is an absolute lunatic, and I love it! Bruce Willis is the calm one, for a change.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|And I don't say this about many novels or other works of art.  Depth of compassion and extraordinary story telling ability are what power this great novel.  For me, this novel ranks with the film The English Patient and the short story and film Brokeback Mountain, as being among my favorites of the past 10 to 20 years.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|The war described in this book is utterly cruel and it gives me a good dose of what are usually not described in other books or films about the war--- hardship and filthy living condition where men had to fight in. Through this book, Sledge presented us from eyes of a marine, the shock, fear and physical exhaustion they had to endure everyday. This book is a great vivid portrait  of the real lives fighting in that war and the great loss of the brave men.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I have installed and uninstalled this game all day and the update won't work. Keeps getting stuck on the Loading screen. I have two disappointed kids right now!!! FIX IT!!!
B00CDCIQX6|1.0|I bought the movie because of the headline stars, two of my favorites,  and I'm thinking &#34;how can ya go wrong with these two?&#34; and the time travel (sorta) theme is one I like in other shows, but 45 minutes into the movie, I'm still like &#34;ok, where are they going with this?&#34;.  Not much character development, the makeup was so good you couldn't tell which ones were the stars (kind of defeats the purpose, huh?) and if the description didn't tell you what was supposed to be happening beforehand, you sure couldn't figure it out on your own.  As I said, I bought it, but I deleted it without finishing it.  AT LEAST do yourself the favor of renting it first.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|I feel I need to review this movie based on what it's meant to be - a live action combination of the comic book and cartoon series from the 1980's.<br /><br />This movie hits those marks better than G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra with more GI Joe and Cobra style vehicles, weapons, and scenes.  One can imagine a comic book cover with the Cobra flag unfurled over the White House or Road Block driving that tracked vehicle fighting tanks with turrets that rise like a cobra's head!  Great visuals and some fun scenes.<br /><br />And what a great comic book premise to have all the major world leaders in one room using their own 'nuclear footballs\\" simultaneously in the ultimate game of brinkmanship!<br /><br />To enjoy this movie, one must set aside all expectations of reality - America's response to what's happening, a total absence of Congress and the Supreme Court, the military's willingness to follow wacky Presidential orders, and even the laws of physics.<br /><br />The biggest downside to this movie is the death of several main characters - both good and bad.  I don't remember such permanent endings to many of the comic books or any of the 80's cartoon episodes.  While I didn't expect this movie to end with \\"Knowing is half the battle\\" sequences, I was surprised with where it went because I assume it did well enough to merit a third installment in the series.
0375869026|5.0|Terrific storyline and message for both kids and adults. Read aloud for fifth graders and all of them enjoyed it. My favorite book!
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|Technically flawless effects mixed with heavy synthesizer music in a movie about the last humans on Earth after an alien invasion.  It all combines for an awesome homage to some of the great genre movies - The Road Warrior, Escape from New York, Planet of the Apes, and even Logan's Run.<br /><br />Though the movie has a great take on the concept - some would call it a twist - it does bog down a time or two because characters don't bother having necessary conversations when one expects them to do so.  I chalk this up to storytelling technique and it does allow for a better visual journey toward the answers.<br /><br />A minor quibble is that the alien invasion is shown to have started in 2017 but the human technology shown to exist at that time is at least several decades away.  I'm not sure why that date was chosen when a movie set in the future could have been written for any period of time, but it certainly doesn't detract from one's enjoyment of the film.<br /><br />One can tell the concept started as a graphic novel by taking in the amazing visuals of post apocalyptic America.  The flying chase sequence also has the hallmarks of storyboarded shots fleshed out to full motion effects.  Indeed, when I think back on the movie, a series of framed scenes pop out in my memory.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this movie.
B009SH5JS4|5.0|This is quite the nice film. Meg is adorable as usual, & Kevin is the typical Kevin Kline. I have been waiting quite awhile for this movie to come out in Blu-Ray & it was worth the wait. The Blu-Ray quality is really quite good. I was pleasantly surprised. Usually you wait to get the Blu-Ray copy & the quality is not what you are expecting. Not the case here. I can't comment on the audio as I am temporarily listening just through the tv speakers. It sounded good though & I didn't notice any drop off throughout this film. I'm sure it's pretty good though. The only Special Feature is a Trailer for the film. Why are these people so cheap  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I have the dvd copy & can see some extras there but not on my Blu-Ray. How sad  !!!!!!!!!!!  If you haven't seen this film & you like Kevin or Meg or both, I think you will enjoy this movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Now if you like free roaming games this is for you it's wonderful if you don't now<br />what minecraft is you have been missing out on a great game it's really worth<br />the money get it now
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|Honestly can't tell you how the whole movie was, because we didn't make it past the first 25 minutes it was so boring. Glad we didn't pay theater price to see it, but frankly disappointed we spent 3.99 on Amazon instant video.
B00E8B1P9M|2.0|So glad this was only a rental. It was ok, somewhat disappointing in the beginning. Lots of action scenes and humor kept me watching. I most likely will not watch again.
B0042RJWTC|1.0|When I received the copy of the Tudors the box looked brand new.  So I was really pleased I bought this for my wife for Christmas.  However after watching the first Disk I soon realized that the disk were all not working.  Squares kept coming up and for minutes at a time the picture became not viewable.  I was very disappointed.  Each consecutive disk the same result.  I complained to WHIRLY WORLD and their response was...............it was used!!!!!!  Better to Buy new........and Better not to buy from WHIRLY WORLD......................................and I am not the type to complain.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|It's flawless, like all of JT's work.  It's well-produced, well-written, well-performed...a strong Grammy contender in lots of categories, including Album of the Year, in my opinion.  If Michael Jackson was the King of Pop, Justin Timberlake is the Prince of Pop (and Bieber is the Fool of Pop)....My point is: I think this album might solidify his spot in the Pop Culture Museum :)
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Not sure what all the negative reviews were about and love how most start off with &#34;I usually don't write reviews.&#34;<br /><br />Love the romance, attachment and strength of Eva and Gideon's relationship. Every time you doubt Gideon like Eva does he surprises us once again.<br /><br />Sylvia Day's writing is exciting and exasperating!  Can't wait for the series to unfold.
B009Y61ZMI|4.0|Voice track was very quiet. The quality of the film was good and the movie itself was good too. Enjoy!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Loved it! Could not put it down! It kept my attention from beginning to end. I would recommend to everyone.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A universe and writing worthy of fiction fans everywhere to spend there time reading. My never ending search for new talented authors has yielded fruit yet again.<br /><br /> Reminiscent of works told by author's like Garth Nix, Arthur C. Clark, and Orson Scott Card. With a narrative that reads as well as any Stephen King book.<br /><br />I Loved it.
B00C1LIYWM|3.0|I'm a sucker for Nicholas Sparks, but was disappointed by this movie. I loved that he added suspense in the mix, but this movie didn't hold my interest. I kept thinking, \\"Is it over yet?\\" I'm a huge fan of Julianne Hough as well, but I felt her performance was a bit bland and there was no chemistry between her and Josh Duhamel. Redeeming qualities? The two plot twists. Definitely not one of his movies that I'll be watching again though.
B001AQQR2S|4.0|Mara Wilson was sweet and very expressive of emotions for her young age. Kid story but nice entertainment. Danny did his role well. Family viewing.
B005LAIHCM|3.0|The first hour of this movie, my husband and I made fun of it and almost turned it off. What we thought was the premise was ridiculous, so we couldn't take it seriously. I even questioned why Jennifer Lawrence had agreed to be in this film, as her other movies are usually decent. I'm glad we kept watching, because the plot twist was pretty great. I usually guess the plot twist, but this one got me good. Not the greatest scary or suspenseful movie, but worth the watch if you've got nothing better to do.
B001EBWINQ|5.0|Well directed. Humphrey Bogart was great. Ingrid Bergman was lovely. Good war time story, predictable but the storey was nicely spun.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Fantastic! I can not wait for book 6 to come out. Started reading the series when I watched all the Game of Thrones series and the books are way better.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Can't wait for the next one!  I liked the graphics and the story line and will definitely buy the next one when it comes out.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|This is a book that I think everyone can relate to! I love how the main character is narrating this book!! This a great book!!!!!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Great Action packed movie with lots of stars. The plot was good and the special effects made the movie a hit!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome if you don't want to pay the money you should because this is an awesome game
B00CW7KK9K|1.0|Where should I start? It does not connect, does not update when it actually connects! It took over 8 times resetting my iPhone to finally connect. Once bluetooth connected it took over 9hrs to update and somewhere along the lines it got stuck at about 70% and stayed there until the device battery died. Not sure if they pushed the product too early but this thing is not worth a penny. Please do yourself a favor and stay away!<br /><br />I own the scale, liked it but this thing is worthless.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|You have to read it to know what I mean. Good pace and interesting syfy.  I will read the next one.
0553582445|5.0|Ordered this book used and we were happy with the great condition it was in.  I think we will be buying used books from now on if this is any indication on what we will be buyng.
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|It is a wonderful approach to summarize the value proposition of ITIL when fully/ properly implemented along with some HBR style leadership scenarios.  The one aspect I completely disagreed with was the authors it security philosophy (and portrayal of the &#34;security guy&#34; ) in the land of IT?  It is EXACTLY his mentality (of managing risk by compliance requirement) that has made most companies so vulnerable today. Perhaps the author isnt as knowledgable in that particular area, or perhaps he's been the victim of business impeeded by bottom of the barrel resources that are all too often and miraculously made an instant security expert? In my mind if he really wanted to show the utopian dream, then more thought on front end SDLC integration, cultural change, and security as a competitive differentiator should have been part of this epic saga...<br /><br />Full disclosure, my career has led me across both/ all sides of this story so i see it from all the perspectives.
0385513755|4.0|I enjoyed this book immensely, even though I am not a novel reader. I like facts and informative reading, but Dan seems to do his homework well. It actually makes me want to go and visit these places he speaks of in the book and see how right he has got it. It seems to match up with other informative reads I have. It certainly gets you in.
B001N9ESQ4|4.0|Better than the first film, Before Sunrise but the actors are more mature now. The ability to portray regret, hope and doubt was outstanding by both
B0078ZTWP4|2.0|It is cheaper but I had to send one back because they are so cheaply made-order the name brand,which I have also, for a couple of bucks more and you will not have any problems
B0042U94UQ|5.0|well my wife and niece love this movie and to me its intertaining<br />for being animated it is worth buying
B00BI73CVI|1.0|Casting Hugh Jackman to play Valjean is like casting Fred Astaire to sing Rigoletto -- the result is neither fish nor fowl. Russell Crowe is also woefully miscast as Javier. These roles need strong voices; Crowe and Jackman just can't do it. The visuals are striking, but the musical disappointment is too great. The rest of the cast is musically very strong -- Eponine, Mariusz, Gavroche -- and there's a charming cameo of Colm Wilkinson as the Bishop, but if you want a good Les Miz, go to PBS and get the 25th Anniversary concert.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I think the hunger games was a excellent book and I would rate it five stars and I would recommend the book to about  middle school level
B009WUAK2M|3.0|Good action flick with lots of action from a long list of action stars from their own line of action movies.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I haven't been able to put this down since I downloaded it. Well done. Smooth gameplay and awesome graphics make this a game to enjoy for hours.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|This game is challenging enough to hold my interest but isn't so hard that I can't play it when I only have a couple of free minutes.
B009DCOU9S|2.0|I spend more time reading text than I do solving any puzzles. I would like more puzzles and a little less text. The puzzles are good when you finally get to them. I can't rate any higher due to the fact that I get bored with all the text. If I wanted to read I would open a book.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Awesome season. Really keeps you guessing and I loved the surprise twists. I highly recommend. Can't wait to see season 2!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|A simply amazing book about a wonderful boy.. This book moved me completely... I loved the book and I recommend it
B000HKYNQ0|5.0|This was and is and ever shall be the consummate science fiction series.  Watch the series that started it all.
B00821OX98|5.0|It is refreshing to have a show not steeped in all the &#34;reality&#34; B.S. that has taken over most programming.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|While the Weather Channel is still a useful app, I liked the previous version better.  I think it was easier and more intuitive to use.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I'm a Potter-head--a middle-aged fan.  I got involved with the books and movies because my sons were reading the books.  I heard a lot of bad press about the books/movies from a few religious groups, and I thought I better check them out before I let my sons continue reading the books.  I found nothing wrong with the books or movies, and I fell in love with the world of Harry Potter.  (Although religion isn't addressed in the book, there is the universal theme of good versus evil; love triumphs over hate; and self sacrifice for others is the ultimate Christ symbol, so I had no problem reconciling my faith with the books/movies.)  My individual DVD's were getting ragged (I can watch the movies numerous times), so I wanted an entire set.  This is a sleek, thin collection that fits in my storage cabinet easily (I can now retire my older DVD's and have more room to spare!).
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Did I say that I love this show?  One of the good shows on tv today.  Go watch it, you'll love it too!
0783233477|5.0|I just had to buy this film for my sons to view--they've never seen it, and I've always loved the story line and the musical score.  It is a slower-paced fantasy film, but they found it immensely entertaining--quite a feat since they are more &#34;action&#34; type fellas.  Very happy with purchase.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I really must read all the tips on Kindle Fire.  Especially pertaining to aps.  I go to something & it says I can read this with or without www.  But it doesn't work when I try it off-line.
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|The director has made this series his own by tying it inexorably to LOR, shamelessly and I might add masterfully. A classic rewritten to match the vision of a genius that had his share of wedgies, relax and go with it fellow nerds. Na-nu.
B004478AS4|1.0|No credible story line, no interesting events.  Author shows very little writing skills. Bland with no real story line. Waste of time.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I am fairly new to Match 3 games.  I like this one because it gives you 3 options for your playing choices.  It certainly is addictive!  I find the play to be a bit sluggish as compared to Dragon Gem, but having 3 different options for playing makes up for that.  I find the graphics to be a bit blurry (nothing really bad) and maybe it's because it's not a HD game...at least that is what I am assuming.  (I have a Kindle Fire HD.)  But, for a free game, I thought it was good.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I never saw Twilight until after Eclipse came out, but I watched them all in order and then started reading all of the books.  By now I have probably read all of the books at least three times. I read Breaking Dawn (for the first time) before the movie came out.  In my opinion, it's just a wonderful love story.  Once you start reading (any one of the books), it's just hard to stop.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book, though it made me cry and I had to put it down at times. I don't know if the author had someone very close die of cancer or not but if he didn't he seemed to capture the thought process of a young lady going through a terminal illness well. Some things those of us who are healthy might never think about since we are, well, healthy. An added bonus was finding out in the reading that this story as  based in Indianapolis, Indiana which is my home town as well a  the authors. I recommend this book to anyone, especially if you've lost a loved one, close friend etc to cancer.
0545265355|5.0|I couldn't believe how good these books were! When the movie came out I figured I would read the books first and I am so glad I did. These are my new favorite books, I even lent them to my mom to read and she loved them as well! Great Box Set.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|It is not as fun as when I started playing the game. It is not as fun as it was 4months ago.<br />I feel the the game is veering towards making you HAVE to buy credits in order to win BINGO &/or get the collection items.<br /><br />I had a lot of trouble with their elite setting. I had bought the elite package and cancel after 2 months. Two months later, I decided to rejoin. For several months, the received my payments but the game wouldn't put me back in the 'elite' status. Several months I sent emails telling them I was not getting upgraded to the elite membership & what it offered. I asked them to please upgrade account. After 3 months of them receiving payment & me NOT receiving the membership, I stated I wanted a full refund.<br />I finally got it and have not tried to be elite again.
B00E193Y36|5.0|First, I love FFDP (who doesn't?) but the live stuff is amazing on this CD.  Have you ever heard a drum solo on a CD?  Yea, me either - this album is BY FAR one of the best I've heard in a long time.  The interaction between FFDP and the audience is uplifting.  Buy the deluxe version, you will NOT regret it!!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This little thing comes in handy all around the house, not just with my Kindle. My puppy actually chewed on it and it still works perfectly!
B003UBTX7C|5.0|Easy summer read. The characters in this book seem like old friends to me now. Wish there were more like it
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book pulled me in from page one and the intense excitement did not end until I put it down. I made my friend read it. Just so I could talk about the ending with her.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This book was extremely hard to read due to the brutality but I think it is important to read it.  What a brave and amazing person to come out the other end of that nightmare so honest and loving.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Great game..absorbing..and fun.  One of the  best..free or paid I have found.  Sort of \\"takes me away from it\\" for a while.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I give this book a 5 star rating. It's not to hard to understand an it's great for kids. Good job !
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Really enjoying this show.  Engaging from the start and I am looking forward to watching the next series.  You will enjoy it!
B009DCOU9S|5.0|The game is very easy to understand and follow unlike some. Background music nice, graphics good. Nice game for kindle fire. Way to go .developers can pat there selves on the back.
1439156816|5.0|I loved this book. I recommend this book for the writer and for the non-writer, because it is a fascinating book. You will not be disappointed. I was surprised at how much I liked it. I am not a fan of Steven King's books mainly because they are just not my type of book, But now I may check out his non-horror books. I love the way he writes. I also walked away from this book liking Stephen King very much. Great book, check it out.
B007T9UIMA|5.0|This has to be one of the best concert DVDs I have ever seen. If you love 1D like I do then you must have this in your DVD collection. It is cute and fun to watch any day!
B006MW3UZW|1.0|I paid extra for the HD version, but AFTER completing the transaction, I was informed that the resolution might be reduced if my internet connection is not fast enough. And that is exactly what happened. The resolution is FAR from HD. In fact, it is awful. That's irritating enough, but what really makes me mad is that I DO NOT have a slow internet connection. I have a 5mb DSL connection and that is plenty fast enough to watch streaming video from other sites in HD.<br /><br />And why can't I download the damned episodes so that I can watch them later in HD? I paid for them. There are instructions for downloading to Kindle, but I'm watching on a PC with the Kindle app. Why can't I download to that?<br /><br />My advice is DO NOT pay extra for the HD version. Go to Pirate Bay instead. That's what I did.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I am a list maker and found it to be easy to figure out.  Bottom line, easy, fun and I like the color choices.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|One of the best books I have read. Get the tissues ready, but so worth your time. I would re-read this which is rare.
B000002MK8|5.0|I love this album, have I told you are one of my very favorite<br />tonight's the night, and Mandolin Wind I enjoy too<br />I'm very pleased with this album.
0920668372|5.0|Along with the Bible :) every home needs this book. Whether you are entering parenthood or nestling the grand kids on your lap, this book is for you! Tho it is an analogy, it portrays the unconditional love of parent to child and the wonderful transference of that ability to pass it on. I don't think a small child can really appreciate it, but rather the its the reader that reaches for the tissue as he or she reflects and yet lives in forward motion.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is really cool to play for all u horse lovers u just have to be claim and patient some times.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love playing this game!  it gets better the farther you run and the more levels you clear. I play all the time. I highly recommend this game!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Side down your your bar^up there then press sync. Sync is amazon checking and update for ALL your apps.btw don't be in the app .for Jesse hope this works for up<br />:) press yes if helped minecraft is awesome
B00E8B1358|3.0|Not a bad movie. Not great either. It reminded me of the expendables, but with less star power and action. I won't own this movie.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is a legal drama with kind of a soap opera technique.  The story line continues from week to week.  It is fun to watch here to watch the episodes quicker than live TV.
B000FC2PKG|4.0|I really like this book and would recommend it to others. I love DD and so glad that she really exists
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I especially liked the characters - not a bunch of steroid stars, but people with experience and talent who carried this through to the great ending.  The perfect lead-in to &#34;Red2.&#34;
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My whole family loves it.  Fun, challenging &amp; addictive. Love to challenge my friends.  Wished there was an easier way to earn coins or have more things to buy with bananas.  overall - great game.
B009ZQC7MY|2.0|This program is too soap-opera-ish.  A shallow TV drama that could be happening anywhere or at anytime.  I preferred Upstairs Downstairs (even the newer WWII era episodes) because although it had its elements of drama, Upstairs Downstairs did a better job of incorporating the history and zeitgeist of the period in which it was set.  I also found the characters, the downstairs ones in particular, more sympathetic and better drawn in Upstairs, Downstairs.
B00881VLCE|4.0|This is so much fun to play, and it has so many options. You can change the size and difficulty of each puzzle. Very easy to use, and nothing to pick up after. Great way to burn some time.
B0000DZEE3|5.0|Used to watch this all the time in college, great to have it on DVD. Best concert captured on video, everyone should watch this.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|My wife got me hooked on this one. Fun &amp; easy to play, it's really kind of addictive. Unless you want to buy more lives, you run out after 5 of them. I like it that way otherwise I'd be playing it all day.
B009DCOU9S|3.0|Nothing spectacular so I'm glad it was a free app of the day.<br />Easy childs game. Just hidden objects with a storyline
B005CVWWJY|5.0|A fun interesting read littered with references to many of the movies, games and bit of history we love.  What a blast.  Glad I bought it.
B001HM1PFO|5.0|This movie is actually very good.  Well written, great songs, good actors.  Very interesting theme, very creative.  I don't like the audience participation at the theater, it detracts from the movie.  Tim Curry's best role yet.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|been waiting to watch this movie forever! it was good some parts where funny! but i think they just tried to hard in other parts!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Modern day LA Law.  Interesting cases as well as interesting characters and plot lines.  What's not to love.  You also get some excellent views of New York city.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey is addicting. The characters draw you in first. They story is compelling and the drama is amazing. But it's the acting that holds it all together. There are no holes. You hate and love the characters as everything feels so real. Grab a bottle of wine, sit down, and watch from Season 1. By the time you get to season 3, you will feel like part or the Crowley house and dying for more.
B002GYI9C4|4.0|I wasn't able to predict the final twist, which is always good. Great read; it entertained me across the Atlantic.
B003TSEL7S|4.0|It was good ,but could be a little bit better. So I would most likely recommend this book to a  friend.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|If you don't mind camp-this is for you. There is something endearing about a boy who loves a girl-dead heart and soul. There can be some things read into this movie-if you really need to find artistic meaning-but mostly its just a bunch of fun. Enjoy!
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Reading it for a Book Club.  Difficult to really get into it but it's growing on me. Can't wait for the discussion.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Nowhere as good as his best and a bit farfetched but not a waste of time. Told in the first person.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Bingo Blitz is the absolute best Bingo game out there......none can compare.  Its' available for PC's, Ipads/Iphones, Kindle Fire, and android phones/tablets.  Once you start playing, you will get hooked!  Join the fun!
B0017TYPIG|4.0|brand new movie, still in wrapper, you can't get anymore classic than a paul newman movie.Very satisfied good job. Thanks
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I like playing but it can be frustrating due to Buffalo Studio's customer service with automated responses with complaints of frozen games and lost purchased credits. I have recommended this game to several people and they have the same problems. You have to send your ID number, transaction number and asked if the system you are using using is updated REAPETADLY!<br />I do want to note AMAZON has ALWAYS been very helpful with refunding what they can but Buffalo Studio customer service is very non-responsive.<br />I would recommend and should take my own suggestion,to just play FREE play and DO NOT purchase any credit from Buffalo Studio.
B004VFN7BE|3.0|Scary movie. Probably wont recommend it to any friends.  Not a movie that i'd bother watching again. It was kind of odd.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Really had so much fun playing this game. Literally could not put it down. Would recommend to all my friends.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great book. Kyle expresses what he saw and his opinion with no holds barred. A very readable account of the war and what it was like to be in the middle of battle after battle. You may disagree with his stance and arrogance, but he was in a kill or be killed situation. Where were you?
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this story it made me mad, it made me happy, it left me wanting. One of the best stories I read in a while !
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|SURPRISED THAT I HAVE NEVER HEARD OFTHE LEADING ACTRESS&#62;  I AM SURE WE ALL WILL NOW&#60; AFTER THIS OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE&#62;
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved this story it made me mad, it made me happy, it left me wanting. Great story, one of the best in a while!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|With inspired storytelling, Hosseini says that lives are shaped not by what people want, by what people fear; that fear keeps them stuck, or co- opted by a culture of power and privilege, or running away. Even so, the main characters learn to love deeply.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|I chose this cd because I heard Leonard Cohen once and wanted to hear more.  I love the way he tells  a story, his voice is captivating and he keeps it current.  I would recommend him to anyone I know to listen to at least once, that's all it takes..
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|I thought that this film was touching.  I love classical music so that was another benefit.  I have always been a Maggie Smith fan.  I thought that she performed admirable well.  The whole cast did!  However, keep in mind that I am of their generation so the movie had a more poignant message for me.  If you have the opportunity to rent or buy it, go for it.
1594489505|5.0|I chose this book because I read the kite runner and wanted more.  I like to travel and enjoy learning about other cultures and wish more people could do both.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in humanity and what makes people who they are.
B006S01GH2|4.0|A quirky awkward little girl transforms into a somewhat quirky and socially withdrawn woman who find the route to liking others and herself.  I recommend it.
159463176X|5.0|I chose this book because I read the authors other two books and thought this would be equally as good and I was right.  This book was different as much as it dealt with family situations on a personal level, contained in another culture, and over a period of time.  Written with great sensitivity as the authors other two books were too.
B00B3EJ292|5.0|I added this to my list of all time favorite movies.  So tender, so touching, so happy, so sad, so well acted.  What a wonderful story.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I liked this game it was fun to play.it did save your game at every chapter of the story.so it was easy for me just to finish the chapter when it says your game is saved.I have read whare some people said the game didn't save there game that's because it saves the chapter of your game.I had no. Problem with the game.I just couldn't wait to get to the end to see who stole the book.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|VERY well done.However ,the main character does not always<br />Have to be kidnapped or abducted.Try something new.I like these novels but be a little creative.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|At first I thought it was going to be stupid but I love the app it's just awesome love it
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I had it on my phone for a while. love it on my kindle. very addicting got the glitches out
140006922X|1.0|I salute Fox New's Lauren Green's heroic interview with jihadist Reza Aslan. Most of the controversy is around the fact that Ms. Green asks the question why a committed Muslim would write a book about Jesus. It's a good question given the fact that Islam is based on a dream by an illiterate drug addict that needed a Jewish man to write down his ramblings since he was incapable of reading and writing. The real question is why this book which is nothing short of Christian bashing is not being condemned by those who would go bonkers if a Catholic or Jewish scholar wrote a book attacking the so called prophet. This double standard has to stop.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Great fun. Nice strategy  game  and relaxing would recommend this game for any family member  can't stop playing<br />Good luck
B0034DGPEU|3.0|Somewhat predictable read.  Initial premise started out promising, but overall character develoment was lacking.  easy to foresee the final outcome.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|Came quickly and was just what I wanted. Easy to use and looks great. I recommend it to those who want a good cover for their Kindle Fire HD.
1439153663|5.0|I loved this story. I found myself not being able to put it down.<br />The story is one of servants before the civil war. There are many sad stories within, each character is seemingly touched by heartache.<br />I loved that the main character, Lavinia, who was a servant after her family died on the boat from overseas. She is very young. Most of the other servants are black skinned. She doesn't see the skin color, they are all the same. She doesn't realize how there is supposed to be a difference after her station elevates. She is still the same, loving girl.<br /> The authors final notes are what really gave me a chill. I believe her... this story had to be told.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|why no candy crush app without hurting my computer and who knows what else the game called lollipops will be just fine
B003G4W49C|4.0|I have read and reread &#34;Ender's Game&#34; many times. I love the themes of &#34;thinking outside the box&#34; and valuing excellence. Wonderful messages here.
B002ZIAC26|5.0|After purchasing BLOOM I needed another Beach House fix and TEEN DREAM does not disappoint.  This CD has an almost Breakfast in America by Supertramp vibe.  It is<br />definitely a CD that must be listened to in its entirety to be fully appreciated.<br />The music is layered and textural. The vocals are haunting and hypnotic.  Beach House is a band in and of itself.  Their sound is unique and addictive.  I am so thrilled Amazon recommended them to me because I would never have found this band on my own.  Their music is enriching my life on many levels. I have also discovered their videos and they don't disappoint either. I hope this band continues to make music for a long time. Highly recommended.
B0063M22QO|5.0|The tiles are pretty interesting and are easy to match quickly.  Next time I'm going to try the timed game since haven't gotten stuck yet.  It's fast paced, works correctly and well done!
B007LNJ4YW|5.0|I bought this Cd without knowing anything about the band. This is such a textural piece of music. The lyrics are hidden away in lush ambience in a dreamlike aural landscape. I don't know if the singer is male or female or if there is more than one singer. All I know is the sound is hypnotic and ethereal. I love this CD so much I have gone on and ordered TEEN DREAM.  It's just as good. I would highly recommend this CD to anyone who loves to listen to entire pieces of a CD in one sitting or while traveling. BLOOM is a symphony and totally sounds unlike anything else I have in my entire CD collection.  Beach House's BLOOM is like a Zen experience one would have staying at a real beach house. Highly recommended.
0345525558|5.0|loved the story, the characters, the mystery, and learned a lot about flowers....I love gardening so it was a hit all the way around.
B004SKLD9A|4.0|Although it is probably a result of parallel creative writing, this story is markedly  similar to This Perfect Day + Fahrenheit 451. Add in stop motion fight scenes (al a Matrix) and you get this moody cautionary tale. And it was actually quite an intelligent take on where our society seems to be headed... (ie. politically correct thinking and all that). I love the aspects \\"borrowed\\" from \\"This Perfect Day\\" the most... the bits about controlling emotions being a crucial step towards peace... because I believe there is an element of truth in that concept. The puppy really won me over though, coming at a slower moving part of the story, I really got hooked on the fate of this dog. I have this movie on both DVD and Blu-Ray and I am glad to have this clearer and crisper Blu-Ray copy... and I encourage all you budding political philosophers out there to buy it as well. MAYBE IF ENOUGH PEOPLE DO, SOMEONE WILL MAKE A MOVIE OF \\"THIS PERFECT DAY\\"
0385347774|3.0|It was a fascinating story but I did not like the way it ended. Sort of left me with a feeling of hopelessness! so these two are going to spend the rest of their lives together looking over their shoulder's?
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I didn't think I could prepare my book for Kindle without the help of a professional.  But, with this book and a little patience I did it myself.  I had to print it so I would have it at my side while doing each step but that was easy enough.  I would suggest a little more clarity from the author but after reading each segment several times it gets easier.  I would definitely reccommend this book to anyone who has not yet uploaded a book on Kindle and even if you have, it's a good reference.
B000W453KQ|5.0|This is just a great story of substance versus beauty. A classic! It is kind of sentimental and has a great love sing. Very nostalgic.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Insightful,touching,informative<br />Read this for book club.  Everyone learned and thought more about the obvious and not obvious plight of a quadriplegic.  It was. A good read and discussion about relationships.
B000OZ0NXA|2.0|I had been looking for another author to read and Reacher came up twice in a day by 2 of my friends.  I got the first in the series and was ready to be entertained.  I had to actually stop reading because it started slow and never got better.  There doesn't seem to be any depth or interesting plots or I should say plot in this case. I read Follett, Crichton, Elegant, Dan Brown and Jeffery Archer and enjoy their writing skills.  I'll have to bring this up with my friends who read Reacher, maybe this was just one bad book of his.
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|Oz the Great and powerful WOW!  In 3D it's amazing the Vibrant colors and sets that make this wonderland movie come to life are amazing!  James Franco is at his BEST and you won't forget the final Battle - done in such a way a to keep you on the edge of your seat!  Buy it and enjoy the fun!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is very easy to use. Nice big numbers, easy viewing. best calculator app I've eve used. Would recommend to anyone
B00D6B4PUG|4.0|Good to have the email/gmail account just one click away on my Kindle as I always have it with me where ever I go.
B008FPOIT6|2.0|I originally thought this book was going to be somewhat of a fantasy novel, but it ended up not being that at all. The book is very focused on technology (GOOGLE GOOGLE GOOGLE), and it just had a vibe to it I didn't care for.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I am only beginning the game, so far it's interesting, I love a challenge and it seems to<br />Get more challenging as I progress. I will definitely keep playing!
B005LHOKFS|5.0|I was recently in Aruba and I downloaded this app before going. It really helped me find the great things to do on the island, and weed out the junky things to do. I will be using TripAdvisor from now on! A+ App
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|fun game for all types of age.  a must download to have in different types of devices, graphics are very good too!
B005EHQGTS|5.0|This application truly brings my desktop in high definition right to my Kindle.  It has wonderful built in support to help you get connected. Being able hear your pc sound is even more of a benefit.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Insightful and a quick, easy read. Full of information I need as a new husband who was speaking the wrong love languages from Day 1. That has since been remedied!
0316077046|4.0|I am loving this series. Once again I was dragged into this original world of Casters. I'm probably in the minority here, but I actually enjoyed Beautiful Creatures a lot more than Beautiful Darkness, even with the slower pace of Beautiful Creatures. This one frustrated me at times and not the good kind of frustrated, the kind of frustrated where I needed to step away from the book. With that being said I did enjoy the story and thought it was a good addition to the series.<br /><br />I freaking love Ethan, and not in the OMG he is so swoony way, but in the you are such an amazing character kind of way. He survives a crazy world with a crazy girlfriend and will not back down or give up. Also, I love that the guy is the normal one. I've said that before, but it's worth repeating. I love that he is the one trying to save the day despite not being the most powerful.<br /><br />Then we have Lena. I wanted to strangle Lena on numerous occasions. I don't want to go into too much detail, but just know that Lena is very annoying in this one. Annoying to the point where I was rooting for Ethan to just give up on her. Aside from Lena though, there were some other great characters. I loved Link because he is just too funny. I also loved the addition of Liv. She was a great character and I thought a great addition to the story. I'm very curious to see what happens with her.<br /><br />I know many people complain about the length of these books, but I honestly don't have that problem. I love that the story is drawn out slowly. It's slow, but you can't look away. It's a good kind of slow. I never get bored and the book never feels as long as it actually is. The plot is great and always keeps me guessing. I love the Caster world and the new creatures we are constantly meeting and I love that nothing is ever as it seems.<br /><br />My complaint with this book is that I missed the history aspect. The Civil War played a huge role in Beautiful Creatures and I would have liked to see that continue in Beautiful Darkness. The history was still important, but I feel as if it wasn't as present in the story. Also one more thing. I felt like people kept showing up out of nowhere just when you needed them. Sure there was always a reasoning the authors included, but it just seemed constant. Every time Ethan was in trouble, someone would conveniently be where they needed to be to help him out. Aunt Prue is probably the best example of this. For those who have read it, I just had a hard time accepting that one.<br /><br />All in all, Beautiful Darkness is a great addition to the series, even if it did follow some of the typical second book patterns. I'm looking forward to whatever else is in store for Ethan and Lena.
1564029654|5.0|We read this book at the beginning of every year in my classroom and return to it throughout the year. Whenever a child is missing their grown up, we always remind them that their grown up always comes back for them, just like Sarah, Percy, and Bill's mama came back for them. It's an especially perfect purchase for an anxious first time school-goer.
B00CA3C1N4|5.0|This is a great game to pass the time with. Only real downside is that it takes a while to build up the experience points so that you can get the better perks.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I had never heard of this book before searching one evening for a new sci-fi read when I saw how many other positive reviews this received so I decided to give it a go. This book lived up to all the 5 star reviews and then some.<br />I honestly found the first chapter or two a little slow, but then I quickly became engrossed in it and couldn't put it down.<br />Character development, scene description, plot, everything about this book made it one of the best sci-fi books I've ever read. If your sitting on the fence not sure if you want to read it, trust this reviewer's opinion and get it. You won't regret it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great fun! Totally recommend if you like the movie. Even if you don't know or like the movie, this is just a really fun game and very well made.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Love this series but enough already. Let's get to the heart of it. They r married so at this point any adversity they hit better be together or its just a step back for the sake of another book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is much fun I play it all the time I love it it is the best game ever love it
B009GCF3Q4|5.0|like all Michael Connelly books it is a must read... enjoyed it to the fullest .. I love a good mystery and this did not disappoint.
0810989956|5.0|My son loved the book and making the story his own. This was a great book to travel with, which kept him busy.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|i lovee this game it is so fun but the onlt thing is i am only on level 5 lol
B000YABS8E|5.0|It carries a lovable way of moving through events that, while not very surprising, do hold several adorable events - for example, the accidental beating up of an all too aggressive bully. The ending may be the most lovable and charming ending possible as well. I may not be able to claim that it shocks me with unbelievable turnabouts - but I don't feel that it needed to. It simply kept everything together well enough through the entire movie that I didn't feel myself craving randomly shifting and excessively dramatic scenes.
0788812408|5.0|My 8-year-old daughter loves this movie. She watches it at least every other day since we got it. It's funny and good for young children.
B003TTH4IU|4.0|Great show! Grey's anatomy is even better the second time around. I'm watching from the beginning and its like a new show!
B009GI8J1O|3.0|Didn't want the video clips but it was the only version available at $14.99. The book is great, just a shame you get ripped off
B003R0MF1W|5.0|iT IS AN EXCELLENT SERIES LOVE THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE CHARACTERS. ALSO LOVE THE IDEA OF<br />BEING A CONTINOUS STORY TO A FINAL END
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Game looked fun. Downloaded it, watched the dumb little movie that it does not let you skip over, then it just froze and wouldnt load. Dont waste your time.
B001CTDH76|5.0|iT IS AN EXCELLENT SERIES LOVE THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE CHARACTERS. ALSO LOVE THE IDEA OF<br />BEING A CONTINOUS STORY TO A FINAL END
B009WUAK2M|3.0|If it weren't for all the older action heroes it wouldn't have been worth the time or effort to watch Stallone and cast are doing what they have done for years. Not much effort in acting and certainly nothing new.
B0030IIYYS|5.0|We had to complete our set. We had 1 and 3 but was missing 2! My grand kids love this trilogy  and watch it over and over again!
B001JI72AI|5.0|After returning from the Kennedy Space Center with our 11 year old grandson this was a good movie to watch!<br />Well done, fine acting almost a tragedy!
B001O5LVPI|5.0|Bought it to replace a ruined VHS tape. My grand kids love this movie!! Cute and entertaining! It was a must to replace.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This is not your typical hidden object game.  You have to solve the mystery based on clues you find around town.  The game proves to be challenging at times, but that makes it enjoyable.  The hidden object aspect comes into play as you progress.  The story is really interesting and involved, and it tends to be surprising and chilling.  I look forward to the upcoming part two.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|really fun got it for my kid and ended up playing it myself lol. the graphics are very life like and you get addicted fast.
B0045EA1P6|4.0|The album is definitely enjoyable, although not quite as catchy as their second album. I've definitely enjoyed listening to it, though.
B00E8B1P9M|1.0|Writing this review is painful, because to do so I have to recall all the parts of the movie I didn't like, which is like recalling all the details of a root canal.<br /><br />But, for the sake of the human race, here I go.<br /><br />I imagine the pitch for this movie went something like this:<br />&#34;OK OK, we want a scene where London blows up, then another scene where Snake Eyes gets in a fight on the side of a mountain, throw some space super weapons, then, to top it off, we'll throw in Bruce Willis!&#34;<br />&#34;Why?&#34;<br />&#34;Because Bruce Willis! Oh, and then use whatever money we have leftover to string all those scenes together with one of those things we used to make...what were they called again?&#34;<br />&#34;A story?&#34;<br />&#34;Right. Just staple one of those to the film. But don't use pencil. Those are expensive. Use crayons.&#34;
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|One of the first games I purchased for the Fire HD. Not sure how I stumbled upon it, but really enjoyed it. So much so, it seemed too short! Hope more is on the way.<br />I'm looking forward to having my son try it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game everybody should have this game! My kids love ot and i do to like it to so you should get it
B003FHMHPQ|5.0|Loved it. Now I know I'm a wise one thanks to Doreen Virtue. Very easy to read and to understand.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Won't stop loading please help me what should I do I can't figure it out I tried UN an RE installing it
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|I love buying books on kindle, so convenient and so easy. Kudos! The book was very interesting and easy to follow.
B004U8VX2M|5.0|Still fun to watch even many years later. Its my first time watching this classic show, I want to watch this before I watch the New Upstairts Downstairs.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|I enjoyed this movie a lot. it took a while for all the threads to come together but came together seamlessly
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|This is a terrible app, it takes forever to load, you play fora fee seconds, then it wants you to buy something, not worth the free price or time to download, shamefully greedy game just trying to steal your money and time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Everyone in the family loves and plays this game. 5 stars. Highly recommend this game, although it is addictive and hard to put down.
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|An instant classic, they have installed some very strange software on these discs, when you place them in your cd player you are unable to remove them.  There are only a few true LEGENDS left in the world of music and film, make sure you see Buddy Guy live, he is not just a guitar player, he is an ENTERTAINER, and lets not forget he is a Louisiana Man like myself.  I am so happy for Buddy on being inducted into the Kennedy Center, I am 57 and Buddy make me feel great to see someone in their prime in their 70s.  Buddy is not going quietly and nether am I.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|After continuously playing the game on a family members' phone, they bought me a Kindle so that I could play games on my own device.  (I still have an original flip pay-as-you-go phone).  This game is even better on a bigger screen.  This is basic, which means I can figure it out, and I understand why so many people enjoy it.
B000GCFX36|4.0|Love this series of books.  I've read this one two or three times.  Love the characters, the situations, the humor with a touch of sorrow.  Great summer read.
B004BSFC46|3.0|A friend of mine recommended these because her baby just loved them.  My daughter is mainly annoyed by them being on her wrists. Also the rattling sound isn't loud enough.  She can barely hear it, so doesn't connect that she is the one making the sound.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|The DropBox app is a fully featured and reliable data-backup app that synchronizes files between your device and your dropbox account.  It supports selective sync, Wi-Fi sync, cellular data on/off, and a simple browsing interface.  Everything is reliable, easy to use and works well.  It's a shame that the NSA can spy on all of it though.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Usually, books that I really like are character-driven.  Many of my reviews focus on development of character.  Well, this book is all about characters.  I can't say too much more without giving the plot away, but if you are like me and automatically side with the protagonist in a book, then this is for you.  I really could have done without the majority of the second part of the book - or maybe even all of it.  Still, I really enjoyed this and found myself staying up too late to read more.
B004DMIIVO|5.0|There is basically nothing about this movie that I don't love. All of the characters were fantastic and understandable, the concept was fantastic, and the plot was so riveting I couldn't look away for a minute.
B00CRVZRUS|5.0|Ahh.  The days of early music video.  No attempt at serious, just goofy, silly, randomly produced and directed and GREAT FUN.  The music is the same HELP and Beatles you've grown up with - and still every bit as good as it was in the 60's.  The remastering quality make this fun to watch from time to time and glad to own.
B000Q76K1A|5.0|This is a great movie. I haven't read the book(s), but I kind of want to now because I like the movie(s) so much.<br /><br />In my opinion, this is a flawless movie. I have no complaints.<br /><br />I highly recommend to all who like action movies with a little mystery.
B00577WFZE|5.0|Had &#34;Calling Card&#34; in vinyl back in the day, loved it, but lost touch.  Just this past couple of years, started getting back in to Rory - and he is just so good, can't believe I waited this long.  Sessions is wonderful work, well mastered and very enjoyable - for a road trip or bourbon & cigar on the deck.  Recommend this highly.
6300274195|4.0|A great movie for the kids, though I wish there was more music throughout.<br /><br />The animations and storyline are both great.<br /><br />I highly recommend to those who like Disney classics and for parents looking for a clean and entertaining film to show to the kids.
B009DCOU9S|3.0|An okay search game.  Not so easy that everything is just in plain sight. There is a bit of hunting for an item to open another and sometimes a puzzle to solve. Pretty typical of the hidden item genre.
1455526959|3.0|This was my first full-length Connelly novel to read, and I found it very easy to follow and decently suspenseful. There are some okay turnabouts and surprises here, but it didn't quite deliver in a really satisfying way. Like many novels in this genre, THE BLACK BOX just follows a fairly ho-hum plot formula. Stylistically speaking, the writing is flat, with a hastily churned out flavor to it, and much of the dialogue is horribly unrealistic, e.g.: \\" 'It was not my intention to have a situation like this,' [unpopular bureaucratic police Lieutenant O'Toole] said. 'My hope had been to promote strong and trusting relationships with the detectives in my squad.'\\" Connelly also has the annoying habit of over-explaining certain common-knowledge details such as Harry Bosch explaining to his partner--and, by proxy, to the audience--what a \\"black box\\" on an airliner is.
B0012GMW34|5.0|The title of  the review is a nod to Rahsaan Roland Kirk, but it is appropriate for the title of this disc also. Love Devotion Surrender: 3 acts of the will. The question is how do they proceed one from another? Does Love engender Devotion resulting in Surrender, or are other interpretations just as valid? Three travelers of the spiritual pathways: Shri Chinmoy, Mahavishnu, and Devadip. Jazz, McLaughlin, and Santana: 3 elements necessary for this recording to work. The question to be answered concerns just how well this offering works.<br /><br />It appears that Shri Chinmoy helped to bring Mahavishnu to Devadip, and McLaughlin brought Santana to Jazz. However it worked, it may not have been complete or totally mature, but the document they produced is well worth your time and the little amount of money that it will set you back these days. Technically, the disc sounds quite clean.<br /><br />Personally, I have encountered the music recorded here at several different junctures during the last 40+ years. Luckily for me, and this recording, every time I found it, I realize that the music does not sound dated. I feel that each time it enters my consciousness it is brand new, or at least sounds that way to me. Of course, that reaction may have more to do with my evolving level of enlightenment, deepening understanding, and/or advancing aging.
B00AEFY66U|4.0|I think this version is much better than the new one. Redford plays a superior role to DiCaprio in my opinion.
B008YCMM2A|5.0|Three CDs of Miles Davis and an undocumented band kicking Bitches Brew-period music to the Continentals. Miles & Co. do cover a few other items not too far antecedent to the B.B. release. It is always a revelation to hear them reinterpret the same musical selections as if they had never performed them any other way than what they were producing at that very moment. Jazz at its best; improvisational and never played by rote.<br /><br />Technically, a great sounding set of recordings. The music is still new nearly 45 years later. A no-brainer purchase at a great price if you are a Miles maniac. If you want your jazz live on CD, then this set is a first choice option. If you want the rarely heard, but long-rumored relic, then you need to order this today.<br /><br />N.B., The DVD is not being reviewed here. I need a bit more time to delve into it. It should be in play rotation soon.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My very literate friend gave me CDs for the first two seasons and I was hooked.  Thank goodness I had purchased a ROKU 3 for my cabin and was able to finish Season 3.  The season finale might be a little melodramatic, but there must be a reason for it.  I will wait to see.
B008Y7D4FY|5.0|Good scary movie.  A lot of new scary movies show too much in the way of the monster or antagonist.  This movie hits the balance of showing scary scenes but still allows the viewer to use their imagination to create the scary.  You WILL turn the lights on at night after watching this.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Season 3 shows The Good Wife is holding up well with each new season. The excellent cast is stable and they continue to introduce interesting and well-cast guest stars. With any luck this series will continue for another 4 or 5 years!
B000HL2J0G|4.0|Season 1 of MacGyver is the best. This is before he got the salon hair-do they gave him later on. MacGyver was not the typical character and the poster boy hairdo he got later just did not fit.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great. I mean seriously awsome. Not a single problem with anything. No problems with loading. No problems with down loading. Absolutely nothing.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Great season! Although I'm noticing the plot lines are starting to get a little over dramatic, but it is executed well. Love the show!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|New update is awful! Please bring back the old version!<br />Going to try a few more friendly weather apps so bye bye Weather Channel!
B004L0NGEC|3.0|I can't really say too much about this app since I'm still learning, that's why I say it's OK for now.
B009H5IS1W|4.0|While not great entertainment like Downton Abbey, Criminal Minds is very watchable even if non-brain taxing - some episodes are better than others.
B00CS74W0C|5.0|Not easy for me to say.  I am more than frugal with my book purchase, and a friend recommended it to me.  I bit the bullet and fell into this series head first.  I am dying for the fourth book to be released.  I have re-read this book twice.  It's closer to 75 shades of dark grey.
B00D3LA5WG|5.0|I had no idea I would end up liking this movie  as much as I do. Not only that, i am seriously going to go broke with the amount of movies I buy(including this one). I like all genres of movies; i am just a movie person. And in choosing movies to watch, I prefer the ones that serve their purpose. As a film that is one of a kind, Mud does just that and more.<br />Mud stars Matthew McConaughey as the title character with a unique supporting cast that includes Michael Shannon as Galen, Tye Sheridan as the other main character Ellis, Jacob Lofland as Ellis's friend Neckbone,Sarah Paulson as Ellis's mom, and Reese Witherspoon as Juniper. The acting in Mud is well drawn up and beautifully shot.<br /><br />The storyline is a honorable mention. It is very southern, but it is heavily centered around the two young boys and Mud. Expect an enjoyable combination of drama, occasional humor, and just the right amount of action for this movie.<br /> It is still considerably early in the year, but this IS one of 2013's movies to watch and is one that will be talked about(in a good way) for quite awhile.<br />To close, Mud fires on all four cylinders and executes all three acts to perfection.<br /><br />5 stars
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this Bible app is very easy to use. Easy to move from one verse to another saving the previous location.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great! simply superb. It is not difficult at the same time not too easy either. very good relaxation. looking forward tonext levels.
B00821OX98|4.0|The first season starts off with a more than adequate amount of action and drama. Throughout the season there is still quite a bit of nail biting moments that the characters go through.
1616551151|5.0|A great encyclopedia of the Dragon age lore,  rather than the actual game mechanics is very interesting and something I enjoyed reading. I would recommend this for anyone who enjoyed both games for the story rather than gameplay.<br /><br />Also if there is one thing I can say about books, is that after you're done reading them they can also make a nice piece of furniture, and nice big hardcover fits that role perfectly
B007ZYDHRM|5.0|I have really gotten in to listening to audio books while traveling.  I had not read To Kill A Mocking Bird while in school but it was great.  Sissy Spacek did a great job narrating.  Highly recommend this audio book.

B008P1EWIM|5.0|I LOVE IT AND YOU WILL TOO.<br />Nice graphics and info. You won't be disappointed.<br />Beautiful and easy-to-use. I love it!!!!<br /> On my kindle fire HD.!!!!!
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|Awesome movie! After watching this movie, the kids wanted to see the avenger, iron man 1& 2, the hulk, and Thor!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I began reading this book right after I finished Dark Places hoping it would be as good.  Wow....this was an engrossing read.  So twisted and gritty but easy to read....I doubt that makes sense.  I don't read many books about murders because some are too descriptive and gross.  This one isn't.  You can get a send of what's going on without it being disgustingly descriptive.  Very good book, creepy but great.
B0042816YK|5.0|Excellent movie.  I will watch it over and over again.  I consider this movie of a spiritiual nature.  Peace & Blessings!
B008H08XW2|4.0|...But the Maroon 5 charm is still there. I think most people that don't like this album (mostly) just don't like the genre of dance-pop. That's fine and dandy really--Maroon 5 did take a HUGE risk here--but to me it worked. The album (at least production-wise) is mostly upbeat, bright and sparkly in the right places. NOTE: If you don't like your music with a heavy dance aesthetic please skip this release and maybe try one of their previous efforts (which were more pop rock).<br /><br />I got the deluxe version and like almost every song. In fact the only song that I don't like much and sometimes skip over is \\"The Man Who Never Lied\\" which is serious filler to me. The rest of the songs are at least good IMO. The actual emotional Maroon 5 stamp is still all over this album: You mostly have songs speaking on the turmoil that relationships sometimes bring.<br /><br />My favorite tracks are \\"Doin' Dirt\\" which is the most addictive number on the album, \\"Beautiful Goodbye\\" (the last track on the standard), the angry-but-catchy first single \\"Payphone\\" featuring Wiz Khalifa, the throwback tune \\"Wasted Years\\" and of course the beautiful cover ballad, \\"Let's Stay Together\\". The two latter tunes are exclusively on the deluxe version and I think \\"Let's Stay Together\\" (which is crooned expertly by Adam) is worth getting it for alone. \\"Wasted Years\\" while good is more of an acquired taste beat-wise. It's different from all the other tracks on the album.<br /><br />All in all I really do love this piece of work. I don't think it's their best but it is damn good still. It's mostly upbeat but there are a couple of ballads and mid-tempos in there too which definitely give it balance. If you like the singles on the radio a lot then you MUST GET THIS ALBUM. I put it off for a while because Maroon 5 did change it up a lot but it turns out this album still works. For all those saddened by how they switched genres almost completely I read in an article that the material they have come up with so far for their next album is more serious and some of it could even be described as \\"dark\\". So take that as you will.<br /><br />4.4 stars.with so far for their next album is more serious and some of it could even be described as \\"dark\\". So take that as you will.<br /><br />4.4 stars.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|This game is great but when I went to visit my neighbor I tried to go home but my farm turned into his farm and kept on saying there was a error. So............ ha that's my comment
B00BB8VRPM|1.0|well this movie just goes to show you how different people can be when it comes to taste.  This movie is awful.  The hardest thing is having to read all the dialog since it's not in English, but I don't think it would have helped the story even if it had been.  What a waste of 2 hours.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Good series made me want to see more about these characters, enjoyable series and storytelling. Sometimes it shows thing's we should take to heart.
031250926X|5.0|Book has colorful animals and fish with sliding &#34;door&#34; for him to open.  Learning colors, animals, finger dexterity and words since words are repetitious but not overly so.  Just enough for his level of learning and a little element of surprise with sliding door.  He doesn't tire of it.  Also, book is well made, solid and &#34;pages&#34;  are well suited in size as well as sturdiness for his little hands.

B00DU74U74|1.0|I didn't read the book but I'm convinced that the book has to be better than this movie.  Bad bad.
B003DBOS7Y|5.0|Playing first in a nursing home and then flashing back to many years prior, The Notebook describes a genuine romance, involving deepest care, and commitment. it depicts the joyful and heart-rending evolution of love between partners who, against all odds, are meant for each other.<br />James Garner, Ryan Gosling, and Gena Rowland are stellar. The script is phenomenal and the action and acting draw one in as is seldom the case in recent movies I have seen. Destined to become a modern classic. Almost as good a romance as Sleepless in Seattle, but<br />beautifully intercut with the painful reality of the frame story.
068817776X|5.0|Great book to read and find out about the Shoah from inside, from most unusual story of one very brave and smart woman. All aspect of Nazis persecutions of the Jewish people can be found here, but not from historical perspective but a very human one. In this life story we have so much to learn about Jewish community in Vienna, about Nazis growth to power, about ordinary people suddenly became fugitives and victims of terror. To me, highlight of this book is irony of faith, and how one Jewess once victimized and persecuted had given an opportunity to judge their own persecutors.
B006IYG5HE|5.0|Jo Nesbo has all the right elements to make The Redbreast, a book you'll have a difficult time putting down until you get to the very end! Keep a score card handy as he introduces a plethora of characters but as the story builds you'll understand why.<br />Now onto book 4 in the Harry Hole series, Nemisis! Yes, Nesbo has left one crime unsolved. Will Harry discover it in Book 4?! I'm betting he will!
0694524441|4.0|I would recommend it to others. It has a different way to look at life and things and that could make someone look inside of them self's and imagine better<br /><br />cheers<br />Jeff
B0042J6VUS|3.0|I expected something with a more adjustable grip for the phone. This only barely fits my HTC One if I take the case off the phone. The tri-pod was quite flimsy and mine actually broke, the three legs broke away from the top piece that connects to the screw-in piece to the phone holder. The good thing about it is that the piece that holds the phone can be used to attach to a real tri-pod :)

0399255370|2.0|It is possible to read too much into a picture book.  A funny statement since what were talking about is literature for people who haven't even seen a decade of time pass them by.  But historically picture books have been places where prejudices are both intentionally and unintentionally on display.  Yet for every \\"[[ASIN:1849393893 Denver]]\\" by David McKee (a picture book about the beauty of trickle down economics) you'll find fifty people reading WAY too much into something like \\"[[ASIN:1558584412 Rainbow Fish]]\\" (communist propaganda) or \\"[[ASIN:1442433701 Click, Clack, Moo]]\\" (inculcating kids into unionism).  The thing is, picture books are meant to teach and inform our children.  Yet along the way a parent or gatekeeper might be worried about the unintentional messages getting pushed along the way.  At the end of the day you have to weigh your reactions carefully.  You can't be pointing fingers left and right, claiming authorial intent where there is none.  Okay.  So round about now you're trying to figure out what the heck any of this has to do with \\"The Day the Crayons Quit\\" by Drew Daywalt.  I mean, talk about an innocuous title.  Why am I going on and on about unintentional messages in works of children's fiction in preface to talking about this book?  Well, here's the trouble.  I have a major problem with this story and it's entirely possible that it's just in my own head.  So here's what I'm going to do.  I'm going to lay out the facts as they stand and you can judge for yourself whether or not this book does indeed make a major you-can't-do-that-in-the-21st-century mistake, or if I'm simply suffering from a case of Reading Too Much Into It.  Either way, it sure makes this Daywalt/Jeffers collaboration into an interesting point of discussion.<br /><br />Duncan's your average kid.  Not the kind of person who's going to expect that when he reaches for his crayons at school he is, instead, going to find himself with a bundle of letters.  Each letter is from a different crayon voicing their complaints.  Says gray, \\"I know that elephants are gray but that's a lot of space to color in all by myself.\\"  Or pink saying, \\"Could you please use me sometime to color the occasional pink dinosaur or monster or cowboy?\\"  Red and blue need a rest, white feels empty, yellow and orange both claim the sun, and all black ever wanted in life was, for once, to color in a rainbow or a beach ball.  By the end of the letters Duncan wants to make the crayons happy.  And that's when he comes up with the perfect solution to everybody's woes.<br /><br />Now let's talk crayon history for a bit.  This is fun.  In 1962 the U.S. Civil Rights Movement was underway.  America was going through big changes.  Assumptions that had lain dormant for years were finally getting challenged and even crayons were getting a double glance.  You see 1962 was the year that Crayola decided to officially change the crayon known as \\"flesh\\" to \\"peach\\".  You see where I am going with this, I suspect.  While white children certainly would use the color as flesh, it wasn't exactly on the up and up to assume that white was the de facto skin color.  Fast forward to 2013 and the publication of \\"The Day the Crayons Quit\\".  Peach does indeed make an appearance in this book and in that section complains vociferously that its wrapper has been removed.  \\"Now I'm NAKED and too embarrassed to leave the crayon box.  I don't even have any underwear!\\"  That Daywalt is linking peach to flesh again is no crime.  Interestingly, on the previous page the pink crayon has been making a very different complaint about never being allowed to draw cowboys or dinos or monsters.  The monster that it HAS drawn is covering its private parts, obviously believing itself to be naked as well, as the dinosaur points and laughs.  So.  Pink and peach are clearly equated with flesh tones.<br /><br />Then what's the deal with brown?<br /><br />There is only one vaguely brownish crayon in this book and it isthe much maligned beige.  The official brown does not make an appearance it would seem.  Beige's sadness is the fact that while \\"Brown gets all the bears, ponies and puppies . . . the only things I get are turkey dinners (if I'm lucky) and wheat.\\"<br /><br />Mmm  hmm.<br /><br />This is precisely where the difficulty comes into play.  How much am I reading into this through my own prejudices?  Let me give you a bit of comparison.  This year is also seeing the publication of \\"[[ASIN:076365714X The Black Rabbit]]\\" by Philippa Leathers.  In that particular book a little white rabbit keeps seeing a \\"scary\\" big black rabbit that he runs away from.  The black rabbit is, in fact, the little rabbit's own shadow and at the end he comes to love the big black rabbit after all.  A librarian recently commented to me that it would have been far preferable if the little rabbit had been brown or some other color.  Otherwise you have a book where a white character fears a big black one.  At first I was inclined to agree, but after thinking about it I wasn't so sure.  After all, the white rabbit's fears are entirely in its own head.  There's also the fact that the book, I believe, is originally Australian, so the author wasn't working with a lot of the codes and keys common in American culture.  I was even reminded of the huge brouhaha surrounding \\"[[ASIN:0060264950 The Rabbits' Wedding]]\\" by Garth Williams.  In 1958 the Alabama state library system removed the book from circulation because it featured a black rabbit and a white rabbit getting married.  But sometimes a rabbit is just a rabbit.<br /><br />So is a crayon just a crayon?  I think the difference may lie in what a kid gets out of reading this book.  In the case of \\"The Black Rabbit\\", few kids are going to equate themselves with fluffy bunnies.  Even if they do, the black rabbit is ultimately the hero of the story.  There's a bit of a difference with crayons.  Kids are constantly coloring themselves and the people they love with the crayons they have on hand.  Crayola, knowing this, even released a brand of multicultural crayons of varying brown tones in response to the public's desire for that very product.  So to produce a book where pink and flesh are equated with skin tones and that possibility isn't even considered with beige or brown makes for a complicated reading.  It's an easy mistake to make if you're not thinking about it at first, but you would have thought that someone in the course of editing this thing might have brought the point up with Mr. Daywalt.  Heck, they might have brought it up with Jeffers too, since he's the one who came up with the naked monster picture in the first place.<br /><br />Getting away from brown, beige, and peach crayons entirely, let's look at the book in terms of its other merits.  When I was a kid I definitely ascribed personalities to inanimate objects.  Not just dolls and toys, oh no.  I could turn a game of War into a long drawn out romantic epic, thanks to the personalities ascribed to various playing cards.  And crayons were no exception.  Each one had a different part to play.  They dealt with jealousies and romances, the whole nine yards.  So in that frame of mind, \\"The Day the Crayons Quit\\" speaks to something very real.  Kids like to believe that the objects that they play with are as invested in the experience as the kids themselves.  So Daywalt has clearly found a unique but necessary niche.  If he follows the book up with a story of playing cards we'll know he's on the right track.<br /><br />This is also an epistolary picture book.  I don't know if Daywalt knows this, but a common assignment given by a variety of different elementary school teachers requires kids to read epistolary books (\\"[[ASIN:0439206634 Dear Mrs. LaRue]]\\", \\"[[ASIN:0152061185 The Journey of Oliver K. Woodman]]\\", etc.).  As such, \\"The Day the Crayons Quit\\" is no doubt destined to remain on multiple children's book lists for decades and decades to come.<br /><br/>Which is a bit of a pity since the book itself is tailor made for an adult readership.  Sure, some kids are going to get a real kick out of it.  But as I read through the book I kept thinking that were it not for the art of Oliver Jeffers, this title would be a difficult read.  After all, it's pretty much all about the words.  Jeffers does what he can to give as much life and vitality as he can to the text, but there are twelve letters in here and around the orange and yellow crayons you'll be forgiven if your attention starts to wane.<br /><br />That's why the success of the book (and success it indeed is) can be ascribed primarily to its illustrator.  I began to notice that the childlike style of the art can really, believably be the style of a kid.  This is undoubtedly why Jeffers was picked for the project in the first place.  Aside from David Shannon it can be difficult to find artists that replicate children's art styles without coming off as half-cooked. Jeffers has also taken great pains to put in as many small clever details as possible, and it makes for a very rewarding rereading.  At first you wouldn't notice.  His Santa on a fire truck is straightforward.  The dragon accidentally burning a clump of grapes is cute but for me the book really picks up with (no surprise here) the moment when Jeffers gets to draw a penguin.  Even the paper he chooses for each crayon is interesting and significant.  Admittedly I was a little surprised that the purple crayon's letter wasn't written on lined paper (since it's such a stickler for staying inside the lines) while the gray crayon's was.  His faux coloring books are fun in and of themselves but it's the final picture that's worth it.  There are a lot of hat tips to the crayons' demands to be found here, from black rainbows to white cats.  I think the character of Duncan still totally forgot to pay heed to blue's request, but otherwise it's on the up and up.  You could even ignore that all the humans are drawn with pink or peach or white crayons, if you had half a mind to.<br /><br />That's sort of what makes the problems I have with the book such a bummer.  There's really good stuff going on here!  Oliver Jeffers is fun to watch no matter what he does and Daywalt has the makings of a fine author for kids.  The troubles come when you look at what the book is saying.  Fans of a certain stripe are sure to disregard my concerns with a wave of their hand.  \\"She's reading WAY too much into this\\", they might say.  Probably.  But it seems to me that you cannot write a book about crayons and mention peach and pink as naked without acknowledging that not every kid in the world thinks of those colors as a flesh tones.  I mean, that's just obvious.  Here's beige again: \\"I am BEIGE and I am proud.\\"  Beige power, eh?  Come on, little crayon.  Time for you to think outside the box.with the crayons they have on hand.

B005HIEFC4|2.0|First let me say that this movie is hilarious and awesome. The problem is that the discription states that it comes with the digital copy but it definitely does not, it's the Blu-ray Disc only. That probably explains why it was a great price when I got it. So if you're not concerned about the digital copy then this is a great movie to own for multiple viewing like my wife and I have done.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Facebook is great for getting in touch with people you know, went to school with and family.  However, I wish there was a choice on the &#34;friends request&#34; only from &#34;close&#34; friends or &#34;family&#34;.<br /><br />I am very unhappy that I get friend requests from &#34;friends of friends&#34; who display nudity and other inappropriate pictures.  In my opinion, as well as others, this should be a &#34;clean&#34; source of networking, not a place to entice and find dates.  I have also had friends that complain of half naked women with requests popping up on their FB page every time they log in.<br /><br />Facebook needs to correct these issues or they are going to lose some &#34;decent&#34; people.

B005CYLSW8|5.0|Beethoven's 5th symphony is often a great place to start, for those new to classical music, due to its immense popularity and familiarity. Most people will recognise the opening, but few will know how or why they know it (frankly, who cares). It's popularity and catchiness is undeniable.<br /><br />A quick search on iTunes, Spotify or Amazon.com will reveal a dizzying number (literally hundreds) of recordings of Beethoven's 5th symphony. This further supports the claims of popularity, but makes choosing a recording close to impossible. This recording played by the Gewandhausorchester (Gewandhaus is a concert hall in Leipzig, Germany, the home of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra), conducted by the famous Italian conductor, Riccardo Chailly is my current favourite.<br /><br />My main reason for liking this recording is the clarity of sound, the crisp energised playing and the generally fast, driving speeds, which I'm partial to. Basically, this is exciting music making from beginning to end and is therefore extremely enjoyable. You are guaranteed to be bobbing your head, pounding your fists, air-conducting, singing along or dancing around. I encourage all emotional responses to music, however bizarre, as long as it adds to your enjoyment. Purists may disagree, but who cares.

B005LAII80|5.0|Dredd, directed by Pete Travis (Vantage Point) and written by Alex Garland (Sunshine, 28 Days Later) tells a story of Judge Dredd, a law-keeper in the Ruin of the Old World. After a mysterious event that left the United States an irradiated wasteland known as the Cursed Earth, Mega-City One, along the East Coast, houses 800 million civilians. Every day, there are over 17,000 crimes a day, and only the men and women of the Hall of Justice stand against the injustice. When he's teamed with a rookie judge (who's also a psychic/mutant) named Anderson, Judge Dredd takes her out on her first mission to Peach Trees, where Ma-Ma, a notorious drug lord is selling and creating vast quantities of Slo-Mo, which makes the brain work at 1% its normal capacity.<br /><br />Dredd is easily one of the greatest sci-fi/action movies ever made, with visually stunning action sequences and superb directing. Pete Travis really knows how to capture the hellish world from the 2000 AD comic books, and Alex Garland knows how to re-create the characters for the screen, in the best way possible. Stallone's Judge Dredd in the 90s was a truly awful movie in just about every way, but here, Dredd is near-perfect. Karl Urban IS Dredd, with his straight-forward execution of law (literally) and no hesitation to do the right thing, which also includes killing; one of his specialties as a Judge. Olivia Thirlby was actually great as Judge Anderson, a mutant with psychic powers, giving her an advantage over other Judges and perpetrators. Lena Heady, well, is no less intimidating here as Ma-Ma than in Game of Thrones as Cersi Lannister. The visual effects are award-worthy, but with the competition it had, it was reasonably overlooked. The musical score Paul Leonard-Morgan is interesting, being both electronic, hard rock-sounding, and orchestral in places, capturing the brutal and chaotic atmosphere of the Cursed Earth.<br /><br />Honestly, any and every action aficionado must see this movie, 2000 AD fans, and those who like well-made sci-fi or post-apocalyptic style worlds/stories. Dredd never lets up on the action or intensity, and there is much more to this world, and to Dredd, that needs to be told. A sequel is needed, and Karl Urban is counting on us fans! Of course, this movie is not for every but it is an action masterpiece

B001ANSSDC|4.0|It's a cute story and quick read.  I think must people will enjoy the story and the easy writing style.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|A great story, with a lot if surprises. Grisham does it again :)! I guess Grisham himself would be a hard nut to crack for the FBI.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|A fantastic, hard to put down story.  I was not aware of the writing style until reading the book; honestly, this is the first book I've read with the multiple narrative format.  It works and provides more insight into the characters.  This is a must read.
B00C2IN74Y|5.0|I could not believe I got this for $9.99. It was shipped very carefully and came with no dings or scratches. The artwork is awesome. Makes a perfect addition to my growing steelbook collection.
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|In the same level as the Godfather, A Bronx Tale, Goodfellas I admit is violent and gruesome but how can you tell the story otherwise.<br />I have watched this movie many times over the years and it gets me every time.<br />NOW GET YOUR SHINE BOX !!!
B009AMALLM|5.0|I've been waiting for the price to come down on this movie, but I never imagined I would get a DVD/Bluray Combo along with a digital copy and ultraviolet. And for less than ten dollars??<br />The movie was not as good as the first one, but it continues the story, and gives more information about the paranormal activities going on in the house.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|So addicting. My grandson and I play it together and we cant wait for. We so exicted waiting for more levels.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|Really pleased with this reason for only 4 stars is it does occasionally stick and I can,t chat with whoever is at top of list. I got Facebook for kindle but that caused nothing but problems and had to remove it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. I can't seem to get enough. This game is so addicting! It's great for all ages.
B007HGPBRC|5.0|It was hard to read this.  I believe that I felt more sorrow for him at points than he felt for himself; the sheer devotion and energy he constantly gave to his career, even toward the end is just astounding.
B00005T30L|5.0|This movie is filled with weird quirky characters, smart, funny, well worth watching, so get off your Computer right now and order it!!! stop reading this, now!!! and just buy it, you freak!!!<br /><br />any how you will love it and there is sex in it as well!!!<br />oh, now I have your attention, and its good as well...
B00C061I3K|5.0|The Digital version only of this album was 12.99 at both Amazon and Google.  The physical CD only cost $10.  AND it came with a free digital download.<br /><br />So, for $2 less, I got the physical copy of the disk, and the digital download. Now I've got the album in my library, without ever even opening the CD package.<br /><br />Also, the music is just wonderful in this album.  I was addicted to it for a week straight.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I recommend this game to everybody!!  Very fun and interesting!!!<br />Excited to play more of The Room.........<br />The only thing I did not like is that it's a very short game I was able to play it in two hour's and I wanted to keep playing!!<br />So if you could fix that then you've got a real good game on your hands!!
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Gaiman lacks the humor of Terry Pratchett, but this is a fine recollection of a coming of age story featuring very long lived (as in a few hundred years) people with a young boy.  Creatures from the paranormal world  help drive the story along.  There are certain similarities to BRIGADOON.  I found it very enjoyable.
B00CQGU9GG|5.0|This finally put an end to a 27 year abomination that should not have ever happened. Mastering was good and not brickwalled in my opinion.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Recommended if you want a somewhat family oriented movie with a new twist on an old story. Not bad. Rather fun.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I enjoyed reading these books, but now I have to wait to see what happens... Oh the humanity! When will the next book come?
B002APU580|5.0|While rating a movie can be very personal by nature of one's tastes, likes, or dislikes I rated this movie a Five based on script, acting, music score, and authenticity of costumes, scenery, and subject matter for that time period in history. I also enjoy life portrayals where imperfect man's class distinctions come into play and are overcome. While some may find my Review Headline/Summary to be offensive or insensitive ... oh well ! Time to head back into my man cave !
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is not only a fascinating story, it is a great read. My husband and I could not put it down The author is a scientist through and through, but he testifies to the truthfulness of spiritual things that became undeniable to him. When you read this book, it will change your perspective about life and death.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|All fans of sci-fi need to check out Doctor Who. Cheesy effects, yes... but that's part of its charm. The real strength is in the story telling and the brilliant acting of the recent Doctors and their companions. This is a great place to start if you're not familiar with the series.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My daughter loves playing this game. Great arcade game.  Many items to choose and buy. Keeps my daughter engaged on trips.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|This was a terrific read. It was long and involved with a lot of characters and a complex narrative. Throughout it all, the passion and love that the main character had for Bombay and the people there was eminently evident. I think this was the redeeming thread for the lead character who was flawed and thus human. The characters overall were flawed but loving human beings. They were caught in their own dilemmas that allowed them to interact with each other although not perfectly and this creates the friction between characters.<br />I think this is a great novel and it has stayed with me long after I have finished it.
B00AHSGNJM|5.0|My son loves this movie he enjoys watching finally purchased it =) enjoy everything bout it..cant wait till finding dory comes out
B004EPZ084|4.0|This one really has it all, good storyline, interesting characters, and crazy situations! Almost everyone's thought about killing their boss at some point (of course we would never do it), but this film sets out to do just that. At some points I felt  bad for laughing, perhaps the film went a bit too far, but it's just funny.<br /><br />I like how the issue of sexual harassment is explored, the confusion about what wetworks means, and the awkward moments the guys find themselves in. This film is actually hilarious, I recommend it to everyone (over 15)
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Awesome for replacing the old type.  I am glad I have the pro version. Beats swype and the learning dictionary is helpful.
B0067Q04AM|5.0|Of our generation and this new millenium, out-of-the ashes like a phoenix rises Robert Glasper with collaborations of nu-soul jazz and uber hiphop with equally talented and expressive soul rap emcees and singers of our time, Lupe Fiasco, Yasin Bey, Erykah Badu and Lalah Hathaway deliver a complex, lush-layered and wonderful marriage of hip-hop, nu-soul, and jazz!!!
B009JZSFUY|5.0|I'm a purist.  The best of the original Star Trek stands above all else (especially true concerning the fun but foreign Abrams Abominations), but First Contact comes close to equaling the original masterpieces.  Well-written, well-acted, superbly paced, cleverly resolved, and ultimately emotionally satisfying, this film is worth your time.  If you like Star Trek, then you've already seen this movie.  If you don't care for Star Trek, then give this one a try.  At the very least, you'll have fun for two hours.  And maybe, just maybe, you'll begin to understand what the 47-year hubbub is about.  Good luck and &#34;Engage!&#34;<br />&#34;
B004LROUNG|5.0|This one begins slowly but then really takes off!  The courtroom scenes are written very well and you actually feel you are there!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great excellent show looking forward in watching season 4. A++++++++++++++nothing but the best brilliant talent and true to the era of time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the most addictive game ever! Bar none. No dishes get done,  no meals get made, and don't expect me to hold a conversation with ANYONE - I'm playing Minion Rush!
B00A285OOW|5.0|Love the story, the history, the knowledge, the personalization she brings to every novel!!! Can't wait til the next installment!!!!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Love this app! Love that I can set it for different locations and check each one for current and extended forecasts. That makes travel a lot easier. This app saves time and trouble!
0307277887|3.0|I couldn't warm to the writer's style: I am not sure that a first person narrative is best suited to the story.  I will probably read the next in the series to see if it bcomes more rounded. It is useful to read the first in a series, but often an author settles in to a more appropriate style as the lead character becomes more defined.  The plotting is satisfying, if that is the right word to describe a serial killer's activities.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|we loved the movie, now we can play the game. we love to play it while winding down for the day. what an excellent relief valve! thanks!!!!!
B00BIVN82M|1.0|This is far the worst album I own by Michael Buble.  It is nothing near the artistry of his other works on any level. I really enjoy the earlier albums and hope this won't be his new direction.  Truly unlistenable.
B008Y76VW2|5.0|I am a fan of any movie that captures deep emotions, but without the \\"cheat\\" of having a major character die. Adventure land delivers. Great performances all around. Especially impressed with an understated performance by Reynolds.
B004EWFV9K|4.0|It gives me a view I had not seen before. It makes me remember what drew me to him,in the first place.
159463176X|3.0|First let me say that I thoroughly enjoyed \\"The Kite Runner\\" and \\" A Thousand Splendid Suns\\". It is always exciting to start a new book from a favorite author. \\"And the Mountain Echoes\\" starts by introducing the reader to a young boy, Abdullah and his beloved younger sister, Pari. They are from a poor village in Afghanistan. With the assistance of a step uncle the children's father sells Pari to a motherless woman and her wealthy older husband who live in Kabul. The uncle, Nabi, considered a success since moving from the village to Kabul, works for the rich couple.<br /><br />The remainder of the book portrays the relationships between these mains characters and the evolution or devolution of their lives and the lives of there offspring. Unlike his previous two books, this story looses its focus. Hosseini introduces too many characters with no depth. They are only tangentially related to one another.<br /><br />Three quarters through the story, the location moves from Afghanistan to Greece. A couple of chapters entail the relationship between a doctor who now resides in the house that Nabi inherited from the wealthy couple and the doctor's childhood female friend with a deformed face. This would have made for a touching story on its own if developed; but seemed liked \\"filler\\" in this scattered story.<br /><br />I lost track of how people were related and lost any emotional attachment to the characters. As with \\"The Kite Runner\\" and \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" there is reconciliation in the end; but it seemed a weak afterthought after meandering through multiple lives in multiple cities throughout the story.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great free app. very addictive. I have recommended this app to several friends. it is a challenging and fun game.
B000X2H8G4|5.0|The device worked wonderful but is not very well constructed.  Wires broke after a few weeks use.  It has been returned under the three year limited warranty.
B00821OX98|5.0|I don't normally watch TV but I did download the first 2 seasons of Falling skies. The writers and production crew were very brave on developing the aliens and other equipment, so I was entranced. Great acting helped and keep you wondering what was going to happen.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|World War Z is an amazing novel. I loved how it was broken entirely into witness accounts. It really puts in the personal side of the conflict. You get the uncertainty of the beginning, the fear and panic of the crisis, then the pride and glory of courage and victory. The main strength of the book is that you can really empathize with the characters and put yourself in the everyday persons shoes. I also loved that it didn't just deal with the suburban or urban people of the western world. It tapped into people from all over and all walks of life and how they would cope. I especially loved that it dealt with the aftermath. Especially that it wasn't just the end of the world as it was known, it was the birth of a new one as always happens after any conflict of this magnitude. It dealt with the fact the humans are survivors and we grow through conflict, pain, and adversity. Pure genius.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I want a sequel for two reasons. 1: The game was AWESOME and my child loved it.2: He told me the achievements were a bit easy. But you should definitely get the full version of this. I have high expectations for the sequel, if you do make one. It should be about  a re-opening of Eden and you are the pest control. You are cleaning out the sewers and all of a sudden you hear screams and then you have to find items to exterminate the rats and the demons.
B0034G4OYK|5.0|I hadn't heard much about this movie and in fact, only purchased it as a gift for someone who had just received a 3-D television.  I was pleasantly surprised by great animations and 3-D effects and a very charming story.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Very enterneining. A critic look at both human behaviour and how it can be tweaked for all kinds of usage. Though basically an expansion of Pavlov's notionns on conditioning reflexes, the author gives us a newmodern look at it, and presents some modern concepts and uses. Good reading also to those who are trying to have better life habits, provides some helpful insights. Read it with a critic minds, and seek other books about human behavior and conditioning. Mainly based in valid scientific concepts.
B00CH26TL8|3.0|There are many other games like this one.  It's okay but not really challenging.  It works well on the Kindle and is OK to play.
B008645YH6|5.0|It's been quite a while since I've had my TV on (Conan) in one room and actually dropped everything (I was preparing for bedtime), and literally ran down my hallway to listen to her performance (Marina was singing her song &#34;Lies&#34;).  I was so blown away by her vocals and the band's sound!  I quickly found a sticky note to write down the band's name.  If you are a woman who has ever experienced falling in love with hopes for a rommance of the heart but such feelings are NOT being reciprocated  from this lover/partner, then you will relate this album.  Of course Marina's album will also take you on a journey, song-by-song, of how a women having had experienced this &#34;predicament&#34; cannot lose sight that it can make you stronger -- afterall, &#34;life's about learning&#34; (lyrics from singer/songwriter Joni Mitchell).  I love Marina's lyrics to the song &#34;How to Be a Heartbeaker&#34; which address four steps in order to protect your heart in future (reminded me of a book I once read, and highly recommend, &#34;The 10 Commandments to Dating&#34;). I understand she is British and of Greek decent which might account for her unique vocals -- quite lovely!  As a side note, Marina shares the same first name of my favorite grandmother, &#34;Granny,&#34; who was a Swedish imigrant to the U.S.  Well done Marina with this album and I cannot wait for the next one!
B009UZLRJE|5.0|My wife loves this show and when I found it on Blu-ray she was even more excited I am not sure how many times she has watched it and if the seller get season 6 on Blu-ray I would like to be notified so I can order that one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway suffers is a great game. Me and my brow love it so much!Everyone should play this fantastic game!!!! Its a great thing to do when u get bored. Is a very good game to play if u r feeling lazy! It is wonderful
B003Y74KCK|1.0|I wanted a case smaller than the OtterBox I bought with my phone. This case arrived ripped at the bottom.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|So far I like this game. My 4 year old loves it. Very similar to the subway surfer which we have been playing.g for months. I like something that is a little challenging. but not frustrating. I downloaded the free version just to try it out. I would buy the full version.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|my 5 year old loves dipicable me. well constructed game. very challenging for him. I would recommend. haven't needed to buy anything to play.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My whole family is addicted. Everyone has it downloaded to their devices and we try to beat each other high score
B001UGB1X8|5.0|I had never even heard of this movie before.  I found it on my Kindle and it was a really good movie.  Of course, I love any movie with Tommy Lee Jones in it.
B00723NWJE|5.0|Whenever I drive, I listen Norah's song. It is very calm and adorable. Her voice is amazing. She can express every emotion. I love her song. This CD is awesome.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I have never had a bad read by Gaiman.  The Ocean at the End of the Lane is a must read I highly recommend.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Whenever I drive, I listen Norah's song. It is very calm and adorable. Her voice is amazing. She can express every emotion. I love her song. This CD is awesome.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|one o0f the best movies ever made with a great and wonderful cast too bad more movies are not made like this.
0805090665|5.0|I bought this item for my daughter's birthday gift. She loves this very much. When she has free time, she always plays with this. It is very helpful to improve her IQ. I love this item.
B003Y5H5EW|4.0|love all of Kate Beckinsales movies her third installment was one of the finest movie so far. you go girl
B00018D44U|5.0|Whenever I drive, I listen Norah's song. It is very calm and adorable. Her voice is amazing. She can express every emotion. I love her song. This CD is awesome.
B00CGPPMKU|4.0|I love playing with this. The graphics are awesome. Endless combinations of designs and colors. Absolutely fascinating! I can't put it down.
B00BMUVW5O|5.0|I loved James Bowen's book A Streetcat named Bob. It was a story of redemption and how human and animal saved one another. This could have been a sentimental tale but the raw honesty James Bowen showed in his description of the dark years of his addiction and attempts to kick it as well as the difficulties homeless and vulnerable people face in society was impressive.<br /><br />Bob the cat is an exceptional animal and without doubt he chose James (as cats often do -- they seem to be able instinctively to pick humans who will care for them).<br /><br />The World According to Bob continues their story until the publication of the first book. I hope that James and Bob go from strength to strength.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game great graphics and yes very addictive. I have lost hours playing th this game. My kids keep stealing my kindle to play it too.
B003F48E4W|5.0|Timeless film, sexy vampires. These actors were at their best, acting and appearance. I have watched this way too many time. The music is awesome.
B008X9I6X8|4.0|some great visuals and surprising acting in this highly controversial film, it could really benefit from being re-edited but is fascinating
B00847KFDS|4.0|Very well done. A great mix of talent, with John's noteworthy style. A nice way to mix up some classic songs. Highly recommended.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|New and unique.  The violence was a little over the top for my liking.  Let us not forget history, and remind us we can be better and promote humanity.
1594488886|5.0|I highly recommend this book.  I have read three of this authors books now and this one is, by far, the best.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|We all face our life's unique challenges.  Embrace them for they make us individual, and a story worth telling.  Great acting.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|I love these boys! Fully realized seasons 1-5 are a DEFINITE recommend. And Jensen Ackles's face is a 10 out of 10. Fall in love and get this!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is so... fun and awesome. Really it is one of the most greatest games I have played on the kindle fire!
B002PNER9U|5.0|i have watched this film over and over. can't get enough of it. i would recommend it to anyone. it's amazing
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers it is fun and very cool I like the whole game, I like the keys the most!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|it's a fun way to pass the time if you're stuck in a doctor's office or just waiting for someone.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Catch up with old friends or make new ones. Play games that consume all your free time. What else can I say it's Facebook..
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|Sure do wish this was available for MY tablet.  I have this on my cell phone and like the game, LOVE Draw Something 2 better and wish that was available for my tablet. Guess my tablet just sucks!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Great game! One of the best games I've ever play I recommend you get it. Get it it's awesome really really awesome
B006S01GH2|5.0|A classic comedy film from France where the stars align to create a character that captures your heart and inspires your soul.
B00005JKZV|1.0|The advertisement read theatrical edition so I assumed nothing was omitted.  It opened with the Uruk-hai  carried Mary and Pippin to Sauramon.  Omitted was the Uruk-hai intercepted by another group of bad guys and they get into a battle. Also omitted was waht happened when Mary and Pippin's escape into Fangorn Forest.  They encountered the Ent Treebeard who while taking them to the White  wizard warned them about the trees and that they would harm them.  While they slept they were attacked by the trees and rescued by Treebeard.  Another omission wasw the aftermath of a battle fought by Eomer.  When the battle was over he search for King Th&eacute;oden's son. AQfter finding him the return to the castle and Wormtongue banished Eomer from Rohan.  Eomer said Worntongue didn't have the authority.  Worntongue produced paper work.  After watching this much it was obvious this was the edited version, there was so much edited out I couldn't continue watching it, especially after seeing the unedited version.  If its advertised as the theatrical version I expected to see the unedited version, it wasn't, I stopped the movie and prepared it for return.  I wouldn't recommend this version to anyone who has seen the unedited version, they might be more disappointed then I was
B008133MDK|5.0|Any Sherlock fan will enjoy this series<br />90 minute long episodes. I enjoy the older Sherlock starring Basil. And this series is equally entertaining
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|It's a great mystery game. Never know what will come next. I can't wait to finish the game and see how it will end up. Just wish the second part was free too.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|This Micro Shell  Folio Case is great to use. I was tired of holding my Kindle Fire in my hand, all the time.<br />This case is light weight and very low price, too<br />It's easy to hold and set up is too.<br />This case well protect your Kindle fire also..
B009RH973I|5.0|Really like this case.  I bought a pink one for a friend's teenage daughter.  She wanted a hard case that wouldn't get messed up from carrying it around in her bag.  Very nice, modern looking design.  I bought a silver one for myself.  It doesn't add a lot of bulk like the other case I had.  Very nice.  The stand feature isn't the sturdiest.  I  don't mean that it won't last, but it doesn't do the best job of holding up the Kindle.  It works but just not the greatest.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is AWESOME Its Me Steven From My Youtube Channel SCMowns2 This Game Is Cool Sly PLS Get It And Burn Get It
B00DFFHUUA|3.0|Explosions, forced bad humor and great action , but not believable, bad actin across the board. Very bad outing for the Joe's
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A book which doesn't mask S&M and reveals what it truly is. This novel shows the ups and downs of a relationship while keeping it realistic within the situation presented. I can honestly say I'll be purchasing the next novel of the trilogy and begin reading immediately.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|it's fun, aggrevating, but fun, can play with friends on facebook, can play anywhere, it's great for kids to play
075669812X|4.0|I got this as a reference or history for one of the best LEGO themes ever produced. So much so the theme is being brought back and who knows the book may have a part 2.
0783222955|5.0|I have watched it several times and the last time I watched it there was some interference, but I think it was the VCR and not this.  I just wish I had it on dvd, but when I purchased it I did not have a dvd player.
B00B5AP7NY|4.0|Get the movie for the minifig. The movie is pretty much the game itself, with all the cut scenes put together for you. Nice for kids, while you keep the minifig.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Music is God's nectar and the Beatles knew it.  It was sacrilegious when one of the Beatles (I forget which one) said that they were more popular than Jesus, but among US and British teens that may not have been far from the truth in the 60's.  This is a great cd.
1465408681|4.0|Since I follow the Clone Wars animated series, this one was a must buy for me. So far the new series looks good.
B00AHJL7BK|3.0|It has a nice smooth interface, easy to read and very pretty on my Nook HD+, But bigger puzzles unlocked in the pay version aren't any harder than the little one in the free version so I lose interest.  Try before you buy. since its hard to find a puzzle app of the right level of difficulty.
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|I have an actual turntable and i can preform most parts of my mixes using this app its amazing im surprised its free
B0058SNI94|5.0|I'm a crocs freak. I can wear these to work. They fit great and look professional (business casual environment). Every time I wear them I feel like I'm getting away with something.<br />Sometimes they squeak but nothing is perfect. I think you should buy them.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game! Enjoyable for everyone......lots of fun!!!!!! Graphics are unbelievable. Recommend download, it's free and you will play for hours.......
0345525558|5.0|Very Fascinating story. Enjoyed all the Victorian references to the meaning of flowers. I loved this book, recommend it highly
B00DHNB5CY|1.0|I'll start by saying, I love horror movies, but not his one.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Extremely unlikeable cast.  Hated every character except for the dog.<br />Weak story.<br />Went overboard on the gore.  It has its place, but I feel they should have concentrated more on a good story and character development.<br />Not scary.<br />Not one bit of humor!!!<br /><br />Pros:<br />None.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun run-forever game like Temple Run, but no gruesome death scenes (a plus in my opinion! My 6 year old can play this (she's not better at it than I am yet!) You don't have to buy anything to win ... All in all, one of the best free apps out there.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Never thought I'd be hooked on a soap opera. Great plot(s), great acting...just a great series.  One of those series that just can't get enough.
B000MD7OKY|5.0|We just returned from vacationing on the french riviera where we drove the 3 corniches, which is the reason that we wanted to see the movie again. No disappointment...it still looks the same as it did those many years ago.
0786962984|5.0|I played this game with my brother as a kid in the 80's and on a lark, searched for it on the internet for my kids, now 6 and 7. I was happy to see that it was remade and still in circulation. As others have noted, it is fairly simple as far as gameplay goes. Much of the in-game mechanics involves simple dice rolls to determine the winner in fights with various monsters and possible damage to you if the monster wins. The loot system and victory mechanics are simple but fun. Therefore, it is an easy way to introduce young kids to fun fantasy board gaming. One thing that must be underscored, however is that it is very easy to customize. After getting familiar with the game, it is very easy and fun to invent new classes of characters. I invented ones based on my kid's favorite adventure characters (Merida from Brave, the kids from the Narnia books, the Hobbit books, etc.), and each had special in-game abilities (e.g., Bilbo could use his ring to automatically escape from an encounter, and Gandalf could use his forsight to detect the nature of an enemy in a room before the encounter). I won't get into the details here. If anybody is interested, I can just post my notes in a further comment discussion. But this sort of thing adds tons of replay-ability to the game. In any case, I'd recommend it highly, esp. if you enjoy doing customization like this as you or your kids become more comfortable with the game.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|So very disappointed I can not get candy crush on my new Kindle HD. I plan on returning it as it does not handle what I require.
0812993292|5.0|I've read this book several times now and each time I get even more from it. This is a book a will keep!
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|Because I enjoyed the movie and the quality of the film. I would rather but it this time from amazon.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Season 1 hooked me and season 2 has not disappointed me.  The love affairs and intrigues continue  I have never been a period drama fan, but the cast, the story lines, the scenery and the aristocrats have drawn me in.  I'm expecting to enjoy season 3 just as much.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Awesome movie, great graphics highly recommend for game lovers of all ages. A new faviorte in our family. Agian a must see.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I found myself addicted to this game very quickly. I played over and over, adding upgrades and boosts.<br /><br />&laquo;&laquo;&laquo;&laquo;&laquo; SPOILER ALERT &raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;<br /><br />But just when I thought I was starting to get good enough at the game to really enjoy it at the higher levels, I discovered the challenge you have to overcome to reach the last level is simply to have the patience to play for several more months. To reach level 9, I need to run more than ten times the cumulative distance it took me to get to 8. But the scenery doesn't change, everything else is the same, so that prospect is as boring as can be.<br /><br />The ending is what you're left with, which is why I don't really like this game as much as I did when I was really hooked.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|Contacted Amazon and someone with a Canadian accent tried to help but was unaware that this didnt work on Kindle Fire.  If it doesnt work dont show it on our app store Amazon!!!  Really disappointed.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent book about the loss of freedom and how individuals keep it alive in their lives.  Movie followed the book well.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love the app but i accidentaly downloaded it from amazon so i uninstalled it and installed it from google play
B001NKI60W|5.0|A lovely, spirited romantic movie set in the beauty of Greece- its incredulous mountains and cliffs overlooking the sparkling blue sea looked down upon by bluer than blue skies. Whitewashed buildings made blindingly bright by the sun. The audience arrives at the scene along with the cast of attendees of Donna's daughter's wedding and the music draws us in to be full participants.<br /><br />Donna had traveled to Greece as a seventeen year old young woman to enjoy a summer of the sights and carefree life there but never returned home - the consequences of casting fate to the wind and loving freely that impetuous summer.<br /><br />Her light-hearted, free and easy ways of her youth had abruptly ended with that summer. As the movie begins, we learn that she has lived out her life over the past twenty years in financial hardship, having been disowned by her mother when her pregnancy was found out. The three young men with whom she had had romantic encounters that summer had moved on with their lives and never knew of her strife. Having the good fortune of inheriting a goat farm property on a precarious hillside, she has spent all her money and invested her back breaking labor in trying to restore the place into an Inn from which to draw an income. The reality was it was crumbling faster than she could repair it and no amount of whitewash could cover its decline.<br /><br />What was planned as a simple village wedding ceremony with plenty of food and drink exploded over night into something quite unexpected as the guests begin to arrive and partake in the festivities. Donna is horrified when the three men - one of which was the father of her daughter - arrive on the scene. They had received invitations from her daughter whose deep-seated need to find out who her father overtakes all caution following finding her mother's diary about that summer and decides to invite the three possible \\"fathers\\" to her wedding - never really expecting any to come.<br /><br />This convergence is rounded out by the arrival of Donna's two oldest and dearest friends from her back-in-the-day youth. The friendships of the young bride-to-be and her circle of close friends have their eyes opened to what her mother and friends had experienced in their youth as they provide the entertainment for the \\"girls only\\" party the night before the wedding by performing their array of disco songs. The young bride-to-be and her friends and the locals are shocked, but totally taken with the freeing tone those songs projected and the whole place goes crazy with everyone joining in along with the three men watching from the edge of the crowd as their old love, Donna, leads the 'playback\\" of songs and fun they had each personally shared with her as a young girl some twenty years before in this same breath-taking place.<br /><br />The ending is a happy one. There is a message we come away with upon leaving the theater. For me it is, \\"Take time dear girls to form you own set of dreams. Find out who you are, recognize your talents, so that you can choose a career or path that will be the \\"work\\" of your life and also the source of what fulfills you outside of a relationship  - before the worldly responsibilities of becoming an adult are laid upon you.<br /><br />Donna had swallowed the shame she felt in becoming an unwed mother. Rebuilding her crumbling property into an Inn became her life. An impossible dream given her financial resources yet she would not give up. Deep inside her, it represented a dream talked about with Sam back in that summer of long ago. A dream she would not let go of despite his no longer being there to share in it. For all its crumbling conditions, it was home for her and her daughter.<br /><br />To ensure that unlike her, her daughter would find a safe and happy haven in life. The Rules would be followed! Her wings would be lovingly clipped to protect her from flying away to the temptations of inexperienced youth. A lovely wedding to remember, a devoted husband on which to depend BEFORE a baby came on the scene.... all would come to pass by following the \\"Rules\\".<br /><br />While the memories of her daughter and her circle of friends are being formed, Donna's old memories - and those of the three men, come flooding back. They are both whimsical and lighthearted, filled with youthful innocence as they came to know one-another's budding interests and then gave way to their over-powering sexual attractions.  Yet the jarring and sobering realities that followed for Donna in how her life had played out after that summer of unfettered fun is unleashed in emotion as she sings, \\"The Winner Takes It All\\".<br /><br />This is definately a \\"Chick Flick\\". Men will probably not come away with any of its deeper meaning. So see the movie with your girlfriends instead. Buy the CD and watch it alone to have a good laugh and cry when the load dumped upon your shoulders seems too much. Bring tissues because we women will cry when they see the parallels found in our own lives, others will cry for those in our sisterhood who gave up their young dreams and devoted the balance of their lives to making the most of their own dealt hand of reality. It reminds us of how restorative it is when we connect with our old friends and reminisce about the life journey we shared. But the movie's most important reminder is that there is nothing on earth to equal the deep and abiding connection between a man and a woman in love whose main expression of that love is to allow each to realize their dreams and be the support in those endeavors... It is such love that happens in both Donna's life and her daughter's that makes for the movies happy ending.
B00BTHWFBK|3.0|I've always been a Sabbath fan from the early 70's, and have all of their albums/CDs.  This CD is basically the typical Sabbath- heavy metal, but this cd has a lot of slower, dark extended tunes, which Sabbath always had a lot of.  Personally I only really liked 4 out of the 11 songs.  I like faster tunes.  Most of the cd didn't have the hooks that the older stuff had.  But I can see a lot of people loving it for what Sabbath was great at.
B00785P2QC|5.0|its fun and stuff I really like this game it has to be one of my favorites on my kindle
0316226424|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book.  I had not seen the movie before I read the book....and my daughter promised not to give away the ending.  There was such a build-up and excitement that I wanted to see a huge conflict so the Cullens could go on with their &#34;lives.&#34; When I saw the movie, I suppose everyone else thought the book lost the reader towards the end, so the ending was changed for the movie.  I enjoyed the movie version so much better than the book ending.
B0031RS4V6|5.0|i have read all his books when is the next movie coming out..i showed my friend and she has bought them as well..jill
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game, not only is it challenging but it's also very fun. Overall I had good time solving this series of brain teasers, and I recommend this game to anyone with time to kill and a good I.Q.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I think it makes checking my email a lot easier. I do wish though I could change the colors and add background
B0064X7FVE|2.0|The Doppler radar map function for this app is really laggy, and instead of moving the view around dragging my stylus zooms in and out seemingly at random.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Things happen quickly in this book.  Then came to an abrupt halt.  I do like the way each character narrates important parts of the story.  Must order the next one now!
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|This is another great game from Fallen Tree Games.  It's not just more levels of their last games. It's a fun improvement on them.
B00633W614|5.0|The story continues and it seems as if I will not be able to put this one down either.  I have learned that Fate has nothing to do with the stories in this book!  It is all up to the author.  This family is very strong.  Now for the next one!
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|The preview was so misleading.  Not only was the story line, acting and make-up terrible; but the fowl language, nudity and sex was horrible.  Don't waste your money on this movie.
B00C2IF9SQ|5.0|I loved reading Dominique's story, but my heart aches for her and how sadly she was treated. However, I'm glad she &#34;exposed&#34; how poorly the coaches treated her and many other children. They should be ordered to retire. I know they are known for their success in having many gold medal winners. But, winning out of fear? I could go on, but I won't. I loved that Dominique was united with her sister, Jen. What a beautiful story. I saw them on Katie Couric's Show and after I quit crying, I  ordered her book. I ordered one for my 10 year old granddaughter,too, but after I read it, I called my daughter and suggested she not let her read it yet. I think it may upset her.
B00DNO3JUI|4.0|Not sure how 'old' this movie is but I finally watched it (8/3/2013)! Well acted. Never would have thought of Harvey Keitel as the 'sexy' other man...I guess Sam Neil (the husband) should have made her work for the piano! Better ending than expected. Glad I finally watched it.
B002R5QPRI|5.0|I have loved this movie since it came out originally.  The music and the show are great.  Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston spark the story.  I would highly recommend it to anyone loving a romantic flick.
B005AKFXZW|5.0|I loved the book! It was a fascinating story about a Circus and a love story. It mixed fiction With Magic in a fun way. I hope she Writes another book. But, for the ending, I know it would not be a sequel to this one...
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|It seemed as if the author was sometimes struggling to come up with the story line. First and second books were better.
B007X709PE|1.0|I wasn't looking to watch a documentary, but that's what this is. I was hoping for a movie like &#34;Driven&#34;.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Not as good as the first, but better than the third. The story has more &#34;meat&#34; to it than the last book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great graphics and sound effects.  Horse lovers will enjoy playing this game.  I am looking forward to getting more horses.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|this game is pretty cool u can get all his suits from iron man3. plus u can destroy. a lot of bosses
0066620996|5.0|I found this book really helpful in thinking about leadership and growing a developing organization. It especially helped me reflect on what makes a great leader and not just a good leader.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|Perfect app for checking in on pet when travelin using webcam.I love this appmuch better than other apps ive used such as pocket cloud this actually works!
B005LLSZNM|4.0|wow, what a good show, all the episodes were good, couldn't stop watching, interesting storyline, kept me wanting to watch
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 3 was great! It tightened the bonds of the main group and showed where they stand ethically. They have each others backs at all costs.  Glad to see Rick get back to reality.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|There are no words to describe this show. I am not into blood and gore but the story behind this show makes the blood and gore seem minimal...even though it is far from it.Watch it and enjoy!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Jennifer<br /><br />This is a suspenseful show with great writing and directing.  The actors are terrific and you will dfinitely develop a connection to the characters.  Love it!
B009JZTQOS|3.0|Not much of a plot, just some mindless action with fantasy violence. It's a great way to kill 2 hours if you're bored.
B009A3NGF4|4.0|I think Babel builds on the great work Mumford and Sons is doing, refining their sound and style of their music while keeping hold of the raw emotion of their lyrics.
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|It only gives help on certain levels. I had hoped for a little more help. Even when I went back to check the help was not really that helpful.
0062014536|5.0|The third and final book in the Delirium trilogy does not disappoint. Lena is shocked to find Alex is still alive and in alternating chapters Lena and her childhood friend, Hana. With each viewpoint, Lena takes us deeper into the world of the uncureds, betrayal and rebellion. Lena has a face to face with Alex and he tells her he never loved her making her turn to Julian for solace and continuing their blossoming relationship. Hana is three weeks away from marrying Fred who is truly frightful. He takes great pleasure in hurting Hana but this does not deter her from trying to find answers to her questions. Oliver's worlds of Lena and Hana collide ad oh what a ride, loved this book!
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|This tool is perfect for cutting bottles. That being said, I would follow the directions of the youtube video posted by powergreenscience for the best method. You still use this tool, but it is better for making a clean cut and just as simple, if not simpler, than any others.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|its really awesome an addictive but I cant link my facebook account or download the other two levels so I cant find macho or menna an I cant finish my missions then
B00005B4GT|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend. They are his favorite band. He and I both love this album in particular. The records themselves work great. I was very pleased.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|I do Not suggest anyone spend a dime on this movie.  Unless you belive the Obama Phone is the ansewer.
B00005N6KG|2.0|I have purchased about 10 pairs of these over the past couple of years. They last about 2 months on average.<br />I wish they'd make a 'quality pair'. Your ears get 'air' when wearing them because of the sideways dime sized disc shape.
B000GCFBQU|3.0|I much preferred Strout's Burgess Boys, which I read first. This one, which centers on a widower minister and his troubled soul, as well as his two daughters, visits questions of faith through his lens, and it views him through the narrow eyes of his small-town neighbors. His friendly relationship with his housekeeper is a welcome thread, fascinating too in its misreading by the townsfolk. But the frequent invocation of the title hymn and other religious references, though necessary to protagonist and the plot, to me got in the way of the relationships among the other well-drawn characters.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|Loved! Was perfect for family movie night! Loved how the movie &#34;explained&#34; the original Wizard of Oz would def. recommend!
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I generally don't even like books in this mystery-plot genre, but Sharp Objects is so well-written and character-rich that I tore through it and went on to read Flynn's Gone Girl (even better?!).
B005LAII44|4.0|Right from the start let me say, I have collected comics for years & I have over 1400 dvds. I love action movies. Having said all of that, I enjoyed this movie for the action only. Several of the characters from G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra are gone. These were characters I enjoyed and that the first movie spent time to develop. If your a fan of Channing Tatum, he only makes a cameo. So this movie is all about the new characters (Dwayne Johnson, Bruce Willis).<br />What's good about it (1) you don't have to see the first one to follow this film. (2) There's plenty of weapons and hand to hand fighting.
B0088W4YTK|5.0|Greatly enjoyed this spin off show when it was originally broadcast and enjoy out as much now. My children also like it and that its saying something that a 10 &13 think that it's a good show
B00A8ECU24|5.0|best game ever i think that itd be better if they added derpy aka ditzy doo it deserves 100000000 stars
B009IU6BIS|5.0|This movie has always been one of my personal favorites. It's a hilarious movie that's great for the family and leaves you wondering, &#34;What else can go wrong?&#34;
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I can't play the game what the heck won't load why WHY WHY IT LOOKS SO FUN PLZ FIX THIS
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved every minute! It kept me on the edge of my seat with every page.  So glad I read it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I need all the help I can get to wake up in the morning, so far this alarm has worked out well with using music from my playlist.  I also like the ascending volume feature.
B009WUBERW|4.0|Not Oscar worthy but what entertaining action movies ever are.  Guns, explosions, witty bantor, it has what you need. It's worth watching.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|The second season of Castle was terrific fun. All 24 episodes delivered entertainment without pause.<br /> As a fan of Nathan Fillion's iconic, cancelled-way-too-soon show \\"Firefly,\\" I enjoyed \\"Vampire Weekend,\\" with its \\"Firefly\\" references, but finding episodes that truly stood out from the rest is otherwise hard to do, as they were all good. The two part \\"Tick, Tick, Tick\\"/Boom\\" episodes were highlights.<br /> Fillion does a true star turn in headlining the show but he is ably assisted by co-stars Stana Katic, Molly C. Quinn and Susan Sullivan's as Castle's muse/partner, teen-age daughter and mother, respectively.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|My friends say this show is slow and boring. Hardly. It's deep, gripping, and believable. Boring and elementary is Adam West's 1960s Batman series.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I didnt like it, this game is kind of boring and it slows down.  got it and deleted it right away.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Nice break from other games  I enjoy it. The little dragons are cute as well. I will pass this on to mm y friends.
1451624468|5.0|This is the first book I've read from Lawrence Krauss.  It got me to dig deeper into particle physics and cosmology.  I'm looking forward to reading his next book.
0316056898|5.0|There are two things wrong with this book: 1)  It's not a 1,000 pages longer, and 2) it isn't volume one of ten.  Please, Tina Fey, WRITE MORE BOOKS, I'm begging you.
B005U9QJY2|5.0|Although this was probably considered a kiddie movie due to it being made by Jim Henson and featuring his puppets, the Dark Crystal was, in my humble opinion, ahead of its time. The concepts of duality, good vs bad, greed and waste vs kindness and conservation abound in this movie. Now that I have watched DC again after so many years I noticed themes like the elite Skexis being willing to steal &#34;vital life essence&#34; from the smaller beings to make themselves young which kind of reminds me of how our elite today abuse collagen or their apparent abuse of their environment which left the landscape around their dwelling barren, Gluttony, competition, and hunger for power are also shown. That the two races, one peaceful and one cruel and barbaric came from one and are still connected is another great theme. The many uses for crystals was not so commonly known when this movie was released as it is today esp. for technology like the crystal bats and our growing understanding of our planets and universe. I know many adults who loved this movie as much younger adults. The puppets still manage to pull off a lot of emotion and each character is complete.This is not Sci-Fi meets Sesame Street. The story line and plot are more developed than some newer movies.
B00DDXJRJG|3.0|I bought this product for my B&N Nook running Xylon Android because I have serious hearing loss and wanted something that could compensate to some degree the way a hearing aide does.  I use it with a pair of Bose earbuds to listen to courses from The Great Courses while riding the bus to work.  The equalizer bands work well for this purpose, allowing me to adjust the sound not only to compensate for my hearing loss reasonably well, but also to cut through the noise of the bus.  The only problems I have with it are that it can't be put in the background and it doesn't seem to check for touch inputs very often.  This means that I have to start it after I've started the audio player and leave it running, and that I have to poke it numerous times to shut it off or to make volume or equalizer adjustments.  Sometimes, I'm simply not able to get its attention.  It's this more than anything that leads me to give it only 3 stars.
B008602KQI|5.0|Although the young actors are not polished, I love this series and read the books. What you are witnessing when you watch the Hunger Games, is what the USA could end up being like if we are not vigilant. I think the eccentric costumes and emphasis on make-up, hair, excessive luxury and fashion make a revealing statement about what we deem important even now and how do we get those things. Don't we even now still buy our clothing made in sweat shops overseas? Notice the poverty of the districts and then the overwhelming glamour of the &#34;Capital&#34; and the gluttony of its inhabitants. Notice also the extent of the cruelty of this &#34;game&#34; which is obviously a sick spin on the Olympics combined with a deliberate political agenda to keep the inhabitants of the outlying districts in fear and submission by forcing them to sacrifice their children annually in this cruel form of revenge for the past uprising. With our nation in 2013 constantly being controlled by the media (and big biz/government that controls them) to fan the flames of racial hatred and gun control as a tool to attempt to provoke its citizens to rise up starting a second civil war so that our government which has long been planning to turn our own military on us would then have an excuse to do so and strip us of all our freedoms to satisfy the agenda of the elite to unite the entire world under one government. That is why the UN is screaming for US citizens to be unarmed. That is why China too is openly demanding we be disarmed. This is why we suddenly see shootings with shady &#34;prior&#34; CIA Dr.s involved in the backgrounds and &#34;treatment&#34; of the shooters who are young people on medications for depression that the drug manufacturers KNOW cause young people to become suicidal and murderous yet their medications and previous treatments are never shown on the news because everyone with a young male in public school who is being drugged just to get through the female biased public schools would pull their kid off it immediately. This is why there are supposedly &#34;mock&#34; emergency drills at each and every disaster location starting with 9/11. We are being herded toward the elite agenda for total world domination. Apparently they aren't rich and powerful enough. Pay close attention to this movie and what is going on right now in our world. Read the books and watch the movies. Research the lies our government tells us all the time. Released government documents despite the editing are beginning to tell the real stories.Look at the information leaked by our military personnel. The elite will do anything to get what they want and if you look at who finances every war you will know exactly who the heads are. Our government and politicians are taking orders from them. We do not run our country. If we aren't careful...we could easily end up like these characters living in outlying micromanaged and military controlled slave towns.
B00C1C0HS0|5.0|Wonderful for kids and adults alike!  This Prime movie is a perfect combination of action and comedy that kept everyone's interest.  Love the actors in Hop!
B000002O4X|5.0|The score (the soundtrack) is just marvelous.<br />Especially the part where he is flying her around in the private plane<br />That particular passage is soul-stirring.
B003B02O0A|5.0|Really a great book.  One of the few John Grisham books that has a happy ending.  I want to read the rest of the Ford Country series.
B006FS22Y8|5.0|I love all of her music. Each album is a little different. This one is a little more pop than the R&B of back to black.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|The cord is of better quality than the one that came with my Kindle.  Thanks for your prompt action and assistance.
B000YAX3P0|5.0|I love all of Amy's music! This one is as good as the others. Some great music. Gritty truth from the heart
B00D6MJOAQ|5.0|As a long-time BOC fan, this is an important addition to their catalog. I think the trumpets and abrupt shift in tone in the beginning of the first track signal that we consumers of mass quantities of BOC must pay attention: this album will be different. No &#34;Ready Let's Go&#34; preparing you for a math lesson. No easy on-ramp for this one. Instead, this album appears to meander and explore a bit as it introduces the new sonic richness the brothers have brought us. I'm still finding new rhythmic components they've buried in these songs. Of course, they deliver the goods to make one's head nod in the car whilst banging out another rhythm on the steering wheel. On this album, those jams are more hidden from immediate consumption: they are sprinkled throughout and, like Pete Standing Alone, they are waiting near the end of the album.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Amazing game to play and addicting! You won't get bored easily and I recommend this app because minions are adorable
B00AFEXRME|4.0|This is an excellent movie but, if you expect lots of flying sequences, forget it, all the action is in the first 20 minutes and then the story continues about a person with a drug and alcohol problem in a very responsible position and what happens to him. A brilliant part by Washington, whilst the premise of flying an MD-83 upside down (I am a pilot) is a wee bit far fetched, I found the way they did everything else about the accident, very believable.<br /><br />Greg
B004PAHZMC|5.0|not only is amazon wonderful but sells quality products! this one was a cute gift for my little lego collector that he uses to take to grandmas house! it is a great size & he loves to tote it around!
068817776X|5.0|No one who survived did so without an astounding story to tell afterward, and this is one such story.<br /><br />This is one of the most personal accounts of World War 2 I've ever read and also one of the best at conveying how the Nazis slowly closed the vice on the Jews in the decade leading up to the actual war - to watch the history documentaries it looks like the Nazis just showed up in Austria one day and the next day the death camps were in full swing.  This book conveys the day to day erosion of rights, the subjugation and the precipitous loss of optimism as the Nazi shadow loomed ever greater, and how once the truth was finally known, it was too late to act for so many.<br /><br />If you enjoy this book I also recommend Maus by Art Spiegelmen and Mans Search for Meaning, by Viktor Frankl.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|I am a fan of Jo Nesbo and the entire Harry Hole series of novels.  I have recommended all of these books to anyone interested in a good crime story.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I am addicted to the game. I must play it at least 3x a day,I love the changing of levels<br />unending
B005544TRQ|5.0|Keeps you watching and makes you wish you went to law school. I'm on season three and can't get enough.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I enjoyed this game very much. It wasn't too hard, but, also, was not easy. You had to think and try different moves. Looking forward to the next ROOM!
B0000062Y2|5.0|If you have seen and enjoyed the movie you will love the soundtrack.  Because the lyrics tell the whole story, listening to the soundtrack is like watching the movie again, or like listening to an audiobook, only catchier.  That catchiness is the one down-side.  You may be humming or singing the songs for a long time to come.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love the graphics and fast pace of this game. I had never played it on facebook but now I enjoy Diamond Dash as much ad candy  crush saga.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|Tomb Raider is a 2001 action film starring Angelina Jolie. It is based on the video game series by Core Design. The movie is a lot like the video game series in terms of the style, look, and atmosphere. Angelina Jolie plays Lara Croft really well, and the film has lots of action and cool scenes. I definitely recommend this movie.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|NEVER having played this game before I am impressed so far with the game. It has alot twists and turns you don't see coming
B005MSD6QU|5.0|Has to be one of te best shows on tv. This episode is great. The cast is great also I encourage anyone to watch
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great graphics.  Holds your attention and immerses you in its strange environment.  I liked it and I'm looking forward to the sequel.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was amazing. I loved it so much. I had already read it but I needed to do it again for school and it was amazing
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Maggie Smith does her usual brilliant job and Billie Connolly is hilarious.  However, the true stars are all<br />the musicians who make up the supporting cast.  Kudos to Dustin Hoffman for making a movie that made me laugh and also<br />made me think about my own mortality.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Find objects, open secret panels, and solve puzzles.  Best interactive game I've seen in a long time.  I think you will find it really puzzling and mind bending.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great app fun I can play this game all day love how they update the cities<br />You will enjoy the game.
1490313370|5.0|I've purchased 10 copies to hand out to friends &#34;of a certain age&#34;.  People like myself that have been sold a bag of goods about the American Dream and playing by a set of rules written by the very people that don't follow those rules.  I encourage everyone to read this book, listen to podcasts and quickly get comfortable with the concept and the need to Choose Yourself.  Afterall, if it is to be...it's up to me.
B00847KFDS|5.0|How could anyone not like this?  All the great songs and great musicians.  Read the story behind the songs and see where John draws his music from.  The only thing I don't like is the cover!  It creeps me out!  Surley there is a better picture of John out there.
B009WUAK2M|2.0|If you like to watch lots of things blow up this is the movie for you. Light on the story.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|I was looking for something different. I needed a change. The other books seemed so dull. Been there done that. Not that they weren't good because they were. But I just needed something different to brighten up my reading. You know like when you really want something sweet and you remember there was ice cream in the freezer. But you also know that if the kids know it's there then it will be gone fast? But you go and look anyway already defeated only to find that it's actually in there! It's a small scoop but you get excited anyway cause...well...it's the ice cream you were looking for. Or how about when you go through the drive thru and get home to find extra fries! Sigh....love when I get extra fries. Well that's what this book was for me. Yup extra fries. It was just that awesome. I even thought about licking my fingers afterwards. LOL seriously....<br /><br />DREW<br /><br />I can't even think of one word to describe him. He was arrogant, self-centered, egotistical, cynical, over bearing at times and smart too. He said it like it is and held nothing back. I think I love him. Here's an example:<br /><br />\\"Come on-are you going to tell me you never imagined that it was Brad Pitt sticking it to you instead of your beer-bellied husband? That's what I thought.\\"<br /><br />He's a genius and unfortunately for us he's also fictitious. Life sucks.<br /><br />I found his flu hilarious. The idea that he had the flu or what made him think it was the flu. LOL priceless. It really was like a train wreck but a good one. Is that even possible? I wanted no needed to know more about his screwed up thinking. This poor poor yet sweet and adorable man. His problem? He fell in love.<br /><br />I've never read a book quite like this one. Being entirely narrated by the lead character. Plus it was a guy's pov all the way and I love that too.<br />Drew learns a tough lesson in this book. You'll have to read it to find out what it is. The change though is remarkable and sweet and funny and I was totally swooning in the end. It made my heart happy. I loved the way it ended. Reminded me of MTV Cribs where they tell you to just get the hell out of their houses.<br /><br />More Drew:<br /><br />\\"My office door slams open, leaving a dent in the drywall. Here we go. \\"You are driving me crazy!\\" Her cheeks are flushed, her breathing's fast, and she's got murder in her eyes. Beautiful. I raise my brows hopefully. \\"Crazy? Like you want to rip my shirt open again?\\" \\"No. Crazy like the itch of a yeast infection that just won't go away.\\" I flinch. Can't help it. I mean-Christ.\\"<br /><br />I'm very much looking forward to the next book.  I hope it's just as funny and different as this one was.d I was totally swooning in the end. It made my heart happy.

B006BDHAX0|4.0|This game has a good variety of layouts to solve. They are timed so you can challenge yourself. Well worth the price ($0.99).
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I'm the furthest thing from a television connoisseur, but it's rapidly apparent this show has it all.  The cast is top notch, the writing, direction, music, it's all there.  You won't find a better television show.
B00DF0POXA|5.0|Mr West has did it again by pushing me in envelope as far as creating a new sound for hip hop. I enjoy that he tries to explore other non traditional route in making his music which makes a big difference in how his album sounds compare to other artist. I enjoy listening to it there are the songs on the album that take us back to the old Kanye along with new songs that are a quintessentially Kanye
B006BGZJJ4|2.0|Ok so I misplaced the charger that was sold with my Kindle Fire that was purchased over a year ago. So No big deal I log on purchase another one but only the one that was given with the Kindle is not sold so I had to purchase this USB and the Power charger. The USB arrived today fits fine since the power charge adapter didn't arrive I hooked it up to the PC. And sadly after two hours no charge.  I hope when the power charge arrives this will work. I am very upset.....
B00CWVG1Z8|2.0|this movie was way too slow. I think it could have been a better story if it was sped up. Great actors just too slow and by the time things start moving the movie's almost over and you don't even care!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging but not overwhelming google. Try it you will like it. Good fun for the entire family. You will like it.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|It's no so often that I love the FAOTD. But this is way cool! Creative and fun. I wouldn't have been sorry if I paid for it. Just keep in mind that there is around an hour of gameplay. I hope for more levels or a sequel. Maybe someday we could design our own levels and share them. :)
0770437400|5.0|Well I'm assuming I'm not the only philistine - I had not heard of or consider World War Z until said movie came out earlier this year. Since then I'd heard a lot of criticism about 'alternate' endings and figured they butchered the plot of the book. Although in the meantime I also heard much about this book being an 'oral history' which produced a response from me 'Oh Ok' (I really had no idea what that meant)<br /><br />So if there is anyone out there suffering the same: the oral history is essentially a series of interviews of significant (or close to significant) people who lived through 'World War Z.' 99% of the prose is in interview format, with a few factoids thrown in for authenticity.<br /><br />Authenticity is something Brooks does well, there is an international perspective in this book that never feels caricatured or insensitively done.<br /><br />However do not pick up this book expecting a compelling (handsome) protagonist, zombie scares or resolution. The book's tension isn't build around the question of humankind surviving the zombie apocalypse, but what we had to do to survive.<br /><br />Keeping interest high in this format is Brook's real achievement, and achieve he does.
B00DFFI7K2|1.0|too bad there was a lot of things that should have been taken out to make it better but then there would be no movie left.  Too bad.
B003OFVIXG|4.0|this album is wonderful, she has a soft sexy voice and you find yourself relaxing and enjoying life. She reminds me of a very young Édith Piaf
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is great its even better than both temple runs.<br />I would play this all day if there wasn't a battery on my kindle.
140006922X|1.0|After reading this book, I found this book very factually wrong . The author gets his history very wrong . Not a good read .

B009DCOU9S|4.0|I like search and puzzle games and they all go by to quick. This game was no exception however I think this game was better than a lot more than I have played.<br />I would not say I had a lot of glitches in this game at one point there were some touch sensitivity but the game was still fun.
0743243153|4.0|The book is thoughtful; and definitely gives you some insight on what love is and what it is not, and how real love can be achieved if you are willing to be true to yourself. You can't help but read this book and think back on your own life and the things you have said/done, and how your actions (and the actions of others) have impacted your life.  It's therapeutic and considerate, and it allows you to be forgiving of yourself and know that you can grow and be better regardless of your circumstances or what has happened in your past.
0761169431|5.0|This is a great gift for either a Star Wars fan or an origami fan.  The book also includes special paper for completing the projects which you can either copy or use the originals.  Great gift item.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I got this for my kids but I play it more than anyone. I rarely get into games like this but it is very addicting. I was surprised at all the upgrades you can get just playing and earning coins. I have been hooked on this game all summer. You wont regret this one!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|It has to be the BEST book I have read this year. In fact, I read this before I read other books I had on my Kindle. As I started to read them, I felt &#34;let down&#34; for a bit.
140006922X|5.0|This review is to offset the unfair 1-star review targeting of this book due to Fox New's idiot reporting. Clearly this man is an intellectual with vast history in this field.
B0062P3392|4.0|Killer Elite(released Sept/11)stars,among others,Jason Statham as Danny Bryce,Clive Owen as Spike Logan,Yvonne Strahovski as Anne Frazier and Robert De Niro as Hunter.This film is certainly a wild ride and it has its characters jumping back and forth between the Arabian desert and London,England on a regular basis.It also has a LOT of PLOT.They say the devil is in the details,and if you can hang on for the ride,in the end it will be worth it.<br />The story finds Statham as an elite assassin who comes out of retirement in order to rescue his ex partner DeNiro,who is being held by an Arabian Sheik.In exchange for his ex partners freedom,he wants Statham to kill the three ex British SAS soldiers who killed his three sons.Statham agrees and he starts down a long,long path of revenge for the Sheik.Statham gets his contact info from a travel agent,who in turn gets his from a covert government agent.<br />Statham assembles a small group together to tackle each job.They either work in tandem or separately.But all hits must have proof on film of their confessions and subsequent death.Each hit takes a lot of prep time and one by one they reach their third victim.By that time a group of ex SAS men,led by Owen,has been hot on their trail and Owen has already done one on one battle with Statham.Owen's group is called the Feathermen,and he reports directly to a hush hush group of individuals high up in government circles.As the heat rises the group start gets cold feet and eventually Owen finds himself alone and rogue.<br />Statham finishes the last man and he reports to the Sheik and it all ends.He heads back home to his girlfriend and De Niro is free and he also heads homeward.All is well until one night Statham receives a call saying the job isn't finished.It seems there's one more to go;a man who is writing a book,which contains the name of the real killer of one of the Sheiks sons.To put the point home the caller tells him to check his girlfriend,if he has any doubts.He goes upstairs to find her quite well,lying in bed,but quickly retrieves an unspent bullet from behind her head,on the pillow.Realizing he has to go this alone,he takes her with him to Paris.He contacts DeNiro who comes back to watch his girlfriend for him,though DeNiro pleas to go along with him.<br />Statham attends a book signing of the author,who he must off.However it is all a clever trap to get Statham,by Owen.Statham gets his man and evidence and flees,but is eventually caught.Statham agrees to tell Owen exactly what has been happening in exchange for his freedom.But in walks the secretive government man who has been dishing intel to Statham's contact/travel agent.He tells them the government wants the oil rich land the Sheik owns and that they were both set up from the start.A fight ensues with the G-man going down and Statham fleeing.<br />Next we have Statham and DeNiro back in Arabia,with Statham about to walk in to hand over the evidence.Something is amiss though,as Owen has gone in ahead and handed it over,ahead of Statham's arrival.Not only that but Owen has killed the Sheik and Owen has had to flee for his life.Statham and DeNiro take care of the Sheik's men and they stop Owen.Deniro takes some of the pay money for his own expenses,but Statham refuses any of it.DeNiro leaves the rest for Owen who he says better use it well,because the government man he killed,plus his ex bosses of the Feathermen,will be coming after him.They leave Owen to his own devices and Statham and DeNiro return to their own lives.<br />The film is based on a true story from the /91 book called Feathermen.The author laid it all out there,but of course the British establishment denied everything from start to finish.My storytelling of this film which lasts a good two hours,is far less than a Reader's Digest version.I make the first three killings within a paragraph and those hits took over an hour of film time. As I said there is a LOT of plot,and so many twists and turns and intrigues,that one could really never do justice to it all.Just trust me,that if you just hang in there,you will be rewarded.The film does have a tendency to drift a little,such as their traveling back and forth between desert and civilization constantly,and who is on the hit list next,can get a little overwhelming.But the makers somehow manage to keep a straight heading throughout.<br />Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp in its 2:40:1 original a/r.There are cast interviews and 13 deleted scenes.<br />All in all a whopper of a story to tell,but based on true incidents.Statham is on game and as intense as always.DeNiro,while not having a significant role to play is also on target as is other star Clive Owen.Recommended.s,that one could really never do justice to it all.Just trust me,that if you just hang in there,you will be rewarded.The film does have a tendency to drift a little,such as their traveling back and forth between desert and civilization constantly,and who is on the hit list next,can get a little overwhelming.But the makers somehow manage to keep a straight heading throughout.<br />Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp in its 2:40:1 original a/r.There are cast interviews and 13 deleted scenes.<br />All in all a whopper of a story to tell,but based on true incidents.Statham is on game and as intense as always.DeNiro,while not having a significant role to play is also on target as is other star Clive Owen.Recommended.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Saw this book at a school book sale and my wife was creeped out with the pictures so we didn't get it for our daughters. Saw it again at another book sale and bought it for myself, so I could be creeped out. And I was. My only bummer was having to wait until 1/2014 for the next book.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Everyone is very good looking, and the acting is very believable. Love the clothing, sets. We have been watching it nonstop after finding the show on Amazon Video. Now we have moved to Series III.
B009KUWWW0|5.0|Both captivating and interesting read especially if you enjoy Medieval history with an exciting story, however you must read &#34;Pillars of the Earth&#34; by Ken Follett first.
1554072840|5.0|this is only potty book we have that actually shows poop and pee, and that is a big hit with my daughter.  she also loves the page that points out all of the body parts.  she is a big fan!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I would love to tell you about this app, but I am unable to get on. The game will not load and I can't get onto it. I have re-downloaded this game many times but still will not work. I would appreciate it if you fixed this problem. Thank you
B009NY43NY|2.0|i haven't been really interested in this series in quite some time, but i really wanted to know who sookie would end up with.  i must say, this book is by far the least interesting and i didn't think they could get any worse.  i was also not a fan of the different points-of-view.  after so many books from sookie's mind, it's really weird to have anything else.  i am happy it's over!
140053271X|4.0|the best parts: the touch screen, the battery life, the contours (easy to hold), and the fact that it reads epubs and pdfs well.<br /><br />the parts that could be improved: highlighting the text with accuracy is pretty difficult, sometimes the touch screen is not as responsive as I am used to on other products
B0094BB4TW|2.0|It doesn't do what I thought It would!! Its too hard to use it...I cant read some of my friends posts......
B009JBZH54|5.0|Great price for what you get. I just can't believe that it included a coupon for the Ultimate Blu-ray box set!
B0043JDUNS|4.0|Not much to say. It's a pretty good movie and worth the rewatch. Just getting the series in order for kicks and giggles.
B006Y5EDRG|4.0|Live the music and drama, but husband wasn't that into it. Great pick and looking forward to season two on prime.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|It kind of felt a little like Eat Pray Love only in prison. Which is why I loved it so much. A deeply personal experience the Piper lets us go through with her...as much as one can without really being there. Loved the book and I'm also enjoying the series on Netflix.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|What a delightful movie!  Yes, the plot was simple and, in general, there wasn't much of what wins awards (not much complexity, conflict, etc.) but I found it a \\"breath of fresh air\\".  The actors/actresses seem to take delight in their opportunity to a part of the movie.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Game is entertaining and addictive...enjoy the challenge of looking for items and trying to complete the new quests it gives you as you go on.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love turning this on at night when my mind &quot;just won't quit.&quot; It almost always sends me right to la-la land.<br /><br />Highly recommended... I found my favorite combination of 3-4 sounds and haven't even STARTED to scratch the surface of what this app can do.
B00BMR5HOO|5.0|It lets me know if it going to be too hot to  walk in morning or at night because I have health issues.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|Absolutely my new favorite album and band!!  Gladly would have paid more for it.  This is a great deal (especially with the free download!)
B009KS4XRO|1.0|There have been many changes to this game recently and it's not nearly as much fun as it used to be.  It's harder to win now, they limit you on how many free gifts you can receive from your team mates, the amount of bingo credits needed to play the newer games is too high, etc.  They are trying to make it almost impossible to play without buying bingo credits.
B008J34466|5.0|This was a gift for my wife and she absolutely loves it!  Pink doesn't get any better than this. Bravo!!
0440243661|5.0|Another great book of his.  Jack Reacher is his usual amazing self in this read.  You'll love it again if you read it twice!
B00CATSONE|4.0|This is a short look into Tesla's life, which made me want to read more about him. I learned a lot.
044024367X|5.0|Another great Lee Child thriller!  I was totally wrapped up in this one, and Jack Reacher is amazing again.  Keep writing Lee!
B008BIGEHG|4.0|A book written much later than the original poorly books by agatha Christie.  A simple story that becomes very involved. Great read.
B005HSL626|5.0|I loved it because it is easy to beat all of the levels. Even my baby brother (he is 4 he can beat every level. It is easy like 1.2.3.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|The characters are real, the story moving.  Hard to put down.  Modern, but timeless. There was great humor and sadness.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It has great instructions its a fun simple game and i could play on it for hours!!!I can't wait to see if there's a second editon
B000FC2KL0|5.0|What an &#34;interesting&#34; lifestyle and so happy he cleaned up his life. Couldn't put the book down and even googled more especially music.
0385535147|5.0|I have read all of John Grisham's books and this was absolutely one of the very best.  My favorite of all time is still A Time to Kill, but I'm not sure if it was really the best or it's just because it is the first John Grisham I read.  Either way he is my all time favorite author.  Hope he writes many many more.<br /><br /> .
B005723JSQ|3.0|This is by far a very outlandish story, let's face it there is no way in Hades this would have happened as it did in the book in the real world...that being said, I read books to get away from the real world.  It was in the least entertaining, however the characters are a little too boring for my taste.
B002S8AGZG|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies!  Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles are the perfect modern day Shakespearean characters!  Great modern remake of The Taming of the Shrew!
B000LTAY1U|5.0|High quality in its superb craftsmanship regardless of its price point.<br />Too good to be wear on my sweaty wrist.
B00AYF5SRG|5.0|These are the best renditions of Vivaldi I have ever heard.  He captures the power and drive of this music.
1781162646|5.0|As a longtime King reader, I've come to expect the unexpected. So many people have him pigeonholed as a \\"horror\\" writer, and its simply not, nor has it ever been, true. I had this one finished in less than 48 hours after starting it. Its a genuinely fun read that I could not put down. Not at all a literary masterpiece, but I think anyone would enjoy this book, whether you're a fan of Stephen King or not.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|This hidden object game has a story which makes it different.  It has not been hard to get through the chapters.  The only thing negative is if you exit the game during a chapter it starts back at the beginning of that chapter.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I thought it was a great season, very suspenseful and action packed but still had that amazing character quality that they always produce.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I enjoy the different types of puzzles in the game. Not just hidden object. The same room will have a new task each time.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|My grandson uses this kindle more than me. ( I read outside and had to get an e-ink).  This case protects the kindle nicely.  He also likes the case.
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|I saw the original version &#34;House Of Cards&#34; on the BBC. I was always curious how it could be done with American politics. I'm very pleased. The acting is superb and the writing is excellent. There should be more programs like this on TV.
B000089RV6|5.0|My son is a huge AC/DC Fan.  I liked being able to purchase online rather than burning gas to locate it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Doesn't everyone?  I think it's one of the best ensemble shows ever, and maggie Smith is iconic. What's not to like?
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really like this useful Bible.  there are so many versions that are so easy to read.  I really recommend this ap

034544678X|5.0|This book was in good shape and since I did not need a new one, it is definitely a good buy.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|This flick is Quirky and fun, just classic Bruce Willis. Blow stuff up, comedy and violence. Looking forward to part 2!
B001W79MBI|5.0|This one was a no brainier! A definite must see for any samurai or anime lover would for sure recommend this movie to see many times over!
B00358ESI4|5.0|This movie was really cool a lot war scenes done right a little scary when you think of the people who had to endure this war but this movie gets my thumbs up!
0897500482|5.0|If you are all ready a martial arts master this isn't for you as your mind is already shaped to know a lot of conditioning techniques this book teaches but if you want to expand you mind on the subject (remember to keep an open mind) this book definitely won't heart! As for the rest of you who aren't you should own this copy!
B0010358D0|5.0|A great movie! Good action, good story, great animation and overall really good attention to detail I can't wait to see what this director has in store for us next!
1781162646|5.0|I ordered this book for my daughter. Upon talking with her last, she hadn't read it yet.  But I am an avid Stephen King reader, so I know it will be a good book.
030746363X|5.0|This book is very informative and full of interesting facts.  Easy read. Found out a lot of information that I was not aware of.
B005RZB65Q|5.0|This book changed my understanding about myself, my feelings and reactions in everyday life. Thanks<br />Hope to implement my learning
B0091REZMW|3.0|This is a fun game. I enjoy finding and collecting the different items. The only problem is that there can be too many quests and objectives to achieve at once. Sometimes I collect items and have no idea what they're for or how to use them.  I end up exploring the same rooms over and over just to collect coins and energy. So many things at once just get overwhelming. Still, a fun premise.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|GREAT GAME!!!But u have to buy or somehow earn a lot of coins just to buy another horse,or any equipment
140006922X|5.0|You are already familiar with Mel Gibson's Jesus.  Even if you never saw the movie Passion of Christ, certainly, you know the story.<br /><br /> It is time to look at Jesus from a different point of view. A point of view that chooses NOT to make certain assumption (e.g. Son of God, virgin birth, literary take on bible, etc).  From the point of view of Jesus as a man, a Jewish man, a poor peasant Jewish man, who grew up in a particularly impoverished area under Roman occupation, at a time  when fundamentalism and revolutionary zeal was specially strong.<br /><br />If you could never quite digest the more supernatural aspects of Christianity, but had an interest in the INDIVIDUAL Jesus, and the political and social environment of his time, read this book.<br /><br />If you want to understand the life and death of Jesus, the mood of  Jews under Roman occupation, suffering under clergy corruption and greed, read this book.<br /><br />If you want to  understand the forces and logic behind the evolution of Christianity after Jesus' execution, read  this book.<br /><br />Reza Aslan systematically peals away the many layers of supernatural fluff, fabrications and exaggerations that have been added on to the individual Jesus of Nazareth over  many centuries.  The result is the  picture of a fascinating man, an approachable man, a real person whom I personally can relate to and admire. Jesus the individual (Jesus of Nazareth as reza Aslan calls him) lives  in a real place, in a real world, that makes sense. The people around him make sense.<br /><br />The events, individuals (including Jesus) and their actions make sense. They are rational. They are logical.  They are worldly. And they are based on extensive historical research, gathered,  studied,and summarized for your reading pleasure.<br /><br />Whether Christian, or not, you owe it to yourself to read this book. I see some 1 stars who most likely have not even read this book, but instead engage in ad hominem fallacy, attacking the writer's faith instead of the arguments/content.
B00CTKHXFO|4.0|I like it but the games feel too dated when you play them. I played through a couple before I got bored and decided to play new games.
B003Y3ZTGA|5.0|This album is really great! Katy Perry is a talented song writer. This album has great songs to dance to and songs to inspire and songs for break ups. I truly enjoyed the whole album
0807014273|5.0|I love this book that explains and describes the author's experiences. The knowledge that I have obtained reading this piece of literature has made me a better person and has inspired me to share my story and try to help others to recognize that we are all human beings with the same propensities for good or evil. Great literature a master piece.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love it it is the best game for me I have found like this . I love it like I do heartland it reminds me of Amy on this

B000O8OTNC|5.0|Great little device. Well worth the bucks. Seems to have high quality sharpeners. Used it on a couple of knives that were fairly sharp. Honed a better edge. Used on axe & hatchet and was surprised how quickly edge sharpened. Used on a serrated knife. Kind of a pain but it got the job done. Highly recommend for camping and for the tool box.
B000FCKPHG|5.0|The book is an easy read. But the big idea it offers is radical and simple.<br />If you believe your ability is 'innate' (a fixed mindset) it undercuts your motivation, strategies, and abilities to grow.<br />If you believe your ability can be improved (a growth mindset),<br />then you challenge yourself to push your innate abilities to their highest level.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I'm 50 years old and have found this series very enjoyable.  Never heard of them before the movie came out and didn't pay much attention to the movie until it was on Netflix.  But then saw (and enjoyed) the movie and decided I had to read the books.  And I was right.  I did HAVE to read the books.  I couldn't put the first one down once I started reading it.  Same with the second one.  It is a well written interesting story that you don't have to be a younger person to enjoy.
B005SHTXN0|5.0|I love this movie!! It's a classic! I watched it years and years ago for the first time. I watched it again with my 20 year old daughter. She loved it, too!! This movie is timeless!
B007V65R54|5.0|A good analysis of why some predictions have become better (weather) while some have not (earthquakes).  Baseball and poker don't really interest me, but as a personal history of his education in probabilistic thinking, they are fascinating.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Rich descriptions of people and places.  Thoughtful phrases.  As rich in information as The Kite Runners.  I can't wait to read<br />And The Mountains Echoed.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|A very good page-turner! I could not put it down. The writing is a bit stilted at times, but the story was compelling enough that it did not really detract.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|If you read North and South by John Jakes, many years ago, you can skip this book.  Disappointed and wished it would end
1419705644|3.0|I was honestly hoping for more out of the Adventure Time Encyclopedia. In some regards it's comprehensive - lots of fun pictures (sadly, the majority are lifted right from the show) in a nice layout, a few tidbits about characters and kingdoms - but there really isn't any substance within. I literally have not come across anything in the book that any regular viewer wouldn't already know. Now don't get me wrong, I wasn't expecting a whole lot, it's a kid's show after all, and much of its intrigue is in the unexplained, but come on, this is light reading, spelled L-I-T-E.<br /><br />The worse thing about it is that nearly everything in the book is from the devil-like Hunson Abadeer's (Marceline's father and ruler of the Nightosphere) point of view so it all comes off incredibly schtick-ey and unreliable. Unfortunately, it isn't up to Adventure Time's usually standards and just isn't all that funny. Page after page of sloppy insults and derision gets old fast and what's left is meager and unsatisfying. What fans want is a comprehensive guidebook with insight into the land of Ooo not bad jokes and schtick. In my view the creators and producers of the show only have a few chances to get this right. Each lackluster effort and half-assed merchandising ploy diminishes the show as a whole and takes it out of the realm of \\"legendary\\", where it currently, but shakily resides, and makes it just another sad marketing attempt in the form of a cartoon. I really hope something better is in the works.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This series is one of the best I've ever seen. The casting is outstanding as well as the stellar acting. The writers are very familiar with the legal environment, most likely through excellent consultants. There are several prominent persons who make appearances as themselves. I only wish there were more than 4 seasons!
B0030MM68O|4.0|was highly acclaimed, so I wanted to see it. Excellent movie. Very realistic scenes, acting was excellent also. Recommend it!
0307476073|5.0|Both my husband and I loved this book.  It was such an inspiring story and very well written. The brutal honesty with which Cheryl wrote the book was a little shocking.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Amazon is better than goggle apps all games are very nice and web is easy to use.keep up good work.
B00CELB94E|5.0|Favorite &#34;new&#34; band out there.  Hope U.S. dates are in the near future.  Would love a DVD before long as well.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Slow and negative feel. If you are negative in a relationship get out of it. The book led me to the feel of make the most of a bad situation. A warped person should be removed from a parenting situation.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I just love how this game has a good mix of challenging and easy levels, even though its super addicting! Great time killer, i could play it all day. 5 stars, instant classic!!!
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Love it... Fun and easy wish you could win more tokens to play more withouhaving to buy tokens ..other than that great
B006JD48NM|5.0|Documentary, but the story is so great, that it reads like a movie plot.  The story flows so well, that you have to believe that some scenes were re-enactments with actors.  The story of one of the greatest racers in history.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Nothing is better than a boxed set of your favorite film series!  All 8 films in one box!  Enough said!
B008LV8TSU|5.0|It is considerably different from the animated movie by the same name by studio Ghibli, however they are both grand tellings of the story, naturall, the book came first.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|We all had a lot of laughs and in joyed it very much.  I do wish that the movies didn't have so much bad language in them.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|The stories shared in this book show women how to stop holding themselves back and get what they want out of life.
B00DYOOGYK|4.0|Very good game. It's definitely worth your money if you're a fan of the Grand theft auto franchise or Saints row for the consoles. There is a lot to do and it is very open and there are tons of weapons, vehicles, and clothes. The graphics are pretty decent for a tablet game it looks like this game was on the PS2 and the first xbox. But Shadow gun proofed that tablets can do much more, that game looks like it's on the Xbox 360 or the ps3.  There are 3 big problems with this game though: 1. It takes up a lot of space so you'll need to delete a lot of stuff. 2. the controls are a little complicated if you're using touch controls. 3. sometimes the game makes you exit the app. But bedsides these 3 problems I'd say it's a must buy. My final verdict is an 8.5/10
B009UX2YAC|4.0|My son loves this game.  It takes skill and speed to get away from the guard.  I recommended it a good pass time.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Marvel the avengers is one of the best action movies that I have ever seen. I would recommend it to anyone who is into Marvel comics!!
