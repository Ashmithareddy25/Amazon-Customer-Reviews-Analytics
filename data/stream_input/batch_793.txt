B000VJ271A|4.0|It is an excellent presentation of Massenet's opera Manon.  Of course, the dream cast of Natalie Dessay and Rolando Villazon contributes enormously to the enjoyment of this DVD.  The production is first-class and depicts the life of these women, who are paid for by wealthy suiters, more realistically than in any other production.  Highly recommended.
B000MCIBE8|5.0|the doors created this timeless masterpiece some 41 years ago!!! the songs are sparkling with a different kind of bioelectricity that can still be sensed today. the five masterpieces of mood on this album are, break on through, light my fire, crystal ship, backdoorman, and of course the end... the other songs are their lesser works. some are a little outdated-sounding, and adolescence-tinged, like end of the night, whiskey bar, i looked at you, but are interesting period pieces that remind us of the new hippiedom, and freedom that swept the country at that time. Overall, a brilliant album that has stood the test of time and will continue to inspire rock fans, and burgeoning rock musicians who may never equal its monumental standing and power... 'It-is-Jim- Morrison's-voice-Ray Manzarek's-keyboards/organ-Robbie-Krieger's-lead- guitar-John-Densmore's-accomplished-drumming' that makes up the doors, a near-perfect continuum that has been seen very rarely...KT
B000YCLRBA|5.0|This is by far the best rendition of \\"Eugene Onegin\\" that has ever been issued on DVD.  The production by Robert Carson is stunning, even without a lot of scenery.  Carson's staging is interesting and imaginative; the lighting is very good, as well.  This notwithstanding, the portrayal of the protagonists is outstanding - foremost the Onegin by Dmitri Hvorostovsky, followed by Renee Fleming as Tatiana and Ramon Vargas as Lensky.  Chor and Orchestra of the Metropolitan Opera under Valery Giergev are at their best.  This DVD is a must - highly recommended.
B000MCIBAW|5.0|somewhat underappreciated masterpiece by the eternal doors... It stands as one of the most coherent albums ever released... with gradual build up of tension with variance, and return to tension pools, with an unbelievably effective ending... Deep thinking and deep sounding rock can not get any better than when the music's over, the only other over- 10-minutes-long studio-recorded masterwork by the doors. The other one being the end on the first album obviously. The album kind of flows like a river with eddies and tributaries, and actually achieves a more consistent line of appeal than their first album which has the weakness of being somewhat less consistent in the choice of song-sequencing, that is: great songs interspersed with much lesser works that often leads to a sense of averaging to mentally sustain the interest. This album is superior in that aspect of maintaining a higher dergee of profundity. this album would be in the top five most underrated masterpieces of rock. i know of no other group that has achieved such a feat of releasing such two great works of art back to back in the same year...KT
B0017I1FNK|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy listening to Emmy Lou...her voice and song choices is always great and this CD is as good as most.  I especially like two written by other well-known performers...\\"Old Five and Dimers Like Me\\" by Waylon Jennings and \\"All That You Have is your Soul,\\" written by Tracy Chapman. She did a great job on both, and on the whole CD.
B0014DBZY2|5.0|WOW!  This is the most exciting album I have had the pleasure to bump into in years!  Where to begin?  First, I am a drummer...it has been an even longer time since a \\"new\\" drummer on the scene has blown me away, not only with his skills, but the creative angles he comes up with rhymically...outstanding!  On track 7, he just gets stanky!!! This band takes the 80's retro comeback to a whole new level...they don't come off as contrived, they sound like a tight-knit unit that's getting it's groove on.  The songs are catchy, but in a challenging, have to listen to it a couple of times to catch the hook kind of way...I really love this album!  I always try to include references to other artists/bands...this will be easy and hard for this band/album...I hear traces of Talking Heads \\"Remain in Light\\"  ie groovy rhythm section, funky basslines, rhymic-yet static guitar w/ lots of reverb and delay at times reminding of The blessed Chameleons, PIL ie chanting vocals, Hood ie glitchy electronica ala Cold House, Steve Reich ie use of repetition, Adam and the Ants \\"Kings of the Wild Frontier\\"  tribal rhythms/chanting vocals, Polyrock ie well, it just reminds me of them, and even Devo at times just cause.  All of this combined into an original blend...check this album out..make no judgement until you've listened to the whole thing and it will blow you away if you are into original, New Wavish sounding music.  Just GREAT!!! PS  For us fans of this kind of music...remember the first couple of times you listened to Interpol's \\"Turn on the Bright Lights\\" and you were transported immediately back to \\"Strange Times\\" and \\"Heaven Up Here\\", but you felt that Interpol was not faking the sound, that it was REAL...you will have the same reaction to this album.  Album of the year...hands down, no contest!
0743454537|5.0|I just loved this book, I could not put it down. Its about the Plain people in the Amish country, it includes lies, murder, lots of scenes in the court room, How the Amish stick together, and believe in their way of life. Just a wonderful book.

B0011FXLCC|5.0|It starts out with just Alison and a guitar accompaniment, slowly adding strings, then bass as it comes into full flower. Near the end, bird sounds and delicate but full harmonies enrich \\"Clowns\\" even more. It's the first track we experience and it is simply delicious. It's also one of my favorites from this album. \\"Little Bird\\" begins with a sublime keyboard melody and also becomes musically fuller as it progresses. Alison's voice sounds a bit older on this cut which matches the slightly melancholy tune. If it weren't for the totally organic-sounding addition of a psychedelic arrangement and drums near the end, \\"Little Bird\\" wouldn't have sounded out of place on \\"Felt Mountain\\". This is where the influences of \\"Black Cherry\\" and \\"Supernature\\" begin. \\"Happiness\\" is done as a bit of Beatlesque march/anthem that wouldn't have been out of place on \\"Supernature\\". Swooshing synthesizers, acoustic guitar and layers of Alison's vocals color the sweet \\"Road To Somewhere\\". Will Gregory's contributions to this album are not to be dismissed. His playing is inventive and tasteful as always. \\"Eat Yourself\\" is a folksy piece, just beautiful with a sad undercurrent that really touches me despite the absurd (though great) title. Although \\"Some People\\" has its charms, it sounds like an outtake from \\"Black Cherry\\". It's gorgeous anyway, with its swells of sound, a nice ebb and flow.<br />One of Goldfrapp's most joyous songs is \\"A&E\\". This song gets me high and is probably my favorite of their entire catalog. It doesn't sound like anything from their previous discs and in that we find them evolving as artists. \\"Cologne Cerrone Houdini\\" is one of the songs on \\"Seventh Tree\\" along with \\"Clowns\\" and \\"Eat Yourself\\" that come closest to \\"Felt Mountain\\". Like \\"A&E\\", \\"Caravan Girl\\" and the closing \\"Monster Love\\" are also different sounding pieces for Goldfrapp. All in all, only \\"Felt Mountain\\" is better than this album to these ears and this is a very close second. I also loved \\"Cherry\\" and \\"Supernature\\" but if you're looking for more glam and more beats, you won't find them here. I would encourage you to get the deluxe version of \\"Tree\\" as it comes with a beautiful (and odd) poster of Alison and a marvelous little handwritten lyric book. The artful postcards and the DVD that contains a short film and a video are pretty cool too.pernature\\" but if you're looking for more glam and more beats, you won't find them here.

B000B7QCKO|5.0|Yanni's music is so beautiful it brought tears to my eyes watching his<br />Live at the Acropolis DVD. Tears of joy. :o)<br />His music is full of joy and great rhythm. You can tell Yanni loves<br />what he is doing. So far this is his best.<br />\\"I would rather live my life as if there is a God, and die to find out<br />there isn't, than live my life as if there isn't, and die to find out there is.\\"
B0016HNOXQ|1.0|The answer is absolute.  This is not considered a comeback.  Replacing these  songs with b-sides would've allowed this being considered a hit album.  Sounds like Gibbon's side project without ideas.  Whatever happened to trip-hop muzik that Portishead was known for?  Scratches, beats, orchestra of spacey loops?  None of the above.  Just sheer disappointment and waste of time.  Some may say this is called evolution, but I think it's depression for the masses.  Becoming a halfway fan.

B0015AARJI|3.0|It's about time they came out with the dualshock controller for the PS3. Now all they have to do is make more games that support that feature.
B00005JPTA|4.0|I gave this film four stars ONLY,and I repeat, ONLY, because of the amazing quality of Viggo Mortensen's acting. He remains stony-faced throughout the film, and much is communicated with the most subtle of expressions. I was impressed even by his use of subtle body language.  I have a new respect for him as an actor after watching this film, and hope to see more of his work in the future.<br />This film should be rated NC-17, not R, for the full frontal male nudity, graphic sex scene, and intense, gory and realistic violence. THe plot is flawed, andmany will find especially the ending to be unfulfilling.<br />Also, I have one important question: Why do the Russian gangsters in this film speak english (Russian-accented) with an American accent? its wierdly contrasted to Naomi Watt's English accent.<br />I must add that the fight scene in the bath house is one of the best I've ever seen on film, mostly because it seemed to lack that obvious choreographed feel. Once again Viggo's acting makes this scene stand out.
1572816112|5.0|Most RW clones leave me cold--how many times can you repeat the same themes? It seems to me that with each derivation of the RW deck, the symbolism gets watered down.       NOT SO with this deck. Under the watchful eye of the moon, the tarot story develops. This deck also depicts the duality of existance, with the combination sun/moon faces. The graphics are somewhat unique (the Empress has 3 breasts, and on the Lovers card the snake bites the female on the leg.) The different symbology on the cards adds extra depth and meaning. Conventional wisdom usually states to use your own intuition and not use the LWB (little white book) that comes with the cards. . .but in this case the LWB is useful for explanation of some of the imagery.    I've done some test readings with the deck and the results were on point. If you want to check out more images of the cards check out Patrick's website. Well done.
B0013BNY2Q|5.0|Basicamente uno de los mejores albumes de la banda, por un momento pareciera que regresas a lo mejor de la m&uacute;sica en los 90's: Riffs grunge y tiempos agresivos con una aspera pero melodiosa ejecuci&oacute;n vocal.<br />REM se reencuentra en este album y nos trae muy buen m&uacute;sica, no sigas leyendo esto que pierdes el tiempo, simplemente pon el cd en tu carro y dejate llevar hasta alcanzar el REM.
1582701709|1.0|The Secret is really no secret.  This is nothing more than regurgitated recycled Hinduism/Shamanism/New Age occult thinking.  It's full of lies, distortions missrepresentations and obsurdities.  It is totally mind blowing how people are falling for it.      For instance the book says:  \\"It has been scientifically proven that an affirmative thought is hundreds of times more powerful than a negative thought.\\"    Really????  When/where/how were these scientific studies done??    The author is a shrewd liar, a charletan.  Take your money and buy yourself an ice cream cone.  It will be better spent than on this occultic dribble.
B0019FOC5E|4.0|Saw the film weeks ago and it is a lot of fun.  Reminded me a lot of how I felt when I saw GREASE  for the first time.  It dares you to laugh at it but you just end up smiling the whole time.  Brosnan talks his way through his numbers.  Seyfried, Streep, Baranski, Walters & Firth all do fine vocals.  Makes me wonder why Mandy Moore was a fool and skipped the role of Streep's daughter.  Too busy doing gems like BECAUSE I SAID SO.  But, I want to know why the hell Waterloo was left off the soundtrack!
B0018CWEYY|4.0|Season 4 was incredible and did what Lost has always done, leave me wanting more. But I am disappointed that there was only 14 episodes with 10 enhanced episodes. My feeling is that they will add the enhanced episodes in the DVD set to bring the episode count to 24. Dirty pool in my opinion. Still Season 4 was great!
B000RPTQ1C|4.0|There are two different releases on cd. I found one of many copies that I bought at Best Buy where the album is released in a cardboard digipack with the cd in a cardboard sleeve. Just like what The Lost World soundtrack was released but this digipack is really thin. There was no plastic hub. The other which I bought too at Wal Mart is in a regular cd case like their other albums are released in and when I saw this I almost blew a head gaskit. Why did I buy two? Well I don't like buying albums in digipacks unless they are only released that way and even if they are released like this one was. If I knew that the album was also released in a regular case I would have waited to get it at Wal Mart and save myself the extra $14.00.    This album is different than their other ones but it has alot of great songs and I am enjoying this one along with the other 8 that I just got and now waiting for Moby's Ambient cd to come in from DeepDiscount. Great job Coldplay! I can't wait to a T-shirt and go to one of your concerts one day! :)
B000000I0K|5.0|Those of you that don't get it, the title stands for the ocean liner by that name from the early 1980's when the vinyl version came out. And this CD is of a distinct British Flavor with several tracks. Overall I think this CD is much better than the one I just reviewed called \\"Platinum\\". From the sounds of what could be a Gypsy camp to the sounds of Old England, a good CD!
B0017ZB8M6|4.0|Hands down, the best thing about Katy Perry--and One of the Boys--is that she doesn't take herself too seriously. Every song is based in reality and makes its point clear, but there's also a tongue-in-cheek aspect to each track as well. Yes, this is pop in every single aspect, but it's also not trying to be anything else. If you're buying this CD in hopes of hearing something that's never been done before, well, I'm sorry but you'll be sorely disappointed. One of the Boys is simply a fun CD to put on and let play.<br /><br />I'm sure most everyone was drawn to Katy Perry from her single, I Kissed A Girl, I know I was. Word has it though (and by 'word' I mean Amazon's product description) is that Katy found popularity with the digital release of Ur So Gay...but that's only hear-say. Whatever the case is, whichever song you heard first, this CD basically follows suit. Full of mostly upbeat, danceable songs, its really quite hard not to like this if you give it an unbiased listen.<br /><br />Immediate hits, for those of you unwilling to sit down and listen to the entire disc, include (of course) I Kissed A Girl, Waking Up In Vegas, Ur So Gay, and Hot n Cold. For those who will actually give this CD some attention, Thinking of You, Self-Inflicted, I'm Still Breathing, and Fingerprints are all slower songs that beg for noteriety.<br /><br />My favorite songs are I Kissed A Girl, Waking Up In Vegas, Thinking of You, Ur So Gay, and I'm Still Breathing. One of the Boys was everything I expected. I expected a fun romp through the pop genre...I got that. I expected some interestingly coy lyrics...got that. I expected to hear some great vocals...I also got that. I wasn't planning on being blown away or anything like that, so I came out insanely happy with what I was given. Pretty sure if you did the same you'd come out pleased as well. Enjoy!
B000000I0J|5.0|I had the vinyl record when it originally came out. It was damaged over the years so I got it again on CD. If you like Mike Oldfield, and I have liked most his stuff since the 1970's and the Exorcist soundtrack, it's worth adding to the collection. To me some tracks are better than others but overall a good idea of the range of Mike Oldfield in the 1980's.
0316143472|1.0|I can't understand for the life of me how this book got on the bestseller list. It's just boring and not funny or witty or insightful in the least.
0156421178|5.0|\\"Homage to Catalonia\\" has long passed from the shelf for current events to the shelf of primary historical sources. No one can study the Spanish Civil War without encountering it. On that basis, it's a five-star book; all primary sources should get five stars. As a reading experience, it's not without weaknesses, which the earlier review by H. Schneider examines cogently. I refer you to that review.<br /><br />Today's newspapers (7-11-08) carried extended obituaries for David Smith, who died in Berkeley, CA, at age 95. Mr. Smith was one of the only 30-some veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, the volunteer contingent of Americans who joined the republican cause in Spain to stop fascism before World War II. The defeat of the republican forces, due at least partly to their own turmoils as described by Orwell, allowed the dictator Franco to suppress the 20th Century in Spain until his welcome death in 1975. David Smith was wounded in Spain in 1938. He returned to America, settled in New York, and married Sophie Kaplan, a marriage that lasted 59 years. Smith worked as a machinist, a union organizer, and for 18 years as a public school biology teacher in New Rochelle, where he campaigned for school integration.<br />David Smith and his wife were active Communist Party members in the 1940s and 1950s, but left the party in disillusionment in the early 1960s. He was one of the victims of blacklisting in the McCarthy era. He retired to Vermont in 1977, and then to California two decades later. During his long retirement, Smith was a dedicated campaigner for peace, a familiar personage at anti-war demonstrations, and an active raiser of relief funds for Central American countries hit by civil strife.<br /><br />I knew David Smith reasonably well. He was a man of sincerity and integrity; I doubt that he ever did anything in his life that failed to meet his standards of conscientious humanity. He meant to do well, and he did what he believed was right. His support for the welfare of working people and for oppressed people everywhere was unwavering. He had no lust for power or fame. Like several other grass-root American Communists I've known, he was above all a decent guy. That he was naive about Stalinist Russia is clear; that he wasn't always right about his positions seems clear also, but who is? But to portray such a person as a menace to free society, an unscrupulous plotter, a pawn in the game of Kremlin masterminds is libel and foolishness, and a self-deception honorable people in America cannot afford.ople and for oppressed people everywhere was unwavering.

B000FC2KL0|5.0|Scar Tissue is an excellent tale.  More than anything the story is about a man who has done some hard yards and is witnessing without shame or pride his life story.  The book is humbling in many ways.  Scar Tissue is as fun to read as it tragic.  His account of his day to day dealings as a rockstar leave you feeling like Anothony Kedis could very well be just one of your friends. He is down to earth.  He is real, and he is very articulate.  There is quite a bit of esoteric language, but you can handle it. Read it.  5 Stars
B000K6QIQO|5.0|As cobbled-together albums go, THE BEATLES AGAIN (also known as \\"Hey Jude\\") is about as good as it gets. The 10 songs presented on it are from singles and B-sides, and cover the majority of the band's stellar career. Not one of these could be considered throwaway or filler.<br /><br />John Lennon's lead vocals on all four of his songs are some of his most powerful ever. The track of \\"Revolution\\" presented is the one Lennon tried (but failed) to place on the White Album. Commonly labelled \\"the fast-version,\\" the spine-tingling guitar work on it is unforgettable. All of Paul McCartney's tunes on this record were some of the biggest hits the Beatles ever had. George Harrison's lone contribution, \\"Old Brown Shoe,\\" is high-energy and has an infectious hook.<br /><br />If you don't already own this one, here is a \\"fab\\" opportunity to enjoy... THE BEATLES AGAIN!
B0012QE4Q2|4.0|I haven't read Philippa Gregory's novel, from which this film was adapted, so I saw the film without any expectations.     I personally enjoyed the film; the Tudor costumes are amazing and the scenery beautiful. Although I didn't get `attached' to any of the characters, I thought the complex relationship and rivalry between the two sisters Anne (Natalie Portman) and Mary (Scarlett Johansson) was well portrayed. Perhaps if there was more individual character-development, the audience may have felt more compassion towards them.    In the film, King Henry VIII (Eric Bana) is desperate for a male heir, which his current wife, Katherine of Aragon (Ana Torent) has failed to bear.    The Boleyn girls Anne and Mary are put forward, by their scheming father and uncle, to satisfy the king. This starts a chain of events that ends with the fall of the Boleyn household.
B0015FHDRW|4.0|I have listened to Green Day since they were playing 924 Gillman in Berkeley, but none of their albums grabbed me until American Idiot. That was one of the most brilliant punk albums ever. Foxboro Hot Tubs shows their musical talents in a different genre. They put together some great tunes with doo-wop and other stylings of the 60's and it works in their style. It's different and it's good.
B000P0J0B0|2.0|Natural Born Killers directed by Oliver Stone is one sick film. I watched this film when I was a teenager and boy this serial killer flick made me physically sick. Woody Harrleson and Juliette Lewis play the love-struck killers and of course Lewis's character was abused as child, jeez you would think so!? The editing of this film is so choppy, hope you don't get motion sickness, stay away from this mess!
B0018QCXGY|3.0|The movie was very entertaining and dramatic as well as with a lot of nice action but for me I just didn't care for any of the characters at all.  The short story line is during a party a man has an argument with his girlfriend who goes back to her apartment when after a while the monster attacks and when the boyfriend gets a call from his girl for help he does indeed try to rescue her.  The problem with rescuing the girlfriend is that her apartment is in the vicinity of the monster's attack zone and the risk to him, his girlfriend, and his three friends with him is great.  Also as you see the mass of people trying to flee Manhattan in a panic the emotion looks so genuine it's pretty incredible.  But I have to say I was more interested in seeing more of the monster than what was happening to the characters themselves and even though it sounds mean I was waiting to see which of them would be killed off by the monster more than if they got away safely.  The monster itself while entertaining to watch just seemed to much of a Godzilla ripoff to take to seriously and instead of seeing a breathe of nuclear fire you instead get these small crablike creatures that far off from the main monster and start attacking people and the soldiers that are attacking the monster.  The blu-ray version does have some more extras but for the picture quality itself there isn't much difference between the blu-ray and the standard dvd version.  Also the audio wasn't much better so if you already have the standard version just stay with that and don't bother with this version.  After the movie though I felt a little let down because if you can't emphasize with the characters or care what happens to them at all than the movie just isn't worth it in the end.
B00005JKN9|2.0|Gangs of New York by Martin Scorsese could easily be his worst epic ever! I could never get into this bloody, violent film. Cameron Diaz looks so out of place in this film and that horrible accent she tries to pull off, jeez she belongs in a romantic comedy! There's no doubt Leonardo DiCaprio and Daniel Day-Lewis are gifts to the acting world but even these talented guys can't save this slow, boring train wreck. If you want a great Scorsese film then see Raging Bull.

B0010VD7EO|3.0|I had heard the first track \\"Time to Pretend\\" quite regularly on an indie radio show before getting this CD. I keep listening to it trying to see if it will grow on me. I think there are quite a few good songs, \\"Time to Pretend\\" and \\"Electric feel\\" being two of my favorites.  The mix of electronic, techo pop, and the lead singer's voice makes me think of the Sleepy Jackson's first album \\"lovers\\" (especially \\"Piece of What\\") though Oracular spectacular is much less a bricolage. It's a solid first effort but with some room for growth. I don't though feel like it's anywhere near the best of 2007 or 2008's indie music. Fans of the Islands or LCD Soundsystem should like MGMT, but not nearly as much as either.
B0018AK9RA|3.0|I was looking forward to this concept album after the pretty good Angel of Retribution:and the subject was of interest.Unfortunately it had me looking at the time remaining on my discman to see how much more there was to listen to.Not a good sign.One other reviewer rightly opined that it would have been better shortened to one disc only.It doesn't compare well with ,say ,Iced Earth's latest concept album Framing Armaggeddon which is dynamic by comparison[and ironically, being sung with more youthful energy by former Halford stand in Tim Owens].I think that Nostradumas has been designed to suit the limitations of Rob's voice which has unfortunately passed its prime now.The music just lacks the guts and force that used to prevail thus turning the album into something more folk music-ish.This is probably great music for listners new to Priest,and certainly vastly superior to the trash found on the radio,but not the stuff to get the head banging and skin tingling for diehard old Priest fans.I don't like to be critical,I wish it were better,but that's the reality to my mind.If you want two great concept albums you can't do better than Thane to the Throne by Jag Panzer or Operation Mindcrime by Queensryche [The original, not the recent one]
B000002KYR|4.0|\\"Dusty Hill's heart-stopping drumming and Frank Beard's sturdy bass.\\"    Hey, Jann, when did Dusty and Frank switch instruments?!  Do I win a gift certificate for finding that glaring error?    Anyway, this is a very good introduction to the band.  Their gritty rock and blues got a bit of a studio polish but it worked as its their best-selling album.

B0013J9KOO|5.0|Normally, movies that try to combine action and 'art film' disappoint me.  Hellboy II combined action, art, romance, comedy, drama, fantasy, and some other genres that haven't got names yet, and worked.<br /><br />Hellboy faces midlife crisis, Abe (the blue guy with gills) finds love, Liz (who has ignited Hellboy's torch and everything else) is warming up a surprise for Hellboy, a German with gas issues joins the crew, and a tree grows in Brooklyn.  Hellboy and Abe, drunk, singing Barry Manilow is a comedic and romantic high point of the film.  Oh yeah, there is lots of action, but given that the movie is based on a comic book, that can pretty much be assumed.  The villian was played by (or had a stunt double who was a) gifted martial artist, and was really allowed to strut his stuff.<br /><br />Yes, I liked it a lot.  Guillermo Del Toro did a brilliant job, and clearly improved on the original.  Noone will be luke warm on this one; you'll love it or hate it.  I loved it.<br /><br />E. M. Van Court
B00122M2QU|4.0|Same old Max.  This seems to basically pick up where Sepultura left off.  There are a few sort of new approaches, but certainly nothing you wouldn't expect if this was the new Sepultura album. My biggest complaint is that Max sounds a little watered down and when he repeats somewhat cheesy choruses it can basically ruin the song.  As soon as I start to recognize what chorus is involved it's like... weak, \\"oh that's this song\\".  They would benefit so much from some guest vocals like Mike Patton and Chino did for them and I guess quite a buit of Soulfly had guest vocals - Max just works great with a complimentary vocalist.    \\"Hex\\" is a really great song.  That song sounds like an expansion of their sound.  I wish there was more of that on here.
B00005JLYW|1.0|I got this as my sisters wanted to see this movie and after watching it myself I truly wish I could get those two hours back.  The main story is that the Angels are supposed to protect the boy in the witness protection program since some unknown person or group seem to be killing off certain people in the witness protection program and the information they get points to this boy being next.  Of course there is some more to the story but if you're like me you'll probably just won't care what they are after watching thirty minutes of this god awful movie.  I like the three main actresses but it's no surprise that there is no talk in the works for Charlie's Angels 3.  Spare yourself the money and time and just buy some other action movie that is truly worth it

0307237702|4.0|'The Audacity of Hope' is one of the most thought-provoking books centered on world and domestic politics recently written.  Barack Obama offers his paragon of politics for the 21st century built upon a foundation of old guiding principles that stretch back to our Nation's forefathers to recent political figures and events that have shaped our political discourse over the last several years.<br /><br />Though stretched in some areas, Barack pulls off an eloquently written prose of ideas that offer perspectives that are more practical than fresh (a dissertation so to speak).  From family, values, faith, race, world politics, opportunity, and the constitution, he remains consistent in his love for country; however, skeptical of its future course.  Specifically, on family his opinions on the erosion of the traditional family cannot be argued.  Two-parent working households that compete with time spent with children is not opinion - it is fact.  To further complicate matters, he points out - painfully - the erosion of the black family with startling statistics that pose no easy answer.  Barack's approach however is a good starting point.  From review of welfare laws that have separated families to engaging children as role model adults in order to compete against a pop culture filled with distractions (perceived and real).<br /><br />His economic views are his strong point.  Obama is able to pin-point in simple terms how globalization of manufacturing jobs, the emergence of low-paying service sector jobs, the complications and trade-offs of NAFTA and CAFTA have depressed our Nation's earning power, stagnated wages, and provided Americans with a lower standard of living despite our dominance as a economic superpower - the results now being felt primarily because of our cavalier approach to deal with crumbling infrastructure, job re-training, funding disparities in secondary education, and lack of affordable college-level education.  Though Obama points out the difficulty in bold, fresh terms, his solution is based on the foundation of the past - Clinton's loose-ends with regards to NAFTA, the fallacy of 'No Child Left Behind' for Bush, and the missing link between teacher merit pay and performance.  The solutions have been offered before.  What Obama advocates is an executed, sequence-based series of action steps - a step-result-step-result format (a practical, perfect world format).<br /><br />Adding to the texture and the value of this book is how Obama is able to talk about the role of faith without sounding preachy.  He navigates his way through the role of faith in our politics, recognizing the difference in our religious views, but upholding the common ground found in most organized religion - value of life, respect for fellow men and women, and execution of the Golden Rule - common characteristics that stretch across the religious spectrum.  His view is that faith within politics should be embraced from a world-view with the nuances of the differences down-played to prevent the widening of the gap that unites us all as  Americans (or Americans to be) - a difficult view that he effectively framed.<br /><br />On Race, Obama cannot win with everyone, but can relate to almost all of us.  Being bi-racial, Obama tip-toes on this issue so not to alienate or shun his black roots, while opening-up enough allowing him to embrace his white roots.  He discusses Race with the authority of someone given a \\"pass\\" to speak from both sides while leveraging his world experience to offer insight on the Latino and Asian American experience.  It comes up short rather than flat primarily because a topic so complicated deserves its own work in and of itself - from Barack (maybe?).  The decay of the black family, the resentment (real or perceived) of whites, the earning power (or lack thereof) for Latinos (and blacks), and the emergence (and impressive escalation) of Asians cannot be condensed within a short chapter.  He points out the crumbling infrastructure and support system of the black family; however, his solutions break from past civil rights leaders and aims toward social responsibility, inclusion, and a \\"make it happen\\" approach to life - again, a hard explanation to condense.  Latinos and blacks have common ground, but Obama doesn't really go into the details of the breaking (tipping) point that keeps these two races apart (only pointing out the obvious blue collar-low paying job battle - however, it's a lot more complicated).  Instead he simplifies this discussion to the common threads we all share, the progress made, and the challenges ahead.<br /><br />Finally, on world politics, Obama demonstrates the skill of knowledge, mastery of geography and government, and a \\"big picture\\" view of resolving our world standing.  To this day (and as evident within this work), Barack is comfortable that he both voted against and spoke out against the war and therefore is able to write with conviction on the faulty reasoning that led the U.S. to war.  At the same time, he realizes the outcome and conclusion of our presence in Iraq and increasing our world standing will be anything but easy.<br /><br />Engaging, straight-forward, and beautifully written, 'The Audacity of Hope' is a book to be shared and reviewed with the passage of time.  Consistent in his view to this day - Barack Obama is able to acknowledge the past and offer insight on how to shape our future based on the framework of what we have and share as Americans and world citizens.system of the black family; however, his solutions break from past civil rights leaders and aims toward social responsibility, inclusion, and a \\"make it happen\\" approach to life - again, a hard explanation to condense.

B0012E6R3W|5.0|I honestly have no idea what to say, this album is just absolutely brilliant. Bay Area thrash metal legends Testament have returned with a vengeance and have created a monster of a comeback as well as one of the best metal albums of 2008, in fact this album is indeed the best and I DO mean BEST metal album of 2008 in my opinion. &#34;The Formation of Damnation&#34; is Testament's first full length album in nine years and their ninth release overall. Words just can't even describe how brilliant, amazing, and awesome this album is, I just listen to it constantly every week, I love it. This is also the first Testament album to feature original lead guitarist Alex Skolnick since 1992's &#34;The Ritual&#34; (he has since returned to the band in 2001) and original bassist Greg Christian since 1994's &#34;Low&#34; (which I still need to get) and of course former Slayer skinsman Paul Bostaph takes over the drums. Chuck Billy (who has since recovered from cancer in 2002) delivers an awesomely fierce, powerful, and commanding vocal performance. There's absolutely no denying that Chuck's vocals are more stronger than before, and this album definitely proves it. The riffs on here are just frantic, savage, and downright heavy and raging throughout. Alex Skolnick's solos are just absolutely killer and mind blowing, and this album showcases his best soloing in years. Eric Peterson (who does excellent rhythm guitar work) also does his fair share of soloing as well too, but Alex steals most of the show on here. Greg does a great job at pounding on the bass, and Paul hammers away at the drums with lots of great menacing thrashing tempos and double bass onslaughts.<br /><br />There's not even one bad song on here, I mean they're all boss, but here's a look at some of the highlights. &#34;More Than Meets the Eye&#34; is an instant classic that is highlighted by muscular thrashing riffs, thrashing drum tempos, a pair of wailing, melodic solos, and powerful vocals from Chuck. Track three &#34;The Evil Has Landed&#34; is another favorite on here that lyrically deals with the 9/11 tragedy in New York City and is highlighted by another awesome guitar solo by Alex and great vocals by Chuck. The title track is an all out menacing, blistering thrash assault that features fast hammering drums from Paul, savage, thrashing riffage, raging, full-bodied death roars from Chuck, and a killer solo from Alex around the 3:24 mark. Track six &#34;The Persecuted Won't Forget&#34; features a savage, battering thrash tempo at the beginning with punishing double bass drum work and muscular chugging riffs, and this song also features another killer solo from Alex, and another thrashing tempo near the end. Track seven &#34;Henchmen Ride&#34; is another favorite of mine on here that is highlighted by catchy, chugging machine gun-like riffs, pummeling double bass onslaughts, another speedy, blazing thrash tempo, and another great solo by Alex. The lyrics are very catchy too as well as the chorus. Track nine &#34;Afterlife&#34; is another great catchy song that deals with some personal stuff that Chuck had gone through, and there's some great lyrics and a pair of great solos as well. Track eight &#34;Killing Season&#34; and track ten &#34;F.E.A.R.&#34; both deal with the Bush Administration which is indeed untrustworthy, and they're both favorites as well (the former which features catchy groove-oriented riffing, great vocals from Chuck, and another pair of killer solos, and the latter which features ramming double bass onslaughts, savage thrashing riffs, more great soloing, and I like when Chuck's vocals get heavier at the end of the song). Please read on for my song ratings.<br /><br />Jeremy's song ratings:<br />1. For the Glory Of... (1:12) - 5/5<br />2. More Than Meets the Eye (4:33) - 5/5<br />3.

Leave Me Forever (4:28) - 5/5<br /><br />I'll be clearly honest, I didn't think this album was going to be this good, since Testament have not released anything new for quite some time, but boy, I was sure wrong. &#34;The Formation of Damnation&#34; proves without a shadow of a doubt, that Testament are back and indeed they're stronger than ever.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|One of the best I've seen. It's hard to say what is the best part, overall a must see!
B000002RXS|5.0|I was looking for this play quite long ago, and finally I found it right at Amazon.
B0013J9KOO|5.0|I liked the first Hellboy film, but I always felt it didn't flow right and that something was missing. Four years later, Guillermo Del Toro has got the pacing right and fully unleashes his haunting imagination, with many monsters looking like the ones from Pan's Labyrinth on steroids. They just have a strange and unique beauty about them. The troll market scene alone has so many fantastic creatures walking around I wasn't able to take it all in on my first viewing. It was nice to see puppets and animatronics used in conjuncton with CGI, rather than just all out cartoon looking freaks manifested in a computer.<br /><br />Ron \\"Hellboy\\" Perlman is the star of the show yet again and seems much more comfortable this time around in portraying the big red guy. He was great in Hellboy, but he is given better lines and a lot more action scenes in The Golden Army. With his signature voice and facial structure, nobody on the planet could play Hellboy except Perlman.<br /><br />The rest of the cast of characters from Abe Sapien, played and voiced by the great physical actor Doug Jones, to Selma Blair's Liz, are given more to do and are fun to watch. I even thought the new addition to the team, Johan Krauss, was interesting, although a tad on the weird side (not for this director I suppose).<br /><br />There are two thing I didn't like about Hellboy II. The storyline was pretty average (although much better than the first) and the editing seemed a bit awkward at times. I felt a few scenes cut off at weird points, but these are minor flaws.<br /><br />Hellboy II: The Golden Army was a visual feast that gives me hope for this soon to be Hobbit director. If Peter Jackson hand picked him, there must be something special. This flick, along with Pan's Labyrinth, proves it.<br /><br />4 and 1/2 out of 5 stars
B000Q66PXE|5.0|I think ROME is the best series HBO has ever come out with. Too bad it was for only 2 seasons.
B0018AK9RA|1.0|I'll keep it short and sweet. \\"Ram It Down\\" was a better album, and Robs solo stuff is way better!!! even TWO is worth buying.
0060558121|4.0|That's the Jeopardy answer to American Gods.<br /><br />The modest thesis is that immigrants to America throughout the ages have brought their gods with them.  They have proliferated, but not flourished, in the melting pot.<br /><br />The story starts strongly.  An early release from prison launches the protagonist, Shadow, on a picaresque tour through the \\"sacred\\" corners of the US.  He meets a broad assortment of deities (mostly understated and well-researched) and is caught up in multilateral war between the gods.<br /><br />As the story begins, the narrative and atmosphere are reminiscent of the King / Straub masterpiece, [[ASIN:0345444884 The Talisman]].  But as the battle lines become clearer, the story slows way down.  Shadow's dead wife observes that he is less alive than she.  Unfortunately, I have to agree.
0061245097|5.0|NOTHING predictable about this second in the series!  Cat and Bones get back together, but in the most unpredictable way!  Other reviewers have summarized the story so I won't. As I said in a review of the first book, I love these characters!  Bones is now one of my favorite alpha male vampire heros. He is scorcing hot.  One of the best erotic hot love scenes in the genre is in this book.  Cat is one of the best strong females in the genre.  As previously stated in my review of the first book,  all of the characters, the good, the bad and the ugly have surprising depth and grow with the story from book 1 to this book. Humor, sex, action, mystery, sex, love, betrayal,REALLY hot sex, and a sterling cast of characters, really well written characters.  As stated in my review of the first book, I just galdly tossed the series by J.R. Ward,  in the trash bin of \\"What was she thinking\\" when she went off the rails she had laid in her first 4 books.  I am so delighted to have been led to this Night Huntress series!  Jeaniene Frost is now on my \\"Pre Order\\" list with Alex Ivy, Lara Adrian, Jacki Frank and Christine Feehan.  These are \\"THE' best \\"goes with the story\\" book covers I've ever seen.
B000BQ7BX2|5.0|I own 22 complete Mahler Symphony cycles (including the one under review here) and a plethora of individual issues dating back to Mengelberg's 4th with the Concertgebouw. Ok, so I am \\"a bit\\" nuts for Mahler, sue me and/or call Bellevue. The latter may be an appropriate destination for me, according to some of you, since I am proud to divulge that--I DO like Boulez' Mahler. (Where are the new \\"Das Klagende Lied\\" and the \\"Adagio\\" from the 10th? Huh?). But then, no composer invites--no, encourages--such a wide universe of interpretation for his works. The four opening measures of the Mahler 4th--as interpreted by Mengelberg and Boulez--intone the same musical notes but are as remote, emotionally, from each other as galaxies. (Or, as my wife likes to say: \\"about as close as a male ever comes to understanding a female!\\")    Well, on to the item under consideration here: the Mahler 10 Symphonies and Das Lied von der Erde as performed by Gary Bertini and the Kölner Rundfunk-Sinfonieorchester, on EMI.    The boys and girls of the Cologne Orchestra and Mr. Bertini have given us a Mahler cycle that will go down as one of the greatest achievements in recorded history. The performances rank among the top interpretations for each and every symphony. This set will be treasured by all who love Mahler's music and accorded the same esteem as the iconic cycles by Kubelik and Bernstein (New York). This is impassioned music making with tremendous virtuosity and élan. I am only sorry it has taken me so long to finally get to listen to it. Trust me. Listen to any of the 11CDs in this set. You'll need a diaper!    The sound captured by EMI is world-class and infinitely better than the better publicized Tennstedt and Rattle cycles on the same label. Only the Gielen on Hänssler, and the Chailly on Decca, have (marginally) better sound. If you own a state-of-the-art stereo system (i.e.: anything that doesn't have BOSE stamped on it) you will love the sonics--spacious, realistic and without hint of the dreaded digital glare. (I really can't understand the comments voiced on this site that the sound of these recordings is \\"compressed.\\" I also listen to vinyl so I am quite familiar with the term \\"compression.\\" A quick audition of any of the original CBS Bernstein/Mahler LPs is an unpleasant reminder of the wretched past of U.S. music reproduction. Please, don't get me going on RCA \\"Dynagroove.\\")     Quick! Buy this set before it's discontinued, as is the pattern with EMI. They do tend to nix recordings within minutes after release, except, of course, those by Sir (or is it Saint?) Simon (I did bow thrice in the direction of the UK and kissed my recent issue of Gramophone before I typed his name).     For you Mahlerites out-and-about: I have recently re-listened to cycles by Leif Segerstam on Chandos, Seiji Ozawa on Philips and all the Mahler recorded (all symphonies except 2 & 8) by James Levine for RCA. Folks, some really excellent performances to be heard in them so don't believe all the \\"toro-caca\\" that's been heaped at them over the years until you listen for yourselves. Other unexpected (but welcome) surprises have come via the Abravanel/Utah recordings and those by Inbal/Frankfurt. There IS a lot of life outside of Vienna and Berlin! I must confess that I've yet to hear any of the ongoing Gergiev or Zinman cycles. Poorly-rehearsed (some in the business claim \\"non-rehearsed\\") and performed Prokofiev and Shostakovich from the former, and dull-to-catatonic Beethoven (oh, gee, \\"new editions,\\" José, as in: \\"tah-tah-tah-plink\\"!) and Strauss from the latter, have dimmed my curiosity for the moment. I am sure they mean well, though.    Finally, if I may, let me mention another recent encounter with previously unknown (to me) recordings--André Cluyten's Beethoven Symphonies with the Berlin Philharmonic (also EMI). Again, another monumental set that has greatness in every performance. (If you do also get this set, then splurge and get the 50-pack Pampers.)
0452289963|5.0|I have been reading books about spirituality for most of my life and for me this is one of the best, if not the best, I have ever read. It makes living in the moment more accessible - a user friendly book. It is a life changing book. A valuable addition to the book is the Tolle/Oprah collaboration series on podcasts and is available free at iTunes->podcasts->religion & spirituality->oprah's.com spirit channel. I've listened to these podcasts, they are excellent and Tolle is a very likeable man and I sense no guile or ego at all.    I highly recommend this book.
6305428042|5.0|This is a movie that I watch in September (sometimes more often throughout the year) to get me in the \\"fall\\" mode.  The music, acting and overall feel of Hocus Pocus is fun, spooky and very entertaining.  The cast is awesome!  The music is stellar and it's been one of our favorites for years.
0440243661|4.0|As mentioned, this was pretty good, but I kept hoping for a little more action.  That being said, I still enjoyed, especially the payback. Reacher and company work well together.  Hope to see a return by the others in a future novel.
1577314808|1.0|Boring. These are not original ideas and the style drags and drags. If the author cited his sources, I might have been able to tolerate it.  I wouldn't suggest to anyone to read this book for the spiritual content -- as others comment, there are far better books for that.
1577314808|5.0|Katie Davis, author [[ASIN:0980091225 Awake Joy: The Essence of Enlightenment]], gave me this book recently after attending an intensive with her and her husband, Sundance Burke, author [[ASIN:0980091233 Free Spirit: A Guide to Enlightened Being]], and I am really glad. Power of Now is a clear and wonderful book. It is obvious that Eckhart has studied every angle, strategy and position that the ego could possibly have.
B000Q6ZG5M|1.0|I thought that if I bought the Blu-Ray version that it would be better than the regular DVD and, since my old DVD disappeared, I ordered this. Anyway, I was very wrong. I noticed several scenes that were missing or truncated, even from the short bit of the movie that I watched on TV a few days ago. They are in the \\"extras\\", but I expected a bit more. Some scenes also looked a bit grainy on my HDTV. I am disappointed.
0385340567|1.0|let's hope this is the last jack reacher novel.  when the plots get this weak, we know the hero is winding down and can't handle high voltage situations.  maybe the next novel will see our hero get thoroughly trounced by a 20 year old kid that wears glasses, and won't be able to perform in horizontal positions.  All in all, a pretty lame novel
B000YCLRBA|4.0|This is a stellar performance by a superb cast and conducted expertly by Valery Gergiev. Hvorostovsky and Fleming are ideal as Onegin and Tatiana The stark set, indeed a \\"non-set\\", is at first disappointing, but does succeed in focusing attention on the human drama instead of toward lavish production elements. Color is used very effectively to saturate each scene and outline the singers. This production no doubt benefited from the close scrutiny of the camera because the performances were finely tuned and sublty nuanced. As an example, the usual \\"dance spectacle\\" accompanying the Polonaise which opens Act III is replaced here by Onegin attended to by his valet staff while changing from dueling attire to formal dress. Although I enjoy a lavish production as much as anyone, it was refreshing to experience a concept which focuses primarily on the protagonists. This would not work with less than world-class principals.
0300108834|5.0|I read a lot of books.  Some would say that I read too many.  Over the years, I've read some really great stuff.  But this is one of the few books that I truly fell in love with.  As I was reading it, I found myself saying, \\"I love this book!\\" over and over again.  It's a quick read, divided into short chapters that can be read in a matter of minutes -- so even someone with a short attention span can read a chapter in a single sitting.  And it is written in such an easy-to-read style that it can be understood and enjoyed by readers of any age.  It was written with young readers in mind; but it is so wonderfully written that adults will love it just as much as kids will.  The writing style is beautiful.  I wish I could write that well.  Everything is made so clear and easy to understand that it's a delight to read.  It's hard to believe that this book was originally written in German and translated into English.  I don't know who deserves the higher praise, E.H. Gombrich, who wrote the original German text, or Caroline Mustill, who translated it into perfect English prose.  But what impresses me even more than the writing style is the content.  This is simply the best history book that I've ever read.  It provides an overview of all of world history from prehistoric times to the 20th century (it was originally published in 1936, and covered events up to the aftermath of World War I; but this new edition contains a final chapter that gives a brief overview of the events from World War I to roughly the end of the Cold War).  And it does a masterful job of capturing the \\"big picture\\" of world history without getting bogged down in the sort of details that no one but historians really care about (as many history texts do).  After reading this book, you will have a good, basic understanding of the overall course of world history.  And you'll enjoy every minute of it.  Imagine a history text that is never dry or boring, that is never difficult to understand, that never bogs you down in useless details you don't care about, and that is actually a pleasure to read.  THIS is that history text.  I would recommend it for everyone: schoolchildren, college students, and adults.  (And it would make the perfect gift for a young person.  Anyone who is old enough to read, understand, and enjoy Harry Potter is old enough to read, understand, and enjoy E.H. Gombrich's \\"A Little History of the World\\" -- and it's a lot more educational.)
B0013XS8A2|5.0|One of the best cd's i now own. This is an Orchestral venture that is a timeless piece of music that takes you on a journey of so many emotions. I feel it is the best creation Mike has composed. I write this so that Mike Oldfield receives more of the credit he so rightfully deserves. This cd has brought us much enjoyment and
B001ACY8D2|5.0|I am never disappointed by these Icelanders! They have not sold out in the least. They have simply made another wonderful album.
B001A3AA0G|5.0|It doesn't happen all the time, but it happened here.  I don't even know what you might call this kind of music, but I like it, the folks that make it like it, so who cares.  I was following links from Bon Iver, (which I discovered following links), and discovered Fleet Foxes. I listen to everything, noisy punk, dinosaur rock, mississippi blues, piano trio jazz, and now this.<br /><br />What a treat and joy to find completely new, fantastic, stuff!
B0013FDM7E|4.0|Amazing and very entertaining movie. thrilling movie. great sci-fi. A future which is not unlikely, if not mankind threads more gently.
B0013J9KOO|4.0|My hubby and I got advanced tickets to this movie. Since seeing \\"Hellboy\\", we were looking forward the the second installment. It was great. A lot of action and the same loveable characters are back! This movie has lots of action. It is funny too! The movie did remind me a little of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movie though. In order to find out what I am talking about, you'll have to go see the movie. How can you not love a monster who sings Barry Manilow songs!!! The creatures were fascinating and different to look at. Go see it and enjoy a cute movie.It will make you smile.

I bought it as a light beach reading while vacationing in Hilton Head. And as you may have read from the title of my review.. I couldn't put it down!! More adult then the Twilight series (I mean can you imagine Belle catching Edward with is pants down. No I think not). I can't wait to buy the next book Betrayed. Reader, enjoy. I think we may have a future movie in the making!!

B0014XCMVM|4.0|Alanis Morissette always makes decent albums. \\"Flavors Of Entanglement\\", her 7th studio album (excluding the acoustic \\"Jagged Little Pill\\") continues to demonstrate her growth and maturity.<br /><br />She selected Guy Sigsworth (Seal, Bjork, Imogean Heap, Madonna, Frou Frou) to produce which was a decent choice. He makes \\"Flavors\\" more of an electronica album with guitar washes and drum loops. The bottom line is that Alanis can sing around anything. Her writing is still as strong as it was when she did \\"Jagged Little Pill\\".<br /><br />As far as anger and angst, I don't expect that from her, and that's better left for teenagers anyway. Alanis is 34 now, close to my age, and if and when you make it to this age, the anger usually has subsided. However, the fact that she continues to write about failed relationships is rather concerning at this point. How many more failures will she write about before figuring out what the problem is.<br /><br />Thankfully, most of the songs have a more despairing, rather than angry, approach. Truly, what can you do when things fall apart? Mourn the loss and move on. That's what Morissette does here very well.<br /><br />As with all Morissette albums, \\"Flavors\\" has some songs that are not as good as the others. The songs I liked (everyone has their opinion) are the first single \\"Underneath\\", \\"Not As We\\", \\"In Praise Of The Vulnerable Man\\", \\"Torch\\", \\"Giggling Again For No Reason\\" and \\"Incomplete\\". The other five tracks are okay, with \\"Versions Of Violence\\" maybe rising above the other four.<br /><br />I would not say this is her best work, nor would I say it is her worst. It just scrapes by being average to get four stars from me. It would be really interesting to see what she would create if she had a very happy relationship. It could be her come back. I say that because, with each successive release, she has not come close to the success of \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" in terms of sales and popularity. In fact, it's almost like Morissette has been ignored or sidelined by the music business. It's a shame because she's an obvious vocal and artistic talent that's now underutilized.siness.

B00005ABKC|4.0|Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers' breakthrough to superstar status via [[ASIN:B00005ABK8 Damn the Torpedoes]] gave him a newfound clout. He joined in the ranks of Mellencamp and Springsteen as \\"people's rockers,\\" and MCA was ready to take advantage of that. \\"Hard Promises\\" was going to be an album that the suits wanted to release at a higher list than regular LP's, and Petty famously resisted. If you look closely at the box of albums in the lower right corner of the cover art, you'll see $8.98 in black marker, a threat Petty made to title the album if MCA did not back off the price increase. Petty won, and \\"Hard Promises\\" arrived on the wings of the triumphant sounding \\"The Waiting.\\"<br /><br />Just as \\"Torpedoes\\" signaled Petty and the band's maturation into greatness, \\"Hard Promises\\" shows them on a hot streak that bore the album into the top ten and firmly entrenched them as one of America's finest bands. However, the album starts to sputter as it gets closer to the end, with \\"Letting You Go\\" and \\"Insider\\" sounding something close to filler...the first time one could say that about a Tom Petty album. It was also noted that, when Stevie Nicks asked Tom to write a song for her and they recorded \\"Insider,\\" Nicks was disappointed that she didn't get a \\"Tom Petty\\" song. So Tom turned around and wrote \\"Stop Dragging My Heart Around,\\" they recorded it together, and Nicks got the better of the deal (a number 3 hit and the number one LP [[ASIN:B000002IB9 Bella Donna]]. In contrast, \\"The Waiting\\" peaked at 19 and the album at 5). Had things worked in reverse, this album might have rated the fifth star.<br /><br />Not to say the songs are bad here, as Petty was still on a solid stride. Both \\"The Waiting\\" and \\"A Woman In Love\\" have deservedly become classics in Petty's catalog. \\"Something Big\\" sports a lyric worthy of Dylan. \\"Thing About You\\" got covered by both [[ASIN:B000002LFQ Emmylou Harris]] and [[ASIN:B000002LP7 Southern Pacific]]. \\"You Can Still Change Your Mind\\" brings the album to a beautiful close. What \\"Hard Promises\\" lacks is anything that matches the visceral punch of \\"Refugee\\" or [[ASIN:B000065AI4 \\"Listen To Her Heart\\"]]. It is still an excellent 4 star album, but not a classic like \\"Torpedoes\\" or the debut were.beautiful close.

0061537934|5.0|You will never look at your dog the same ever again after reading this book.  Life's struggles as told by Enzo the family dog.  This tale leads you down a path with a pot of gold in the end.  I really don't want to give too much away, but this is the smartest dog ever.  Lassie be damned!  Enzo is humanized in a way that is very fitting, while never giving away his true dog soul.  I felt like I was looking up at people in the story.  Garth held his true course throught the book.     Funny thing is that my girlfriend read this right after I did.  When leaving now we debate what TV Channel to leave on.... for the dogs.    All in all this is a truly wonderful and magical read.  Please pay it forward, don't put this on your book shelf, give this book to someone else to read.  This book is that good.

B0013J9KOO|3.0|Ron Perlman is in good form once again returning as Hellboy in Hellyboy 2. Del Toro is also a fine director with a unique style and he always offers fine visuals and really cool creatures. The most memorable creatures here are called tooth fairies but not because they collect teeth but because they eat the bones of their victims. We also get an evil underworld Prince who wants to wipe out humans. To do so he wants to use the Golden Army which can only be controlled by 3 pieces of a crown which are now seperated. He's collecting the pieces but his sister has the last piece and is in the custody of Hellboy and his team. While Hellboy's g/f Liz (Selma Blair) struggles to tell him that she's pregnant.<br /><br />  The movie is entertaining and fun but not as fresh and fun as the first movie. While I agree with Richard Roeper that Del Toro does need to work on with when to end a movie. Since the end comes a little sudden and isn't that solid. Other than I recommend the movie for fans of the first. If you didn't like the first though, you'll probably like this one less.

This version was never issued commercially in any format.  Some lucky people like me were able to record it off TV.

Renny Harlin's filmography contains excellent thrillers like [[ASIN:B00002E233 Deep Blue Sea]], [[ASIN:B00004STDN Cliffhanger (Collector's Edition)]] or [[ASIN:0780618548 The Long Kiss Goodnight]] as well as regrettable works like [[ASIN:B00065HKLG Exorcist - The Beginning (Widescreen Edition)]] or this COVENANT. But I'm ready to be very lenient with the Finnish born director who has to pay his taxes, like you and me, and who'll undoubtedly give us another top notch film one of these days. This one is unfortunately already forgotten.

B00177Y9ZC|2.0|`Jumper' could be the perfect manipulative teen movie fantasy.  Start with a boy who  faces a distant, but menacing father in a divorced family where the mother's been absent since his fifth birthday, a bully at school who keeps him from his dream girl, and we have all the makings of an escapist venue about someone who gets and tries to keep it all.      In an early confrontation, David Rice (Hayden Christensen) meets school bully Mike as he connects with Mike's girlfriend, Millie Harris (Rachel Bilser).   He's sharing a glass bubble snow scene with her when Mike confiscates it and throws it on a frozen river.  Predictably, David falls through the ice while retrieving it, and remarkably, Millie's rescue attempts don't have her joining him through the same ice; even more mysterious is how Dave gets transported to the local Ann Arbor Library before he can suffocate under a sheet of unbroken ice.      Now he's discovered magical powers that enable him to jump ahead short and long distances in hyper-cyber leaps with invisible traces.  If he can only hone it and use it at will, he can globe trot the world and use it at whim.  We not only go forward physically, but we do so in time frames as well with casual announcements of passing time.  (The movie does this--not the powers.)  Relationships would surely suffer, but not for him.  We see him elude his overbearing father, but his trek seems like a lonely one with no one he can share his gift.     His first act is to do mission impossible and rob an impenetrable bank.  In one of the movie's time warps, we leap ahead to David sitting in his upscale New York apartment.  Never mind that this kid who wouldn't have the credit history or employment record to justify his application.  Having forgotten Millie for some years, he's able to pick up a girl at a London pub just after hanging out on one of the four faces of Big Ben.  After enough fooling around, he decides he's grown lonesome for Millie, so he heads (I should say jumps)back to Ann Arbor years later where he finds she's supporting her college expenses as a bar maid.  Here he also meets a drunken Mike where the conversation turns as tipsy as his beer glass.  Again enamored by the contrast of brutish Mike to his civility and maybe a little more than impressed by David's ability to throttle his nemesis through powerful transport, Millie is his.  Not wanting to be peculiar in her eyes, David satisfies her desire to travel the world, using traditional money instead of his magical powers.    There has to be a catch.  After the bank robbery, NSA operative, Roland (Samuel L. Jackson) is hot on his trail and knowledgeable about the Jumpers.  Using an electrical device, Roland is able to stave off jumping powers by shocking the Jumper's brain waves.  Not able to transport, he nevertheless, uses photographs to unlock the path of his suspects' movements.  Labeled an Inquisition figure, Roland roars, \\"Only God should have the power to be all places at all times.\\"  So instead of an investigative interest in the bank robbery, we get a jealous preacher.  If there's no consolation in the chase, then we're at least better informed when David locks heads with British fellow jumper, Griffin (Jamie Bell).     In many ways the movie goes nowhere.  The scenes where he moves ahead are done with genuine expressions by the actors, but the special effects draw attention to itself.  It's much more satisfying to watch the believable blur in a 'Bourne' movie.  The transport gets tiresome at times.  Credibility also takes a back seat.  Maybe he can jump to Maui, but does it automatically make him a champion surfer?  There are no good guys here (except for one sweet and innocent girl).  That may work for 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,' but not here.  Robbing a bank doesn't make our protagonist likable or gain our sympathies.  Without intending to do so, the film highlights much of sixties' science fiction which looked upon such advancements with a wary eyeand undermined them with consequences.  (Okay, so this is more fantasy than anything else, but it's the same idea.)  I did like the mystery of David's mother (Diane Lane), but even that treatment is limited.  If you want a real vehicle for the imagination, read Philip Jose' Farmers' `[[ASIN:0345419677 To Your Scattered Bodies Go (Riverworld Saga, Book 1)]],' a truly transporting work--one that expertly fuses space and time with the necessary caveats in ways this movie does not.      (Based on a novel [[ASIN:0765357690 Jumper: A Novel (Jumper)]] by Steven Gould.)
B000002KHH|5.0|I grew up fearing Black Sabbath because of my strong religious upbringing. I was shocked to hear Satan's name used in a song; I didn't know if that was censorable or not at the time. When I was 11, I would sneak off on my bike with my Walkman, and I always heard \\"War Pigs\\" just about everyday on KNAC. It gave me such a heavy feeling at the time, but I knew that I liked it somehow.     Well, when I finally moved out on my own, I made up for lost time and sowed my wild metal oats.     Paranoid is easily one of the best rock records of all time. It goes beyond just being the defining Heavy Metal record. Everything about this record is perfect.     The sound is amazing. I love the way it was produced and mixed. The guitars have the perfect amount of crunch, with not too much of the mids in the EQ that make so many rock records draining to listen to.  The bass is loud, thick and chunky; it is not too muddy or inaudible which is something greatly missing from the Rock Recording Rulebook. The drums resonate perfectly with the perfect amount of punch, with not too many overtones or ringing in the toms and snare, and the cymbals are so crisp. Say what you will about Ozzy, but his voice is perfectly matched for this band and Geezer's lyrics, which will always remain timeless.    Take for example, the single, \\"Paranoid\\". We're nearly approaching forty years since this album's release, and the track still sounds fresh and relevant to how people feel, compared 95% of the pure crap that is put out today. There is no filler on this record. It is one of the few albums that you can listen to all the way through without skipping any songs. I always thought that \\"Rat Salad\\" was a nice response to Led Zeppelin's \\"Moby Dick\\", and I love \\"Planet Caravan\\" with the original solo and piano chords at the end.    I have the standard US Warner Bros. CD edition. I have not heard any of the remasters that have been released since, but I did manage to pick up the 180 gram vinyl reissue a few moths ago, and it is even better!    Anyone who hates this record does not deserve to be a called a hard rock or metal fan, period!    People always overhype The Beatles' work, but Paranoid is the yardstick that I measure all rock music by.    Even if you download it, YOU EVENTUALLY HAVE TO BUY THIS ALBUM because the guys really deserve the money for this true classic.    Maybe people didn't like it back in 1970-71, but artists that are way ahead of their time are always poorly misunderstood. Take KraFtwerk for example. Pure electronic genius.    I give this album 10 STARS!!!!
B000002H2H|5.0|Metallica's second studio album, \\"Ride the Lightning\\", is my personal favorite from the band to date (it sounds like Metallica will release \\"Death Magnetic\\", their ninth studio album, later this year).  Don't let the opening to the first track \\"Fight Fire With Fire\\" fool you, this album is fast and furious from the get-go.  The three song tandem of \\"Ride the Lightning\\", \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\", and \\"Fade to Black\\" may be my favorite 3 song stretch from any Metallica album.    I won't discuss all of the tracks, but I'll cover some of my favorites. The title track gives a very strong performance from both the vocals of James Hetfield (I personally like his early work when he has a higher pitch) and Kirk Hammett's shredding ability in the middle of the song.  \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" is a stronger, heavier sound than is exhibited on the rest of the album, but it still fits in very well (in a side note, the opening of this song would be my entrance music if I were a pro athlete, it's pretty wicked sweet!).  \\"Fade to Black\\" is a bit more reflective and is a personal favorite of mine.  \\"Creeping Death\\" gives an interesting retelling of the plagues experienced by Egypt during the Jewish captivity of Moses time, and it features another killer guitar solo by Kirk Hammett.    However, having written all this, my favorite track on the album is last, \\"The Call of Ktulu\\".  I enjoy this song in a similar fashion as I enjoy the orchestral piece \\"Bolero\\" by Ravel.  It is purely an instrumental that starts with a very creepy guitar intro, then proceeds to building intensity through the repetition of a common patter, emphasized by different instruments.  It builds to a climax 6 to 7 minutes into the nearly 9-minute song length.  It concludes back with the \\"creepy\\" guitar and a huge finish, accentuated by Lars Ulrich's drums.  I personally feel that a great band can do its most inventive work when vocals don't get in the way, and for me personally the brilliance of Metallica trulyshines in this last track.    For me, this album represents the best mix of song-writing and musicianship in a Metallica album.  It has many memorable songs, rocks harder than in subsequent Metallica albums, but has a more polished sound than \\"Kill 'Em All\\".  This definitely gets a 5+ stars from me!!
031236198X|5.0|I am usually more into serious literature, but one of my team mates in an on-line course suggested that our group use this book for an educational leadership project. It was an excellent suggestion. Not only was the book \\"short and sweet\\", but within its pages, I could actually see myself and the role that I play within the structural system of my school. I am a die hard for doing things the \\"old way\\" and this little fable opened my eyes to seeing the importance of change. If we don't adapt, we won't survive. It is also very amusing to read about the plight of these little penguins and their cooperative effort to solve the crisis of their iceberg population. The illustrations are also well done and very entertaining. I would definitely recommend this book. It's great! It really brings the point home without becoming offensive.
B000T2OMX0|5.0|This was played for me in my local classical CD store and that was it: I was hooked. When I then saw it in my local high-street national chain on sale at a ridiculous price I walked off with it like a kid at Christmas. Everyone who has heard the opening strains has said \\"That's fast\\", to which I have singularly replied \\"Yep - great isn't it?\\". And they have all remembered I'm a period enlightenment nut, and gone \\"Of course\\".    It has everything to recommend it, this recording, from exquisite technique and musicianship, to ear-pricking boldness, gusto and courage, to a wonderful space around the recording that gives an atmosphere of elegance without being austere, reserved or removed. This could at once be in a great hall of kings, or in a little front room of a village cottage. Either which way, it really fills the room with a presence and spritely-ness that commands attention and bestows a great big smile.    Queyras' recording had the misfortune to emerge at the same time as, and therefore under the blanket approval of, the admittedly great Steven Isserlis recording (yes, I love that one too). For that Isserlis set there was much media interest in how Isserlis had held off the Bach, made/waited himself ready, studied the pieces carefully, and identified (amazingly sombrely, given his findings) the dance rhythms and elements as the core of the works. (Doubtless this was highlighted because the record company / artist probably pushed it that way as a way of establishing an originality to justify another Cello Suites, as if any talented professional cellist needs the \\"contributing something new\\" clause or excuse to attempt on disc what is the pinnacle of their instrument's existence!!!) Isserlis' / Hyperion's recording certainly illuminates those dance rhythms, performing them rhythmically and excitingly, musically more alive than the sombre verbal/written annunciations of their presence was. However, Queyras / Harmonia Mundi offer(ed) no such reasoning for the recording's existence, and yet the dance rhythms are definitely their, perhaps even more so than with Isserlis. This recording is very much alive with them, and to them, and it resonates with a realness as a result. It's a dancing with a certain gentility, nothing raucous or base about it, but with a likeable robustness and positive forwardness that inspires both confidence in the artist's ability and consideration, and a reflection on the life and purpose of the pieces, from their gestation to their present incarnations.    Just as I was beginning to despair for great readings of Bach's Cello Suites at present, and had recently delved back to discover the great readings of Pierre Fournier and Janos Starker (and finding I didn't like Rostropovich's rather clumpy and over-bearing fatherly heaviness as much as the reviews and reputations said I should like it), I am absolutely delighted to have two outstanding arrivals in the shape of Isserlis (which I knew would be great) and even more so Queyras (which I knew nothing about), which have reinvigorated my love of these works. I would also put in this echelon of new interpretations worthy of recommendation, those by Anne Gastinel, although I'm not sure how many will be so easily encouraged towards her's as towards Isserlis (easy to encourage towards) or Queyras (hopefully not too hard!). Isserlis uses gut strings and an instrument of appropriate age, and a great amount of \\"period\\" technique, attitude and approach, though is not definitively a \\"period\\" recording; Queyras is such; and Gastinel is \\"modern\\". All are very much worth investigation; all reaffirm the brilliance of Bach, of the pieces, and the existence of cellists capable of surmounting these heights; Queyras might just, for me, have climbed the hardest, fastest and best.    Pass this by at your peril!
B00005JPLW|5.0|For folks who are fascinated by this film and wonder how it is done, this is an excellent edition.

It was so touching and real and just moving. It is a keeper, and there a few books i hold onto. I will definitly read it again and again. Definitly looking forward to his other books. I hope they can compare!
B0012QE4Q2|2.0|There are things to recommend this movie. The costumes are gorgeous. The acting is pretty good, although the dialogue is a big stuffy (though Natalie Portman certainly has plenty of experience delivering awkward dialogue from chewing her way through the various klunky Star Wars movies). I thought her portrayal of Anne Boleyn was good -- in fact, better than the story could carry.    This takes one of the most exciting and perilous chapters of the long and gory Tudor story and turns it ... dull. There just isn't any getting around it. They just make it dry. The perspective of Mary Boleyn would have been more interesting if they'd given Scarlet Johannson anything to do except go around looking like a sad puppy and acting like a doormat. The whole \\"twist\\" with George Boleyn, frankly, was not believable. The potential of Jane Parker Boleyn, so cornerstone to the books, was thrown into cameo status.     I watched this while doing some complicated work, and I was glad to have something interesting to do while I was letting this grind to its predictable and messy finish. One can say that any drama based on history is, by its very nature, predictable, but you're almost waiting for them to get on with the executions so you can roll the credits and move on.    All in all, if you like costume dramas, there's worse ways to spend a couple hours.
B0016Q56C4|3.0|\\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" would be the ultimate theme park ride were it possible to build. So many moments of this film are as fast paced and exciting as an extensively themed roller coaster, with a lot of falling and flying and escaping set against the backdrop of elaborate special effects. This actually poses a bit of a problem: just as theme park guests ignore the story of a ride, so too will audiences ignore the story of this film. The filmmakers most likely did this on purpose, seeing as there isn't much of a story being told. It's all about the visuals, which can be experienced in 3-D if you go to the right theater (mine only offered a traditional 2-D presentation). There's nothing wrong with great visuals, but they're always a lot more tolerable when coupled with a solid plot. An attempt is made in this case, but it's weak even at best.    Those of you expecting a direct adaptation of Jules Verne's novel will be greatly disappointed, especially since both author and story are mentioned by name throughout the film. It's more of a springboard, a way for the filmmakers to tell their own story and introduce original characters. First, there's Trevor Anderson (Brendan Fraser), a disorganized but dedicated earth scientist. He teaches a college course no one wants to take, and his lab is understaffed, under-funded, and completely disrespected by the other faculty. Despite his problems, he remains passionate about seismology, volcanology, and plate tectonics, much like his brother, Max, who disappeared in 1997 while doing fieldwork in Iceland.    While his sister-in-law prepares to move to Canada, Trevor is left with his standoffish teenage nephew, Sean (Josh Hutcherson). He's also left with an old box full of Max's things, one of which is a copy of Jules Verne's novel marked with notes. Trevor compares the notes to his own scientific data and realizes that Max was on to something big; it seems that the world's most seismically active sites contain passages the lead deep beneath the earth, and this suggests that Verne's writing was not mere science fiction. Trevor and Sean immediately book a flight to Iceland to find Sigurbjörn Ásgeirsson, an earth scientist who had known Max and shared the same passion for \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth.\\" When they arrive, they instead find his daughter, Hannah (Anita Briem), an avid mountain climber. While she loved her father very much, she never believed Verne's book was anything other than fiction.    Despite having just met them, Hannah agrees to guide Trevor and Sean up a volcano so that Trevor can do a bit of fieldwork. A sudden thunderstorm forces them into a cave, and after a couple of hair-raising close calls, they fall through a thin sheet of rock all the way to Earth's center. They then discover a dangerous yet amazing world of glowing birds, magnetic rocks, carnivorous fish, gigantic Venus flytraps, still-living dinosaurs, and underground oceans. \\"A world within the world,\\" Trevor muses, realizing his brother and Hannah's father were right all along. Unfortunately, they have to get back to the surface as soon as possible. The temperature is rapidly rising, and they only have so much time before a volcanic geyser is ready to erupt.    I grant you that all of this is fun to watch, and while I was unable to see it in 3-D, I understood how the effect was supposed to work on the audience. The sheer number of objects flying towards the camera is enormous, pretty much to the point of being obvious. The thing is, I want more than three-dimensional images assaulting my field of vision--I want to be told a story, and I don't care if it isn't believable. The story for this new \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" is a bit flimsy, probably because it didn't seem like the actors fully believed what they were doing; their performances were restrained, as if they were just rolling along with the punches. Not bad, but definitely not great. If they aren't convinced of the material, how can the filmmakers expect the audience to be?     Nevertheless, the film has its moments. There's a touching scene between Fraser and Hutcherson taking place on a beautifully lit shoreline, and while I won't describe what happens or reveal what they say to each other, I will say that it felt the most authentic in terms of character development. And yes, the special effects are quite good, most likely because they didn't look completely real. Strange as it sounds, the last thing a story this preposterous needs is a realistic look. Take, for example, a frenetic scene in which all three characters coast through expansive caverns aboard runaway mine cars; instead of the tracks going in simple straight lines, they swoop and curve and suddenly drop. There's even a sizeable gap that they have to jump across.    My point is that it's more exciting for a film to be outrageous than to be realistic. However, it was annoying that the mine car scene was copied from \\"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,\\" a much better film in all respects. \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" takes us on a ride and gives us plenty to look at, but it doesn't really give us anything to remember, certainly not as far as characters or story are concerned. I have no doubt that children will love this film, especially if they have access to a theater showing it in 3-D. But most other people will see it as nothing more than a mildly amusing distraction, a way to kill ninety minutes out of the house. See it if you must. See it many times in a row, if it suits your fancy. Some people love riding the same amusement park ride over and over again.
B000FJGWBM|5.0|Momento is a mindbending thriller which follows its protagonist, played by Guy Pierce, from the end of his journey back through time to its beginning. In the film, Guy Pierce has a rare condition in which he has no short-term memory. This handicap makes everything harder, as he has to take polariod pictures of people he meets and writes notes upon them to remember something about that person.  He is on a mission though, looking for the elusive John G. that raped and murdured his wife, and gave him his condition. When he finds John G. he is going to make him suffer just as he has suffered. Without ever lowering its sharp intensity, Momento comes to a close with not only a satisfying, but an all to poignant end.
B0013J9KOO|4.0|While I didn't find Hellboy and Abe Sapien getting drunk and singing Barry Manilow's \\"Can't Smile Without You\\" particularly funny, it was explained later on that that scene was supposed to reaffirm Hellboy's humanity, to show that even though he's a demon and supposedly designed for mankind's destruction, he's capable of lightening up and doing so much good. Or maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it was just a throwaway gag meant to kill some time between important scenes. But it doesn't matter in the slightest; Guillermo Del Toro's \\"Hellboy II: The Golden Army\\" is still a wonderful work of comic book fiction, filled with a dazzling array of visuals while at the same time grounded by a solid, believable plot. It has the muscle of an action film and the art of a fantasy epic, and I was amazed at how well they worked together.    The story begins in 1955 on Christmas Eve. Within the walls of a hidden military base, Professor Trevor Bruttenholm (John Hurt) tells an adolescent Hellboy the story of an ancient battle between humans and mythical creatures. Long ago, the Elf King Balor was given the Crown of Bethmora, a special headpiece that would enable him to control a warrior group of mechanical monsters called the Golden Army. When Balor realized how needlessly destructive the Army was, he banished them into an eternal dormant state. He then made a truce with the humans: they could live in the cities while the mythical creatures could live in the forests. As a token of goodwill, Balor broke his crown into three pieces and gave one of them to the humans. None of this sat well with his son, Prince Nuada--they disagreed so strongly that Nuada was sent away in exile.    This story remained as nothing more than legend until the present day, when Nuada (Luke Goss) emerges from hiding and crashes a New York City auction, one that would have sold a missing piece of the crown to the highest bidder. Sent to investigate the incident are the agents of the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense, now under the control of the exasperated Tom Manning (Jeffrey Tambor). While at the site, our red-skinned, candy-loving hero Hellboy (Ron Perlman) reveals himself in the middle of a press conference, apparently tired of hiding himself from the rest of the world. The outraged Washington branch of the BPRD assigns a new leader: Johann Krauss (voiced by Seth MacFarlane), a formless ectoplasmic entity encased in a scuba-like suit, one that must have been inspired by Jules Verne. With a German accent that puts Ludwig Von Drake's to shame, Krauss is known for doing absolutely everything by the book.    Now under new management, Hellboy, his pyrokinetic girlfriend, Liz (Selma Blair), and his fish-faced partner, Abe (Doug Jones), are sent to further investigate the auction incident. Their search leads them to Troll Market, a massive underground trade center hidden beneath the Brooklyn Bridge. It's there that Abe crosses paths with Nuada's twin sister, Princess Nuala (Anna Walton), on the run with a crucial piece of the crown. She and Abe immediately fall in love, although it's doubtful anything will come of it; Nuala and Nuada are connected at such a deep level, they know exactly where to find one another. It doesn't help that they share each other's physical harm. Despite their connection, they couldn't be anything less alike--the brother is angry, resentful, and sick of the way humanity destroys nature; the sister is calm, collected, and determined to uphold the truce her father made with the humans.    As the struggle between humans and mythical creatures rages on, Hellboy begins to think that entering our world was a bad idea. No human is ready to accept him as anything other than an ugly red demon with a hand made out of stone. Nuada picks up on his sense of isolation and uses it to his advantage, tempting him with the idea of leaving humanity behind. But doing so would go against everything the kind-hearted Professor Bruttenholm taught him. It would also mean ending his relationship with Liz, the woman he loves with all his heart. It's a fascinating dilemma, and I'm glad Del Toro continued to explore it in \\"Hellboy II.\\"    Just as fascinating are the array of mythical creatures, the best looking of any fantasy film since Del Toro's own \\"Pan's Labyrinth.\\" A wealth of imagination went into each and every being, from makeup to costumes to physical features. These bizarre yet beautiful creatures were designed to go well beyond the average comic book character, giving the film as well as the genre a much-needed dose of originality. But the best thing about it was that it didn't take itself too seriously; it wanted to be fun above all else, and it is. This goes double for the title character, a short-tempered, wisecracking tough guy who now uses a massive flair gun called The Baby; Perlman was definitely the right choice for Hellboy, not only because of his commanding build, but also because of his ability to emotionally alternate between Hard-Nosed Brute and Gentle Giant. But it was more than just a character that won me over; \\"Hellboy II: The Golden Army\\" was simply a great comic book film, energetic, engaging, and loaded with fantastic imagery.
B001CDD84Y|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I've read about teleporting from a very early age, beginning with \\"The Stars My Destination\\" by Alfred Bester, featuring the teleporting anti-hero, Gulliver \\"Gully\\" Foyle. (I highly recommend this novel.) Since then, I have always been fascinated by the idea.  This movie is a great idealization of the power to teleport, or \\"jaunte\\" as it is described in Mr. Bester's book. The special effects are terrific and the world-wide locales are a feast for the eyes.     Despite what a previous reviewer stated, this movie has an interesting plot and the motivations behind the Paladins were easy to understand. Ultimate power usually corrupts absolutely. And Jumpers have what the Paladins consider \\"power only God should have\\".    The movie's ending suggests a possible sequel.     I'm looking forward to it!    TJ
160459201X|1.0|I have read countless books on the subconscious, positive thinking, and mental focus techniques.  I firmly believe in the power of the subconscious mind and my negative review does not discount this in any manner.  I gave this book one star as it rates among the worst I have read on the topic and recommend not wasting a moment with this piece.<br /><br />Murphy provides his explanations into the power of the subconscious mind and the power of belief based on his conclusions built on analysis of many events.  He also spends time on the process of meditation and subconscious suggestion for the mind.<br /><br />The significant weakness of this book is Murphy's use of examples that he uses to comprise his analysis and draw his conclusions.  For example, he describes a woman that desired a Cadillac so intensely that she put her subconscious mind to work thinking about it.  Murphy states that she used the specific approach he advises.  As a result, within two weeks, this woman was the owner of a Cadillac.  Murphy then concludes this was the result of his thinking processes; using her subconscious mind.  Murphy then further illustrates how she came upon the car as a result of her uncle passing away and willing it to her.<br /><br />If Murphy deduces from the example above that the major contributing factor for this woman receiving a Cadillac was her thoughts, then you also must conclude that the death of her uncle was also the result of her thoughts; a small piece of irony evidently lost on the author.  Assessing the situation and giving full credence to the power of thought based only on these results is not only ludicrous, but it does a disservice to the true power of the mind that Murphy is unable to articulate.<br /><br />Murphy's line of reasoning in this book is filled with logical fallacies permitting one to simply replace the power of doing jumping jacks with his subconscious methods and not miss a beat.  Of course I am not suggesting that jumping jacks would have any influence in his examples; however, Murphy's logical leaps are often so absurd that using his reasoning one could conclude the same about jumping jacks as one does in this book with thoughts.<br /><br />I do not discount the value of the subconscious mind as I believe from personal experience it is incredibly powerful; but The Power of Your Subconscious Mind hardly provides any scientific evidence nor any anecdotal explanation that would lead any intelligent person to the logical conclusion that mere thought was the cause.  Murphy presents a very poor attempt at explaining the unknown power of the subconscious mind and does it so poorly that this book would be better served as a satirical piece.les; however, Murphy's logical leaps are often so absurd that using his reasoning one could conclude the same about jumping jacks as one does in this book with thoughts.

0316143472|5.0|David Sedaris is hysterical! This book of essays had me laughing out loud..regardless of where I was reading it ( so there are some people on the subway that moved quickly away from me...who cares!) His writing style is so comfortable that it is as if you are sitting across from him in a cafe ( or a bar) and he is relaying the crazy events of his life to his closest friend. This book, along with all of his others, are fantastic. They are easy reads and guaranteed to have even the grumpiest person laughing in spite of themselves.

0743290119|2.0|I was so looking forward to a good chick lit read. My expectations were dashed. I kept thinking it would pick up, that there would be a story line, a bit of pace, something to keep me reading. I finished it but it was a total bust. No fun, no wit, no comparison to \\"The Devil...\\"
B0010X8NF0|4.0|The Darjeeling Limited is visually stunning- The long shots, the close ones, the timing, the colors- everything is beautiful.  Seeing the progression all the way from Bottle Rocket to present has been a wonderful experience.  Individual performances and the storyline fell far short of any precedents.  I loved watching this movie- but would never reccomend it to a Wes Andersen virgin.  Tenenbaums had the widest appeal, Life Aquatic had impecable humor, Rushmore had fantastic performances- Darjeeling just looked great.  It's an incredible movie that left me at once satisfied and dissapointed.
0307237702|2.0|Obama in this book, like on the campaign trail, is stuffy.    Interesting all the similarities between Obama and George W Bush:    Obama: \\"For people to vote for unity and hope instead of fear and division\\"  Bush: \\"I'm a uniter, not a divider\\"    Obama: From one of the most liberal cities in the country, Chicago  Bush: From one of the most conservative states in the country, Texas    Obama: Won election as senator of Illinois with about 70% of the vote  Bush: Won lection as governor of Texas with about 70% of the vote    Obama: Rapid ascent, 4 years from being state senator to Democratic nominee  Bush: Rapid ascent, 6 years from not being in politics to Republican nominee    Obama: Considered a fast rising star in Democratic party in 2006  Bush: Considered a fast rising star in Republican party in 1998    Obama: Supported 2008 Bush Economic Stimulus Plan  Bush: Supported 2008 Bush Economic Stimulus Plan    Obama: Supported $700 Billion bailout  Bush: Supported $700 Billion bailout    Obama: No combat experience  Bush: No combat experience    Obama: Harvard Law  Bush: Harvard MBA    Obama: First African-American President (potentially)  Bush: First MBA president    Obama: VP Biden, had far more federal experience then him at election time  Bush: VP Cheney, had far more federal experience then him at election time    Obama: Attended elite prep school in Hawaii  Bush: Attended elite prep school in Massachusetts    Obama: Supports federal wiretapping  Bush: Supports federal wiretapping    Obama: Both parents went to college  Bush: Both parents went to college    He says the energy solutions are corn Ethanol and more E85 pumps.  He implies government workers are better then nongovernment workers, people in labor unions better then those who aren't.  Advocates a higher minimum wage, has ideas about outsourcing which seem like Thomas Friedman's.  That getting more people to graduate from college is going to solve economic problems.    He says math and science college degrees are so great, but I have math and statistics degrees and know that to be laughable.  Most of the college curriculum doesn't apply to what most graduates are doing in the real world, because computers automate technical processes like correlations or finding fair value of securities, except for exotic, cutting-edge processes being done by guru level people.  Why does having a college education add value?  Is it the diploma, the networking, the education, or that the two groups are demographically different?   Maybe college graduates are more conventional then other people.  People always talk about average income differentials between college grads and others, but the average income of people that read the Wall Street Journal is something like 200000, while the average income of people that don't is something like 40000.  Does this mean that if a typical person started reading the WSJ there income would increase 5x?    There has been tremendous change in the economy, few people's life, job, energy bill or food bill is the same as it was in January 2001.  Some people think the country is changing too fast, others changing too slow.      The real question isn't what most people want and need, as almost everyone wants a growing economy, clean environment, etc., and with constant polling you can find and promise that.  For every person who promises and delivers, others promise and fail.  That leadership is reactive because what people view as the most important problems facing the country change over time.  Anyone can read polls and state goals.      But how do you achieve those goals, like improving economic competitiveness, an effective energy policy, or achieving victory in Iraq or Afghanistan?    Obama belives people who sit behind computer screens at work are less worthy then others.  It's unfortunate he doesn't have more compelling ideas about things that are more important.    No one considers themselves to be a special interest. LGBT members have certain lawsthey would like passed, just like union members do, or NRA members do.    Bush gets blamed for things when they go poorly, like gas prices going to $4.11 this summer, but then doesn't get credit when they go well, like gas prices going to below $2.50 now. That seems unfair.    Who will our country be better off with four years from now? No one knows this, because plenty of unexpected things will come up in the next four years that will require crisis management and adaptation, just like they do in everyone's life.
B000002KNI|4.0|The music brought me back to when I was young , in the 1960s.  What a great selection from their concert in Central Park!  I wanted this disc because I saw \\"The 69th Street Bridge\\" song sung by Art Garfunkel on U-Tube.  All the magic of this duo is here on this CD.  Their voices are still \\"clear and young\\", not like the albums they put out later in their career.  If you want a trip down memory lane, get this CD.

0930289234|5.0|First things first what I liked about this book is it touches themes about humanity, and how certain events comparable to the shooting of Arch-Duke Ferdinand or how Germany invaded France could trigger a global world. This is what I liked about this book it still echos sentiment about the present now if it dealt with human pandemics like AIDS it would have been more then a book it would have been a prophecy. The end page about Tandoori Chicken now was really comical as well but if you want me to explain what I am talking about you should read the book. In this book Nixon is still President and the Soviet Union invading Afghanistan would have triggered a World War if certain events which have not played out at the end would have clinched it. This book is over 20 years old and was and is ahead of its time so it is no coincidence it is Time Magazine's 100 best novels.<br /><br />Now I will talk about what I don't like that is why I love writing reviews what I didn't like was I did not feel any strong attachments to any of the minor characters since the novel was focused on telling a story now that is not totally a bad thing but for me I would like to feel some bond to some characters and knowing more about these minor characters who were briefly mentioned would have even been more compelling.<br /><br /> The only character that I felt any strong sentiment dies at the end and his name is Rorshach a character who has an unending crusade to find the truth dies because the other heroes did not want him to tell the truth was heartbreaking because there is no opportunity for a sequel since it is 23 years later and Moore hasn't written anything to follow up this book. This is even compounded by the fact that the movie that is coming out next year will not have a sequel as evidenced by online reviews.
0385338724|4.0|While not as humorous as some of Sophie Kinsella's other books, I really enjoyed this one.    A story about how Lexi's ordinary life is literally transformed overnight (at least as far as she's concerned) due to amnesia.  She's forced into a seemingly pefect life and forced to ask herself some tough questions, like what's a \\"perfect\\" life, what drives you for success, what's important to you etc.    As with most of Sophie Kinsella's books, there's some career focus, romance, friendships and family life.  A nice, light read that really holds your interest with great characters and lots of things that are relatable.    I can't wait for her next book.  I have read all of her books and will be certain to read them again or listen to the audio.  (abridged and unabridged)    I listened to  audio version on this one read by Rosalyn Landry (she also read the last 2 Shopaholic Books and Undomestic Godess (unabridged).  She's an okay narrator and does a nice job, but I missed Emily Gray, who narrated the first 3 Shopaholic Books and the abridged version of \\"Can You Keep A Secret\\" - Emily is amazing.

0440237688|4.0|This story made me think of the old movie \\"green sun\\".  It should make everyone react at his/her level without any age distinction but mostly teenagers.  No robot in the futurist story, just human conditioned and controlled (by who?) at the extreme.  It is wonderfully explained how one ends up not questioning the system and how he/she can escape it.  The end is splendid except for a \\"prop\\" which appears from nowhere.  This excepted, the book is beautiful.  I strongly recommend it to everyone over 13.  I warranty parents they won't hear \\"I'm bored\\" or \\"I have nothing to do\\" the time of this book reading and may be thinking of :).  For grown ups, it is a fabulous and clear reply to Finkenkraut's \\"Vain memory\\".  Claude

The pages and flaps are a bit worn, so I'm buying another copy. It was the perfect size for her to hold when she was younger, she loved it when we made the animal sounds, and now she sits and reads it aloud. Every baby should have one!

I also feel that I have a better idea of what they were thinking.  However, on balance, I liked the book a little better than the movie.  The way that John and Abigail expressed themselves in their letters to each other is so very articulate and caring and thoughtful and beautiful.
B001676320|5.0|Couldn't agree better than with the previous feedback.  This is an awesome concert with lots of EWF and Chicago's catchy tunes.  What a synergy between the two bands!  Video is presented in 1080i/60, which is totally acceptable for concerts.  It's brilliantly filmed.  Audio is either 5.1 DTS HD MA, 5.1 Dolby Digital, or PCM 2.0.  Both 5.1 surround sounds are great, but no doubt the DTS HD MA sound is superior to the Dolby Digital one.  As far as concerts on Blu-Ray are concerned, only Shakira would top this one in my opinion.  Better get both!
B000002JR8|5.0|I bought a copy of this album when it first came out in 94. Almost 15 yrs later, it still sounds riveting and fresh. This truly is an uncompromising masterpiece in hardcore heavy metal. The music has enormous amount of aggression, rhythmic energy, power and anger, all wrapped up in a great sound editing/mastering/overall production. The musicianship shown by each member and the band as a whole is utterly tremendous and puts to shame other hardcore metal bands that are less disciplined in execution. Sloppiness plaguing in hardcore metal could no longer be an excuse after Pantera.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I am just so impressed that after all these years, the Eagles are able to put on such an amazing show.  You would think that at this point they might just mail it in, but they give an absolutely electric performance.  Don Henley is just amazing.  His voice is stellar, although his rendition of \\"Hotel California\\" seemed just slightly off.  Maybe if they had put it earlier in the concert instead of at the end, his voice would have been more fresh.  But he hits everything else just right. Glenn Frey is great too. Yeah, he's got a few corny jokes, such as dedicating \\"Lyin Eyes\\" to his ex wife, Plaintiff. (Get it?) His version of \\"Already Gone\\" is just amazing. Although he looks kind of silly dancing while Henley sings \\"All She Wants to Do is Dance.\\"  I also gained new appreciation for Timothy B. Schmit.  People rag on him all the time that he's not a \\"real\\" Eagle and not as good as Randy Meisner, but I think he definitely holds his own.  \\"Love Will Keep Us Alive\\" is such a beautiful song.  And no Don Felder - who cares!  Steuart Smith proves to be a more than capable replacement. There are also some funny outtakes at the end of the second disc, especially one involving Don Henley and his guitar. If you like the Eagles, you will LOVE this DVD.
B000WGWQG8|2.0|The portrayal of John Adams is not in line with David McCollugh's's book on John Adams, from which this mini-series is taken.  Adams is portrayed in the video as egotistical, belligerent, and prickly. His relationship with his wife in the book is much less antagonistic and more loving than portrayed in the video. Just to try and enhance the book contents, HBO added in a short romantic interlude between Adams and his wife upon his return from France, which was both plainly gratuitous and completely unnecessary.    I felt that HBO took a calculated risk (and lost) by changing the character's on screen personalities to add extra 'drama' to the film, whereas in the book, Adam's life is much more peaceful, and personally, would have been more attractive to watch onscreen.    Read the book, forget the video.
B000B8QF00|1.0|The reason I am giving this one star is because the hit, huge hit if I might add \\"All I Really Want\\" was left off. I remember buying this in the 90's and that song was all over the radio. It's also a great song. I don't understand why in the world they left it off. It's her best song. It's funny how you can go to i-tunes and type in Jagged Little Pill and all the kids download the five singles from this album, but not \\"All I Really Want\\" showing you they weren't around at the time to see how big that song was. They only look at this collection and take the five songs from Jagged Little Pill and download them.

B00164KYS2|4.0|I thought this movie had just about everything.  It was like watching three episodes of the telivision show in one movie.  Nothing was lacking here as from the original show. Wife was with me, and she had cried at least 5 times in the movie.  It had some strong themes, love, friendship, forgivness.  Excellent production.<br /><br />The only flaw was that the Jennifer Hudson character seemed to not belong in this storyline. It was completely out of place since they were trying to create something not needed here.  Hudson's character contributed nothing to the storyline since Miranda, Charlotte etc were her support system.  I would have suggested they could have just found an obscure actress to play this role. It really felt like a corporate exec wanted her in this movie for no reason.  The fact that she is also in the soundtrack makes it equally annyoing to me.<br /><br />Apart from that, the movie is flawless.
B000ZOXDFA|4.0|Cate Blanchett does a convincing job of portraying Elizabeth I as she grapples with her enemies, the Catholic government of Spain and her cousin, Mary Queen of Scots.  She dispatches both of them quite neatly, but not before she gets to wear fabulous costumes and flirt with Sir Walter Raleigh who becomes enamored with Bess, her lady-in-waiting.  The movie has some spectacular battle scenes and good acting (mostly by Blancett) and gives the viewer a brushing-up on somewhat-accurate English history.
B000OV170W|5.0|This is a wonderful novel from beginning to end. Many people complain about the ending, but I think they have a negative reaction simply because it is not the ending they wanted.
0385340540|3.0|I'm not an avid reader of Grisham's - I might have read a couple of his early books in high school - so I can't really measure this against previous work.  As a suspense/thriller type book, it's fine as far as it goes.  The plot isn't terribly complicated and it is difficult to get very involved...at the end of the book, I was left with a feeling of, well, not much.  Still, it is a fun read and has inspired me to visit Bologna!

B0013J9KOO|3.0|I was really looking forward to Hellboy II. The movie had really funny and memorable scenes and yet, regrettably, the movie fell into the very well known category of crappy sequels. The movie is about...well DUH, Hellboy, this time fighting Prince Nuada and the Golden Army. The movie is a mix from Lord of the Rings, a bit of Star Wars and even a bit of Neverending story. It seemed like a collage of all these movies. But, this movie falls short of anyone of these previously mentioned films. First of all, the entire beginning could have been dispensed with. The animation in this part and the entire scene was ... Pathetic? Embarrassing? And a poor attempt at setting the storyline. The special effects, the acting, and just about everything about this first scene was downright awful. But then we move to this incredibly amazing scene where Prince Nuada showing us how damn good he was at fighting.<br /><br />While this movie excelled in development of the storylines, characters and plot line, it just seemed to fail in some basic parts...such as not making the viewer be embarrassed for watching this. Can we cut the end scene too? Please? Nevertheless, Hellboy had some truly excellent fight scenes. My only complaint was that they seemed to occur to fast and out of focus such that the viewer would be unable to truly grasp the fight scene.<br /><br />The movie was very funny. There was a very funny beer scene that is a must see. Selma Blair was pretty great in this movie. Her character had great dialogue and scenes. Still, the movie failed in its execution. I felt I was watching a mismatched collage of a bunch of recent and important films.  Throughout the movie I felt more emphatic towards Prince Nuada. I rooted for him to win all the way to the end. His story and cause were very compelling (although yes, wrong, taking over the world is a big no no).

B0014Z4OL6|4.0|While many books and films about South Africa's Apartheid have attempted to convey the tension and the eventual dissolution of that sociopolitical scheme, few histories bring us as close to the core of the schism as does Bille August's excellent film THE COLOR OF FREEDOM.  Based on the book GOODBYE  BAFANA by James Gregory (with Bob Graham) the story details the relationship between Nelson Mandela and prison warden James Gregory during Mandela's long imprisonment on Robben Island off the coast of South Africa, and the gradual friendship that occurred between these disparate men.  Studying this development of a friendship provides an opportunity to better understand the concept of Apartheid and of the evils of racism in general.<br /><br />Nelson Mandela (Dennis Haysbert) was convicted of treason and sentenced to life imprisonment  on the desolate Robben Island for his non-violent  attempts to end racism in South Africa, attempts that eventually resulted in work stoppages and resistance movements that moved the articulate, well-educated lawyer Mandela into the realm of activism.  While on Robben Island he was guarded by one James Gregory (Joseph Fiennes), a pro-apartheid, cruel prison employee who was assigned to Mandela as a spy and censor because of Gregory's knowledge of the local language Xhosa (learned from his childhood when his best friend was a black boy named Bafana).  Gregory lives on the island with this wife (Diane Kruger) and children and his commitment to his family provides a stark contrast to his hatred of his black 'Kaffir' prisoners: his involvement with the pro-apartheid status is strengthened by his direct communication with Intelligence in the cities of South Africa where his censored information from the prisoners leads to definitive capture and 'disposal' of the blacks.  On a trip ashore Gregory and his wife and children witness first hand the beatings and cruelties of the whites against the blacks and Gregory returns to his duties on Robben Island with a gradually changing point of view for the model prisoner Mandela. They begin communicating in Xhosa and Gregory allows Mandela's wife Winnie (Faith Ndukwana) to spend more committed time with her husband on her restricted visits to Robben island.  One particular misstep - Gregory passes Mandela's Christmas gift of  a piece of chocolate to Winnie - threatens Gregory's status on the island, while at the same time bonding Mandela and Gregory like brothers.  Gregory's life and philosophy have been changed by Mandela's powerful personality and spirit and his eventual release from prison into the new, freed South Africa has been aided in a small but meaningful way by Gregory - a reflection of Gregory's childhood bond with his friend Bafana.<br /><br />August captures the tension and the atmosphere of South Africa  in this visually stunning film.  Fiennes is superb as James Gregory as is Diane Kruger as his wife.  Dennis Haysbert conveys the spiritual essence of Mandela despite the fact that his physical appearance is not at all like the Mandela known so well from the still constant photographs of the diminutive freedom fighter we see frequently.  But the film does convey the tenor of the changing times during the 27-year confinement of Nelson Mandela.  The featurettes on the DVD offer lengthy history lessons about the real events referenced in the film and add immeasurably to the film's overall success.  There is much to learn from this film in addition to the fact that it is a solid work of cinematic artistry. Grady Harp, July 08h a gradually changing point of view for the model prisoner Mandela.

B0012QE4Q2|1.0|What a disappointment this movie turned out to be!! I couldn't wait to purchase the DVD since I hadn't gotten to the movie theater to see it.  I had found the book to be a fun read.  The book was one of those stories that flowed easily and was enjoyable.      The things that made the book so enjoyable (well drawn characters, a feeling of being \\"behind the scenes\\" to important historical events, well-paced storytelling) are completely lacking in the DVD version!!!    If you are a fan of the book, or the Tudor series on cable, or if you are a history buff, this movie will completely disappoint you.  The characters are so poorly brought to life.  Dialog is wooden, as are the performances.  Pivotal scenes are left out, while ridiculous new ones are added in.  Even the costumes are pathetic!!  If you've read the book, don't bother with the movie.  If you haven't read the book, don't bother with the movie.
B000BB1MI2|3.0|I enjoyed most scenes in the film except those with Johnny Depp,he comes across as a creepy pedophile.I know there are other actors that would have been better in this role(such as Jim Carrey) but Hollywood has some secret contract that says all Tim Burton films must star Johnny Depp.Johnny Depp is a good actor but this part didn't fit him.  I still enjoy the original with Gene Wilder more because I grew up with it and it is a timeless classic.

He read that book cover to cover. The next Christmas I gave him this set. It didn't leave his side for two years. He went to bed with it, we took road trips with it. It was permanently attached to his lap. He practically memorized the strips. I will forever be thankful that I didn't recycle the first book, and subsequently bought this set.

B000YPUFA6|4.0|Fans and critics alike notice the Resident Evil films strong departure from the game series, but much in return a new flavorful yielding story plot to work with. While being bashed for not following true 'zombie' scenarios (Living Dead series), Resident Evil still holds up as a great adventurous adrenaline pumping scare.<br /><br /> After \\"Apocalypse\\" (the 2nd film of the set), we found that Alice (Milla Jovovich) the protagonist had received incredibly powerful telekinetic abilities. Her powers grew to a much larger extent, she is more powerful,intrepid, and willing than the last film. She's more or less a super hero at this point!<br /><br /> Unfortunately not even our 'super hero' could predict or prepare for what has happened to the world... the entire world. The Zombie transforming T-Virus has infected the world, becoming an epidemic, and vastly reshaping the land. What were once lively friendly locations are now dry deathly terrain. To make things worse, zombies make up the population! Five years have passed and Humans are becoming extinct, save for a few survivor groups. These groups hit the road in an attempt to seek salvation or to at least be able to greet the next day.Alice has become a lone wolf, hiding from Umbrella's satellite controlling  probe that manipulates her as their very own weapon. She must remain incognito to avoid hurting any survivors. Days of peace have long come and gone.<br /><br />While the hip LJ and combative Carlos return leading the convoys, characters such as Jill and Angela are absent. Absent too is any information of their departure, in real life actress Sienna Guillory (Jill) was working on the film adaptation of Eragon. I wont spoil what happened to them, just look it up online if you are curious. Claire Redfield comes into play as one of the convoy leaders, she is on the more serious side in contrast to the other leaders. She was often known in the games as a bold individual, and had an older brother Chris Redfield (wonder if he'll ever make an appearance?). The convoys have their team sniper, medic, electronic/radio junky, and soldier(s) to help provide for one another. The group is slowly dwindling, common day objects are becoming a rarity as they scrummage through the desolate towns.Avoiding big cities of large population at all cost, they ran dry all the small towns... Las Vegas may be their last hope, but it may cost them their lives.<br /><br />Even the largest corporate industry in the world, the creators of the T-Virus, Umbrella are feeling the tremors of this. They have been forced underground into tunnel connecting facilities till it all blows over. Or till they can concoct a remedy for the virus. Leader Albert Wesker will not stop till the cure or an alternative is made. Sending his tyrannical (no pun intended for people who've already seen the movie) somewhat psychopathic partner Dr. Sam Issacs to deduce the situation.<br /><br />Resident Evil: Extinction is a great horror/action flick, the visuals are top notch, the casting is great, and music is eerie as can be. The film though does suffer from unexplained events, a rushed ending (come on it's a short movie why not dose up/lengthen the ending!?), and a rather weak final 'battle'. Extinction is said to be the final Resident Evil film of the story ark, but after watching the ending how can one call that finished! Imagine reading a book that doesn't scream for a part two, it's necessary as it says \\"to be continued\\"...you get the idea. Overall a great buy, and nifty extras make this a sure good addition to ones collection. The picture quality must be mentioned a second time, it's phenomenal. Some effects on characters faces have been note as heavily air brushed, some wont mind. At the end of the day Extinction holds all the key elements to making a successfully entertaining flick.pearance?).

This book is great!! I found myself laughing out loud and not wanting to put this book down! The book is what it is - a crazy girl, with an endearing heart, that has a bit of a shopping problem -it's fun, light, and will make you laugh.

B00005V9HH|5.0|It is not a recent film, indeed. The Twin Towers are still standing. We are entering the profiling era and it was tempting for criminals to return the favor, though they have always done that. They here profile the police and their investigative methods. If you satisfy the police's way of thinking you will go through their net with no difficulty. You just have to convince the cop that a certain criminal does not exist, that this criminal projects you in some kind of legend or saga, is a boogeyman under the  bed or in the closet. If the cops are convinced that this boogeyman is a pure collective invention, some folklore in another word, they will just shrug their shoulders and consider the one who is telling the story is, like all the others, haunted or possessed by a phantasm. And it works. He is the only survivor, or nearly, and he convinces them that his criminal persona is a myth. They are dubious, dubitative, skeptical and many other things, but they cannot imagine you are that myth, that criminal and that you are fooling them massively. To play on the impossibility for these cops to believe such a story can exist is your best diversion, disguise. They are ready to buy a lot but not that someone who is a coward, a weak person, a subservient non-entity, what's more a cripple, can be that ruthless, pitiless and unwavering mastermind of crime. Of course the punch line of the film is that the cop realizes he has been fooled because this cripple being the mastermind is the only explanation why he knows all he knows: he knows too much to just be an accidental witness. And the punch line is doubled with the composite picture of this fantasized criminal as seen by the other survivor who should not have survived and the criminal does not know he is still alive who has seen him very distinctly. This composite picture, a very sketchy image, is arriving on the fax machine as the cripple straightens up and gets into the car that was waiting for him outside the police station. Too late. This tactic has been used by other thrillers, but in this case it is very persuasive and the film works very well provided we do not profile the thriller-maker, otherwise we would know the end before the film ever starts.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines.

Though I'm not necessarily a Beatles Fan, though I have always appreciated their music, I had to have this book after seeing the movie \\"Across the Universe\\". It was like I heard the words for the first time and realized also for the first time that The Beatles were way ahead of their time in music and vision. I highly recommend this book.

B00139W3NE|4.0|Not having read the book, I found the film quite enjoyable and on a conceptual level perhaps even profound. The idea of a Socratic personal daimon in an animal form was deep (reminding one of the Mexican folk idea of the 'nagual', or animal soul each person is supposed to have) and impeccably executed. As far as i am concerned, however, the movie is really about special effects - the weasel, the golden monkey, the jackrabbit, birds, cats etc were supercool. Also, the polar bears were magnificent, amazingly well done - their walk, their roars (grizzly-like, actually), Iorgen's run - all this was really very professional.    On the other hand,  the cossacks and \\"Samoyeds\\" were unconvincing, i had no idea where they came from, why they supported the \\"Magisterium\\" etc. Ditto for the Gypsies.     The script was a bit superficial but it did get the point across - of a being a conspiracy to deprive people of their (our) animal nature, our animal soul. Sounds familiar.    what I do dislike and even resent in the film is the blatantly unfinished end, which leaves the watcher hanging in the air. They could 've pulled this one off much more elegantly. The main actresses (Dakota & Kidman)  did a pretty good job, much better than the men which were either unconvincing or simply too generic.   Anyway, pretty good film overall, much better than the Narnia flop.
0780626966|5.0|Great price for value.  Great classic horror movie series with overall plot, actor and actress, director (how was movie was taken), special effect. You have to see to belive it with own eye.  I think Wes Craven's movies are still best horror movie there is now.

B000092T6M|1.0|The legend of Robin Hood is a myth but its based on a number of real political and historical issues. This awful mean spirited movie substitutes modern political notions for ancient ones.<br /><br />The first modern agenda is the exaltation of blacks and moslems and the denigration of European whites. Simply put this is a racist movie. Morgan Freeman - an African American - is shown to be wise and civilized and the red headed Irish are portrayed as mindless savages. Not only is this offensive but it is bizarre. Islam to this day embraces the slavery of black Africans. Islam at the time of the crusades was not a place of racial harmony and enlightenment. Millions of blacks were marched across the Sahara for centuries. Most died. Those that didn't were given the most menial tasks. In Islam blacks were the least valued of slaves.<br /><br />During the crusades, this movie would have you believe that an African who is also a Muslim could wander around England and be well accepted. He is shown giving a Caesarian operation to peasant's wife with his dagger. Really?<br /><br />The second agenda is anti-clericism. The religious figures are depicted as impossibly evil. The medieval church had a lot of faults but these churchmen are laughably villianous. They seem modeled on Snidely Whiplash. Everything we know about the high middle ages tells us of the extreme devotion of the people to the Church. This ugly caracature of a history is agressively anti-Christian and pro-Islam.<br /><br />It has been said that the all the inventions of Islam were by either Jews, Christians or Persians. The Arabs served to transport ideas from India and China toward the West, but like those other conquering people, the Mongols, they themselves made few contributions to civilization.<br /><br />This propoganda movie turns all that on its head. Morgan Freeman is portrayed like a visitor from another planet with miraculous products of their advanced culture. This is just an anti-Western agenda. The creators of this film want to spread the notion that the roots of civilization were not European but Islamic.<br /><br />There was of course a real political context to the Robin Hood legend. It revolved around the Norman - Saxon rift. It involved language - Germanic Saxon versus Norman French. It involved the very bad English King John and his conflict with the nobles leading to Magna Carta. It involved Richard Coeur de Lion.(This goofy movie has Richard who couldn't speak English at all speak with a Scottish accent. Ha!).<br /><br />You would think that these real historical issues would provide enough material for a screenplay but instead we get a lecture on modern American race relations and the evils of Christanity. The plot seems to have been devised as an exhibit for Black History Month.the notion that the roots of civilization were not European but Islamic.

B000NY133G|3.0|Hi, a very closed friend of mine showed me the movie of The Secret, and actually the first time i saw it, it made me feel good about life, although it left me with a few questions and doubts about what they said in the movie, like you attract what you think, i dont think a woman who was raped attracted that situation, or the death of a loved one that you attracted it into your or his/her life, i think its cruel to say that and dangerous, how many people would feel guilty if they think that their thoughts contributed to an awful situation without knowing it?, maybe they didnt explain it well, but the way they put it , it sounds cruel, i do think that if you repeat words that are negative and make you feel bad and you think about them over and over again it may be attracted to your life and also they will make you feel worse about a situation, and maybe if you think positive things instead and search for solutions, things will change for better. Thinking positive is good but also taking action and taking advantage of the opportunities that come to your life. My advice is dont take this book as the whole truth in life, some things may be true, but other things are not well explained like the ones i pointed above. Keep searching and investigating, learning and taking action in your life and stay positive.

B00168HARG|5.0|Warning!  Spoilers ahead.<br /><br />The first season of TERMINATOR: THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES was a good one. Though fans are now brooding over whether the series will be picked up for a second season -- this is, after all, FOX, killer of shows -- the ratings overall were good, especially in the 18-49 demographic. While I would be the first to acknowledge that you should never underestimate FOX's ability to kill a good show, even FOX will hesitate to cancel a show doing this well in the most desired demographic. If the series is cancelled, it would definitely rank as the most dim-witted cancellation in FOX's history. At least some of the other very good shows that it cancelled were struggling with ratings. My guess is that they will bring it back in the fall and pair it with 24 on Monday nights.<br /><br />A lot of fans of the original two TERMINATOR films (we can all pretty much ignore the third TERMINATOR film, which even the makers of the forthcoming Christian Bale-as-John Connor film is not going to treat as canonical) were bugged to no end with minor or (in their minds) major chronology issues. My response is: who cares? First, we are talking about two very good SF films, but they are not the cinematic equivalent of WAR AND PEACE. Second, fans of the TERMINATOR films need to learn the same sensibility that fans of comic superheroes have learned: change is good. I mean, what is canonical in Batman? What cannot be allowed in Iron Man? There have been so many variants in comics that if it weren't allowed, there would be no comics. Besides, in the history of story telling there have been an almost uncountable versions of various stories throughout history. If TERMINATOR: THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES plays around with thee films' chronology, this is the biggest \\"no big deal\\" of all time. The question is whether the adjustments lead to some great storytelling. I believe it does.<br /><br />Casting is incredibly important in a series like this. Although by the end of the season more characters are introduced than one might have initially imagined, this is mainly a three-person show. Lena Headley, who is best known to mainstream American TV viewers from the film 300 (though she has been in a very large number of other films and TV series), does a great job in the title role, with one exception. She looks the role, acts the role, comes across as tough in the role. I completely buy her. But I really hope in Season Two that they decide to dispense with the opening narrations. Though she is a good actress, she doesn't sell the narration. Kristen Bell on VERONICA MARS and now on GOSSIP GIRL makes it seem so effortless, as does Jim Dale on PUSHING DAISIES. But it is an easy to underestimate skill. No doubt the writing hinders Headley in her narration. It comes across as too self-conscious, too aware of itself, too unnatural.<br /><br />Thomas Dexter, who most know from a controversial character from early Season One HEROES (his character was initially Claire the cheerleader's gay best friend -- but when Christian groups started complaining about a gay character, they suddenly un-gayyed him -- I wonder if people who are so obsessed about saving America from gays and the dangers gays represent to marriage [though I've never quite grasped the connection between keeping two dudes getting married and how that is going to make heterosexual marriages healthier] spent more time working on their own marriages if the Bible Belt, which currently has the highest divorce rate in America, would have more successful marriages, heterosexual or otherwise), does a very creditable job as John Connor, the sixteen-year-old version. The challenge of playing John is that it has to be made creditable that this kid would sometime become the kind of leader who could lead a resistance. My major complaint with T2 is that this wasn't done. I think Dekker by the end of the season started doing that. Early in the season he seemed more rebellious, headstrong teenager. But by the end of the season he had started maturing.<br /><br />The producers of the show say that they created the role of Cameron with Summer Glau in mind. To show how crucial she was in their conception of what they wanted to do, she was offered the role outright, instead of auditioning people for it. And it is obvious that they knew why they wanted her: they'd obviously seen FIREFLY and SERENITY and saw how she played the on-the-edge insane River Tam, who is simultaneously a genius, a psychic, a highly honed killing machine, and a crazy person. There is some legitimate complaint about her performance in the Pilot, but it is the fault of the writing and directing and not Glau. In the Pilot when we first see her, she is a super friendly, socially smooth, chipper, giggly high school girl in the first episode. But the rest of the season she seems to have the same social skills that Arnold did in his turn as your friendly neighborhood terminator. Once they got past the pilot, however, Cameron became one of the best things in the show. Most robots on TV are clearly persons, even if they are not human. Data, for instance, was clearly, for all his lack of emotion, a person. Sharon on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA clearly is, as is Caprica Six. Even the Doctor on STAR TREK: VOYAGER is clearly a person. There is a famous thought experiment known as The Turing Test, from a thought experiment proposed the famous Cambridge mathematician and super genius John Turing. He imagined a test in which a human being and a computer were separated from a questioner by a wall. A series of questions would then ensue. If the questioner couldn't, by the answers that were given, tell which respondent was the computer, then, Turing reasoned, that computer could be considered a person. Cameron is the first important TV cyborg, robot, or android since Robot on LOST IN SPACE who probably couldn't pass the Turing test.<br /><br />Let me expand a bit on this. Although Cameron can attend school, hang out with people, and basically pass for human, she constantly exposes the gap between her and humans. This is incredibly unusual for television. As a result, this could end up being one of the most important cyborg characters in the history of TV, at the very least the one that could inspire some interesting reflection. She is the first cyborg character on TV who truly seems to be completely devoid of compassion. Early in the season, when a girl she has \\"befriended\\" is about to jump off a roof in a public act of suicide, Cameron refuses John's entreaties that they do something to help her. Later in the season she promises a ballet instructor, from whom she seems genuinely interested in learning some ballet (it helps that Summer Glau is a real life prima ballerina -- her first acting job was on an episode of ANGEL as a ballerina and she and ANGEL creator Joss Whedon are reportedly working together on a ballet film), that she will save both her and her brother from the people seeking to kill them if they will give her information that she is seeking. They give her the information, but instead of helping them, she coldly (not cruelly -- Cameron does not seem capable of cruelty, just as she is incapable of compassion) exits the building. When asked later why she didn't help them, she replies that it wasn't part of the mission. When John asks her if she lies, she admits that she does, even to him. And the season is filled with some wonderful Cameron moments, such as when she one minute complains about their looking for the remains of a dead girl, because she a dead human is merely \\"meat and bones,\\" and a few minutes later is found sitting beside John, talking with him, as she applies pink polish to her nails. Her character is filled with incongruities. Oh yeah, she is blown up at the end of Season Two, but no one really believes that she won't be back, do they?<br /><br />I liked the patience of the show in Season One. They very gradually brought along three supporting characters. Dean Winters in the Pilot played Sarah's fianc&eacute; Charly and I fully expected the guy I think of as The Beeper King (from his role as Liz Lemon's boyfriend on 30 ROCK) to immediately disappear from the show. Instead he has reappeared in several episodes. My guess is either that he will be killed off or he will end up as part of Sarah and John's little army of supporters. I'm guessing the same will be true of Richard T. Jones's Agent Ellison, who started off as someone after Sarah because he considered her a mere murdered, but as the season has gone alone has come to believe that she was not lying when she claimed to be chased by robots from the future. The finale saw Ellison and a substantial group of FBI agents attack and get mauled by the terminator after John. I would lay money on Charly in the first episode of Season 2 taking Ellison to meet Sarah and having him become another member of her cadre. The third character to emerge was Brian Austin Green as Derek Reese, the brother of Kyle Reese from the first TERMINATOR movie and therefore the uncle of John. I didn't much care for his character by the end of Season One, but that is mainly because he was so gruffly written. I also got tired of his endless suggestions that something needed to be done about Cameron, that she was a killing machine that couldn't be trusted, bladdy blah blah. I hope they either kill him off or deepen his character in Season Two. I suspect they will take the latter route.<br /><br />My last comment is that this show managed to do what any good show need to: it got better as it went along. I enjoyed the first episode, but with each successive episode I liked the show more and more. I am very much looking forward to Season Two. And completely confidant that there will be one.

0385732554|5.0|I loved this book. Sameness is presented as a good, simple way to live, which at first seems like such a good idea. I loved experiencing the injustice and horror Jonas experiences as he learns, discovering with him the severe shortcomings of the only world he knows. Jonas and the Giver are strong characters who were a pleasure to meet.    My only small complaint with the book is that the end seemed rushed. After becoming attached to the characters and invested in their futures, the end feels hurried with assumptions without any definite conclusion. The setting of the ending is certainly fitting, I just would have liked the last scene to have been more fully fleshed out.    Nonetheless, this was a wonderful book, full of the joys of individuality and differences.
006135323X|3.0|I am probably guilty of writing  a public review after reading some of the others.  I enjoyed the book initially but did not feel that same sense of satisfaction finishing.  Then I read that one person enjoyed the early chapters about relativity and felt the book lost steam in the end.  I actually bought a new Macbook this week and ended up buying the \\"middle\\" model of three offered.  Now I know why.  I am glad I read the book, but I wish the later chapters were as interesting as the beginning of the book.
0743496736|5.0|there is only one word that describes this book. spectacular.    if you are looking for an amazing book....read this one.
0143038419|4.0|I am kind of confused by the reviews I have been reading here on Amazon. The book delivered exactly what it said it would deliver. The subtitle alone is \\"One Woman's Search for Everything....\\" It's not every woman's/person's search. Maybe you all don't find that you can relate to her journey because its very self-absorbed? Its a memoir. How can it not be?    I appreciated reading about her unique journey and attempt to heal herself of her very personal struggles/pain. I can even relate to some of them. Not all of them. And yes, India was kind of tough to get through at times. Maybe because I am not super interested in the type of meditation she practiced or really, meditation in general. But, I still enjoyed reading it and learning something new.     To blame her for being self-indulgent seems redundant because I don't think she would really argue with you. If anything, that was her intention.
0064407667|4.0|This book is highly indicative of what the rest of the series is like. The narrative is light-hearted though the story is quite dark. It is a fun, quick read and reread.
B0013FNC38|4.0|Great!  Better than Mr. A to Z, but still not as strong as Curbside Prophet.  Jason Mraz's third album is much stronger than his second with upbeat tempos and interesting duets.  It is still not as strong as his debut CD, but I still love it!
0143038419|1.0|Unfortunately, I agree with a lot of the negative reviews. Ms Gilbert is a very good writer but her self discovery does not seem to be enlightening at all. She came across as a narcissist and somewhat uncaring about the suffering around her. The book is not suppose to be a tourist guide but an emotional journey of someone who was in pursue of spirituality, peace, and communion with God and humanity. Regrettably, it does not deliver.
B000WGWQG8|4.0|Very realistic account of history.  Even if you are not a history buff, you will enjoy this series.

B000002U8G|5.0|Pink Floyd has had many sounds and styles over the years.  There is the Barret-era, the pre-Darkside era, as well as the Darkside-era and the post-Darkside era.  Each gives insight into the happenings of the band, the creative leaders, and the battles for power.    Meddle was somewhere in the middle.  It sports of the refinement that would make Darkside of the Moon one of the best albums ever.  It glimpses that architectural, perfectly choreographed style that shot Pink Floyd into the history books.  However, it also contains elements of the style that made them famous.  Long, organic rivers of textures and melodies that blended seamlessly.    Meddle is the fulcrum point of this change; it displays the meeting of the pre-Darkside and the post-Darkside era.  If Darkside is too structured, or Atom Heart Mother to jam-oriented, Meddle is the perfect compromise, mixing structure and smoothness in a perfect way.
0938045695|3.0|Overall this is a decent book.  There are inconsistencies.  The book starts w/a male teen who first uses a 53 lb. kettlebell.  Pavel wants men today to start w/a 35 lb'er.  Is it due to lifestyle differences of people from the past versus today?  Another story about a kettlebeller pressing a 70 lb. KB 88 times.  No one from the \\"Party\\" has mentioned they have done so.  They continually mention the snatch test.  Competitive Girevoy sport competitions include the jerk, snatch, and long cycle.  They can use kettlebells other then the 53 lb.  He talks of many studies being done.  I've tried to search for many of these names and have found nothing.  The citation at times is improper as well.  He has done a great job of getting Americans converted to KB training.  Go to their web page and you'll see.  However, say something remotely critical against the \\"Party\\" principles and many will try to refute you or the post will be removed PROMPTLY.  There are about ten pages of the book that were in various catalogs the company puts out.  Why is that?  Filler material?  There are too many pictures, full of interesting poses however.  Smaller print  and a disk (or web link) w/proper technique vs. poor technique could have been used.  He encourages the reader to buy the accompanying video as well.  Money making idea-YES.  Good one too.  Another alternative to encourage people and not just take money would be a video link printed in the book that would link you to him demonstrating various lifts.  The book is like Power to the People but using simply a KB, five total exercises mentioned (he mentions two to make one \\"a man.\\" The \\"RKC Program Minimum\\" involves the Swing and Turkish Get Up.  The \\"Rite of Passage\\" involves the clean and press, swing, and the snatch test (once a month or so).  The body tension techniques are well worth it as well.  The book does mention how to combine these techniques w/his other books Power to the People, Naked Warrior, and Bullet Proof Abs-another subtle marketing ploy.  He also suggests going to RKC kettlebell instructor course.  $2495 for three days w/a 20-30% failure rate?  Houston what is the problem?  Is it the teaching methods?  Is it the student failing to prepare?  Either way failing students is easy money for the organization.  Again, if one wants be involved in competitive, sanctioned kettlebell events, take up girevoy sport.  He continually refers to \\"Eastern\\" or \\"Russian\\" training secrets-clever marketing ploy.  Why?  Perhaps because of the Cold War an how the East owned lifting, Americans now want to know why.  Just a thought.  Only two out of the six chapters (33% YIKES) were useful.  Great book for beginners, intermediate and advanced trainees its a waste of moolah.  A CHEAPER alternative-search their website on Enter the Kettlebell (ETK) you can cobble together the major program points, search video websites of the exercises mentioned and you'll save yourself some money and trees.  Lastly, it sounds like he's coming out w/a sequel to this book.  If it's so great what is there to improve?!?!?!?!?
6304493681|2.0|A few memorable scenes, lots of dialog that tries to examine some deep subjects but fails.  Not miserably, but fails.  Had I seen this when it came out, it might have had a bigger impact on me, but the characters were wooden and the ending unsatisfying.<br /><br />If a human could have an artificial heart and still be human, what if the whole human was artificial?  When is someone no longer human and does it matter anyway?  Mildly interesting story that can stand on its own, it just doesn't stand very tall.<br /><br />Unfortunately, reviewers on Amazon give out 5 star ratings like they are candy for dying kids.  Every teenager (mental or otherwise) rushes off to plug their latest fad.  At least I liked it well enough to finish it...

B0018AK9RA|4.0|Being 33 years old I know all the Priest stuff, but this is the first release of Priest that demands the listener to listen to it over and over again. And if you do, it will find a place in your Priest( metal) heart. It is easy to throw up on this album, because you expect something different from Rob and friends. But in their good traditional fashion, Priest decided to do something different and it takes some patience to award it. If you take the time with this record, I'm convinced you will agree and it will be a 5 star rating!!

B000WGWQG8|5.0|What a Winner. I sent this amazing set to my father-in-law for Father's Day, I was late of course, but it got to him in plenty of time. Being a ex-history teacher, and huge American history fan, he was bowled over. He had just disconnected his HBO subscription and knew he was missing a good thing. This is a great gift for any history fan, but really great for any kid, the series is rivoting and you know your history when your done.  Loved it!
B0000C16OQ|3.0|\\"Grease - Deluxe Edition\\" was released to celebrate the 25th Anniversary  of the film and features two CD's in a nice case and a booklet with all the lyrics.<br /><br />Disc 1 is the same as the standard movie soundtrack [[ASIN:B000001FDK Grease (Original 1978 Motion Picture Soundtrack)]]. It features original songs from the movie and good clean audio.  What's not to love with that?!<br /><br />Disc 2, the reason you're paying the extra bucks here, is a disappointment.  I bought \\"Grease - Duluxe Edition\\" because I thought it would include more music from the movie that wasn't included on the original soundtrack. The bonus disc is a big let down.<br /><br />The second disc features an instrumental version of \\"Grease\\" originally released as the \\"B side\\" of the \\"Grease\\" single.<br /><br />There are four songs here touted as sing-a-long versions (\\"Summer Nights\\", \\"Hopelessly Devoted to You\\", \\"You're the One That I Want\\", and \\"Sandy\\".)  This comes across as sort of a poor man's karaoke.  The sing-a-long versions include the original music track and background vocals.  I put the CD in my PC to see if they display the lyrics the way a real karaoke disc would - they don't. But, if you get stuck, there are always the lyrics in the booklet I suppose.<br /><br />Also, included are the single version of \\"Greased Lightnin'\\", a 20-second \\"Rydell Fight Song\\", a four and a half minute instrumental called \\"Greased Up and Ready to Go\\".<br /><br />There is a Megamix medley, a Dream Mix medley, and two songs are presented in a Martian Mix format. I found the mix versions kind of weird and unappealing.<br /><br />If you can pick up a good used copy of \\"Grease - Deluxe Edition\\" for the same price as the standard soundtrack, go for it.  Otherwise, unless you're a \\"Grease\\" fanatic or a completist collector, \\"Grease - Deluxe Edition\\" isn't worth the extra money.<br /><br />Five stars for the original soundtrack performances, but a two star deduction for the disappointing Disc 2.

B000VDDWDS|4.0|Peter Weir's \\"Master and Commander\\" manages to compress two marvelous novels into one marvelous film. Captain \\"Jack\\" Aubrey (Russell Crowe in a marvelous performance) and the crew of the Surprise pursue a French warship in Atlantic waters. Out gunned and out classed by a heavier, faster ship, Aubrey is determined to take down the French raider before it takes down another of Her Majesty's Ships. This pursuit will cost his crew, his ship but must be done to keep the waters safe for other vessels.<br /><br />The most important question is whether or not you want to upgrade to the Blu-ray because of improved picture quality. While \\"Master and Commander\\" does look better than the standard DVD and many scenes look truly exceptional, the film looks a bit uneven overall. Could the transfer have been better? Absolutely but owning this on Blu-ray comes down to how much you love/like this film. I suspect that the same original HD master was used for this a couple of years back. It looks extremely good but not as brilliant as I had hoped.<br /><br />Sharp direction by Weir, a masterfully adapted script by Weir and John Colee makes this harrowing sea adventure a worthwhile trip. Weir adds a powerful cinematic flair with the sharp camera work of Russell Boyd. Unlike a lot of previous adventures at sea, the fluid camera work adds to the sense of menace and danger that Aubry and his crew feel.<br /><br />The extras are similar to the original single disc DVD which is a bit disappointing especially considering how much Fox is charging for their Blu Ray discs (particularly compared to Warner). All the extras are in high definition which is good news. We get deleted scenes, a historical and geographical trivia track, a pop up map showing you where the H.M.S. Surprise is at any given moment, the theatrical trailer and the ability to search and save your favorite scenes.<br /><br />There's no commentary track nor are there any featurettes on the making of the film. Considering this IS a Blu-Ray disc, I'd expect the featurettes from the deluxe DVD edition of the film if nothing else but, sadly, we don't get it. I suspect we'll see a Blu-Ray double dip shortly.<br /><br />I can recommend the movie on Blu-ray simply because it has a superb looking transfer with nice detail and without the over use of digital clean up (a problem for \\"Patton\\" which is one of the worst looking Blu-Ray's I've seen--not because of the image itself but because of the overuse of digital tools to clean up the film creating waxy looking skin textures, loss of general detail and adding an unnecessary digital \\"look\\" to the film to eliminate film grain).featurettes from the deluxe DVD edition of the film if nothing else but, sadly, we don't get it.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|Last night I finished the John Adams DVD series.  This series was wonderful!  It made me so proud of our American beginnings.  I think it is great how David McCullough brought out the personalities of our forefathers.  We got a glimpse of the mechanics behind the decision makers.  It also showed how even then, there were those who tried to block freedom and who were popular and had much power in the government.  Thank God for the tenacity of Adams, Jefferson, Franklin and many others.  I watched it once through and because of the rich history I had my 13 year old watch it too.  We watched it around the 4th of July, so its significance was even stronger.  I highly recommend this to all you patriots and those who could be...
B000ZLFALI|5.0|All I know is, I never even tried to listen to Beatles cd's my entire life, cause I just thought they were an old band, old people listen to from the 60's. And at first when watching this movie I thought it was really cheesy and a stupid musical. I had never listened to the beatles mind you, and I tried my best to hate the movie. But the actual music stuck in my head, and I begun researching and listening to the Beatles, and now I am a big fan of them. And after becoming a fan of the Beatles I can now watch the movie in a whole new light and love it. My point being, this movie is made for beatles fans, the plot doesn't have to be a huge mystery you have to watch intensely and solve. It shows how life in the 60's was ever changing and listening to the Beatles was an escape from the perils of a stressful world. And as the Beatles music and lifestyles evolved through the years, so do the lifes of the people in this movie. As the songs get more psychedelic the characters get more into the drug world. All in all this movie is great for the fact it is bringing in a new era of beatles fans, senior fans of the group should be glad that a newer age is sharing the love of the Beatles as they do
B000P5FH3K|4.0|I enjoy any of John Grisham's books about the underdog fighting high corporations and winning. I usually read the book first and then compare it to the movie.  The movie stays with the plot of the book well and the acting is well done. I like the fact that the actors that usually portray the characters in the books are big name actors with a lot of experience in their craft. Their performances are stellar which makes the film even more fun to watch. Even though I have seen this several times I wanted to added to my collection of DVDs.
B000YAA68W|5.0|I was giddy with nervous anticipation when I first heard that there was to be a film version of Marjane Satrapi's brilliant graphic novels about her childhood in Iran during the 1970s-1980s.  I loved her autobiographical stories so much and was worried that a film version would be a total let-down.  Fortunately and according to the extra features on the DVD, it seems that Satrapi herself was the key creative force behind the production of the film and dictated many aspects of how her animated characters should move, talk and behave.  The result is an absolutely lovely and engaging film with stark but artistically rendered black and white animation.  The story itself is a compelling combination of war narrative, adolescent angst and comedy and provides a peek into the world of Iran's fundamentalist regime.
B0000UJL96|4.0|Wow, what an improvement over the previous Star Trek film: Star Trek V:The Final Frontier, but we won't even get into that.  The Undiscovered Country is one of the best Star Trek films out of the current 10 film franchise, with its only competition including Star Trek II:The Wrath of Khan (my personal favorite), Star Trek IV:The Voyage Home (the non-trekkie favorite) and Star Trek:First Contact (almost everyone's favorite), however, there are plenty that say the 6th and final film featuring the TOS cast is the best, and it is certainly a strong and fullfilling end for the TOS cast (unfortunately the same cannot be said about the more recent TNG cast).<br /><br />This one takes itself seriously, with a strong story of diplomacy, faith, and the fear of change (the future - which the Klingon Chancellor refers to as the Undiscovered Country).  Of course any trekkie will pickup on every little Trek detail thrown into the movie and will make the experience that much better (especially references to Kirk's son's death, which took place in Star Trek III).  However, the film can still be enjoyed and understood for any movie-goer, though will probably come off more as good entertainment and nothing else (but nothing wrong with that).<br /><br />The story revolves around the Klingons, and as tiring as they were starting to become (no Romulan stories in the films until the 10th entry), Undiscovered Country brought forth a great story that was refreshing as much as the new looks of some of the Klingons....the film even won an award for best makeup.  General Chang (Christopher Plummer) is a great example, with the most unique look to this day of any Klingon, sporting an eye patch and a tiny ponytail...its almost a pirate look at times, but he pulls it off with ease and it works.<br /><br />The action in this film holds up well to this day, and a cloaked Bird-of-Prey firing torpedoes at a helpless Enterprise still gives me chills.  There isn't an overabundance of action at all, in fact, you might say there isn't a lot, but the film never needed it.  The final battle is a solid couple of minutes of the very climactic showdown between General Chang and Kirk, both aboard their ships.  One after another, Chang sends torpedoes through the Enterprise's hull while quoting Shakespeare.  The effects are great, especially for 1991, and such a huge welcome after Final Froniter's laughable attempts with effects.<br /><br />Trekkie or not, this is a great film that holds up very well that should not be missed.  The pacing is wonderful, as is the story and the subject matter at hand.  There is great dialouge, humor, action, effects, and a villain that is one of Trek's most memorable.  This is one fun and entertaining ride that feels complete.<br /><br />Acting - 4<br />Action - 4<br />Characters - 4<br />Story - 4.5<br />Overall - 4.5there isn't a lot, but the film never needed it.

B0002SVW3O|3.0|Mostly this album is an overblown dark ambient hodgepodge of genre fittings, but occasionally the brilliance that would become this band comes through. Their debut is perhaps the only album where Sigur Ros could actually be heard sounding like something else (quintessential shoegazers Slowdive come to mind) and the only album in their respected discography not needed to date.

B000RG1FMO|5.0|Kanaye West Graduation is the first cd of his I have ever bought or even wanted to buy as his release approached I was looking past his effort to a man who had held my attention for several years 50 cent . So I picked up 50's effort first and while not as strong as his first efforts I felt it was still a solid effort but as I heard more of Kanaye's effort stronger, welcome to the goodlife and flashing lights really moved me to purchase this cd . Seems to me Kanaye kinda reinvented himself and atleast to me put out a better product . I would say he narrowly edged out Jay-Z for best rap cd of 2007 . Kanaye spits inpressivly and beats are strong while bring in T-Pain for good life appears to have been brillent . Go out and get Graduation
0385340540|1.0|This is the only John Grisham book I have read, and I was very disappointed.<br />Basically, the plot takes the standard ingredients of a spy novel (foreign countries, powerful Washington players with hidden motives, secrecy, scary technology, etc.) and throws them in a bowl, expecting a great thriller to automatically come out.  The plot keeps hinting at intrigues, keeps building up to a big climax, but never reaches it.<br />For instance (spoiler alert, but it shouldn't matter because I don't recommend the book to anyone), it introduces the character of this great Chinese assassin, builds him up to be the deadliest, most effective assassin in the world, shows him closing in on the target, and then -- nothing.  He's completely dropped with no explanation!<br />I actually liked the whole sub-plot of the protagonist having to learn Italian in a hurry.  But it was all for nothing, because he never had to use it in the end.  Use that in another book, it would be great!<br />This book was a waste of time!  I'll give Grisham another try, with something more well-liked by his fans, but for anyone considering this book, I wouldn't recommend it at all.
B0015D3Z4O|1.0|Madonna has never been a remarkable musical talent; she has simply always been a remarkably astute observer and creator of culture. She is the consummate chameleon with the correct response to every trend. I have always believed there is a streak of true depth to Madonna, despite her comfort in the superficial, and that depth lies in her commitment to the principle of free self-expression.    Madonna has lost that depth and the kernel of her genius in this album. Her \\"self\\" never emerges through the carefully packaged, retro-dominatrix club motif. For the very first time, we have no idea what Madonna is trying to tell us.     \\"Hard Candy\\" attempts to draw heavily on vintage Madonna. The sounds are produced enough to be squarely within our decade, but the song packages are reminiscent of the mid-80s. Even the album cover, with its neon and leather, is 1985. And yet the impetuous, creative, but curiously soft-spoken young woman from 1985 who relished her ability to stir the public with sharp edges is now so entrenched within her cocoon of status as a politically correct, music-industry legend, she has no motivation to manipulate us with this album.    All we hear are formulas. All we see are the hottest names in the business floating around the album to entice us to associate Madonna with contemporary musical power. It is all package, and no substance.     If there is any message here, the message is, \\"I may be pushing 50, but I am still a pop star\\". Like the stereotypical middle-aged man enduring an obvious mid-life crisis with a poorly conceived purchase of a flashy sportscar, Madonna is not conscious here of the narcissism she is projecting.      When \\"4 minutes\\" was released, (an odd mixture of the trendy global consciousness in Madonna's conceptual style and Justin Timberlake, who is just there because he is Justin Timberlake), my first response was to realize how much better \\"Blackout\\" is, and how terribly ironic it is that I am hearing songs from Madonna instead of Britney because while Madonna is a shrewd and confident master of public image, Britney is mentally ill.    Here, however, in Hard Candy, the limits of disingenuous posturing are seen; for once, formulas and shrewd marketing cannot take sail without any vulnerable and real person behind the package clamoring for expression.

055350259X|5.0|I initially bought the CD version of Sunburned Country thinking it would keep me from driving off I-5 into a feedlot while traversing San Francisco to LA and back. As it turned out - Mr. Bryson's account is so much more than caffeine or background entertainment that I must revisit this book (without the roar of Big Rigs or BMW's) to experience the details, wonderful insight, amazing adventures and most of all - hilarious perspective that he brings to Australia. Hearing it read by the author adds the perfect pitch to this journey, which has made this \\"book\\" a treasure!!
B0014VPFTA|5.0|I thought there were a lot of good songs on this CD (Gravity, In Repair, Dreaming with a Broken Heart, to name a few...).  And John Mayer varies the mood of each track enough - all without sacrificing his familiar style - such that listening to the whole CD in one sitting does not get boring.
B0013J9KOO|2.0|I really wanted to love Hellboy II.  After all, this was supposed to be the Hellboy that Guillermo Del Toro longed to make, and now could with a big war chest and the clout earned from Pan's Labyrinth, a film that ranks close the very top of my list of all time favorites.  Yet, for all that money and all my hopes, Hellboy II is, by and large, a clunker.  An at times visually stunning clunker, but a clunker nonetheless.<br /><br />Let me clear.  The acting -- even from the better of the cast -- is hit or miss, and mostly misses.  The dialogue sometimes works, but is mostly cliched.  The story?  It's actually Lord of the Rings Light.  And Del Toro's gorgeous visual style and effects?  Too much, too often.  It's like stew that suffers from an avalanche of heavy textures, tastes, and smells -- and never lets up.  Special effects work best in small quantities, in my opinion.  There are so many here that they become mundane and uninteresting.  Which is too bad, since Del Toro obviously has a unique vision of creatures and worlds.  Someone needs to tell him when he's dipped too many times into too many paint trays.<br /><br />Hellboy II does have the charm of beautiful creatures and worlds, and Hellboy himself is a damn endearing figure.  Too bad it missed the mark so badly.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|Viva La Vida marks a great departure from all of Coldplay's previous work, especially their last album, X&Y. X&Y was heavy on the synth-strings and airy vocals, but Viva focuses more on hard-hitting, steady drum/guitar beats and at times even gravelly vocals. As a long-time Coldplay fan I was skeptical at first of X&Y; it took a number of listen-throughs before I really started to appreciate that album. Viva La Vida though, was an instant love for me. The style is much more bold and I took to it immediately; It's definitely in my top 5 favorite albums of all time. Musically, is this album another Rush of Blood to the Head? No. That album remains, in my opinion, the bands greatest work. However that doesn't mean that Vida is not deserving of all the praise it gets. I was almost expecting this album to just be plain bad; how many bands have released four consecutive albums without one of them being considered a \\"clunker?\\" But lucky for everyone, Coldoplay has done it again: This album is a must have for any fan or anyone on the fence about X&Y (you will be converted!).
B00005JMXX|1.0|Science fiction involves speculation or rational extrapolation based on current science or technology, so scientific rules have to be obeyed up to certain degree. Then, there is no choice but to classify The Day After Tomorrow as fantasy, because the science was so exaggerated and full of factual mistakes that not even the man-made global warming tribe was willing to defend it. Famous environmentalist George Monbiot called it \\"a great movie and lousy science.\\" Realclimate.org compared it with [[ASIN:0061015733 State of Fear]] for addressing \\"real scientific issues and controversies, but is similarly selective (and occasionally mistaken) about the basic science.\\"<br /><br />The only positive comment has to do with the special effects, they are as good as their sister movies [[ASIN:B00005V9IK Independence Day (Single Disc Widescreen Edition)]] and [[ASIN:0767817478 Godzilla]], from the same film Director.  Besides from SFX buffs and disaster movie fans, the only others who could really enjoy this movie is the small band of radicals, who in the name of a number of good causes, covertly advocate for industrialization, capitalism and globalization to end as the only means to save our planet. And this film makes their dream come truth, as the modern Ice Age forces most of the citizens from developed countries who survive to march as refugees to the Third World in exchange for their foreign debt. The Independence Day of climate change!<br /><br />However, to be fair, it has to be noticed that The Day After Tomorrow was a big hit in the box office, so, unquestionably most moviegoers really love the combination of fantasy, good SFX, action, and disaster movies! This also explains the paradox of why so many Amazon reviewers agree on the exaggerations of the movie, but some rated it as five stars while others just one.

0767805712|5.0|Gattaca really makes you wonder about the moral and ethical consequences of genetic engineering, and the risks of mankind playing God. This is science fiction at its best. In a nutshell, Gattaca is the modern version of Aldous Huxley's science fiction classic novel [[ASIN:0586044345 Brave New World]] (1932).<br /><br />As usual, not every great movie is a box office hit, and Gattaca actually went unnoticed for many sci-fi fans. Why? The film's atmosphere is that of a slow pace dystopia, quite similar to the classic novel [[ASIN:B000087F6L Fahrenheit 451]]. Therefore, the movie lacks many of the sophisticated modern special effects we are used to, up to the extreme of astronauts traveling to outer space in full business suits. Also, worth noticing is the great performance by the leading and renowned actors Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, and Jude Law. Deliberately the movie does not have any flamboyant SFX because its simplicity is part of the attractive. It is high tech against the human spirit!<br /><br />I do highly recommend this movie, whether or not you are a science fiction fan. For those interested in exploring similar philosophic and ethical questions regarding genetic engineering and cloning, I also recommend watching the 1980 or 1998 TV versions of \\"Brave New World\\" (not available on DVD), [[ASIN:B000BO0LH2 The Island]] (based on Huxley's novel [[ASIN:0060085495 Island (Perennial Classics)]]), [[ASIN:B000UD0ESA Blade Runner - The Final Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)]], the action hero movie [[ASIN:B000056PMU The 6th Day]] and [[ASIN:B00003CXAT Jurassic Park (Widescreen Collector's Edition)]], though the original [[ASIN:0345370775 Jurassic Park]] novel's storyline is much better than the movie. Also Michael Crichton's novel [[ASIN:B0017TZKRG Next]] raises similar interesting and deeper ethical issues regarding genetic engineering, a more comprehensive exploration of the issues than Gattaca, but be aware that \\"NEXT\\" has a really lousy childish plot, not Crichton's at his best.<br /><br />And by the way, I was curious about what Gattaca meant, if anything. According to Wikipedia, \\"the title is based on EcoRI, a restriction enzyme that cuts the sequence GAATTC, that composed of the initial letters of the four DNA nucleotides (adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine).\\"<br /><br />PS: There is a VHS version of Brave New World (1998) available, though it is hard to find (see details at the Amazon UK store).

0440241413|5.0|Many LOL moments. I've waited for a book like this, and intend to keep reading the rest of Kinsella's. Too funny to set down.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|This surprisingly adult animated film places a love story between two robots against a backdrop of a bleak, uninhabited earth not so far in the future, where WALL-E, a mobile trash compactor, continues to do his job with only a cockroach as a friend. He whiles away the time by collecting the remnants of human consumer goods and watching a video of \\"Hello, Dolly.\\" One day a monstrous spaceship lands and discharges another robot, who turns out to be a \\"female,\\" and the tale begins.<br /><br />\\"WALL-E\\"'s post-apocalyptic vision of an ecologically devastated world is chillingly relevant in these days of ever-heightening anxiety about global warming. Although no human beings remain on the planet, it eventually emerges that they have survived, after a fashion. The director's vision of how people have fared is, again, all too plausible and none too flattering.<br /><br />The one drawback of \\"WALL-E\\" is that the opening scenes are so convincingly and absorbingly done that the rest is hard put to live up to them. When WALL-E, in pursuit of his lady robot love, reaches the space vessel that carries the remnants of humankind, the script resorts to standard action-adventure hijinks, diverting enough, which resolve to a moving though perhaps over-optimistic conclusion.<br /><br />Beyond the allegory, adults in general and film buffs in particular will be kept on their toes spotting  samplings of sci-fi film classics: I caught, without particular effort, references to Kubrick's \\"2001\\" (very obvious), \\"Aliens\\" (not only because Sigourney Weaver voices one of the roles), \\"THX 1138,\\" \\"The Andromeda Strain,\\" \\"Blade Runner,\\" and Douglas Trumbull's underrated \\"Silent Running.\\" Moreover, the basic premise evokes Ray Bradbury's short story \\"There Will Come Soft Rains\\" from his Martian Chronicles (in which an automated house continues to function after its inhabitants have been incinerated in a nuclear blast). It is a measure of the skill of the director and the strength of his vision that the film doesn't become a mere patchwork of cliches. \\"WALL-E\\" turns the last-man-on-earth conceit that has been used so many times in science fiction on its head, in a gentle cautionary fable that nevertheless packs a powerful punch.e a mere patchwork of cliches. \\"WALL-E\\" turns the last-man-on-earth conceit that has been used so many times in science fiction on its head, in a gentle cautionary fable that nevertheless packs a powerful punch.

I have many of his cd's, and so I was naturally excited to pick up the newest one. Oh boy, was I disappointed! Where are the hooks? Where are the tightly constructed songs? Bridges? Where is the old AL!? Mind you, there are a few interesting explorative type tracks on this one, but the much-hyped \\"duets\\" or collaborations are very weak. Of course, since Al can sing the phonebook, this one gets 3 stars on the strength of the vocals, alone. However, I'm afraid that the rest is forgettable.    I'll change my review if someone here can convince me that there is even one song on this whole album that is 1/10th as good as is \\"Belle.\\"  Yeah....Good luck trying.

No surprise that the illustrator and author is related to a major historical film director.

B00003003R|2.0|In addition to other comments: the versions of the songs presented here are far from the best ones available. Sometimes the band sounds like they desperately need to sober up/get their act together, or as if they're just bored.    Mastering is bad: when you get crackling during solos no need to reach to check your speakers - it's on the recording.    Contrary to what I was expecting this album sounds completely uninspiring, and it has Civil War missing. Look elsewhere for GNR.

B0013J9KOO|5.0|Director Guillermo Del Toro just keeps getting better and better.  He seems to have given up making genre-straddling childhood-based horror/dramas for now and has officially supplanted Peter Jackson as THE director to look out for in the realm of fantasy film.  This is a man who is redefining the genre as we know it one great film at a time.  \\"Hellboy 2\\" is the perfect sequel to a solid comic book adaptation and a great way to spend two hours of your life.  The visuals are amazing, the humor works well, and the characters are much more fully fleshed-out than they were in the first film.  Every aspect of the first Hellboy movie has been improved upon and nearly every flaw buffed out.  As a superhero flick it may not hit the heights of [[ASIN:B00005JPS8 Iron Man]], but it does lord over the impressive [[ASIN:B00164DWEA The Incredible Hulk]].<br /><br />You know the story: Nazis raise a demon during WWII, American troops intercept and adopt the little red bugger and raise him as one of the good guys, demon fights monsters as part of a top-secret task force, falls in love with pyrokinetic hottie, discovers he's destined to destroy the world, lots of a$zkicking ensues.  The first film was a nice introduction to the characters with some really great visuals and cool ideas.  But the fact that big red demons don't work so well in a live action medium hurt it.  In fact, I'd venture to say that without the amazing Ron Perlman, the whole project would have been an exercise in futility.  But Perlman IS Hellboy and he brings a lot of believability and gruff charm to a character that simply shouldn't work on the big screen. On the other hand, the two [[ASIN:B0017VG6AY animated features]] suffer from no such translation issues and still benefit from Perlman's distinctive delivery so check those out for sure.  Okay, round two.  So here we are introduced to the story of The Golden Army, an unstoppable mechanized force used to subdue mankind during a war with the elves and other magical denizens of the world.  The wise elf king ceased the slaughter and agreed that humanity may have the cities and the magical denizens take the wilds.  But now mankind has left them nothing and the king's son seeks to renew the war and crush the world's population by resurrecting the legendary Golden Army.  Meanwhile, Hellboy continues his passive-aggressive attempts to expose the covert Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense to the world (his handler has to bribe him with Cuban cigars), but at least he's got the girl...or does he?<br /><br />Freed from the annoyance of the unnecessary human protagonist of the first film, we're now totally focused on the characters we the fans care about: Abe Sapien the Atlantean empath, Liz Sherman the unbalanced firestarter, Hellboy himself (obviously), and a new addition to the team in the form of a German poltergeist that can inhabit and animate inanimate objects, Johann Krauss, who arrives to serve as the team's field commander.  This guy adds so much to the film I don't know if it would have been above average without him.  Great, great character.<br /><br /> Fairly early on Del Toro begins throwing everything he's got at the audience.  The menagerie of creatures in this film is astonishing.  Do not try to count the varieties or you will miss the film.  George Lucas is kicking himself somewhere as we speak; Del Toro manages to infest \\"Hellboy 2\\" with enough bizarre and imaginative creatures to fill dozens of Star Wars cantinas but I never once stopped and thought \\"that is totally computer generated\\".  That's the difference between a filmmaker who truly loves his work and one who just wants to throw a bunch of cool stuff to make the audience go \\"wow!\\" before getting annoyed by it 15 minutes in.  Guillermo Del Toro has built a career encompassing [[ASIN:1558908323 simple horror]], [[ASIN:B000274TLW supernatural coming of age drama]], [[ASIN:B00005JKWJ comic book films]], and [[ASIN:B000O76ZQC politically-tinged fantasy]] and has continually innovated and improved on each genre he has touched.  \\"Hellboy 2\\" feels like a culmination of those styles coupled with a massive budget.  The film has incredible visuals, but never forgoes character development; it has clever humor, but also genuine emotion.  Perfectly balanced.<br /><br />I've tried to think of a specific flaw in this film and I've come up empty.  \\"Hellboy II: The Golden Army\\" is a brilliant fantasy film that delivers everything one could hope for and easily tops it's predecessor.  Don't get me wrong, if the idea of a big red demon with an oversized gun in one hand and a cigar in the other strikes you as unconscionably silly then this film will still not work for you.  This is not \\"Pan's Labyrinth\\", this is not an art film, this is a pure goofy over-the-top comic book romp.  But it's one of the best out there and there is only one man who could have made it so.  Next stop for Guillermo Del Toro: Middle Earth. I absolutely cannot wait to see what he has in store for \\"The Hobbit\\".<br /><br />4 1/2 stars rounded up for degree of difficulty.<br />Seriously, YOU try to make something like this into a believable film!innovated and improved on each genre he has touched.  \\"Hellboy 2\\" feels like a culmination of those styles coupled with a massive budget.

Eventually, the two fall in love, but then EVE is whisked away to her ship when a plant is discovered.  The two then have to convince the overweight human crew to go back to Earth and finish the clean-up process.<br />What is there not to like about this film?  The visual effects are gorgeous.  Dirt looks real.  Wall-E looks like he might even run today.  And this is only just two of the many, many beautiful details in the movie.  I enjoyed how the first part of the movie has no talking, just watching Wall-E as he worked and discovered new objects (a paddle ball, a rubic cube, etc.) and how he meets EVE.  The chemistry between EVE and Wall-E is very emotional--I never thought it would be possible to cry over two robots being separated, but I did!  The story is superb.  Yes, there is a message of humans destroying the Earth.  Yes, there is a message against consumerism. But these messages are soften when the humans realize how important other beings are, how beautiful the beauty of nature is, and how much they want to return to their home and change their ways.<br />Wall-E is a movie that I think everyone can enjoy.  It is adorable, it is mesmerizing, and it is spellbinding.  After seeing all the other Pixar films, I loved this one the most.  Definitely worth seeing.<br /><br />Brought to you by<br />*C.S. Light*

Crazy Horse rocks and rolls and chugs and like the Stone's they always seem to be just on the verge of collapsing but never do. You can't go wrong riding the Horse.

B00065MDSQ|3.0|I've been a Crimson fan from the beginning. I bought \\"Court\\" at age 14; it was my first album and still one of my favorites. That said, \\"Red\\" and other albums by this lineup of KC have never been among my favorites because they are rather pale and obvious imitations of the work of Mahavishnu Orchestra and other jazz/rock fusion bands of that era. Crimson should be Crimson - unique and like no other. KC really didn't come into their own again until the Thrak era.
B00133KFGW|5.0|August Rush is an exciting and deeply moving story. The music is wonderful--combining rock and classical. The story line is spiritual and thought provoking. It is a story to be viewed several times. The desire to slow down, be still, and see what is around you is penetrating.  I can say, it is one of the best films I have seen in years.
0316143472|3.0|This book was really hard to review! How exactly do you explain 'I hated this book and couldn't stop reading it. You might like it, too!'<br /><br />Personally, I did not like this book. Each time I put the book down, I swore I wouldn't read any further. His stories left me with an odd, indecipherable feeling; sort of disturbed and a little melancholy. Mostly I just felt sorry for the author, like he was a guy that couldn't quite get a break, always a bit of bad luck following him. But a few hours later, maybe the next day, I would find myself picking it up and reading on...until I would set it down again and so on. I couldn't bring myself to call it quits, I felt compelled to keep reading.<br /><br />It was while writing this review that I pinpointed what kept me engaged in the book. Like it or not, David Sedaris weaves you into his stories in a way makes you almost certain you were there, too, like he's triggered a memory just about to drop off the radar of your mind. His style of writing was rich and realistic; I found myself identifying with the way he organized his thoughts and how he digested the circumstances of others around him.<br /><br />I don't feel I've much useful information to offer about the book beyond what I described: his writing is great but the content is for you to decide!
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|Coldplay has done it again...though the first time through it may take some getting used to, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends is a remarkable album that reaches beyond the band's comfort zone while still remaining true to their roots. Viva la Vida breathes life, and just like each of Coldplay's albums can brag of having a personality all its own.  If you already love Coldplay, you'll enjoy and appreciate the new elements of music  incorporated into their already unique sound.  Chris Martin's melodic and intriguing pipes surge right through you, and after a few listens, you'll have both instrumentals and lyrics stuck in your head. And that's a good thing.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|\\"John Adams\\" is a powerful. accurate depiction of a great man. Stodgy, unyielding, John Adams nevertheless was a bulwark of consistency as a tireless patriot and a strict constitutionalist. He was vocal in his rejection that the newly formed country adopt the fleshy indulgences of Europe, namely France and proved an effective, if relucant negotiator. Paul Giammani was superb in the role of our Second President who if outwardly aloof was privately emotional. Laura Linney played the perfect helpmate in Abigail Adams, who was quick both to encourage her husband and to constructively criticize whenever John got too bombastic. This series was a matchless viewing experience.

B00007L4MJ|4.0|Kino's Restored Authorized Edition of Metropolis is undoubtedly the most superb restoration of a film ever executed.  However, as of July 1st, 2008, this is no longer the most complete version of the film available.  Metropolis was originally a 130 minute film which was mercilessly chopped down to an overly simplified 80 minutes.  Archivists across Europe worked tirelessly to restore Metropolis to the best of their ability, producing this 124 minute version as a result -- the longest version of Metropolis to date, containing scenes and subplots that don't appear in any other version.<br /><br />However, it's now been twice verified that a complete 130 minute version of the film (which wasn't supposed to exist) has been discovered in Buenos Aires and is the real thing.  This Holy Grail of classic film is in poor condition and will, no doubt, take time to restore, but you can bet that restoration will begin immediately.<br /><br />The point of all this: If you want to watch Metropolis NOW, then this is the version to get.  However, if you're willing to wait, a perfect \\"Ultimate Edition\\" will eventually be on the way.

1421506270|4.0|If you haven't read the previous volumes of Death Note, I'd really recommend that you do.  Spoilers ahead!<br /><br />A third Kira has appeared, complicating an already impossible case.  L's main suspects, Light and Misa, have already been subjected to confinement and the killings have gone on without them.  Light has given up the Death Note, lost his memories of his actions as Kira, and is now on the task force to find Kira, even though he's spending every minute handcuffed to L.  As the task force closes in on the Yotsuba group and begins to eliminate suspects, Misa plays a vital roll in the investigation - one which leads to her learning about the Death Note, Rem, and the third Kira's identity!<br /><br />So the action slowed down considerably in the last volume.  If you thought there was a lot of talking and speculation in previous Death Notes, you ain't seen nothing yet!  L is working overtime as he tries to discover the third Kira's identity while also questioning Light and Misa and using their relationship to his advantage.  Adding to this is Misa's general silliness - even trapped in L's headquarters, she's only focused on dating Light.<br /><br />In fact, the start of this volume is much more light-hearted (forgive the pun?) than previous ones.  The drawing style, the dialogue, and the interactions between characters are brighter and somewhat tongue-in-cheek.  Perhaps that's because we don't have to see Light grimacing and sneering all the time?  Come to think of it, this really does show you a Light that's uncorrupted and unaffected by the Death Note.  He will occasionally acknowledge that he makes the most sense as a suspect, and it makes him nervous and angry that he could be capable of such actions.  Even when he's missing his memories of being Kira, I don't really like Light, but this gives us a chance to see the sort of personality the Death Note can draw out.<br /><br />So after all that complaining about how slow this volume is, I will say that the action picks up drastically about 3/4ths of the way through.  You'll definitely want to have the next volume on hand when you finish this one!out 3/4ths of the way through.  You'll definitely want to have the next volume on hand when you finish this one!
B00030590I|4.0|Zhang Yimou's \\"Hero\\" is probably one of the most visually beautiful and exquisitely filmed movies I have seen in many a year. Set in the third century BC during the unification of the seven kingdoms under the first Chinese emperor, the film stars Jet Li as a literally Nameless warrior who has supposedly vanquished the emperor's most fearsome enemies: Sky, played by Donnie Yen, Snow (Maggie Cheung Man-yuk), and the previously undefeatable Broken Sword (Tony Leung Chiu-wai).<br /><br />Nameless is escorted into the divine presence as a hero, but after hearing his account of how he defeated these three foes, the emperor isn't buying any of it; he suspects Nameless fabricated the whole thing only to get within striking distance (ten paces) of the emperor himself in order to carry out an assassination plot. The story then divides itself into a Rashomon-like re-telling from various POVs, each one photographed with strikingly vivid color shifts -- a vibrant red, a pale blue, a pristine white, and a delicate, pale green. And then we see Reality, photographed against a background of lifeless desert mesas which seems to emphasize the futility of it all.<br /><br />The most compelling characters in the film are Snow and Broken Sword -- she's a single-minded woman warrior with a take-no-prisoners mentality, and Broken Sword, her lover, is a warrior who has fought one fight too many and no longer believes that the sword is the only option to resolving conflicts. But Snow, like the true believer she is, loves her principles more than him, and the resulting confrontation between them is as inevitable as it is tragic.<br /><br />The acting is excellent all around. Jet Li is an appealing and likeable hero (or is he an anti-hero?), and Tony Leung gives a totally convincing performance as Broken Sword. The cast is rounded out by the exquisitely beautiful Zhang Ziyi as Broken Sword's servant Moon, in love with her master and faithful to the end, and Chen Dao Ming as the emperor of Chin.<br /><br />There are going to be endless comparisons between \\"Hero\\" and \\"Crouching Tiger\\", Ang Lee's masterpiece. Visually, \\"Hero\\" can hold its own against \\"Crouching Tiger\\" any day in the week. And yet, somehow, it doesn't grab you emotionally in the way \\"Crouching Tiger\\" does. \\"Hero\\" is gorgeous to look at and maybe that's its problem, it's so eye-popping to watch that the story doesn't measure up to its pure visual impact. Zhang doesn't do a \\"Rashomon\\" tale as brilliantly as the late, great Akira Kurosawa, and in this film he doesn't grip us as totally as Ang Lee, but he's delivered a movie that, at least to watch, is eminently satisfying.<br /><br />Judy Lindto be endless comparisons between \\"Hero\\" and \\"Crouching Tiger\\", Ang Lee's masterpiece.

The layout is better with entries starting at the top of the left page instead of just \\"wherever\\" like the previous books.

B000P12LWY|2.0|To be honest, this series strikes me as the ultimate case of packaging over content-- the people are all gorgeous, the houses perfect, the lighting and camera work exceptional, and the character motivations simple. While I enjoy the occasional early 16th century nubile nude youth as much, or more, than anyone, one suspects that the European rulers at the time based their actions on more complex desires than the pursuit of the perfect tryst.<br /><br />Ok, maybe I expect too much, and being familiar with books may infuse me with an expectation of complexity not to be hoped for in a Showtime costume series. However making Henry 8 an over sexed frat boy who occasionally has fits of intellectual awareness between bouts of sexual obsession simplifies a complex character beyond adult belief. I envy all the young actors ability to look good in tights. Some of them can even ride horses. And poor Sam Neil, as Woolsey--- try as he might, he's given nothing to play other than a power mad prelate who gets an occasional hyperactive massage from his mistress. Sam, no rear end points from the Jurassic Park series?<br /><br />I guess what I'm driving at is that if someone over at Showtime had shown the same care in the writing of the series, as they did in the productions values, this might have been a truly exceptional production.  It may get better--I've only been able to invest three hours of my life that I'll never get back on the first three episodes--but the hope of improvement may not suffice the risk of more hours waiting for something substantive to happen.
B000WGWQG8|4.0|I enjoyed John Adams: The Mini Series. I wasn't sure how Paul Giamatti would fare, but he grew on me after the first episode. I'm a HISTORY-FREAK. I have visited Colonial Williamsburg TWICE and have A collection<br />OF BOOKS AND MOVIES about my favorite : the American Revolution.<br />The cinematography and costuming was \\"stunnning\\" in this series. I felt like I was witnessing American history coming to life before my eyes!<br />I liked the series so much I bought the DVDs...I don't do that often.<br />  I didn't know a lot about John Adams before I read the book and saw the series. My knowledge of the Revolution was limited to George Washington and the military history of the conflict as opposed to the personalities. It was facinating!<br />  I also thought Laura Linney turned in a FINE performance as Abigail Adams. An actor is at their best when they seem to become the person they are portraying. I forgot all about who Paul Giamatti and Laura Linney are, when I saw this series. Enjoy!  Atreides

B0015HOFZI|4.0|As a tool for getting your vinyl to CD (or iTunes or whatever), this is a great product.  Sure, the whole thing costs less than the B&O crowd will spend just on cartridge, but if you're like me and have a bunch of LPs sitting in the garage feeling neglected, this is just what you need to get the tunes back in your living room & vehicle.    As others have said, the software takes a little getting used to.  It would have been useful if the software's default startup behavior would have been optimized for use with LPs.  As it is you have to hunt around a bit to get the recordings to work.  Don't be surprised if on your first attempt:  * The sound on all your programs stops working  * Your first LP recording sounds even scratchier than the oldest LP you've ever played.    After a little poking around, you'll get most of it working. Like the others I haven't been able to get the sound to play through my computer while recording, but since I've got the unit hooked up to my receiver, that doesn't really matter.    Just remember recording LPs isn't like ripping CDs.  :) You actually have to play the album in real time in order to record it, just like the old days.

B0017WI5VQ|5.0|Chasing Pavements stopped me in my tracks many months ago.  Now after doing my best to wear out my expensive imported CD, Adele is finally released in the US.  I've bought it yet again to get the bonus disk, and it was well worth it.  It turns out the live and unplugged bonus tracks show how truly talented she is.    On the studio CD, producer Mark Ronson put his magic touches on Cold Shoulder which not only will get her airplay, but lead to the inevitable Amy Winehouse comparisons.  This hopefully will stop since she outshines Amy with her originality and incredible voice.    As the world finally gets to listen to this CD, they will hear the most amazing talent that has emerged in decades.

B000002UW1|5.0|\\"Document\\" was R.E.M.'s first breakout album that took them out of the obscurity of indie rock. Although R.E.M.'s guitars and Stipe's voice are louder, they added some cool guitar effects and some saxophones too.<br /><br />Although this album eliminated R.E.M.'s softy band status temporarily, this album added a stadium sound that increased R.E.M.'s accessibility. After all, listeners had a hard time hearing the words in R.E.M.'s first albums. In fact, with the opening track, \\"Finest Worksong,\\" Stipe shows off his stadium voice, bellowing \\"The time to rise has been engaged/You'd better best to rearrange.\\" As guitars blast in the background, Stipe calls people to take their instinct by the reins.<br /><br />R.E.M. also prove that they can still sing great soft songs, in the part acoustic, part-electric guitar ballad \\"Welcome to the Occupation.\\" Stipe continues his political edge about the government, with lyrics such as \\"Listen to the Congress/where we propogate confusion/primitive and wild/Fire on the hemisphere below.\\"<br /><br />But this isn't completely a political album at all. In fact, Stipe sings some really wacky line in the song \\"Strange,\\" where he sings to a cool drum beat \\"There's something strange going on tonight/There's something going on that's not quite right/Michael's nervous and the lights are bright/There's something going on that's not quite right, uh-huh.\\" The next few lyrics don't really elaborate much, but it proves how much R.E.M. is interested in utter absurdity at this point of their career.<br /><br />And of course, no song is as absurd as \\"It's the End of the World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine).\\" Stipe mouths off fast strings of lyrics, such as \\"The other night I dreamt of knives/continental drift divide/Mountains sit in a line/Leonard Bernstein.\\" Of course, the first parts of the song make more sense, where he sings \\"Eye of a hurricane/listen to yourself churn/World serves its own needs/don't misserve your own needs.\\" Although I don't think anyone who heard the song could make much sense out of the words, it was still a fun, original song that became a huge hit.<br /><br />Of course, there is another song that received plenty of recognition, named \\"The One I Love.\\" Don't be fooled by the title--it isn't a love song. In fact, Stipe sings that \\"This one goes out to the one I left behind/A simple prop to occupy my time.\\" Obviously, that girl wasn't much of a person, if she was just a prop. But the guitar strums and drum beats accompanying Stipe after crying \\"Fire!\\" made this song legendary.<br /><br />In fact, Stipe proves that his band is just as capable of blasting cool guitar strums, frets and feedback effects. And \\"Fireplace\\" really shows off the guitarist's talent with a saxophone playing a hot improv accompaniment.<br /><br />Even though some songs, such as \\"Exhuming McCarthy,\\" sound way too happy to be taken seriously, the album is a very strong effort from R.E.M.

It proved that R.E.M. was a band that deserved to enter into the limelight.
B000BUYP4Q|5.0|This movie goes into great detail on the origin on one the greatest superheroes of all time. This film anwers all the questions about Batman that the first film didn't bother to tell. Questions like: How did Bruce Wayne become Batman?, Where is his secret HQ, The Bat Cave?, Where does he get all those gadgets?, and How did Batman become skillful in the Martial Arts and Combat. Batman Begins will tell anyone the adventure that started it all.
B000P12LWY|3.0|I would have liked historical accuracy, but it would not have been critical for me to enjoy this. What i find more important are things like character development and writing. Judging from the introduction/credits to each show, the pitch is that these stories are based on fact, when indeed they are not. Hopefully people are not watching this and thinking it is accurate.    I was excited to watch this show which has gotten so much attention that i felt i was missing out on something good. At first i was a bit intrigued, then disappointed, then mildly interested. I guess i was surprised that the writing was not so gripping, complex, or thought-provoking as it could be, given all the drama and complexities that history has provided the writers. The writing is really, really bad.    I initially felt the chemistry between Henry and Anne but what they fail to show is what is it based on? Why is he so drawn to her? I wish they got into that a bit more. He could have had anyone so what made her so special? Nothing i could see beyond a good chase.     The depiction of King Henry isn't enthralling. He comes off as a bit of an idiot, a spoiled brat. I guess I'm in the minority here.     I don't mind tastefully-filmed sexual encounters, but it was so gratuitous that i was rolling my eyes. Enough, already! The mind needs to be turned on too!    So i have hopes that season 2 will be better. I'm interested enough to keep watching, but season 1 is light years away from series like 'the sopranos' and 'six feet under'.

Written from the point of view of a dog, the main character, it touched on such varied topics as car racing, where dogs go when they die, the commitments of marriage and family in the face of tragedy, and the human spirit's ability to overcome adversity.

I enjoy a good British comedy occasionally, so when I saw this movie I thought I would give it a shot.<br /><br />I expected the dry humor found in many British comedies, but was also pleasantly surprised to find a good deal of physical and situational comedy.<br /><br />The movie revolves around a family getting together to pay respects to the father of the two main characters. What ensues is complete madness.<br /><br />Death at a Funeral is definitely a gem and worth watching. Guaranteed laugh out loud funny.
B00139W3NE|3.0|2007's \\"The Golden Compass\\" has a lot going for it: an outstanding cast, a high concept plot, and astonishingly good special effects. It is all the more frustrating that after a good running start, the movie leaves its story seriously incomplete.<br /><br />In the alternate universe of The Golden Compass, people's souls, called daemons, are embodied as animals that walk or fly in company with their owners. The people in this universe dress in the manner of the early 20th century but use of mixture of old and new technologies. They are controlled by the Magisterium, a mysterious, semi-religious organization dedicated to peace at the expense of free will and other inconvenient aspects of individuality.<br /><br />At the center of the story is one Lyra Belacqua (Dakota Blue Richards), a precocious and brave young orphan in the care of a university. Her uncle, Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig), is a seeker of truth; he leaves early in the movie for the Far North, to discover the origins of a mysterious dust that may provide a link to other worlds. After his departure, a Mrs. Coulter (Nicole Kidman as ice queen), arrives to take Lyra in hand and follow Lord Asriel to the North. It seems that Lyra is special; the university secretly entrusts her with a golden compass that only she can read and that tells the truth about all things.<br /><br />Lyra shortly becomes aware that Mrs. Coulter is far from being the smooth society lady she appears to be. She escapes and links up with a group of sea-going gypsies to travel to the Far North herself. Her mission and that of the gypsies is to free a group of kidnapped children, one of whom is Lyra's best friend from the orphanage. Along the way, Lyra will meet a friendly witch (Eva Green), a great armored polar bear (voiced by Ian McKellan), a helpful aeronaut (Sam Elliot), and tribes of strange warriors. Her path leads her to a strange laboratory in the Far North, run by the Magisterium, where she will have a fateful confrontation with Mrs. Coulter.<br /><br />The storyline is epic, on the scale of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". The superb special effects make possible the fascinating landscapes of London and the Far North; battle scenes involving Tartar warriors, polar bears, and witches; and the seamless interaction between humans and their daemons. However, the movie never gets around to explaining its own confusing theology or the backgrounds of the principal players. Worse, the movie ends abruptly, without resolving any of the major plot elements. The viewer can only assume that one or more sequels are intended.<br /><br />\\"The Golden Compass\\" is recommended as an entertaining visual feast only to those who have the patience to wait for the necesary sequel or sequels that will finish the story, left seriously incomplete at the end of this movie..

185984054X|5.0|During her lifetime, Mother Teresa was as close to canonization as it was possible to get without actually being dead. The front cover of Time magazine called her a \\"Living Saint\\". A cult of holiness surrounded her and in the eyes of the media and many politicians she could do no wrong. She was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and awarded numerous honors in the countries she visited.     The facts however didn't match the illusion and public perception and Christopher Hitchens had the courage to say so. He exposes her revolting attitude towards the dying, namely that they were there to die and to suffer; in that way they became closer to Christ. Care, compassion and alievement of pain were practically non-existent in her `clinics'. Standard clinical procedures and medical diagnosis was also spurned because they were materialistic. Provenance was to be preferred at all times. Hitchens also shows deceit was practiced as a matter of course towards those of other religions who were secretly baptized without their knowledge by sisters who were supposed to be caring for them.     Then there is her fawning over politicians, including some of the worst despots of the latter twentieth century. The Duvalier's of Haiti and Hoxha of her native Albania were amongst the most notoriously repressive regimes, yet as Hitchens documents, this living saint was there giving them her blessing. If she could preach her message against abortion and her present advocacy of unlimited population growth at the same time, so much the better. Not so much reducing the suffering in the world as adding to it would appear to be Mother Teresa's legacy.     There is also the little matter of money and as Hitchens points out, there is rather a lot of it, that was handed over in the name of charity or humanitarian support. Very little of this ever went to benefit the poor for whom it was intended. Rather it disappeared into unaudited bank accounts. One account in the Bronx had over $50 million dollars, yetMother Teresa was on record as saying she wouldn't accept altruism. She was quite happy to accept money from fraudsters such as Charles Keating, but ignored a letter from the man investigating Keating's massive thefts requesting its return. It might also be asked where the money came from which allowed Teresa to fly around the world often at short notice. As far as I know, the world's commercial airlines have never operated a policy of free seats to the religious.     Hitchens' book does not set out to be a hatchet job but he has not surprisingly received a fair amount of criticism for writing it. However there has never been any convincing explanations put forward by Teresa's apologists to any of Hitchen's criticisms, yet there has been much silence since he former living saint was hoisted to a higher plane following beatification in 2003. For those who are determined to see Mother Teresa as the embodiment of religious holiness nothing will convince them of anything untoward. However, if you do have doubts about the abuse of religious power and the ways in which all manner of lies are justified on the back of adherence to religious dogma, this book will provide a most illuminating window into a highly corrupt world.
B001BKV9TE|1.0|I didn't know they spoke English ten thousand years before Christ was born.    This movie was 300 meets Quest For Fire.  The best part of this movie was when it ended.      Instead of a Razzie award, please give this movie The Golden Vacuum Cleaner award, because it sucked!
B00004TL2N|5.0|The days are gone when recordings of Bruckner's Eighth Symphony were a rarity, but despite that great recordings have remained elusive. Haitink was too dour and the normally relaiable Gunter Wand got into quite a mess on his RCA recording. Karajan's mid 70's version was probably the only reliable choice and his tended towards the rhetorical. Not so with this new Boulez recording. Every detail is carefully thought out but never do you feel Boulez gets in the way of the music. Unlike almost all other recordings, the double-dotted rhythm of the first movement is correct and played naturally. Boulez resists the temptation to overstate the conclusion of the short first movement, realising there is still much further to go, placing the emphasis instead on the third movement and the finale which is surely what Bruckner intended. The third movement with that yearning melody in D flat is here played with such poingency and feeling that you immediately sense this is where Bruckner intended the heart of his greatest symphony.  Boulez's judging of tempos of each movement is exceptional throughout, broadening out at the big climaxes and pushing the tempo in the build ups. Never is there a feeling the music has lost direction, the big problem with Guilini, also on DG. The Vienna Philharmonic know this work possibly better than any other orchestra and here they play it with an intensity that they lack for Guilini. Boulez is prepared to honour Bruckner's dynamics to the letter, avoiding the temptation of others, including Haitink, to 'edit' the big brass tuttis. In this performance they shine out in their full glory. The strings have that famous polish of the VPO and the quality of their tone will rank alongside the finest work they have committed to disk.    The venue for the recording was the Bruckner Church in Linz. Boulez voiced some reasonable concerns about the possible acoustic problems. He need not have worried. The DG engineers have worked wonders and every detail of thisrecording is clear and vivid. At high volume, the power of this recording is quite breath-taking, but it works at lower volumes as well. The quality of the recording is splendid. It must go down as one of the finest recordings to come from DG and that is no mean achievement in itself, considering the high standards of so much of DG's output. Here though they have truly excelled themselves. Boulez uses the original Hass edition of the score, complete in every detail. This is infinately preferable to Novak; those cuts still feel wrong no matter how many times you hear them. Far better to hear Bruckner as he intended his works to sound rather than through one of his numerous editors who cut large chunks out often without reference to Bruckner himself.    For those who may be wary of Boulez in German and Austrian music, here you need have no fear. This is certainly one of the finest recordings Boulez has ever done.
B000056JYC|4.0|Before the release of this landmark double-album, Peter Frampton headlined a summer community festival in Parma, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland. After the release, Frampton was the headliner in a music festival inside Cleveland Municipal Stadium.<br /><br />The former Humble Pie member had four pretty undistinguished solo releases before this January 1976 breakthrough that propelled Frampton to superstar status on the arena tour circuit. But even this multi-platinum monster did not catch fire when it initially reached the record stores, debuting on the charts at a distant 191.<br /><br />But once it gained momentum, the staying power was incredible; topping the charts at number one for 10 weeks, remaining in Billboard's Top 40 album chart for 55 weeks and staying on the Billboard Top 200 chart for a total of 97 weeks.<br /><br />Importantly, the success brought a new gimmick to the music industry, with double-album live sets - or a twist, three sides live and one side of studio material - becoming the rage for established acts and artists looking for a big break.<br /><br />Because of what this meant to Frampton's career and to the music industry, it will remain as important a release to get a better understanding of the marketing of pop culture during this golden era in rock.
B0006399FS|5.0|If you love early U2 AND later U2 you'll LOVE this album for the mix of both found in the music on this disc. I liked this album even better than ALL THAT YOU CAN'T LEAVE BEHIND.    I also recommend the Collector's Edition of this album. Yes, I have both!
0061537934|5.0|My husband found this book for me at Starbucks.  I am a huge animal lover and active in Animal Rescue.  I read this book in eight hours while we were driving on a trip.  I laughed and cried my way through the pages.  As an owner of four dogs from 1 year to 13 years old, I don't look at any of them quite the same after reading this book.  I can almost hear the oldest guy say, \\"If you only knew how my legs hurt getting up to walk over there\\" each time I call his name. My only hope is his crossing is just as Enzo says it is in the last chapter, and in the end he really does come back as a man.  A beautiful, well written book.
B00068IOWM|5.0|Anyone who rates this lower than three stars has bumped their head! I agree that the packaging could have been better but the music is top-notch on this album. Calling U2 'sell-outs' for this record is utterly WRONG! The opening note to 'ALL BECAUSE OF YOU' catches my attention right away and gets my adrenaline pumping. The track 'A MAN AND A WOMAN' is beautiful and 'SOMETIMES YOU CAN'T MAKE IT ON YOUR OWN' is inspirational.    Ulitmately, I can hear the best of early U2 mixed with the experience and passion of later U2 mixed together very nicely on this album. I have both this version and the regular version of this album with no qualms about owning either.
B00000JPH6|2.0|The Dark Crystal opens up with a fairly good start. By the serious and profound voice of the narrator, you'll be thinking that this is going to be good. But as the film rolls on, its many flaws and weaknesses begin to show through.<br /> Jim Henson is talented and it's amazing the different kinds of puppetry and animatronics he blends together to create this other world, but I'm sorry to say it just isn't good enough. The Mystics' movements are so slow that it's a wonder they make it to the Skeksis castle even by the end of the film! I know they're old but come on! Then there's our hero the Gelfling. It's impossible for him to evoke any sympathy or emotion from the viewer because since he's a puppet he's not capable of facial expressions! The only way we know that he is sad or happy is by his voice. The puppet even with that still seems lifeless.<br />  Another problem is the story. Though we are told that the Skeksis are corrupt wizards and the Mystics good wizards, we NEVER see ANY wizardry from either of them whatsoever. If you are hoping for a great wizard finale, look elsewhere. They don't ever cast any spells; they don't ever have magic objects with them or concoct amazing potions; they're just there really.<br />  Again with the puppetry. There is a scene where the Skeksis' Garthim come barging into the ugly, wise, old woman's laboratory to get the Gelfling. This was intended to be an exciting sequence. The Gelfling just misses a Garthim's clutches before he gets on the old hag's rotating planet thingy, but because of the cheap, crude, silly movements of the character it looks too fake and lackluster.<br />  This film would have worked so much better if it was animated by some talented artists. Having more believable and smoother movements from the characters, facial expressions, and beautiful artwork and scenery would have turned this sad yarn into what it was intended to be: an enjoyable fantasy epic.<br />  Also a pet peeve of mines is the chamberlain Skeksis. Oh my Lord!  Give me an ax to hack that thing with! I know Jim Henson is trying to give individuality to his characters; give them certain traits to make them memorable and distinct from the others, but come on!  All his stupid whining and 'Hmmmmmm...&#34; sounds happened practically every time he comes in the scene.<br /> You can't say that I'm judging this film unjustly because I am an adult. You can't say that if I was a child then I wouldn't have noticed these things and would have enjoyed it. Sorry wrong. I hated this film as a child and still do. I thought that now that I am older and more open minded about things I used to dislike that I might care for this. Nope. Still stupid. Still sucks.<br />  You want a good fantasy? See the Neverending story, Willow, Castle in the Sky, The Secret of Nimh, or even Henson's Labyrinth. They all work much better and are better films.sis. Oh my Lord!

B00004TH7Z|5.0|I was in high school while this album had already been released. I had never heard Maiden before but always wanted to. I looked through some cds at a store and saw this cover. I that it look pretty wicked and picked it up. This album was a life changing album for me. My perspective on music totally changed. My focus as a muscisian and a songwriter changed. These guys are now my favorite band by far and its all because I decided to buy this album. If there is some other kid out there who is like I was then, I hope they pick this up because it may do the same for them.

B000EHSVQ4|5.0|I first watched Kingdom of Heaven in its theatrical release version, and could have given it a 4/5.  The effects are good, filming is fabulously done, and it is pieced together well.  And of course, the music is by Harry Gregson-Williams, which means that it is a soundtrack worth purchasing!  However, some of the historical facts were a little off, some things omitted, others added - you know, common things that go on in historical movies.  Just about all of the omissions are actual in existence - on the Director's Cut - which is much more complete.  Most of the additional scenes are actual vital for historical accuracy, character development, and a more balanced view of the Muslims (the theatrical release showed actually very little of them - and Saladin was the only obviously intelligent one, although none of them are \\"stupid\\").  The viewer's understanding of Sibylla changes drastically in the Director's Cut; I know I was not the only one bewildered by her unexpected character change in the theatrical release (her character development happens in the half hour cut in between).    Honestly, unless you are watching a History Channel special on the Crusades, Kingdom of Heaven is probably one of the most accurate Crusades-era films made.  If you want the history, get the facts; that's what I do.  But don't pass up this great film!
B000ANVPPQ|5.0|A friend let me borrow this film and I found it funny and cute.  Although his version the film was scratchy and not good quality but I bought this one and it was perfect.  The sound and picture quality was perfect.  I do not have any trouble with my disc.      Words of wisdom: \\"I can't explain it Becky, but there is something that happens between a man and a women with all that growing up together.\\"      John Wayne at his best!
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|Dario Marianelli does a fabulous job of capturing the three eras of music that this film's setting finds itself surrounded by: Late Baroque (1700-1750), Enlightenment Era (1790-1800), and Classical Era (sometimes considered 1750-1820, sometimes 1800-1850).  He also slips in some allusions to the nearing Romantic Era (1815-1910) with his Robert Schuman-like piano compositions, such as appears in the main theme.  The dances borrow heavily from Henry Purcell (hence the track entitled \\"A Postcard to Henry Purcell\\").  And, of course, what musician could call himself a musician without putting some Bach influence in his music?  (Theoretically, it's impossible not to, since apparently every musician since Bach is influenced by Bach whether or not he likes it!)    Jean-Yves Thibaudet plays with such elegance and grace, the soundtrack makes me wish my own inexperienced piano-playing could sound less like plunking and more like music - since he is one of the great pianists of today, who defines what \\"music\\" is when it comes to piano.  Lovely.    Dario Marianelli usually writes quite dissonant, passionate music, so this album is a little out of the ordinary with its rare \\"tragic\\" episodes - yet is always a little curious and nostalgic even, if only for all of those famous composers he includes in his writing.  Although the mood is entirely different than what I am accustomed to him writing, it is unmistakenly Dario Marianelli.  That is evident of a great composer, and his versatility will surely serve him well in the years to come.
B0013FDM7E|3.0|I have mixed feelings about \\"I Am Legend\\"; Will Smith does very well as a one-man show throughout most of this film and captured the insanity that comes with the solitude very well. I especially liked the scene where he is alone in the DVD store saying to one of the plastic models: \\"Hello\\" and `say hello to me'. It really made me feel compassionate towards the character as I can't imagine what it's like to be so lonely you've resorted to speaking to inanimate objects as if they are real.     The most surprising part of the film is seeing a city, absent of life, at the beginning. It was kind of creepy with the one man, one dog and deserted land.     I think the zombies could have been made better; they could have been made to look more `real' as they appeared rather computerized. Otherwise, they added a layer of chilling horror to the film.     In the film, a sickness wipes out the world, Robert Neville (Will Smith) appears to be the only survivor, immune to the disease that has taken everyone else. While trying to avoid going `nuts', he perseveres in search for a cure for the disease that has killed off humanity and left the others as carnivorous zombies. This film contains some dark and rather cringe-worthy humour, but it seems appropriate in the setting of the film.     Altogether, I think the film is worth seeing but maybe not owning.
B000O75F7C|5.0|I have most all PTree releases and at first, Fear of a BP did not do much for me. But as I listened to it more, I find myself playing it all the time and loving it.     This release to me seems like a great mix of old and new PTree, thus making it sound fresh and new. Did that make sense? :>     I also picked up Nil Recurring, the mini album follow up to Fear. Its a excellent complement to Fear.      Wish I was old and a little, sentimental.  Well not really.

I had to go to work so in most of my free time I read this book.   It is beautifully written. The story is definitely different.  Anna decided she doesn't want to donate a kidney to her sister Kate. Kate has been sick since age 2 with leukemia. The main reason Anna is born is to save Kate's life. Finally Anna decides she wants her own life and doesn't want to donate anymore. She is thirteen and wants to be medically emancipated from her parents.   This book is really good. It will not disappoint! Jodi Picoult is a good writer and I am so glad I found her books.

1402210086|4.0|This is my first Georgette Heyer novel.  I had a hard time getting into it.  The first quarter of the book is rather slow and dull.  However, once into the story, I found it very quirky and fun.  I did not find it to be a romance though.  Freddy and Kitty don't have much spark.  And although I realize that this was not the intent of the author, I kept waiting for Freddy to come out of the closet.  At the very least he is a metrosexual.  I like my heroes a little less interested in female clothing and style.    But if I look past the idea of this book as a romance, I enjoyed it.  The banter is great.  The characters are hilarious.  I would definitely recommend it.

B0013J30W2|1.0|Shades of Star Wars, the Matrix, the Professional and the Fast and the Furious make their tired appearance in this absolutely redundant, brainless and insultingly in-your-face wallet siphon called, inappropriately, \\"Wanted.\\"  A pathetic work-a-day loser, with whom us twenty somethings are meant to relate, finds himself in the middle of a shootout between professional assassins, learns he has mystical powers and spends a few days training to become a super-powered killing machine/race car driver.  This movie represents bad, bland, half-baked writing and pop-culture appropriation in Hollywood at its worst.  I would gladly give no stars to this if I could... if this review dissuades even a single person from spending money on the film, I'll be happy.

Case at point, A&M's 1976 phenomenal \\"Frampton Comes Alive!\\"  Being the owner of all three CD editions...the first one, with 2 discs, completely duplicated the sequence and line-up of the original phonograph album, probably taken from the original 4 analogue tape masters...i.e., 2 albums...4 sides...complete with applause fading in & out between the \\"LP\\" side breaks, which can become obnoxious, to the stuffy CD purist.  The next edition, the Re-Master for Digital...combined both \\"records\\"...all four sides...by the way of \\"cross-mixing\\" all four programs together...seamlessly, on one CD disc!  But there's one thing that remaster engineers \\"CAN'T\\" do very well...and that is to cleanup bad analogue \\"tape-splices\\" that were made, back-in-the-day, to compile the songs together over the roaring crowd noise!  These \\"splices\\" that act as connectivity points for the individual cuts, have no way of \\"equalizing\\", if you will, sound levels.  If you listen closely to the VERY BEGINNING of the epiconic \\"Do You Feel Like We Do\\", a REAL bad hard splice was made over the intoxicated mob noise, that was very audibly apparent, on the record, the 1st CD release & even the 2nd CD Re-Master.  NOT SO on this new glorious Re-Mix Edition!  When I opened up my copy...I went RIGHT TO that start-up point of \\"Do You Feel...\\" and sure enough that horrific SPEED-BUMP had been so smoothly & effortlessly corrected!  That short 3 second passageway, went down like a smooth shot of warm Brandy on an cold Arctic day!  (And I don't even drink!)  So now, it probably sounds the way it ORIGINALLY did, that very day Peter, Bob Mayo, John Siomos & Stan Sheldon, knocked it out, before a mesmerized San Francisco mass of maylaying multitudes.  Other cuts like, \\"Show Me The Way\\" is cleaned up extensively during the introductory strums of Frampton's guitar, that remained \\"muddy\\" over the years on the original mix.  As I write...I have the DELUXE CD on my Tascam Pro-CD Player...so there's still SO much more good things to report on...so you'll just have to take your critical ears on a listening journey yourself!<br /><br />NOW...one item that disappointed me greatly...was the new treatment to the number one ballad \\"Baby, I Love Your Way.\\"  During the Re-Mix process, much less (if that's a word) reverb effect was laid on Siomos cross-stick drum action, as he kept his beat time on the snare-rim.  That was sort of a shame.  Being a mix-down engineer myself (yeah right, if you hadn't already picked up that \\"humble\\" part of my personality), when layering effect for \\"ballads\\", it's always customary to add more \\"grace & warmth\\" to the drum mix, if you sweeten the snare drum cross-stick action, with some longer-lasting decay (echo) of natural reverb...digital or analogue.  In this case, is was drastically lessened...taking away from...in my opinion...the beauty of the percussive rhythm track of \\"Baby, I Love You Way\\".<br /><br />Nevertheless...this Universal Music Company's DELUXE EDITION Re-Mix Release of Peter Frampton's musical Blow-Torch of an album, COMES ALIVE, one more time!  (Bonuses include, never-seen-before photos of Peter & the Boys in the underground arena tunnel, lying in wait to hop out on stage...all wearing their iconic mid-70's tight, white Disco-Pants, complete with Street-Sweepin' Bell-Bottoms...!!!

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Dexter is the most amazing, clever, funny, dark and thrilling program I've almost ever seen.  It is brilliant and unique and interesting and thoroughly enjoyable.  The fact that we can actually like a serial killer is amazing in itself.  Michael C Hall is fantastic as Dexter.  He is intelligent, lost, and almost unable to feel love for another human.  The story lines are chilling and keep you on the edge of your seat - you are always guessing.  The writing is superb and witty and smart.  I never read Jeff Lindsays books, but now I think I'll go buy them and read cover to cover.    Trust me; this show is one that grabs you and won't let go till the ride is over.  Just when you think you have things figured out, they might take a different turn.  It's addictive and one of the best programs you'll ever see.  It's great and I love this.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|We watched this show over a few days on DVD last week.  I was so glad to hear the new season is starting in 2 weeks!  This is a great show.  I didn't watch it when it was originally shown - I didn't think I would like it, but I  really had my head up my butt on this one.  My husband and I were hooked after one episode and had to go out to the video store the next day for the other 3 DVDs.  I plan to buy it.  The writing, acting and production values are all top-rate.  I love the characters.  I haven't seen most of the actors before, but they were perfectly cast. I can't believe HBO passed on this show.  Can't wait for the next season to see what happens.
B0016Q56C4|2.0|I rarely give less than 3 stars for a movie, because I always find enough little things to like about the mediocre ones to push me over the hump. Not the case here. If this wasn't in 3-D, it might have made my top 10 worst movies I have ever seen in theater list. The acting, dialogue and pacing were terrible. It seemed like it took forever just to get down in the Earth so the action could begin. Brendan Fraser was annoying as usual, and the kid just made things worse.<br /><br />The only saving grace for me was the 3-D, though it wasn't as amazing as the visuals of Beowulf. There were a couple of neat scenes involving carnivorous fish and plants. Special mention to the mouthwash on the face 3-D effect early in the film.<br /><br />If you got kids who want to see it, take them to the showing where you have to wear the funny glasses, otherwise Journey to the Center of the Earth will be torture to sit through.
B00127RAJY|2.0|This is definitley a strenuous workout, but even the level 1 beginner routine is too intense for someone not already in shape.  I hurt my knee almost immediately and then my back.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone with weak joints.
0143038583|5.0|An amazing tour de force of food in the US!  Pollan writes with wonderful wisdom and honesty.  The book has a wonderful bibliography.    Industrial food is at the heart of all the major health problems in this country.  Pollan will open your eyes to the fact and make you wnat to learn about the alternatives.    Highly recommended!
0385338724|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book. It was so interesting to read about someone who has amnesia.<br /><br />Poor Lexi was torn between her lost memory and what her body wanted to do. Her instincts were right on when she rejected Eric's advances.  Although he was her husband, she was in love with someone else. Right away-she was attacted to Jon, but held back because she was married to someone else.<br /><br />She made a mistake-made the wrong choices: the husband and the cobra attitude to succeed in business.<br /><br />This reminded me of that dvd: 13 going on 30. They were similiar because the main characters forgot their past (in this book 3 years) and came to the future to find out that they had behaved badly. They made things right and goodness triumphed in the end.
B0018QCXGY|5.0|I really enjoyed this flick. A great original take on the classic monster/disaster movie. Well done end to end.  It left me wondering if the sequel(there will be one) will be like this one with a hand-held camera or a traditional movie or a combination.  The Bluray picture quality was very nice considering it was a camcorder perspective. It also made seeing that curious \\"event\\" at the end in Coney island easier to see  ;-)
0452289963|5.0|Widowed, depressed, jobless and didn't know what to do with myself; I stumbled across Oprah's website and found out about this book.  What drew me in was the subtitle \\"Awakening to Your Life's Purpose\\".  Every job I've ever had I've hated. I need a job, but I don't want one! I have very few reliable friends, and too many unreliable one's.  Even my immediate family seems like a huge disappointment.  What was I to do?     I literally felt as if I was going mad, and my life was over at age 42.    The simplicity of thought in this book seems widely criticized.  However, I will tell you it is this simple mindset that saved my life, snapped me out of my depression, and got me interested in exploring the world again.      I can't say that I have \\"found my life's purpose\\", as I'm now convinced it's undefinable.  But, I am no longer \\"as\\" concerned about what ifs and what could have been.  The simple presence of \\"Now\\", answers each and every moment when I dare to question my life's purpose.  I'm not saying I've got it, and it never slips away.  I'm saying, that when I remember to notice \\"Now\\", I remember that I don't need to foretell the future.  And I don't need to worry about the past.  I try to remember \\"Now\\" as often as possible.    The only trouble with the thoughts and methods outlined in the text is that it is apparently too simple to grasp affectively.  I've heard and read so many comments trying to complicate it's message.  Trying to turn the book into a study group, or a philosophy in and of itself.  Even what Oprah is doing is a bit out of context with what the book is about.  This is a book review, not an Oprah review, but I have to say that Oprah's ego was awakening to my ego on more than one occasion.  I really don't care if Oprah \\"gets it\\" or not.  Please, can we just let Eckhart talk about the book!    Anyway, I'm not going to pretend that I have any more insight than anyone else.  But, this book is well worth a read to find out if it rings true for you.  It may end up that you don't like it, and you wasted your money; as it has for so many others.  But if resonates for you, it has the potential to change your entire outlook on life.  For the better I'd say.
B0010X745K|5.0|My g/f and I LOVED this movie.  The best horror/suspense movie I've seen in many years. Well acted, rich characters, good special effects. And a ballsy ending that Stephen King even said he liked better than his own. A testimonial like that says it all.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|Stone Cold is a great find because Tom Selleck is one of our favorite actors and we own the entire Magnum PI collection. In this series a more mature but still incredibly handsome Tom Selleck plays the character of the Chief of Police of a small New England town called Paradise, Massachusetts.    Jesse Stone is a former Los Angeles homicide detective who left life in the big city and is now underemployed, but still doing service to the community, which he loves. He divorced the \\"only woman he is able to love\\" and in each of the movies, for we now own three, he has relationships with rather sophisticated and interesting women, such as the attorney played here by Mimi Rogers.    While life in Paradise is slow and for the most part the Chief of Police only gives out traffic or parking tickets, a series of murders take place, and in this episode a high school girl is raped and we see the Chief of Police solving murders, and protecting the young girl, allowing her father to \\"extract\\" vengeance in ways that we simply cheered.    Don't miss it, the pace is slow but introspective, the plot is deep and intelligent, and you are left with feeling admiration for a man that has done wrong things while always attempting to do what is right!
159102594X|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, currently waiting to receive the follow-up.  Nicely written for a debut novel
B000TGCR38|5.0|World War II movies never cease to capture our interest as they demonstrate the worst of man-kind and this movie is simply riveting. Black Book is about a woman forced to live the horror of seeing her entire family murdered and yet continue to struggle for life and survival in Nazi occupied Holland.    At the beginning of the film we see Rachel Stein, beautifully played by Carise Von Houten, our heroin, living with a gentile family on a farm. An allied force plane unloads its bombs to gain altitude and by mistake they destroy her refuge. This forces her to start a journey to The Hague, and she visits her family's attorney who disburses money and jewels that will help her survive for at least a year.    Unfortunately, a group of Jews she joins is part of a Nazi ambush, and she witnesses the death of her entire family as the Gestapo not only kills but then steals all the possessions of the victims. She does get the chance to see the face of the man in charge... something she shall never forget.    To cover her true identity she transforms into a blonde singer by the name of Ellis de Vries and infiltrates Gestapo headquarters as part of the resistance force.    The film has many cliffhangers and on a train ride, with the Gestapo requesting papers from all passengers, she shares the cabin with the head of the SS, Captain Müntze, superbly played by Sebastian Koch, and he soon falls for her lively beauty. Many spell binding situations unfold and we realize that there must be a traitor amongst the resistance because they are uncovered at every turn, but we never know the true identity of the traitor. The story is complex but a clear reminder of the danger of war. Don't miss this film; it is without a doubt... magnificent!
B000F5FNSE|5.0|I love the Greek Mythology It's a great change from fairy stories. Its a diffrent kind of magic. I have read all the books in this series except the 4th book I still getting to that one.
B0013L2EDQ|1.0|I have read every James Rollin's book and only ask why this. This bio-thriller is a mix of impossible surrounded with absurd with poor dialogue. The premise of a super virus transmuting bacteria is a real possibility in this world but it could stand on it's own. It did not need a James Bond Sigma Force with almost every page superhuman efforts. I quit reading after 291 pages-that is how bad this book was written.
B000JBWWQ0|2.0|the book went into great detail and the movie just kind of skimmed through almost as if it was expecting i had read the book. had i not read the book first, i wouldnt know how great the story truely is. READ THE BOOK, its excellent
B000641ZA4|5.0|\\"The Video Show\\" is a collection of Genesis music videos from \\"Trick of the Tail\\" (1976), through the Phil Collins and Ray Wilson eras all the way to \\"The Carpet Crawlers 1999\\", which featured the reunited classic lineup. There's no concert footage from the Peter Gabriel era or anything (1969-1975), which is a shame. (unless you include the tiny pieces used in \\"The Carpet Crawlers 1999\\"). I'd really like to see some of that Peter Gabriel footage, and I think there is a DVD or two on amazon.com that contains some, I'll have to check them out...    I'm a fan of both Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins eras (not so much Ray Wilson) and I really enjoyed the music.  The videos were an interesting look into the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, with all the various styles, budgets and locations (I love the brown urban locations in the \\"Keep it Dark\\" video). The 1970s stuff shows a bit more of their theatrical side with videos like \\"Robbery Assault and Battery\\", but its the 1980s stuff where you see a bit more of the bands personality. (The goofing around in \\"Invsible Touch\\", the concert behind the scenes of \\"Throwing it All Away\\", for instance.) There's a bit of silly character acting too, be it pretend Mexicans in \\"Illegal Alien\\", or the hypocritical televangelists in \\"Jesus He Knows Me\\" or Phil Collins slightly sleazy role as the main character in \\"I Can't Dance\\".     A good deal of the videos features the guys performing on a stage or in a studio or something, which I don't really mind as it's interesting to see how they play the tunes (especially Tony Banks multi-keyboard work, my favourite one to watch him in being \\"Robbery Assault and Battery\\".) If it had been another band, these \\"performances\\" might not have been so interesting to watch.    The menus of the songs are arranged like stacks of singles which you go down using the remote, which I thought was a nice touch. Don't think there are any Easter Eggs on here.  When you press the enter button just before the videos start though, you get a bit of information on each single, which is nice.    Recommended for music video collectors. I think the \\"Land of Confusion\\" video clip, with it's puppets and silliness, is an essential. Benny Hill fans might also get a kick out of this, as the British comedian stars in the \\"Anything She Does\\" video as one of the Genesis tour's security guards.
B000FP2OPY|4.0|First, I must note that I love TV shows like Smallville, Buffy, Charmed, & X-Files. So naturally Supernatural definitely falls into that genre so I figured I would give it a try. I think this is a good show but not great like Smallville which is my favorite. The acting is fine. Actually, I think the character's have very good chemistry, also like the classic rock music, muscle cars, & the beautiful cast. So what I don't care for is this show is lacking in suspense & storylines aren't as good as a show like Smallville. The storylines can be better for each episode.  Good news is it's very watchable & I hear that Supernatural gets better in Seasons 2&3.  So I am going watch all those seasons first then come to a final conclusion of what I think of this show overall. This is only a review for teh first season.
B000HEVZ8K|4.0|I've avoided this movie for years, but I was plasantly surprised when I finally viewed it. Most people talk about the complexity of John Wayne's character, but I disagree.  I feel he wasn't complex at all.... just a cut and dried racist.  Near the end of the movie he did become a little complex, but I think it was just a matter of conscience.  What I really liked about the movie was the storyline and the scenery.  ONe of my favorite movies is The Color Purple and there were scenes in The Searchers that I'm almost certain Speilberg had to have copied for the Color Purple.  Especially the shot of the family on the porch at the beginning of the movie. It was so reminiscent of one of the final scenes in the Color Purple.
B0013J9KOO|4.0|More than any movie since Pan's Labyrinth, Hellboy II is a visual feast.  Thanks to director Del Toro's vast imagination, there's so much to take in that the only way to view this film properly is to see it in the theater and then again when it comes out on DVD.  Spectacular scenes like the Troll Market scene simply demand repeat viewings.  And there are just SO many other cool things to enjoy - the spectral Dr. Krauss with his containment suit, the tooth fairies, the forest elemental, and more!  Additionally, although the visual aspect of Hellboy II is the main reason to see it, there is pretty good story in there - fantasy, humor, romance, etc.  (Major spoiler alert!) To me, the only real weak element was the whole \\"I have something to tell you...\\" way that the pregnancy news was handled.  The fact that there was an interruption every time the news was about to be shared was something that's been done before the same way roughly ten thousand times?  But that was fairly minor, and it was more than compensated by the way a Barry Manilow song was used, plus some of Hellboy's one liner's (several of the best ones are unfortunately given away in the trailer), and the romance between the princess and \\"Blue.\\"  [By the way, that's fun too, the nicknames \\"Red\\" and \\"Blue\\" for two of the heroes.]
B000YABYLA|4.0|Although I don't think her performance was quite Oscar material, the movie was good and the acting was good, and I would recommend it.
B00003CXAA|4.0|Parts 1 & 2 rate a full 5 stars. Part 3 not as good in comparison, give it 3 stars. Still recommend the bundle. Goodfella's is still my fave ganster flick, though.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|John Adams (HBO Miniseries) is an excellent series.  It is not only informative but entertaining.  Very well done!
B000KFTWIG|5.0|Unless you were way too young to remember or not even born during the time, the years around 1994 were the best for hip-hop. Alongside [[ASIN:B0000029GA Illmatic]], [[ASIN:B000002WPI Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)]], [[ASIN:B000002WR5 The Infamous]] and many more, we also had the debut from the short lived Christopher Wallace. Whether you like to call him The Notorious B.I.G., Biggie Smalls, or whatever he's remembered by, he was one of the biggest standouts from 1994 until his tragic and untimely death in March 1997. \\"Ready To Die\\" is the debut album, and what an incredible album it is.<br /><br />Lyricism and flow are what made Biggie who he was. His flow is deep yet mixed well enough to stand out. The lyrical content is based on the rough life he experienced and he is able to form a loose concept about how he grew up with drug dealing to make it through, suicidal thoughts, and finally making it to the top. The rhymes are easy to understand yet far from dumbed down.<br /><br />The production is great, even though the album is not something to admire just because of that. Sean Combs and Easy Mo Bee handle the beats perfectly, in which they enhance the lyrics. However, there are exceptions, with the DJ Premier produced \\"Unbelievable\\" and the Lord Finesse produced \\"Suicidal Thoughts\\".<br /><br />The guest spots are extremely minimal, only limited to Method Man on \\"The What\\". It's really pleasant to hear Johnny Blaze's dark hook laden voice collaborating with Biggie's voice.<br /><br />This album isn't considered a top album by many for nothing. If you want to hear a departed legend at his peak, this is the album for you. If you want quality hip-hop, this is for you. Even for an album that is not completely underground, this is classic and there are very few albums that can dethrone it.
B00004Y6NP|5.0|What can I say?  This \\"album\\" came out when my oldest child was born.  I had been on total bedrest for two months at a University Hospital.  The baby was still born three months early, but survived.  While he was still in the hospital, but I had been released, there was an oldies concert in the town where he was born which we attended.  While the crew was setting up the equipment, the music from \\"Brothers in Arms\\" was blaring from the loudspeaker.  I consider this collection of great eighties music to be my freedom album:  freedom from bedrest (even though I did that willingly to have a child,) freedom from infertility and the freedom to still be \\"cool\\" at 30, despite the 60's adage:  \\"Never trust anyone over 30!\\"  I was at a dinner party once, and a man said he thought Dire Straits were the Beatles of the 80's.  While I wouldn't go that far, I do feel that \\"Money for Nothing\\" is the Anthem of the 80's and the first three songs on the CD were among the best of that decade.  The later songs are good too; a bit more mellow than the first.  Overall, a great collection of songs is found in this (now) small  package.
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|Her Best recording Since the Giorgio Moroder Years (1974-1980).<br />Good News No Timbaland around,<br />Madonna can go swallow again her Lollipops.
B0015519VS|5.0|every song on this cd is great and i think most would love it too!!
0711225176|5.0|I concur with everyone else's opinion on this book and want to add what a great value this is for the money.  All the reproductions are beautiful.  As someone else has said, the book has a fine text and it also shows the breadth of Mucha's work showing sculpture and sketches as well as his famous posters.  This book is jam packed with the best of Mucha and I can't recommend it highly enough for true Mucha fans.  I sometimes cut up books like this for framing, but there are TOO MANY great pictures to separate them.  A marvelous vision of all of his life's work with many hard to find reproductions.
0440243661|5.0|As you'll begin to see by the books I review here, I have very eclectic taste in books. Some might think the Reacher books by Lee Child are more suited to a male audience, but, hey, this is the era of the kickass girl.<br /><br />As a woman who took karate in Okinawa (decades ago before that was a common thing) with an Army tank of a sensei, I like to think I fit the kickass paradigm. I wholeheartedly enjoy these books so read on. You may find you enjoy them too.<br /><br />If you've ever watched The Unit starring Dennis Haysbert then it's not a great stretch to imagine if The Unit personnel retired and wrote books, the books would be pretty much like a Jack Reacher novel.<br /><br />In Bad Luck and Trouble, members of Reacher's Special Investigators are being killed. The other members ride to the rescue. Reacher and his former team members, notably Frances Neagley whose picture probably resides next to the word kickass in the dictionary, set about making things right and making those responsible pay.<br /><br />I won't give away any spoilers because it really is a neat action book, but with surprisingly mild language from these characters. The action melds well with a mathematical savant element of Reacher's personality. Plus, Lee Child actually writes a good love scene for a male author. Kudos to Mr. Child.<br /><br />All in all, it's like a very good read with buddy humor, good characters, nice suspense, a little shocking violence, and a really good, smart payback.<br /><br />The book made the rounds of my family. Read it, and you too will be waiting for the next Jack Reacher novel from Lee Child.
B000UJ48UO|4.0|Just like the original. Just what i expected. this is the one with the better features GET THIS VERSION. the Hi-Def on older movies is a tough thing to get looking and sounding good. they did pretty good with this one.
B0017I1FO4|5.0|I have been waiting for Shinedown to come out with a new CD since Us And Them. The sound has changed a little bit, but Brett Smith is one of the best lead singers out there today. The guitars are great and I disagree with the person who gave them a 3 the guitars do not go too fast and actually I like the sound they have. Especially on What A Shame it reminds me a lot of Turn The Page the version done by Metallica. There are a few slower sngs on the CD and they are great especially the ending with Breaking Inside and Call Me. It was definitely worth the wait because overall this is a great CD and none of the songs disappoint in fact I don't think I've been disappointed with any of their songs even on Leave A Whisper and Us And Them.
1416550518|5.0|Wonderful book, one of best I've read.  I look forward to her next book, which I have preordered.  Fine crafting of characters, plot, twist at the end.  I loved it.
B000LW7UR8|5.0|Placebo is a very distinctive band becuase the lead singer's voice is very unique. Not like anyone else right now in Rock. The best songs on the cd are Meds, Infra-Red, Follow The Cops Back Home, and Post Blue. At first I wasn't impressed to much with the cd, but Placebo is the type of band that you have to listen too more then once to appreciate them. Placebo is definitely a good band and I definitely recommend the CD.
0780622553|5.0|I remember waffling something fierce on whether to see this movie. The movie trailer said, \\"go for it,\\" but the premise said, \\"dull dull dull.\\" I'm not someone who gets enthralled by murder mysteries. Murders are mundane and can happen anywhere, and unfortunately in real life too. I rather enjoy seeing things that you don't normally run across. At long last, I finally buckled and went with my gut instinct over the visual cues from the trailer, and I guess the rest is history.    I was captivated by the scenery instantly as well as the quirk of the characters. Keifer's agitated speech delivery made me nervous and excited. When the story unraveled into what it actually was, I was hands-down sold.
B000EBEHR2|5.0|Placebo is one of those bands that you have to listen to more than once to appreciate them. At first I didn't really like them at all, but then I listened to it more and more and found that I really enjoyed their music. The best songs on the cd are Follow The Cops Back Home, Meds, Infra-Red, and Post Blue. They have interesting lyrics and overall they are a good band. The CD is definitely worth getting just becareful when reviewing I accidentally reviewed the extra track CD which I don't have.
B0014I4KIK|5.0|Duffy's CD, \\"Rockferry\\" is an instant classic. Several people had mentioned her to me but I had no reaction. I then ordered a copy from Amazon because it was CHEAP! Well, once received, we kept hitting repeat play. For anyone who loves that 60's sound (Dusty Springfield type orchestrations abound!) they'll love this CD. Duffy has a unique sound that should propel her to super-stardom if only someone will give this woman some corporate support and LOTS of radio play. I'd hate to see her fall through the cracks........SHE'S TOO GOOD FOR THAT! EXCELLENT!!!!!!
B00005JMYI|4.0|I had caught this film on pay cable when it came on in 2005.    Surprised me I liked it.      At the time of release, it was original idea for a film I thought.    It is the ONLY Will Ferrell film I like where he is the lead character.    Now of course EVERY ear he does a similar film like all the sports films basketball, NASCAR & ice skating where this good Anchorman idea keeps being repeated.     The cast were perfect in their roles.  Did NOT need Luke Wilson though.  Unnecessary.  And, I do NOT like the Wilson brothers.    Now, the DVD package it's.    I expected more since it is a \\"Unrated, Uncut, & Uncalled For!\\".    1.  Has those HORRIBLE little flaps tat are a pain & terrible to have to open up.  2.  NO chapter search list or any information on the film inside.    Good soundtrack for the film

B000WGWQG8|5.0|Appropriately, the HBO mini-series portrays John Adams in a positive light.  He was responsible for critical decisions such as naming George Washington to lead the continental army and to stay out of war against the French and British during his presidency.    The minor historical inaccuracies do not detract from the story.  The mini-series speculates on the role that Abigail Adams played in her husband's decision making.  Clearly she was a bright and incisive political thinker.    One of the most interesting features of the film is the raproachment between Jefferson and Adams.  The mini-series should be required viewing for all those in politics today.

B0013FDM7E|4.0|Will Smith stars yet again in another film where he battles animated creatures.  First it was runaway robots in \\"I Robot.\\"  Now, it's super strong mutants, products of a cancer treatment gone horribly wrong.  The bald mutants look very similar to the robots.<br /><br />  \\"I Am Legend\\" is a remake of a remake.  The original is \\"The Last Man on Earth.\\"  Made in the sixties, this film most closely resembles the novel on which it was based:  Richard Matheson's  \\"I Am Legend.\\"  An airborne virus kills most of the human population which return as zombie-like vampires.  Vincent Price is Dr. Neville who's lost his family to the virus and searches for a cure while killing vampires in London.<br /><br />  In the early seventies, Charlton Heston reprises the role as Dr. Neville in \\"The Omega Man.\\"  Living in Las Angeles, he also searches for a cure while killing the mutants.  Those who do not die from the germ warfare are turned into psychotic albinos who are afraid of the light.<br /><br />  Of the three movie, \\"The Omega Man\\" is superior because it has the most realistic plot and the better characterization.  The mutants are three-dimensional humans; they are not cartoon characters.  Neville has more interaction with the unaffected survivors, especially one female played by feisty Rosalind Cash.  There are also more twists and turns.  It has a delicious, downbeat ending that leaves us with a faint ray of hope for mankind.<br /><br />  In \\"I Am Legend,\\" Will Smith is basically a one man show; it is him versus the cartoon characters.  The interaction between him and the dog is touching and very emotional.  However, I felt more sympathy with Vincent Price's Neville who watched his family slowly die of the plague.  He even encountered his wife's return as a vampire.<br /><br />  Overall, \\"I Am Legend\\" is entertaining and suspenseful.  However, it is a disappointment for fans of the far more superior \\"Omega Man.\\"  I strongly suggest that, if you liked \\"I Am Legend,\\" you obtain a copy of \\"The Omega Man.\\"  You may enjoy it more.  If you are a fan of classic horror and/or Vincent Price, search out a copy of \\"The Last Man on Earth.\\"You may enjoy it more.  If you are a fan of classic horror and/or Vincent Price, search out a copy of \\"The Last Man on Earth.\\"
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This is great entertainment, and also really shows off what a Blu-Ray player in an HDMI environment can do. The picture and sound are simply stunning. I am in awe of what it must have taken to capture, edit, and produce this series.
B000TNF7OC|4.0|Phenomenon is a great listen. The strange thing about this album is that I feel Doctor, Doctor and Rock Bottom are 2 of the lesser songs(Rock Bottom less so). This is most likely due to how often I hear them and how great Rock Bottom is on Strangers In The Night. This CD is full of many other gems and unlike No Heavy Petting, does not weaken in the second half. Time On My Hands was always one of my favorites.    I found the extra tracks to be great but there are a couple of things that bother me:  1) Why not include the other Dave Edmunds produced tracks? According to the liner notes, there are other tracks that I am sure people would love to hear including another original - Rock N Roll Car  2) Why is Oh My (bonus version) partially credited to Michael Schenker when he was not in the band yet according to the liner notes. I can believe he had an influence on the final version though.  While on the subject, if one believes the liner notes, that an early version of Doctor, Doctor was recorded with Bernie Marsden (albeit with a different title and lyrics), why is he not given credit? and as stated above, why not included. Raw demos are often quite enjoyable    I already had the German bonus tracks so I really got this re-release because of Sixteen and Oh My (bonus). I really like the alternate version of Oh My.    The booklet included is great. The liner notes are very informative and I especially love the pictures of UFO with Bernie Marsden and Paul Chapman as the 2nd guitarist. I also found the Sounds review in the booklet amusing since it called the first two tracks awful - they happen to be favorites of mine.

0525950079|1.0|I came as far as 400 pages and then I stopped reading the book. It was just to similar to POTE. What was most annoying though were the frequent sexual references in the book. It appears that Follett's imagination of the middle ages is that everybody was horny and just continuously looking for sexual gratification. The other annoying item was the authors obvious dislike of the Christian religion. Pretty much every stereotype was checked off: Gay priests/monks, lesbian nuns, womanizing bishops, ignorant church people. You even get a feminist 'hero' who performs an abortion on herself. The book was gripping for a while but after some time the storyline became boring. Building a cathedral is just so much more interesting than building a bridge. Anyway, I regret having bought the book.
0393327345|3.0|This was my first Chuck Palahniuk.  Though I've heard a lot about his novels, as well as the film adaptation of Fight Club, I've been wary of his dark, nihilistic outlook.  After completing Fight Club, I must acknowledge Palahniuks's shock value, yet I'm not convinced that he is the great novelist many portray him to be, nor am I very sympathetic toward this mean-spirited rant against modern civilization.<br /><br />In the Afterward, Palaniuk recounts how Chapter Six of Fight Club was orginally published as a short story.  The novel, it turns out, was simply built open the shocking premise of this Chapter Six, resulting in a thinly plotted, repetitive rant that amplifies the short story from which it was born.  (I hope never again to see in print the ubiquitous phrase, \\"The first rule about Fight Club is you don't talk about fight club.\\")<br /><br />Told from the first-person perspective of an insomniac whose professional and personal malaise is pushing him toward the brink of madness, this novel is brimming with shocking anecdotes, recipes for making homemade explosives and other tools for the weekend anarchist, along with the larger-than-life antics of Tyler Durden, the founder of a secret underground fight club that morphs into a grass roots cult of anarchy.<br /><br />If this premise appeals to you (and you're a sucker for the mind-bending plot twist), you'll probably appreciate this book.  If not, you might want to seek out something more life-affirming for your entertainment.

0446677450|3.0|Rich Dad Poor Dad became a best seller as a result of either introducing or reminding the masses of basic financial principals.  The storyline is presented in a manner describing this advice from both a successful father figure with little schooling but ample street smarts, and a less successful father with an abundance of education but little financial sense.  Given that only a small sector of society generally finds interest among dry financial books, the writing style undoubtedly also had a lot of influence on the success of this book.<br /><br />Kiyosaki provides an adequate overview of assets versus liabilities and in depth explanation as to why assets with earning capacity are true assets while others that cost money to sustain (such as your home) are not.  However, the message could have been given proper justice in a brief essay as opposed to a best selling book.  The principle at heart, while true to the bone, is nothing more than what one would arrive at with a simple understanding of bookkeeping and common sense.  Kiyosaki provides a lot of clich&eacute; with a story about his two Dads to attempt to add depth to the book, but otherwise the book provides little insight except perhaps to those with limited financial aptitude.<br /><br />Kiyosaki is certainly a master marketer and undoubtedly made millions by marketing his books, so perhaps if there is a silver lining to the book it is that one might discover the genius behind how to market a book by reading Kiyosaki.  Otherwise, look to the cliff notes on this book and save your time and money for a book that offers a more comprehensive study on finance.
1577314808|5.0|I read this book at a time when I was absolutely delusional. I'm so glad that I suffered through all my neurotic BS for years and years, because if I had been content with what most people consider to be a good life I would have never awakened. Now that I'm beginning to deepen my understanding I thought I'd throw this review up for others to read.     I see how important it is for me to put this out there because nothing matters more than realizing the truth....not accepting some dogma which most people have done and continue to live with their filters which limit their ability to live in reality. Nothing matters more than this (not this book, but what the book may be able to bring about inside yourself); not money, fame, sex/any other shallow pleasure, your ambitions, past, not your family/relationships (not saying they aren't important...but ultimately relationships can be a hindrance if you are ignorant of the nature of their essence), and no idea of happiness or love that the majority of the humans on this planet buy into will make your life meaningful. All of these things may bring you some feeling of importance and acceptance...some pleasure....these pale in comparison to being able to live in wonder, with REAL joy and love.     I had thought I knew what love was....I do now, and I know that most people aren't able to love....but we all have potential. I now know what bliss is...can you feel bliss from owning a big house or landing a lucrative career....can you feel love for everything by \\"becoming\\" an educated person with a nice office where you can display how great and smart you are, lining the walls with diplomas, certificates and awards? Will that person (or people) whom you long after completely fulfill you once your long thought out relationship plan comes to fruition? If you reflect on what you have wanted in the past and thought about obtaining and realize that it didn't fulfill you...it might have made you excited and anxious thinking about how greatit would be once you got it...but then you get that thing and you loose interest in it...you look for something else you can think about obtaining, and the cycle just keeps you in this confused state of distraction from what is truly significant in life...the ONLY thing which is available to EVERYONE.     I could say the present moment is all there is and how great it is and how everything else is an illusion and give you a logical basis which can't be refuted....but don't take my word for it...find out yourself. Do you know what a spider is?....when you asked \\"what's that\\" pointing to a \\"spider\\" your Dad might have said...\\"oh, that's a spider\\"; so now you can't see the spider, tree, birds or flowers because all you see is their labels. This gets so deep (I haven't fully realized the depth...each day is astonishingly new and insightful) and I want to share this with everyone...and you will too if you realize how trite the \\"American dream\\" is.     You can go to school, get a good job, be in happy relationships and buy nice things AND realize that there is more to life....but please do yourself (and the rest of us) a favor and find out what is truly meaningful before you accept that your secure and highly planned out path to successful happiness with all your beliefs, ideas and opinions will hold water. I'm not saying drop your dreams, I'm saying find out what it is that you DO HAVE...that you always have...that you will always have...because you will never have anything else (speaking in the absolute). I hope you find out for yourself and maybe you can help others find out as well...there is nothing better you can do with your life than help someone find out.

Please do yourself a favor and read this book with an open mind. Notice your reactions to what is written...look inside yourself to see if there is anything substantial to this book...look past the book and author and look into yourself....you can find out what it means to be alive...most people are dead...and you'll see that if you can find truth in this book (...it's by no means limited to this book or any book...but this can help). I hope you find out...and if you do, please help others....there is nothing you can do that is more important than helping another awaken.
B0000UJDLM|4.0|This is such a cute and funny movie and I am sure the new movie out in theaters now is a spin of this original. The humor based upon familiar colloquialisms is sprinkled throughout and is delightful. This is clean adult humor, playing off the sayings we have heard and used for years.

The formerly GI-destroyer robot develops a relationship with Ally Sheedy and demonstrates he is more than the sum of his parts - he is \\"alive\\". Good for the family to enjoy.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|The John Adams Mini Series on DVD is well worth the hours it takes to view the whole set. The screenplay is based on David McCullough's biography of John Adams. Both the book and the mini-series take their audiences back in time through the hearts and minds of John and Abigail Adams. The experience is inspiring and exhausting. The family is as dysfunctional as it is exemplary, as reasonable as it is exasperating, as visionary as it is blind-sighted. A democracy in Iraq does not seem impossible after watching the characters and circumstances responsible for the formation of American democracy. John Adams is cinema at its best. It represents the past so well that it inspires hope for the future. What is the price of liberty? John Adams gives an answer.
B00000JSJC|5.0|Hadn't seen this film in forever. Saw it a couple times when it came out. Just watched it again today. Wow! I totally forgot how amazing it was.<br />It's still relevant and a work of art today. I haven't seen anything like it since it came out in '95.<br /><br />The idea of virtual reality that you can plug into by use of a SQUID, an electronic cap with electrodes to electrically stimulate and manipulate your brain. The use of floppy disks, yeah, okay, it was '95. The use of a big ole box like the old cable boxes from yore? yah. Ok. The idea of people getting sucked into spending more time with electronic devices than living real life? Right on. Then and now. Yeah, there are internet/techno junkies. Near catatonia and zoned out. Subjective. The idea that electronics/games can get the best of you, and bring out the worst? Too much of anything's not good. People too game. Bound for perversion. Gamer is played out. Another consumer consumed? Yeah. Pushing limits to pushing daisies.<br /><br />Some other movies popped into mind when watching this film again. [[ASIN:0783228457 Videodrome]]. [[ASIN:B000BBOUW2 8MM]]. Blue Velvet. Sean Penn's [[ASIN:B000069HZP The Game]]. And then there's the Vincent D'Onofrio [[ASIN:B00003CXKM The Cell (New Line Platinum Series)]].  In 8mm, Joaquin Phoenix's character Max California warns Nick Cage's Tom Welles, 'When you dance with the devil, you don't change the devil, the devil changes you.'<br /><br />All visually appealing films, often with more than 1 superstar. Strange Days, no doubt, a title ode to The Doors song, includes many superstars. Michael Wincott is Philo, who starred in the 1991 Val Kilmer, movie about 60's rock legends \\"The Doors\\".<br /><br />In this regard, Strange Days opened many doors of mayhem. Pandora's Box, no less. Sex, drugs, rock and roll, techno, love, good, evil, etc.<br /><br />People \\"just trying to survive. Making a run for it, if need be.<br /><br />When Ms. Bassett got down to Earth running through the crowds reveling in NY's merriment, she kicked off her heels and got real practical, like any  woman would. While there are elements of horror and the perverted, skidrow elements too, you also see fist fighting women, and women tag-teaming for their men. So it was no surprise when Mace hitched up her glam black gown all sequins and strapless, and shoved her pistol in her thigh garter; or when she flipped off those heels and sprinted like Wilma Rudolph. She was not about to get shot in the back a la android stripper Zhora (the whore-a?) (Joanna Cassidy) in Harrison Ford's 1982 [[ASIN:B000UD0ESA Blade Runner - The Final Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]. A beautiful dead woman running and stumbling to her death, a pretty corpse replete with heels. Maybe chalk all this up to a woman director making heroic, capable, women of action. Can't imagine someone in law enforcement who couldn't at least kick off her heels and run to dodge bullets trailing her backside. (Last summer, Blade was re-released to millions of fans' delight, in major theatres so we could see it digital, big screen. The android getting shot in the back still resonates as one vicious scene, sex and violence in a slowmo death ballet.)<br /><br />Characters skirt the cusp of interracial romance between actress Angela Bassett and Ralph Fiennes. You wonder about the romantic tension, but film studios being as they are, the chemistry pops just the same between 2 people so that others feel it too, whether it takes place or not. At the end, unrequited love lets go of the past memories and lives in the now.<br /><br />Overlook the stereotypical 'tude/hard black woman Ms. Bassett had to play. She chills out over the course of the movie and viewers realize it's less the black woman 'tude than an under appreciated woman willing to do battle for the man she loves, and even help him win another woman if that's what it takes for his happiness. Oh, ...sacrificing women. Sign of true love when you're willing to give your all, a sign it's not love or even friendship if someone's willing to let you take a bullet, not have your back when it counts, and even throw you under the bus.<br /><br />The movie drops in the historical temperament of the '90s toward what was going on and wrong with the LAPD at that time. The riots of '92 in LA and elsewhere when the Rodney King vid hit the air (imagine Youtube igniting a firestorm back then). Strange Days is set in '99, but drops in a provocative scene of citizens versus police brutality by the LAPD. It does give credit to the good men in uniform who rise beyond corruption and are willing to police their own in the name of justice. The footage of the New Year's countdown for 2000, according to the credits was likely footage from New York Times Square. There was mention of Madrid. In this supercharged scene, Vincent D'Onofrio's police character seems more like a flashback of horrific evil from his [[ASIN:B000P0J09C Full Metal Jacket]] Days. The crowd is awe struck and nearly speechless as the monster drags his crime in partner forward, marching towards unspeakable evil. LAPD rise to the challenge. Strange Days precedes and perhaps sets the typecast for D'Onofrio's future on Law & Order. The quirky, weird guy with a heart, who maybe is on the good guy's side, but understands the demons in all, can draw it out by drawing on his own. Ever intense, check him out in [[ASIN:0780627849 Feeling Minnesota]] with ex gf Cameron Diaz and Keanu Reeves, in which he play typecast, another odd man out. But no blood, not much anyway, this time. Men in Black? A scifi flick but not so dark and dreary for Vinny.<br /><br />As refined as the Harvard alum is, her street cred didn't really pop with legit authenticity, but of course therein lies the distinguishing characteristic of someone with bigger plans than the circumstances under which they've found themselves anyway.<br /><br />All of the main characters, including Juliette Lewis (of \\"[[ASIN:0792846435 Kalifornia]],\\"  \\"[[ASIN:B0000542DH Natural Born Killers - Oliver Stone Collection]]\\", \\"Cape Fear\\" fame), Tom Sizemore (\\"[[ASIN:1558908242 Pulp Fiction]]\\"), intense actors in any film, sizzle and spark here.

0060589280|1.0|This is my second book by Paulo Coelho. I first read the Alchemist and I bought this book before I realized it was the same author. Based on reading these two books, I have to say that this guy writes as though his audience is young adults. The writing is flat and simplistic.  If you like reading YA books, then you might like this. Otherwise, don't bother.

B000UZQIDS|5.0|I read this book in one day from the kindle, I could not put it down.  It gives the true feelings of how Mr. Knightley felt about Emma.
B0013J9KOO|5.0|Outside of Ron Perlman's bravo performance as the title character, Hellboy, in the first film, what wowed me the most (as I stated in my previous Amazon review) was the deeply theological and emotional subtexts of that film. As much as I loved Ron Perlman's even more bravo performance in \\"The Golden Army\\", it took me a while to clue into the fact that some of the deepest subtexts in this second movie are a bit different than the first film.     I don't wish to indulge in any real spoilers this early in the game, but this new film has exchanged the theological subtext for a psychological one that is just as deep.     In the first film, the question was one of what made Hellboy a truly 'human' character. The answer was the right to choice based on free will. In this new film, the related question is whether or not Hellboy can ever truly fit in and should he even try. \\"The Golden Army\\", with the beneficial switch to Universal Pictures, makes a clever connection between Hellboy and Boris Karloff in \\"Bride of Frankenstein\\". Mr. Karloff's little cameo appearance as Frankenstein on one of Hellboy's many television sets in a significant scene with Elsa Lanchester as the titular Bride nails that subtext in just a few brief moments of film time in a way that a lot of surface action in the film never could have.    The father/son subtext of the first film is still here, but buried even more deeply as John Hurt's character of Hellboy's adoptive father, Trevor Bruttenholm, was murdered in the first film. We are reminded of his character by a cameo appearance of John Hurt as Trevor 'Broom' in a flashback to Hellboy's younger years; but hasn't anyone ever told Guillermo del Toro that, in the original comics, an eleven-year-old Hellboy would nowhere be as small as the character is portrayed in this flashback. In the original comics, once he get past ten years old, Hellboy is almost full grown physically, if not emotionally mature.     Yet, there is a further connection in the new film to that father/son subtext of the original film. It's too bad that it is one that will probably pass right over the heads of that portion of the audience who haven't see the first movie. In this second movie, both Hellboy and Prince Nuada are the sons of murdered fathers. Where the huge difference lies between these two characters is the identity of the villain who commited the murder.    Once again, we have a film of deep emotional, religious subtexts lurking under a fun, exciting, quip filled surface. Watch out for a drunken scene between Abe and Hellboy. I thought I'd die laughing; but it is those deeper subtexts that make me love Guillermo del Toro's \\"Hellboy\\" movies and I can't wait for the third installment.
B0019FOC5E|2.0|I have seen the stage musical more than a half dozen times.  I have loved ABBA music since the 70's and do to this day.  What is on this CD does an injustice to both.<br /><br />How anyone can give this soundtrack a 5 star rating is beyond me.  I can only assume they haven't listened to it.  Meryl Streep, one of my favourite actors, is bearly passable as a singer.  Pierce Brosnan... seriously, who told him he could sing?  Better yet, who HIRED him to sing???  \\"When All is Said and Done\\" is actually painful to listen to.<br /><br />I'm sorry, I had such wonderful anticipation for this soundtrack and film.  When I heard the casting, I was disappointed, but thought perhaps they all have hidden talents.  THEY DON'T!  I like pretty much all the actors in this movie; especially Meryl Streep and Colin Firth.  But I hope people aren't letting their love and respect for the acting abilities of the many stars of this film, cloud their judgement on just how awful the vocals truly are on this soundtrack.<br /><br />In their ill-advised box office grab to fill this film with as many big names as possible in lieu of getting actors who can actually sing, the producers may just have ruined the theatrical version of one of the most successful musicals in history.
0060775858|1.0|Im not sure if my daughter just has less of an attention span or wants to look at more interesting things but i found this a highly useless book.  The objects in the book were very small, on some pages they were in black and white and some of the things in the room arent very topical or relevant.  I tried reading to my daughter from this book.  she was happy to bang her hands on the book generally and try to turn the pages but the pictures werent in the least bit interesting to her and the lyrics didnt have much of a soothing effect either.  i find it hard to believe that america finds such a third rate book such a classic.
B000TGCR3I|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />\\"Tekkon Kinkreet\\" is a sporadically engaging, though frequently confusing, anime gangster film from director Michael Arias.  The story, based on the comic book by Taiyo Matsumoto, focuses on two homeless orphans, one named Black and the other White, who live on the streets of Treasure Town, a seething cauldron of criminality, vice and corruption.  Black fancies himself a superhero crime-fighter, while White, who is given to extrasensory knowledge and visions, dreams of one day moving away from the city and getting a home of their own on the beach.  Thanks to Black's insistence on taking on the bad guys, both youngsters get caught up in a turf war between the Yakuza and some robot-like killers who are duking it out for ownership of the city.<br /><br />Fans of anime will find much to enjoy in this film, which is marked by beautifully detailed urban landscapes, exciting action and chase sequences, occasional lyrical flights into fantasy, and a sometimes touching tale about commitment and friendship centered on the two young boys.  On the other hand, the plethora of characters and occasional narrative incoherence can make it difficult at times to understand what exactly is going on, particularly when the story takes a decidedly metaphysical turn (with imagery taken straight out of \\"Contact\\") in the final half hour.  Still, the visuals alone make it worth a gander.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|CHILDREN OF MEN is the most accurate cinematic view I've seen of a world that will soon, but has not yet fully come to pass. Society in advanced decay, massive social upheaval, fanatical xenophobia, extreme class segregation... what today we see just beginning to bud is depicted horrifyingly and in full fruition in CHILDREN OF MEN. There is no real hope for humanity when even those fighting to save civilization do all the wrong things for all the right reasons. The super rich sit in luxury above the fray, hoarding the great treasures of humanity's past glory, yet are themselves blighted by the fact that nothing of redemptive value remains in the world, even for those with the money to pay (this is what idiot Republican's and their wealthy overlords should have considered when they began to disslove economic equilibrium twenty years ago). This movie is very realistic, and those back from war with PTSD should probably avoid it... the rest of you should definitely face the future you have helped to create.
0802130208|4.0|\\"Confederacy\\" is among the most original and entertaining novels I have ever read. There is much that makes \\"Confederacy\\" unique: a wonderfully tight, complex yet `ripping` plot; phenomenal characters brilliantly portrayed; an unforgettable protagonist; and, crucially, a tremendous sense of humor. It was a complete surprise to me: I picked it up without knowing anything either about the novel or its (tragic)author. I was left with a memorable read and a sense of loss of a great talent.    One additional comment. I highly recommend also avoiding this Evergreen paperback edition. The material of the cover is very pretty and has a nice feel, but its also impossible to read the book without the cover getting completely bent over. Serious readers will find the US$ 8 dollars extra for the hardback edition available on Amazon a very worthwhile investment, particularly for such a timeless novel
B000WGWQG8|4.0|Enjoyed the miniseries even though I am not particularly a histoy buff.  Provided a great view of life in the late 1700s and early 1800s.
B0012Q732O|1.0|I think this movie has frustrated many people, including myself, with its misleading title. I picked it up hoping it would have some semblance to human history, and see how the director had visualized a time about twelve thousand years ago. This movie has nothing to do with history. I am not an expert but 12,000 ago years humans were in the stone age (at least accoring to wiki) - there were no metal spear heads, saber-tooth cats were nowhere as large as they are depicted. The geographic location is not clear - where they in Africa, or Europe? The characters seem racially diverse - how did such mingling happen so long ago? And there were definitely no large Egyptian-structures built that long ago.  Well, ok. So, you stretch your imagination - maybe a civilization did exist that got wiped out. But first the movie seems a rip-off of so many others - Gibson's Apocalypto foremost, a bit of Jurassic Park and some others. Then, the dialogs appear very discontinuous - maybe an amateur screenplay writer? And finally, the storyline is very weak - sometimes it makes you feel that the story was just made along.  The CGI animation was not too bad as some reviewers said - about the same standard as King Kong, but less slick. There is violence, but far less gore than apocalypto.  But no matter how you look at it, you feel like you wasted time watching this - so just avoid it.
0756404746|5.0|I read a lot of books. This is not the first book I have read where I found myself thinking \\" Okay I know what is going to happen.\\" This one of the few books where the author continued to prove me WRONG. I was surprised over and over again. Not only by plot twists, but with excellent foreshadowing that helped me jump to the wrong conclusion. It made me want to keep reading just to find out what is really going on. The biggest surprise was how good the book was. I hope that does not spoil the book for you.
B000EHRVP6|1.0|I really enjoyed Cabin Fever, which is partially what made Hostel such a letdown.  Hostel is a movie that revels in pure sadism.  It's not the first movie to do that sort of thing, but it does so in a way that is gratuitous and rather pointless, as though the writers and producers had lost interest in the plot and were trying to one-up each other to see who could come up with the grossest torture and nastiest injuries.  Atmosphere is not a problem in the movie, but the gore-for-the-sake-of-gore element that drives the movie renders it unfulfilling as a viewing experience.  The ending is also somewhat silly.  Overall, a ghastly movie full of rather grotesque tortures that really don't aim towards any greater contextual purpose except to show off the crew's vivid imaginations.  The film is not for those lacking strong constitutions.
B00177Y9ZC|5.0|i saw jumper in the theater and it was fun, so i got the dvd. the effects of jumping from place to place became disorienting on the big screen - this was much more enjoyable watching on a home video setup (large screen though it may be).    the scenery is great. maui, rome, egypt, london, new york - what a world. to be able to be anywhere anytime - brilliant.
B000YENUI6|3.0|I had a hard time understanding Eastern Promises.  If it wasn't the quiet mumbling that dominated the majority of the conversations, it was the shocking and disgusting segments involving gruesome deaths, blood, or other kinds of violence.  The build up in the beginning was extremely slow and uninteresting.  It's not a movie for everyone.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|bought this for my boyfriend who bikes to work everyday. he only brings with him his glasses, wallet and cell phone which makes this stow away pouch compact and  useful. If fits his car keys, house keys, glasses and its bulky case, cell phone and wallet. He uses it everytime he bikes. It's fits securely on the bike.
B000OQF6N6|2.0|I'm not a huge Smashing Pumpkins fan or anything but I did really like their first 4 albums.  Once they did Adore that's when they turned for the worst.  After the break up Zwan was pathetic and lifeless.  that band was never ment to go anywhere.  In 07 Billy decides to get a new Pumpkins band together with founding member Jimmy Chamberlin and two new people.  The result is a sloppy, weak mess.  This album only has a 2 good songs.  Doomsday Clock and Bring The Light.  Other then that the album is just straight up garbage.  Every other song sounds flat and stale.  I'm all about a band experimenting and trying new directions but this album really has no life to it.  If I want to listen to the Pumpkins it's going to be 1 of the first 4 albums.
B00003CWN3|5.0|Hillary Swank is such a fine actress. I would go to see anything she was in. This, along with \\"Million Dollar Baby\\" are her finest performances. She has made many other movies, all worth seeing. This movie is so penetrating. A gut wrenching ending. What more can I say?
B000006NUW|5.0|After visitng the Motown Museum, this complilation of hits was just what we needed for great memories.  Takes one back to their dancing days!
B0018QCXGY|4.0|I was initially put off by this film, as the critics compared it to Blair Witch, which I hated.  Anyhow when it appeared on DVD / Blu-Ray I read further reviews stating \\"If you enjoy films such as Godzilla, then you'll love this\\".  Having recently purchased a PS3 I bought this on Blu-Ray American, as it isn't yet available in the UK.    I loved every minute of it, if anything I just wish it was longer.  Some people didn't like the Shaky cam effect, but this didn't bother me at all, if anything I was even more absorbed by the film.  Great film that definately required repeat viewings.
0385522401|5.0|The book itself is rather small in stature but when the story started my attention was instantly saturated with powerful intensity for it. I found this novel to be quite extraordinary and read it in one sitting - right after having oysters for brunch; I left ready and pounced on it ferociously and enjoyed it until dusk arrived. This was my first time reading McEwan and I found his language, ideas and wording very easy to slip into. Some authors requite an adjustment, sometimes it feels like a change of latitude and climate, even gravity but not with Ian, it's hard for me to imagine anyone who's not curios about life that would not enjoy this.     It's a brief novel set in the 1960's, all I knew about it before I read it was that I spotted it on the New York Times Saturday Book Review ( my favorite)  bestsellers section and the simple mention of a wedding night going horribly wrong hooked me. This indeed was a mess slowly unraveling, making me read on nervously knowing that something ugly is about to perspire. The story starts of gently enough but pretty soon the reader gets a real glimpse of Florence, the young bride, and her revulsion of all things having to do with the secrets of the flesh. Even before she married Edward her love for him was warm and pleasant, almost maternal but a few hours after the wedding during their supper, being able to see the freshly made bed in the next room of their honeymoon suite was making her nauseous and fearful of disappointing her new husband with her true feelings concerning the dreaded wedding night.    The acting between Florence and Edward that takes place, the restrained talk and emotions when Edward can barely stand not pouncing on his bride while eating, the dance like charade skillfully played by almost petrified Florence and the glimpses back on how they met set up a heck of a story, the reader knows that things are about to go badly for both of them. Either the bride goes with the flow and makes the best of her situation or she offends Edward and shows him her true feelings. The energy generated by minimal dialogue, sensitive writing and skillful psychology made for an incredibly alluring and mesmerizing book. This isn't only about committing the act, it was more about human errs and not being true and honest with one self, trying to act according to the times and not engaging in close contact with your partner, not understanding who he is until marriage. One can easily see how this type of a scenario can make for hair rising fiction (even scarier, it was probably true back then).     Living in different times makes it easy for me to judge, through out the book I kept thinking \\"I would never do that\\" or \\" I can't even imagine feeling like this woman\\" but I still connected with her, feeling sorry for her and being angry at her at the same time. This is a treat not to be missed, skillfully written and well told, a story that truly feeds the soul.    - Kasia S.
B001676320|4.0|After much delay, this disc is finally released  so; what do we have.  Overall the concert is a great experience.  I thought the direction was outstanding, with some great shot choices and timing.  It is my understanding that the video was captured in 2004, which may explain why the occasional shot doesn't hold up to blu-ray full potential as to clarity.  Am going to assume that most buying this disc are fans of the bands, so you already know that both now contain a substantial percentage of non-original members.  One of the most fascinating aspects of the show to me is how well the bands mesh during their two sets together (both the opening and closing of the show).  It's a real treat and am sure you will like it.  It is during the separation that the differences become more stark.  EWF goes first, and the fact that most are hired guns aside, there is no question that EWF showcases superior musicianship.  The groves are intense, and the energy is omnipresent.  About the only oddity in the group is that Philip Bailey has placed his wife in the band, who in my opinion added nothing to an otherwise stellar lineup.  Bailey's voice truly delivers, including a beautiful showcase vocal solo.  The harmonies are there.  As to the musicianship, I assure you there are chops aplenty, but they never once clutter the grove.  It's just beautiful.  Then, Chicago take the stage, choosing to open with some fairly bland obscure material, which is especially stark given the immediate contrast to the remarkably powerful set they are following.  They do warm up as the set progresses, but in my opinion never equal the EWF show, though it's be no means a bad overall performance.  To their credit the percentage of original members is much higher.  While members from both bands \\"guest\\" during the other's solo set, I was hoping that each band would choose a tune from the other and do their own arrangement of it, but alas this was not to be.  I want to specifically discuss the mix, as in my experience that is something often overlooked in disc reviews, and it seems to me valid info for anyone investing in gear taking advantage of blu-ray capability.  I used the DTS HD Master Audio 5.1 mix for this review, played in a well equipped and balanced theatre setup.  The mix uses the rear speakers sparingly; I think a bit more of the crowd response would have been fun.  Once in awhile one of the instruments will show up there too.  The mix when the two bands are onstage together is wonderful, as is the mix of EWF.  However, Chicago's set, for no apparent reason, was rendered thin.  There is no reason why a band with two keyboardists shouldn't sound fuller, and at times the harmonies and the occasional string line seemed too far back in the mix.  Also, the toms were continually mixed far lower and out of balance than the rest of the drumkit, so quite a few of the drum riffs intended to add power were rendered weak.  On a positive note, I found the recording of the cymbals of both kits to be some of the most pristine capture I've heard on any disc.   Forget extra materials; there aren't any, save for a drum and percussion dual which might have been better served left in the concert itself rather than isolated.   Overall you will really like this disc, from both a visual and audio standpoint.  Can't go with five stars for the reasons listed, but it's a solid four star, and well worth a listen.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|The perfect series to bring the birth of a nation through its incubation period and to see how life really was in the 18th and early 19th century.
B0016Q56C4|4.0|Michael Weiss and the other creators of this redux of the Jules Verne classic posit that someone who actually made the trip to the center of the earth through a volcanic tube told the story to Verne. In short, Trevor Anderson (Fraser) is a struggling geologist who has been trying for ten years to prove his brother Max's theory that the Jules Verne tale is real.  Trevor's inherited project is about to be closed down when his sister in law brings his 13-year-old nephew, Sean, (Hutcherson) to stay for a couple of days.      Along with Sean's baggage is a box of Max's things, including his hand-annotated version of \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth.\\" Based on Max's notes, Trevor realizes that his brother actually was close to proving his theories before he disappeared. Coincidentally, the geological conditions are perfectly matched to those under which Max died.      This brings Trevor and Sean to Iceland, where Max was last seen.  They hire mountain guide, Hannah (Briem),  who was also the daughter of another Vernian, to take them up the mountain to one of Max's monitoring sites.    Through a freak accident, they end up falling through a cave down into the center of the earth.  Thus, their journey to return begins.  You will see elements of the threats from the original novel--in 3D if your theatre supports it.  Much of the film is a wild ride with vestiges of \\"Temple of Doom\\" style mine shafts and water slides that will leave you gasping.      The 3D effects are pretty stunning, which is probably the best part of the film with a few touching scenes included between Trevor and Sean.  Overall, seeing the remake was a satisfying experience intensified by the special effects.     Note:  Due to 3D, my theatre had a surcharge for the glasses which made the matinee price of the film close to $[...].      Warning:  Those with vertigo, migraines, seizures or other motion-triggered illnesses might want to use caution in seeing this film.    Rebecca Kyle, July 2008
B000WGWQG8|4.0|I enjoyed John Adams by HBO, I like history and I hope HBO's interpretation is close. I felt the actors and actresses did well and portrayed their parts fairly well. I noted what seemed a jump in time with the death of Abigail's daughter and the next scene where all of a sudden Abigail's hair is totally grey a lot of time seemed to have passed. Perhaps I missed something. I also was a bit stunned at the nudity in it. I hope they don't show it in schools. Finally the last cruncher was to see it for $20.00 less in Canada at Best Buy than I paid at Amazon. Up to now I've found Amazon prices the best and lowest and the delivery of the product ,the great way it's packaged,how fast I get it and the whole online experience has been superb.  Is it worth it?in the future?
B000W4D94I|4.0|This movie has been around for years but only when it came out on Blu-ray did it peak my interest.  Twister is a great mix of action, comedy, suspense, and just straight up corny-ness.  Its the kind of corny that you can't turn away from for some reason.  Almost like it was done that way on purpose.  The tornado scenes are fantastic!  The audio just begs to be played loud, and the picture just like most every blu-ray, is mind blowing.  To sum this up quickly because I must get going,  twister on blu-ray is a recommended addition to your blu-ray library.  If you watched it on DVD or even on VHS way back in the day, then  I suggest you revisit twister on blu-ray, and get twisted!
B0001Z53MY|5.0|Every audiophile and/or Elton John fan should have this.  To have what many consider Elton's masterpiece rendered in higher definition audio as well as a 5.1 mix is a real treat.  The mix is overall very well balanced and sounds wonderful!  I would have liked a bit more use of the 5.1 capability on \\"Funeral For A Friend\\", but that of course is up to personal taste.  The extras on this disc are terrific, which include some B side material as well as a great acoustic guitar oriented version of \\"Candle In The Wind\\".  There is also some great video interviews with producer and arrangers, including some great insight at a mixing console with the original master tape cued up.  If you don't have this in your collection, you are truly missing out.  Acquire it immediately.
B0017R5UAA|4.0|This album/ and group is truly unlike anything else I have heard.  Like another reviewer mentioned it feels like you are walking through a field in the morning during the middle ages.  While few songs are really catchy, if you take the band as it should be, a different melodic experience you won't regret the purchase.
B0017MO10U|3.0|It's not that Continuum is bad, it's just like you're watching a familiar, but much longer, episode that you've already seen.<br /><br />It's the SG-1 \\"old reliable\\" with time travel and parallel worlds. The exploration of Bahl's character is interesting, but doesn't really focus on the interesting questions. The movie sets up scenarios that aren't resolved to satisfaction. It's the usual, \\"hey, let's create an alternate reality where we can kill off everyone or make a good guy into a bad guy, because it'll all get changed back at the end!\\"<br /><br />I have always enjoyed the SG-1 series. But, I had to watch this movie in two sittings, because it dragged so much. Stargate fans deserved a little better than this reheated left-over.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|Seldom somebody has pulled off such a magnificent integrated marketing stunt as Mr. Al Gore with this \\"movie\\" (actually, it is a VERY long commercial for his associated business trading in CO2 \\"credits\\". Only rarely the true marketing character of this venture comes through, when snippets of 400 Million $ ad campaigns \\"to make people aware of global warming\\" flash trough the networks. The Gores always were savvy businessmen, be it father Gore with his Armand Hammer / Oxy ventures (oil business for those that are not aware), exploiting links to the communist block dating back to Uncle Joe days, or be it the son who has discovered that dealing in the ultimate derivative is the easiest way to make money (did he learn this from the federal reserve?). That the politicians like it is only natural: Al needs a lot of regulation to succeed in his venture, and he graciously has given a new life to ideas of even higher taxes, thought dead for some decades now..... So the entire elite wins.  [[ASIN:1897597320 Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds]]
0316143472|5.0|It's sort of a \\"no-win\\" situation to try to review an author like David Sedaris.  I ACHE to be as funny as he is, but sadly, it's just not there. The scenarios he describes are so familiar, and some of his observations are things that you might have thought, but could never articulate.<br /><br />The best thing I can say about his humor, (and that of his sister, Amy Sedaris; man, to be at their Thanksgiving table!) is that most of their humor is just WRONG, and that's what makes it soooo gosh darn fun!
0060512806|5.0|Neal Stephenson is a fantastic writer, and his skills truly shine in Cryptonomicon. Yes, it's a long book, but I suggest to all those who find fault with Stephenson's long-windedness that brevity is not somehow 'better' than verbosity, it's just different. Stephenson has carved his own niche in the continuum of writing-style, and, yes, it's in the Long-Winded-Land area of the spectrum. Is it a good style despite this? YES. Stephenson is incredibly deft with words, and the telling of his story is extremely effective. Cryptonomicon made me laugh, cry, and feel ill to my stomach at times (in a good way!). The dialogue is witty as usual for Stephenson, the plot is dense, multifarious, and fascinating, and the characters are well-developed. What more could you ask for? I recommend 'Cryptonomicon' to you, yes, YOU.
0446577391|5.0|I've never read Baldacci before but after reading this book I am super excited to read the rest of his work.  Stone Cold is a great page turner.  I actually found myself thinking of actors to play the characters in the book.  Baldacci paints perfect pictures without weighing the reader down in minute details.  Every page felt important.  The good guys are easy to root for, the bad guys easy to fear and root against.    You made it to this page considering purchasing this book, do it, you won't be disappointed.  Pick up Camel Club as well, it will help with character development, although not necessary because I started with this book.

B00008CHEX|5.0|I won't try to add comments about this work, it's simply a masterwork. There are a lot of editions of the recording. This is the japanese edition of the last edition appeared in Europe and USA. In this edition, you can find, in fact, three versions: the CD, stereo SACD and multichannel SACD. There have been some criticism about the CD version (loudness). Nevertheless, the stereo and multichannel SACD versions are fantastic. I bought this japanese edition to compare with the european one. I don't know why (best pressing plants?), this edition is superior to the european one. This happens very often in many japanese editions. Curiously the best remasterings are made in USA, but the edition of the same remastering made in Japan is usualy better (less harsh, more focused, more listenable).
B000RPTQ1C|4.0|Sorry Coldplay but this CD didn't (at least for me) live up to the hype. Way too different for my liking. I've heard this CD 5 times already and still only really like Viva la Vida and Violet Hill. I love everything on their previous 3 albums so I was very dissapointed. Guess I'll just have to wait and hope on their next album. Hope it doesn't take too long though.
B0015XASFS|5.0|So there I was surfing through the channels late one night at two in the morning.  Then I saw this young guy on PBS bellowing out sounds that can only be described as \\"Heavenly\\".  I absolutely had to watch the hour long edited concert in which I saw women go hopping crazy over this guy as he mesmerized them with his voice.  Make a long story short I now have all 4 of his albums and am eagerly waiting for his fifth.  His music resonates with me.  When I heard his music for the first time I felt like I had heard the song before, to the point where I could almost predict what happens next.  His music will give you tears to goosebumps and bring you a sense of euphoria. Listen and you will know.
159562015X|5.0|As I had mentioned in the previous post \\"The Matrix: Lessons in sales\\", I recently had something short of an epiphany while having a conversation with my boss. The conversation reminded me of the scene in The Matrix where Neo was sitting in the room with Morpheus for the first time. Walking away from the discussion I started really thinking about `who' I am at work and not so much with `what' I do at work. I've always been an overachiever but walked a line that kept me from being all I could be. I had a conversation with a friend of mine that pointed me in the direction of a book called  Strengths Finder 2.0. I ordered the book from Amazon and was eager to get the results.<br /><br />The book is based around an online test of approx 75-100 questions that took about 20-30 minutes for me to complete. The answers to the multiple choice questions were going to identify my top 5 talents and explain where my strengths are. Once the test was done the answers were calculated and the results were given to me.<br /><br />My Strengths<br /><br />  1. Achiever<br />  2. Maximizer<br />  3. Relator<br />  4. Focus<br />  5.

0316067601|5.0|I come from a long line of military veterans, and after reading this book, I have a whole lot more respect from them then I did.  The story is engaging and heart breaking all the while enlightening.  I have always had the utmost respect for the Armed Forces, but now it is unspeakable how much respect I have for them.  He details what he had to go through in SEALS training [BUD/S(getting wet and sandy)] so he could call himself a SEAL.  Then he explains the missions and what mistakes were made.  When I recounted the story at a recent family picnic to a few retired Marines, each of them said, should have killed the goat herders.  So I, in no doubt, believe that his is a true account of what happened, and my heart goes out to the author Marcus Luttrell and his fallen companions, as I believe what he said happened as he said it.
B000X1Z0BU|4.0|Once is about a guy who sings on the street of Dublin for change and otherwise he works at his dad's repair show for hoovers or vaccum cleaners. I'd like to remind you that Dublin is not known for it's street side singing and neither are folks who sing duets in trend. I like the actor's voice and I like how he subtly they show him showing off his art whether on the bus or on streets or simply near a pond. He meets this girl who was just walking by hearing him sing. Much taken by her art, she decides to play piano and add subtle vocals to his lonely melodies. The guy and girl together record their demo tapes and the jamming bit was just excellent. I like how much heart the guy carried and it is not a film to be forgotten and is somewhat of a class act in it's own right.<br />Similar films would include Darjeeling Limited and I don't know why I think it's very different at the same times. An easy 8/10.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I am very interested in American and Civil War history and a fan of McCullough so I was very intersted in seeing this miniseries.  I think HBO did an excellent job with the adaptation of McCullough's book.  The story is well acted, and the sets and dress are true to period and nicely researched.  I think the series is worth the purchase price because you'll probably want to view it again like me, or loan it to others.  It's good.
B000P46QIG|3.0|Quantum, last Planet X music effort, shows the talent of drummer innovator  Virgil Donati, more involved in the compositional side than the previous records, with keyboards wizard Derek Sherinian and some incredible special guests like Brett Garsed, Jimmy Johnson, Rufus Philpot and the guitar legend Allan Holdsworth.  The new record take ahead theirs musical adventure in the unexplored ground of prograssive rock fusion, with new compositions and some new arragements of older material, featuring advanced armonic and rhythmic concepts and highly technical soloing skills although the overall production seam less good ( drum sounds expecially ) compared with the previous Moon Babies.  Anyway a must for progressive fusion lovers...
B000000XB9|5.0|This CD is Creedance Clearwater Revival's original recording, and is one of the few with the full, long version of my favorite piece, Suzy Q.  The CD was in excellent condition and came in a very short time.  I recommend this seller for future purchases.

B0010YSD7M|3.0|\\"The Ark of Truth\\" finishes the Ori story arc when season 10 of Stargate SG-1 ended its run on SciFi.  For non-Stargate watchers, the movie might get a little confusing. For Stargate watchers, it's a very nice way to continue the beloved series.    There are plenty of things to like about the movie. Excellent visual effects, nice battle scenes with Ori followers, as well as a wink and a nod to \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" on occasion, make this a step above the average show episode. And yes, the Ori story arc is finally closed.    What's not to like? No big battle between the Ancients and the Ori, Carter suddenly becoming less efficient and a lot more girly, yet another over-the-top IOA guy, and last but not least the \\"resurrection\\" of a long defeated enemy. And oh yeah, no Jack O'Neill.    Overall, the good points outweigh the bad and I would recommend this movie.
B000YABIQ6|2.0|Got my set today 7/12, and played the first disc and watched the first two episodes and notice several visual glitches.  The first two the picture seemed to freeze for a few seconds then continued on with the scene.  The third one it look like a film strip broke and got stuck on the screen before continuing on .  Anyone else have this problem?
B0007PLLQ0|1.0|The version with the Tangerine Dream soundtrack is much better than The Jerry Goldsmith crap. That's the one I watched as a kid and that's the one I really want.  This version is ruined with music that doesn't belong.
0812975219|5.0|Many concepts in \\"Fooled by Randomness\\" can be mentally applied to many areas and circumstances of our lives.  This book has a lot of variety both past and present that can help us in the future in how we *think* about things, our environment, and more importantly, ourselves.  This review will take a different path because there have been so many written about this book already.      Author Nassim Taleb believes that Randomness and luck is more of a factor regarding people's positions and successes than most folks realize. In politics, business, economics, and a other fields and areas.    We often too quickly make the assumption that because of someone's superb and/or superior circumstances that these superior results are exclusively because of his/her smart mind, brilliant decisions, actions, and skills.  Surely they must know something we don't? This isn't always the case.  Sometimes it is, but not always. More often than we might think, it isn't.  I see the author's repeated points that we as humans, underestimate the odds and occurrences of Randomness.  But I do think diligence, planning, and acumen are also highly prevalent in many successful things we do, in life.  It you're good, you'll do better than someone who isn't, in anything.  Common sense is a critical factor, too.  Our choices also obviously affect what happens to us, in what we passively receive.     All of us can recall times when we were given credit for something that was in all honestly, more the result of fortuity than our own doing.  Do we often openly admit it?  :)  I do believe, that most of one's achievements is because of hard work, skill, planning, and yes luck.  But for some of us, in certain situations, luck is the key reason, and there's nothing wrong with this.  Those of us that have been the beneficiaries of luck should enjoy it, use it to our advantage, and perhaps most importantly, realize that we've received it.      Within the first couple of pages a detailed description lures the reader:  the quick-topping Ferrari, screeching to a halt.  Underlings immediately jump, scramble, and run to park the car as its owner vacates and bolts to the Trading Floor.  Being a former trader, there attention paid to the trading world in FBR (Fooled by Randomness).    One of the many real-life examples and anecdotes Nassim Taleb noted was the topsy-turvy rise and crash of individuals in the world of Bond Trading:  A Bond Trader named \\"Nemo\\" was envious of his 'more successful' Chicago neighbor \\"John the high-Yield trader,\\" who lived right across the street.  Nemo had a 14 year track record of solid returns based on careful assessments of risk.  Nemo was a long-term survivor of the Bond World and had a solid personal financial base he'd built up for him and his family.  Across the street, John was boorish, loud, show-offy. He loved to flaunt his toys.  His wife was arrogant, and pseudo-high society.  John's luck - his stint with randomness eventually ended, and he crashed.  Karma....       Over the years as we get older we observe our circumstances, our environment, our peers, and our peers' circumstances in relation to *ourselves.*  In the chapter, \\"If you're so rich why aren't you so smart?\\" we see the randomness of the social pecking order.      The world has many one hit wonders in politics, business, music, film, etc.  And when the Random opportunity or luck of the one-hit wonder appears, people should take advantage of it.  (If, they can recognize it.)  Because if it's luck or randomness, it won't last forever.      Only a few times (not often) throughout this book, I had to re-read or re-scan a sentence or group of sentences to get the point Taleb was making.  But the writing is good enough, to the point, and succinct.  Readers should note the author is not a native English speaker and being a Mathematician, the author is likely left-brained.  So readers, go easy.  I do believe however, this book is decently written.     Taleb lists some of the commontraits listed of people who are the beneficiaries of Randomness but don't realize it.  Instead, they think their situation is the result of mostly themselves, their decision-making, and actions.    The Confusion Index:     The Confusion Index has several terms for people who assume results are because of \\"vision,\\" \\"excellent strategy,\\" and \\"brilliance.\\"  This is often the interpretation of past results.  It's pretty easy to interpret past results, isn't it?  It's easy to be a Monday Morning Quarterback.  This is called \\"Hindsight Bias.\\" Have you ever heard \\"It was so obvious\\" after the fact?  Things appear more predictable after the fact. Some concepts below in the index:    Luck vs. Skills  Randomness vs. Determinism   Probability vs. Certainly  Belief, Conjecture vs. Knowledge, Certitude  Theory vs. Reality  Anecdote, Coincidence vs. Causality, Law  Forecast vs. Prophecy    My Favorite Chapter: If you're so smart why aren't you rich?    Some of the many great chapters and sub-chapters:    Gamblers' ticks & pigeons in a Box  You should be dead by now  Placebo Investors  The rare-eve fallacy: the mother of all deceptions  Survivorship Bias (one of my favorite sub-chapters)    Don't be fooled.  This is....a great book.

B0001611DI|4.0|After watching Night of the Living Dead, I decided to give Dawn of the Dead a shot. Right from the get go, I was hooked on the film. The movie follows Stephen, Roger, Peter, and Francine, who are trying to escape to Canada, away from the zombie epidemic plaguing the cities. Along the way, the group finds a shopping mall, and decides to make a stand in the mall.    I personally think the mall idea is brilliant. Honestly though, whenever I think of zombie epidemic, I think of malls. Malls in America are one of the most well stocked facilities capable of sustaining a small group for months with food, clothing, and all sort of entertainment.    The next cool thing about the movie is the fact that the mall they filmed in is an actually mall that exists in America. If I remember right, Romero shot at Monroeville Mall which is interesting for many reasons. One is that you'll see a lot of brand name companies which wouldn't be used in modern times and the fact that nearly every store somehow contributed to the efforts of the movie. For example, the characters went into Penny's for supplies, or a gun store, and even more surprising a bank. I think the fact that Romero was able to pull off shooting at an actual mall is a feat all by itself and I liked the movie all the better because of it.    The thing that separates Dawn of the Dead from other zombie films is that you grow attached to the characters in a small way. Throughout the film, I was rooting for many of the folks and by the end, I was sadden by the fact that they had to give up their mall due to looters and zombies overrunning the mall.    While waiting for the film in the mail, I decided to read over various sites. I was a bit surprised by the amount of articles outlining the fact that Dawn of the Dead is some sort of satire about America's consumerism. After watching the film though, I believe that it is a good zombie film and nothing else. I mean I guess you could make the connection that zombies, malls, and people are somehow connected, but in my opinion, who would give up a mall if there is a zombie epidemic? And not only that, the characters were careful to note that looters would most likely come to mall and they made necessary precautions but failed in the end.    Overall the movie is good. Personally I recommend buying all the Divimax Dead series as they are all good in picture and sound quality. It comes with a short bio on Romero and some Trailers and photo shoot, but I don't think any other sort of bonuses exist on the dvd.
B00002Z88D|5.0|I wouldn't really rate this as a \\"true\\" live album as the symphony concept was a rare event, and not something that truly portrays the songs as you would here them if Metallica was touring today.<br /><br />S&M came out when i was in high school.  Being a band dork, this was a great fusion of something I was fairly familiar with (classical ensembles) and Metallica, something I was just starting to get a taste for (its hard to dive right in when they were coming off of crapfests like Load and Re-load!)  For all their missteps in the studio, they still had a great live act and a real wealth of great material.  This turned me on to metal in all its forms and potential.<br />The first three tracks,  this start's out with Morricone's \\"Ecstasy of gold\\", were a real challenge for me.  Cthulu is a very long instrumental, and I feel like the orchestra helps to keep this song from getting monotonous(as sometimes Metallica tends to repeat the same riff to death).  Then you come to Master of Puppets, now this is where everything comes together, as James finally starts singing.  You started on with just the orchestra, then you add the band, and finally the vocals.  Now that all three are playing along (with a little help from the crowd acting as a massive choir) you really start to have fun with it.<br /><br />Others have commented about all the songs, but I just wanted to finally mention the real peak of the album for me is \\"Hero of the Day\\".  For all I care this is the definitive version.  The orchestra almost changes the meaning of the song, that's how integral they are to this arrangement.  It turns it from what I feel is basically a bitter/beaten veteran's song into a song about loss and redemption, the orchestra acting as some sort voice on high.  I get chills when i hear this version.  love it!!<br /><br />This was a great disc to buy back when it came out, and I would still recommend it to Metallica fans today.

B00104QSOM|4.0|The Good Things<br />*Excellent filming style, editing, and cinematography.  Stylistically similar to a Sergio Leone film.<br />*Some fascinating ideas; in particular, a lot of paralell cases where people are using or abusing each other for gain.  Makes for subtle but complex story.<br />*Also provides some fascinating insight on the oil drilling business.<br />*Excellent acting; interesting group of characters.<br />*Good writing.<br />*Excellent music; John Williams can eat his heart out.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Very very long.<br /><br />The Ugly (or Questionable) Things<br />*Pretty weak story; focus is more on internal conflicts and rivalries than on any physical conflict.<br />*Despite the movie's title, there are only a few violent scenes, and they are not too graphic.  If you're looking for a bloody action film, this would not be it.<br />*Abrupt, crazy ending.<br /><br />This is basically like \\"Citizen Kane\\" in the west; a broad story about relentless ambition and corruption.  It's a very long, slow-moving film, with an epic scope and scale.  The story can be seen as tedious or boring, and perhaps even pointless, but the main attraction are the characters, all of whom are well-developed and well-acted.  With patience, it is worthwhile watching at least once.<br /><br />Image and sound quality is excellent (especailly in blu-ray).  The single-disc DVD has no special features.  The two-disc and blu-ray versions have a 1923 silent film depicting the oil business, a fifteen-minute montage of behind-the-scenes stuff, a few deleted scenes, and a couple of the trailers.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|I've seen the play twice, and I'm REALLY looking forward to the movie.  If it is anything like the play, you'll be smiling from beginning until the end.  I had no idea Meryl Streep had such a good singing voice, but I absolutely love every song that she sings on this cd.  Pierce Brosnan, on the other hand, could use some lessons...  Trust me, this cd will make an excellent addition to you collection!  A++++

Image has done it right this time by releasing both Special Editions(with loads of cool imput,there I go again,I mean extras,including a great audio commentary and other super cool goodies!) Blu Ray(the one I personally bought for an awesome low price by the way!)and Special Edition DVD,both are good and definately better than the bare bones cheapo release of \\"Short Circuit\\" also released by Image,actually Image had a Special Edition DVD a while back and was discontinued for some reason and the prices for that one went sky high on auction ste like E Bay,well the good news is there is THESE new brand new \\"Special Edtions\\"(Blu Ray Disc(Prefered),and regular DVD now available to enjoy!!! But get one before they go out of print again,while the price is right!!! One of the great classic 80's films for sure!!! Two thumbs up! A+

0374105235|5.0|Surprisingly well written for someone with a background of being a civil   war soldier at such a young age.  His intelligence shines through.  What this boy has lived through, and the ways he tries to overcome adversity, should be an inspiring story to anyone.  Once I started this book I never put it down.
B0017ZB8M6|5.0|...but somehow you get the idea that it's all in fun. This pop/rock recording makes for a fine debut. Katy does seem to have a bit of gender dysphoria...she kisses girls when drunk [and enjoys it], sometimes she feels like \\"one of the boys\\", and \\"ur so gay\\" and \\"hot n cold\\" depict her boyfriend  has having some confusion of his own {PMS, indeed}. The lyrics, though are clean...well, there is a line in \\"if you can afford me\\" about not being a piece of a**...and I, at least, was left with the impression that she doesn't really mean it, and is just having a good time with us. \\"i kissed a girl\\" is not only not offensive, it's my favorite song on the album...really catchy.<br /><br />Katy is a pretty girl, with a clear, strong, voice...she should go far. The album is well recorded, and presented, with great artwork. The recording may be a bit more \\"rock\\" than I like, but only a bit. She manages to take themes which some could use to gross us out, and make a real \\"feel good\\" album...that's an accomplishment, right there. You go, girl...<br /><br />Addendum: I liked it when I first got it, but this is a record that actually IMPROVES with repeated listening...Very high recommendation. Six stars, at least.
B00AEFYL6K|5.0|As the \\"Old West\\" is dying and statehood and a new, more complex society looms, a Senator, played by Jimmy Stewart returns to his humble beginnings of Shinbone to attend the funeral of his friend, played by John Wayne.<br /><br />As a journalist interviews Stewart, he reveals how his career got it's ultimate boost because he was known as \\"the man who shot Liberty Valance,\\" a violent criminal. In a flashback, we see what really happened. Stewart was not the man who shot the criminal, but it was John Wayne, who witnessed the gunfight from an alleyway and managed to kill Liberty Valance with a shotgun at the same moment that Stewart fired his own gun. He did this despite the fact that he had lost the love of his life to Stewart. He was doing the right thing!<br /><br />When the journalist hears the truth, he refuses to print it, stating, \\"When the legend becomes fact, we print the legend.\\" That statement captures the essence of this classic film.<br /><br />Without a doubt, this is a movie is a classic that should not be missed.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I've wanted to add this title to my DVD collection for a while, but hesitated when I saw the controversy about the changes.  Still, at $25 for the set, I thought I'd take a chance.<br /><br />Personally, I think the CGI is great.  It looks crisp on an HD screen, and not grainy like all movies would be from this period.  It breathes new life into a good, but old movie.<br /><br />I even wish they would have taken it a step further and updated some of the lo-res computer graphics in the movie.  They look like Pong.<br /><br />The puppets seem kind of campy looking today, and maybe they could have done a little something with those too.<br /><br />I guess there's no way to cover up some of the stupid dialogue between Han and Lea, but that's another matter.<br /><br />I do agree with others that both versions should be available, but I'm guessing that would be expensive.  The whole \\"Greedo shot first\\" thing is pretty bad, and completely changes Han's character, but whatever.<br /><br />The changes make the two trilogies fit together better, and make modern viewing a little bit nicer.<br /><br />\\"I find your lack of faith disturbing\\"<br />-Darth Vader
B0013J9KOO|4.0|Saw it last night and liked it.  Been a while since i had seen the first one, didn't like it too much but really liked the way the actors played the parts.  Feel the same way with the second movie, the actors are great, the special effects are on steroids (as with most hollywood big summer action/ super hero movies).  It's a fun movie, great action, cg.  Ron Perlman is just awesome in this role as hellboy, his sarcasm and ease in this role makes the movie.  Again realy like all the actors.  The plot involves the history of the magical realm using the golden army to go against the gready humans in the olden days (great cg mock up done for this recounting of the story) and how the king of the fairys/elves (forget which one) was sorry at the death toll that resulted as the golden army killed many humans.  A pact was drawn up to keep the magical realm in forests and humans in their cities.  One elf in modern day does not want to honor the truce and wants to bring back the golden army to finish the job.

B0012Q732O|1.0|This movie looked like it would be a great adventure film. I was way off, this movie has no climax, no humor, and it seems as though they took pieces of Lord of the Rings, Apocalypto, and tried to make a movie out of it in BC time. This movie is really not that good at all. I feel asleep half way through. I would not buy it, if you need a couple of hours to kill rent it but don't expect much.
1593080220|5.0|Howards End is one of my favorite books, and every couple of years I pull it down off the shelf to reacquaint myself with it. It's one of those books that has become an old friend over the years.    The story revolves around the Schlegels, Wilcoxes and Basts, three families whose lives interconnect over the course of several years and not necessarily always for the better, and at the center of the story is always the country home, Howards End. The book is an amazing study of class distinctions; passion versus intellect; constraint versus action; wealth versus poverty.    The Schlegel sisters, Margaret and Helen, are passionate for life; they want to experience as much as they can from it. The Wilcoxes come from a more conservative stock, more it tune with their wealth and possessions than anything else. After a hastily announced (as just as hastily broken) engagement between the youngest Wilcox son, Paul, and Helen, the families find themselves at odds, until an unlikely friendship forms between Mrs. Wilcox and Margaret Schlegel. Upon Mrs. Wilcox's death, she leaves Howards End to Margaret, but the Wilcoxes as a whole do not feel that Mrs. Wilcox was in her right frame of mind and never let Margaret know of Mrs. Wilcox's bequest. In amidst these settings we are also introduced to Leonard Bast, who lives on the brink of poverty and feels that through education and enlightenment he might better his life and that of his fiancée, Jacky.    There are so many subtle nuances to this story, I have a hard time getting it all down. Forster has created an amazing story that is poignant in its telling and staggering in it depth. No matter how many times I read Howards End, I am always amazed at the intricacies of the story and feel that I take something new away with each reading.

B00005NB8K|3.0|I think The Doors are one of the greatest bands in rock history. I also think that no one else will ever possess the presence or talent that Jim Morrison did,especially with the way rock \\"music\\" is going these days (I mean, Limp Bizkit was popular a few years ago, if that says anything about where rock is headed.)<br />I'm not an Oliver Stone fan particularly. I've never seen JFK, and Natural Born Killers seems to have a sort of following behind it, but I honestly didn't see any redeeming qualities about that movie. So when I saw that Oliver Stone was the director of the movie about my favorite band, although I was excited to watch it, I truthfully wasn't expecting very much.<br />I bought it before watching it and still own it. Although I've seen it many times, I'm still conflicted as to how I feel about it. It seems that the movie, although true to The Doors and how they got together and their rise to fame, did not do Jim justice at all. It had nothing to do with Val Kilmer, he was perfect as Jim, especially the live performance scenes; I've watched many Doors live performances and how Val embodied Jim in that respect was really amazing. I do think he over-did it sometimes-the pouty thing he did drove me nuts and the photo shoot scene made me laugh it was so cheesy. All in all though, I loved Val as Jim. Yet the movie seemed to show only one aspect of who Morrison was-on the road to excess, out of control, drunken, womanizing. Sure he's a rock star, but I would have loved to know more about who he REALLY was, because I feel the movie didn't delve into that. I'm positive there was much more to him than the drunken rock star (even if it was the truth, that's not all of who he was). Ray Manzarek said it best \\"It was not about Jim Morrison. It was about Jimbo Morrison, the drunk. God, where was the sensitive poet and the funny guy? The guy I knew was not on that screen.\\"<br />I give the movie three stars because aside from my criticisms of it, it's essentially a good movie by an okay director about an amazing band. Damn you Oliver Stone, why couldn't a better director with a better screenplay have done this movie, who knows what could have been.an okay director about an amazing band. Damn you Oliver Stone, why couldn't a better director with a better screenplay have done this movie, who knows what could have been.
B00166BL6Y|5.0|This is without doubt the definitive version of this album. The quality of the remastering work is stunning and a credit to the guys 'twiddling the knobs' to make this one of the better remastering efforts that I know of. The technology for recording this album must seem archaic to what can be done today.    I was a bit doubtful when it was first released as the last thing I needed was the mono and stereo versions of the same tracks. But both are of such high quality that it was like listening to the album for the first time. The mono version stands equal to the stereo mix in my opinion.    I will not review the album tracks as they have been around for 40 years and most Tull fans would/should/could have heard them by now. There was guitarist in the band before Martin Barre and I think Mick Abrahams can be proud of his effort.    I would have bought this album irrespective of the bonus tracks but they are just the 'icing on the cake'. A few new pictures are included along with some kind words by all the musicians - unexpected bonuses.    Tull fans should rush out and buy it but the thought of the 40th Anniversary version of DotCom has me worried if I'll still be around. Any fans of 1960's English blues should all included this album as it is a great blues album and captures the sound of this period.    Enjoy.    Russell

B0012QE4Q2|4.0|The other Boleyn Girl was a popular historical novel about the sister of   Anne Boleyn...Henry VIII's second wife who brought down the dominance of   the Catholic church in England.  Here it's given a first rate production   with three excellent actors in the lead roles...Scarlett Johanssen and   Portman as the Boleyn sister and Eric Bama as the king.  Though the strict   historical accuracy can be debated, it's an entertaining ride for any  lover of historical fiction.

Such does not detract; rather the performance is enhanced by the witnesses, who are our surrogates, to their own stunning performance. We all see and hear Victor Hugo's message transmitted with clarity of life's revolution taking place within and around each one of us. The ending will send chills down the back of the most cynical critic of the theater.

B000VNMMR0|1.0|The original \\"Die Hard\\" was one of, if not the best, action films of all time. \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" has to be one of the worst. The villains were lame, the plot was idiotic, and our hero's antics were so ridiculously implausible as to be insulting. This was an ordeal to endure. You've been warned. You're welcome.
B0018AK9RK|5.0|I agree with the point if you are looking for the \\"Metal Gods\\" head-banging sound & feel, this is not for you. I love Judas Priest, I love heavy metal, and I love their classic metal songs. But on a whole different level, I think Nostradamus is a brilliant piece of work.     No one ever likes concept albums when first released. But if you have any idea about music and history, this is a CREATIVE MASTERPIECE! 20 years from now, it will be the benchmark for all concept albums. Some of the lyrics are written in the same style of using quatrains that Nostradamus used. The lyrics are powerful and follow the history of Nostradamus, and the art work in the book ties everything together with the music. There are some heavy metal sounding tunes in the mix, but it is more the style of Judas Priest as Metal Minstrels.     I say cheers to Judas Priest for daring to try something new and growing creatively!
B0018QCXGY|5.0|Feel good films are about feeling good and feel bad films are about feeling bad.  Cloverfield unapologetically falls into the latter category.  Filmed from the perspective of an amateur camera, I immediately fell into its chaotic rhythm and felt borderline nausea, which actually worked for me, amplifying the intensity of the horrifying circumstances.  Whether or not the directors, producers, or editors consciously intended that or not does not matter, the end result was an immersive, captivating, first-person experience, whose discomfort was simultaneously repulsive and hypnotic.  I felt I was trapped inside the film right alongside its victims.  The hectic, scrambling kinematics produced an atmosphere of motion sickness, panic, and disorientation, providing only fleeting glimpses of the horrifying monster, a \\"less is more\\" taunting that had me almost craning my neck to get a better look.  If Hitchcock did sci-fi horror today, it would turn out something like this gem.    With so many predecessor monster flicks having desensitized movie goers for several generations, this film was quite risky.  It could have been a routine flop had it taken a safer, but incongruous approach of delivering this order of death and mayhem through a more traditionally aimed lens and richer cinematography.  Boldly eschewing slicker visual story telling for its uglier amateur camera perspective transcended the pedantic mechanics of movie production and elevated the resulting experience to that of viewing art.    At 45, I thought I was too old and jaded to get enthused about yet another monster flick, but Cloverfield is a worthy refresher of the Godzilla film genre, and a brilliantly crafted spectacle.
0452289963|3.0|The promotional information caught my attention; 'Awakening to your life's purpose' which made me quite excited to receive this book. I did not know it was on Oprah's book list so this came as a surprise.  I must admit I am quite disappointed. Maybe it is useful to put an age old spiritual concept into contemporary terms, 'the ego', but spirtuality is far more than just this.  For those putting a first foot on a spirtual path, yes it has merit but if you are widely read and are looking for something mind expanding, well, make your own mind up but don't hold your breath. It is more pop psychology and self help than spiritual and there are far better books to guide you to your life's purpose.
B00158K0S8|5.0|Patton is one of the real good stories about World War II.  It is really pretty accurate from everything I have read on the subject.
B000YXMMAE|2.0|Let's see.  This album is now a product that can be bought.  The point is to review the product.  I really cannot stress enough how uninspired this album sounds to me.  The best songs Radiohead have written are clearly contained on The Bends and OK Computer.  And Kid A/Amnesiac to a lesser extent; though there's some fine material there.<br /><br />The band's output since 2000/2001 has been uneven and at times faultering.<br /><br />In Rainbows finds them creating the same mistakes again.  Thom Yorke is most likely heading the ship.  It's been sinking for a long time, and I don't think he gets it anymore.<br /><br />The song \\"Videotape\\" (especially Yorke's solo live version) hinted at the possibility of this band/man still being able to pierce the heart with lyrics and melody.<br /><br />I've heard people defend that there's \\"some good songs\\" on this album.  But that could (way too) easily be narrowed to 2 or 3.  Radiohead were a band I thought would never release an album with so few good songs.  Apparently they've done it.  Though it certainly isn't the worst album, compared to many modern bands, it meanders so much that it becomes sonic beige carpet, and overall the album is an emotional flatline.  Yawn, maybe we'll see what they do next.

1401216676|5.0|\\"Batman: The Killing Joke\\" is one of the seminal Batman comics as well as one of the finest comics ever published.  That's hardly a surprise considering that it was written by Alan Moore, the Shakespeare of comic books, who the year before had written \\"[[ASIN:0930289234 Watchmen]],\\" the greatest comic of all time.  For \\"The Killing Joke,\\" he teamed with artist Brian Bolland to craft a psychological look at what made the Joker, what makes him who he is now, and how the threads of Batman's fate are inextricably woven between those of the Joker.      In \\"The Killing Joke,\\" the Joker escapes from Arkham Asylum.  He then proceeds to cripple Barbara Gordon and kidnap her father, Commissioner James Gordon, and hold him hostage.  Meanwhile, Batman frantically searches for the Clown Prince of Crime.  As one of the many comics published in the 1980s which upgraded the medium from children's entertainment to serious literature, \\"The Killing Joke\\" is very mature and very disturbing.  Unlike the Joker of Tim Burton's \\"[[ASIN:B000B5XOY8 Batman]]\\" or of the legendary [[ASIN:B00023E894 animated series]], this Joker's jokes are not amusing to us.  They are disturbing.  As if the crippling of Barbara Gordon was not heartbreaking enough, the Joker takes disturbing photographs of her nude -- in a pool of her own blood -- then kidnaps and abuses the naked and chained Jim Gordon, laughing all the way.  This is not Caesar Romero's mischievous clown from the 60's TV series.    Through a series of flashbacks, we see how the Joker came to be.  Moore cleverly draws from the original origin tale created for the Joker in the 1950's.  Initially intended as a throwaway story, now that tale becomes something meaningful and intriguing, an important piece of a tragic puzzle.  The Joker is such an interesting character in \\"The Killing Joke\\" because at once one is appalled by him, by his ghastly actions, by his complete disregard for humanity, and yet, at the same time, one feels horrible for him.  Hebecame the horror he is after one bad night -- and, as the Joker points out, so did Batman.    Introducing that notion was just one of the ways that \\"The Killing Joke\\" influenced the future of Batman comics.  The notion that Batman was a similar creature to the Joker, perhaps even the same, had never been explored before.  But that's just what Moore did.  \\"The Killing Joke\\" suggests that Batman needs the Joker and vice versa, as though they are yin and yang, two pieces of a puzzle, neither of which can exist without the other.  Batman needs to put the Joker in his place, just as the Joker needs to be put in his place by Batman.  At first it seems like an insane idea -- but out of that apparent insanity comes the frightening realization that that may be the most sane idea yet.    Moore himself has distanced himself from the books since its publication, saying that he felt that the book was devoid of \\"real human importance,\\" and that the characters felt like just that: characters.  He may be right in some regards.  \\"The Killing Joke\\" hasn't the \\"human importance\\" of \\"Watchmen,\\" but its examination of what makes these two unusual humans tick, what created them, and its suggestion that one should step back and see the big picture, makes it important enough in my book.  It's true that some of the characters with less scenes, such as Barbara Gordon or even Batman himself, do come off as characters more than people, but those characters that Moore focuses on, namely the Joker and Jim Gordon, come across as real human beings.      Bringing additional depth to the story is Brian Bolland, whose eerie, muted artwork perfectly compliments Moore's chilling story.  When the book was first published in 1988, it was colored by John Higgins, who used a sort of rainbow-tinged brightness in his coloring, which didn't quite fit the story.  This edition is re-colored by Bolland, so all the artwork looks the way it was intended to look: splendid.  Most noticeably, he's sucked most of the color out of the flashback scenes, which adds an additional bitterness to them.  Bolland's muted colors are utterly perfect for Moore's writing.  The Joker may never have looked so good as he does when Bolland draws him.    \\"The Killing Joke\\" was highly influential.  For one thing, it brought about the creation of the crippled Barbara Gordon's alter-ego, Oracle, who would be one of the leads of the \\"Birds of Prey\\" comics (and TV series).  For another, it inspired both Tim Burton's depiction of the Joker in his film and Christopher Nolan's depiction of the character in \\"The Dark Knight.\\"  And while Moore and Bolland have often questioned the relevancy and overall quality of the book, it remains a fan favorite.    So for those looking to acquaint themselves with Batman comics, or those who want to know just what the comic fuss is about, \\"The Killing Joke\\" is a must.  It remains the greatest Joker story ever told, as well as one of the best Batman stories told, period.  It's dark, disturbing, thoughtful, and revelatory.  If you're interested in comics and you haven't read it, well -- the joke's on you.
B0017I1FNK|5.0|This is the most recent album from an icon of Country Music: Emmylou Harris. Over more than four decades Emmylou's elegant soprano voice retains a crystal clarity rarely heard in my experience. Many of the songs in this album are written by Harris and she has selected her accompanying vocalists with great care. The result is superb; each song seems to portray a unique message and appeal. I own 16 albums of her music and this is as enjoyable as any. I give this latest contribution as high a rating as allowed: 5 stars. You will not be disappointed. The title song says what she wanted to say: this is \\"All I Intended to Be\\" when I began my career in the 1960s.
1582701709|5.0|This book is a masterpiece! The title says it all as it is not only attention getting but once you read it , you have realized all along it really wasn't a secret afterall but something your soul had known since the day you were born We just may not have been listening. Rhonda and the teachers give it an identification, a name. they call it what it is and show us how we have been using it and how to change its flow should we so desire. I learned about this book from watching Oprah one day.. I was guided to the broadcast by a higher source. The subject was not the secret per se but, in a split second mention  Oprah refers to this book.. of course I was interested just on the title alone as thats all that was given. I went to the bookstore and voila, here I am writing a review on it. The DVD is also enlighteneing and a great compliment to an energy we all know but aren't aware of it, or are we? As the saying goes, if you really want to hide something from someone, put it right in front of them. Read this work and you will certainly see what I mean.
0307346617|1.0|Easily the most disappointing book I've read in the past 5 years. I struggled just to get through it.  If you like to pick up your favorite AP story and read a good interview in your USA today, then you'll love this book. For me, where is the thrill? The story line? The intrigue?  At least give me some central character to root for or against!!  And the the nerve of Brooks to attempt to invade Romero-style political comments relating to todays headlines...it just falls plain flat and childlike in his efforts. Not good...
0316776963|4.0|As much as I'm a fan of biographies - particularly historical ones - I've never been really enamored of autobiographies.  Generally, they are too self-serving, which is to be expected:  you can hardly be really objective when writing about yourself.  Indeed, David Sedaris's Me Talk Pretty One Day is self-serving, but at least it's not in the standard way.  Instead of being the hero of his book, Sedaris is often the lead buffoon.    Of course, that is to be expected.  This is really a collection of semi-autobiographical essays which often does obvious fact-bending to get some good humor.  Does the humor work?  Usually, yes, and that's the key to success for a book of this nature.    Me Talk Pretty One Day is divided into two parts.  The first part - titled \\"One\\" - is a series of essays about Sedaris's life in the United States, coping with speech therapists (due to a lisp), drugs and teaching.  The second part - \\"Deux\\" - deals with life in France, where Sedaris goes with his lover (it is no secret that Sedaris is gay and he gets some humor out of this, but most of it has less to do with homosexuality as with relationships in general).    The typical problem with these sorts of books is that they are best read in small doses, maybe an essay or two at a time; otherwise, the humor begins to acquire a bit of sameness that dulls it a bit.  Unfortunately, this conflicts with my cover-to-cover-and-on-to-the-next-book attitude, which may have cut into my enjoyment a little.  But I still found this to be a breezy and funny read; it may not be a riot, but Me Talk Pretty One Day is good enough to get the occasional chuckle and have you at least smiling the rest of the time.
B0013J9KOO|4.0|Hellboy II, The Golden Army is Guillermo Del Toro's second crack at the popular comic book series which has Hellboy pitted against his most dangerous (and dare I say moral?)enemy yet. The plot begins thousands of years ago when an eleven king signs a peace treaty with the human race after a terrible and bloody war. (During this war the elven king hires a goblin engineer to forge the legendary Golden army who are basically huge golden mechs. they prove to be too powerful and the king decides to lock them away.)  His son, Prince Nauda disagrees with his father and leaves his people, swearing that he will return to lead them when they need him most. Fast forward a few thousand years, Prince Nauda has returned and his goal is to rid the world of the humans, who he sees(rightfully so) as a danger to the world. He decides to reawaken the Golden Army but first he must find all the pieces to his fathers crown before doing so. Hellboy and B.P.R.D are sent to stop him and Nauda does an excellent job of kicking their collective arses. Golden Army is a excellent addition to the Hellboy series and is better than the first one. \\"Golden Army\\"is unique because I had the hardest time figuring out who the good guy was. Hellboy is brash, self centered and cocky, in many ways the personification of the the disagreeable qualities of humankind, on the other hand Nauda is regal, focused and poised embodying natures last line of defense against a greedy and uncaring world. Yet, somehow Hellboy is championed? To me Nauda was the real hero while Hellboy was merely a tool used by the government to protect it's interests. Hellboy is a fun and exciting adventure well forth seeing. The fight scenes are excellent and Guillermo delights with his ever vast imagination. See it !

B000000OAC|4.0|In many ways, this seems to be Queen's 1977 answer to punk rock, and it holds up remarkably well after 30-plus years. The opening pairing of \\"We Will Rock You\\" and \\"We Are the Champions\\" may seem overplayed today, but at the time they were also a statement of purpose. \\"Sheer Heart Attack\\" is another blistering rocker. \\"Get Down, Make Love\\" is blatant sexuality set to music, making nice use the of pauses between the notes, as well as a mid-section that sounds a bit like a game of pinball gone haywire.  There are many different bases covered here musically, just in a more stripped-down fashion than usual (not as many layered vocals, overdubs, etc). \\"It's Late\\" is a slow-building guitar track, \\"Who Needs You\\" has a laid-back Spanish feel, and \\"My Melancholy Blues\\" is a perfect album closer, as if Freddie Mercury were singing this piano ballad in some smoky after-hours jazz club. Somehow it all manages to hold together -- and to still sound very much like Queen.
B000N6TX1I|4.0|Unless you want to end up a blubbering idiot.      Needing DVDs for a passage, I bought this DVD on an impulse, remembering I had heard \\"good things\\" about it. I knew nothing about the plot, camera work, or startlingly realistic birth scene.    Unwarned, and nestled in the V-bearth I put the DVD in my computer and got slammed full-force by a first-rate distopic sci-fi thriller. I didn't even notice the long takes until the refugee camp scene, and I'm a filmmaker. When I miss something like that, that means I was *really* caught up in the movie.
B000000OAH|4.0|A worthy follow-up to 1977's News of the World, Jazz continues the Queen tradition of making a very diverse album, though not so over-the-top as, say, A Night at the Opera. \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\" is the best tribute to \\"heap-big women\\" ever put to vinyl, \\"Bicycle Race\\" and \\"Don't Stop Me Now\\" are both classic and a lot of fun. \\"Jealousy\\" is a typical overblown Freddie Mercury ballad, that works. \\"Leaving Home Ain't Easy\\" is a sad/breezy Brian May ballad, and \\"Dreamer's Ball\\" is lighthearted and jazzy, with a sad undercurrent. There are a few weaker moments, including Roger Taylor's rather lame \\"Fun It\\" (he was always the band's weakest songwriter) and John Deacon's pedestrian \\"In Only Seven Days.\\" On the whole, however, this album works, and is notable as Queen's last of the 70s, the end of an amazing run. As with many artists, the 80s would prove to be trickier and a bit uneven music-wise.
B0012QCZ54|4.0|Step Up 2 was so much fun, I think I was smiling the entire time I was watching it, not to mention on the edge of my seat wanting to dance.  I thought the first Step Up had some amazing choreography, but the story line was a bit slow and got bogged down for me by the stale romance and the whole death thing.  Isn't there a  tragic gang-related death that spurs the protagonist to dance as he has never danced before?  I guess I was so underwhelmed, I don't even remember the details.  I certainly don't need to see Step Up ever again, but I am eagerly awaiting the DVD release of Step Up 2.  I went to Step Up 2 because I go see all teen dance movies, but I was pleasantly surprised by the innovative dance sequences, the likeable characters, and the engaging storyline.  Whatever was missing for me in the first movie was there in abundance in the sequel.  It's so nice when a movie that could be another teensploitation piece of corporate money-making junk is actually well-crafted and clearly made by a group of creative people who really care about it.  I am a bit of a film snob myself, but I strongly believe that commercial film can be good and innovative, not to mention great fun.  Step Up 2 is a fine example.

0385340990|5.0|The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society by Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows is a delightfully engaging book about the island of Guernsey in 1946. The entire book is told through correspondence between Juliet Ashton, a writer working on a story about the German occupation in Guersey during WWII, the members of the eponymous society, her agent, and her erstwhile boyfriend. Each letters sparkles with the writer's personality from Juliet's world-weary writer to Isola's gruff affection to Dawsey's sweet, unassuming observations of the world around him. The story flows quite easily without the extraneous detail of a novel told in the normal format. We may not see every scene and those we do see are only from one perspective, but the authors build suspense and romance in equal measures. When the truth about Juliet's feelings are finally exposed, I couldn't help but breathe with a little catch in my throat. This book reminded me of the joy I find in reading. Not a word was wasted, and every page was a wonder.
B0002HSE18|4.0|There is nothing new here, but the quality of the sound is so improved as to make this absolutely worth the cost for any serious ELP fan.  The packaging is very nice as well, but really, who cares?  The toons are finally reproduced with a minimum of distortion.
0425188809|5.0|Bravo to Koontz on a brilliant effort. I felt very emotionally involved with the characters, even the minor ones. If you like this book, and I believe you will, pick up Mary Shelley's Frankenstein if you have not read it. Both examinations of human involvement in nature's work provide wonderful food for thought. Koontz' work is a more engaging book but it is interesting to see that these moral issues are not as new as we might think.

B000WQ9UA8|5.0|Bought this album for my, younger than I, wife and I was shocked at how great it was. Clearly this album was backed by fantastic producers, enginers, arrangers, musicans, and top song writters, and was made to deliver a top pop star's triumphant return to the topermost of the popermost. The album delivers. (To bad Britney in her real life is acting a mess.) Britnety however delivers on this album like it was yesterday. How many takes it took we do not know, but she is right on. The catchy songs will be enjoyed by listening and or dancing to, and will stay in your head for weeks. Never thought Britney Spears and a great album would be in the same sentence, but it surely is true here. Enjoy!
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|I just listened to Viva la Vida 3 times in a row.....I immedatley LOVED it. I think it's definatley one of the best albums I have heard in a long, long time.     The more I listened to it, the more I noticed the album -start to finish- tells a story.     It starts off as a time of innocence and happiness, a time when the world is beautiful (Life in Technicolor), however, the memory of wars and turmoil past still resinate in everyone's minds, as they remember the dead (Cemetaries of London), then slowly the story changes and becomes darkened as another war breaks out, and yet again soldiers are bravely fighting, all the while thinking of their dead commrades, the injustices and brutality of war and lost loves (Lost, 42, Lovers in Japan).    Finally a revolution comes and the war is won (Yes, Viva la Vida), however, after war comes dreary aftermath, and re-building, and the harsh realities of what war can bring (Violet Hill).    The final two songs are messages of love, survival and people sort of making a pact  that they don't want go to war ever again (Strawberry Swing, Death and all his Friends) .    The album ends with the same instrumental music as the beginning...suggesting the cycle of peace and war goes on and on.     I dont know if they are speaking aboutt the Iraq war, French Revolution, WW2 (or just war in general) but it's DEFINATLEY got a hold on me,     I think this is a superb album, Coldplay has really thrown every ounce of what they have spiritually, emotionally, and musically into Viva La Vida to create more than just an album with just random songs...the songs here interlace with one another, bleed into each other, weaving a story together and taking the listener along for the ride.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|After watching this beautifully crafted 7-part minseries on HBO, we orderd the DVD. Although I taught high school history for 25 years, I learned a great deal that I didn't know from this series and am delighted to be able to re-view it at leisure. John Adams was a major figure in the beginning of our nation, and one who is often slighted as we teachers rush through the early days of the founding fathers. High school curriculum demands and present day testing requirements make going into depth re any one historic person very difficult. In the time frame leading to the Declaration of Independence, the Revolutionary War, the drafting of the Constitution, and the presidencies of Washington and Adams, teachers tend to focus on Washington, Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin, and Adams makes only a brief appearance, basically as a failed president and opponent of Jefferson. This miniseries pulls his contributions, personality, and life into perspective and demonstrates, in an entertaining and historically accurate manner, his great intellect, difficult personality and many personal tragedies. One gets new insights into Franklin (an essential and amazing man!), Washington (so much more than a cardboard figure) and Jefferson (brilliant, taciturn and maniupulative).     Do not think of this material as a \\"history lesson.\\" There is drama and comedy aplenty, especially when Franklin is on the screen. I came away in awe at the courage and determination of those incredible founding fathers and what they accomplished.     Seeing them argue, heap abuse on one another, put egos and fortunes on the line, and eventually hammer out a new nation is an astounding journey. We owe them much. They cared deeply about making the new nation the best it could be and we owe them the same.    This is a wonderful DVD and one I recommend without reservation.
B000025H0Q|5.0|Well, you pretty much have no excuse for lending an ear to Nick Drake's three albums.  Like many artists that manage to only release three albums, each of their records are so different and good that it's quality over quanity.  While Drake's albums don't score a hat trick together, all of them are worth listening to, and all of them are quite stunning.<br /><br />Nick Drake tried something new with Bryter Layter, and it sounds the best when the right mood hits (just like Nick Drake's other albums, actually).<br />Bryter Layter is lighter than the rest of the albums, and is brilliantly orchestrated.  Drake still has that beautiful guitar playing, though I think his playing is less highlighted, not quite as shimmering as Five Leaves Left or Pink Moon, but it doesn't need to me.  His voice is, as usual, stunning and evokes all kinds of things, his lyrics are as good as you'd expect from him, and the other instruments are brilliantly used, as they are also a highlighted part of the record.<br /><br />As mentioned before, this is probably his most experimental of the three.<br />All kinds of things show up, like flutes, strings, piano, percussion, horns, saxophones, bells, John Cale,  plodding drums, other kinds of guitars, and bass.  It's closer to Chamber pop, or at least that's the best I can make a connection to, than folk music (at least in some of the songs).  Three instrumentals also make the cut.<br /><br />For the songs themselves, they all have quite to offer.  The three instrumentals are all beautiful guitar pieces with other instrumentation evoking moods like you wouldn't believe.  Some of it is indeed quite jazzy, like Poor Boy, which sounds actually like bossa nova at times.  Northern Sky twinkles beautifully, as it's one of the best tracks on this album, and it's a love song that doesn't resort to cliches.  The Hazey Jane songs, At the Chime Of A City Clock, no bad songs really.  You get ten evoking pieces that shimmer with beauty, well your getting Nick Drake, and that says it all.<br /><br />This album doesn't feature his best guitar playing (that belongs to Pink Moon), but it perhaps shows Nick Drake's amazing way of beauty, well, it's just a fantastic showcase for Nick Drake (hate to sound like the amazon editor's review, but it is).  Nick Drake is the best folk artist in my opinion, and it shows in his three albums.

B000TGCR3I|4.0|Based on a Japanese manga and created by a Japanese studio, yet written and directed by Americans, this movie still doesn't lack authenticity like I was worried that it might. The story it tells is fairly universal, focusing on the bond of brotherhood.     The 2 main characters, White and Black (friendS? brothers? the movie never really makes it clear) live in Treasure Town, a very vibrant city that's easily one of the most amazing things I've seen in animation. Yet this city, despite looking like a huge playground, is actually a bit of a wreck, where gangs fight for control and where crime is rampant. The first half of the story focuses on Black and White's bonds and their life as the Cats, the gang that owns the city. The second half features a new mob boss entering and attempting to gain control with his alien cohorts who seem nearly invincible.     The movie does lose a bit of interest as it beings to verge into the supernatural (those alien things really didn't fit in at all, I didn't think,) and the resolution, involving, like many anime's, a trip inside of the head of the main character, may leave mixed feelings on some viewers. The pacing's a little off as well...the first half may be too slow for some while the 2nd half doesn't ever really stop with the action and the chase scenes, which may wear some down. Still, we have a great anime here where the city's the star of the show. Somehow my favorite scene in the movie takes place during the second half of the credits, where you simply see shots of the city as a song from the Asian Kung-Fu Generation plays in the background. It's an amazing setting and even though it was only made for 5 million dollars, it looks, to me, much better than most hundred-million+ CG movies made today. It's not perfect (Despite the R-rating it seems to play it a bit safe at times...Black never seems to kill his rival gangsters even though the script and direction seems to act like he does,) but it's definitely a movie worth seeing.The first half hour in particular is just stunning.     Note; there IS an option for an English dub on the disc. The director (in interviews) has actually recommended the English dub, and while I don't agree with him, I will say that it's much better than the dubs you find in most anime. That said, though, a lot of the dialogue (especially White's) seems extremely corny when spoken aloud in English...and overall it does dampen the story a bit, so I'd recommend the Japanese language with subtitles. If you MUST hear it in English, at least you can be assured that the performances are good and it actually fits fairly well.
0765316978|2.0|I read both of the previous books: Old Man's War and Ghost Brigades and this Last Colony was a huge let-down.  There are several brief part of this book that got me somewhat interested, but overall it is rather boring.  Writing is down right bad. Scalzi's characters all talk as if it was the same person. John Perry, who in the first book was wisecrack, here becomes just a guy who has to be the one to finish the already annoying conversations.   Almost no new ideas or technology were introduced - although some were stolen from, for example, The Forever War.  If Old Men's War was an \\"A-\\", Ghost Brigades was a solid \\"B\\", this barely scrapes by with a \\"C-\\"  Don't read it, just stop at Ghost Brigades.

0553266306|5.0|This is a very entertaining book, enjoyable for anyone interested in modern Western politics and \\"espionage,\\" without the need for precise historical accuracy.<br />Forsyth's novel is pure fiction with a heavy dose of generally accurate non-fiction context.  The setting is the unsettled political climate of 1963 France under De Gaulle.  For a Western democracy, France was (and had long been) a politically unstable nation with a fidelity for its government that was as faithful as the legendary lust of the Frenchman (another myth . . .).  Anyway, Forsyth's fiction is based on a plot to assassinate De Gaulle as promoted by the rebels in his army who are bitter about his abadonment of the Algerian colony.  The rebels hire a shadowy professional British assassin who insists on working alone, and for big dollars.  To stop him, the best of French intelligence is devoted to a continential manhunt to find a man who has not yet committed any crime to investigate and who is otherwise unknown to everyone in the world (including the rebels who hired him).  The rest is a great story presented masterfully by Forsyth.<br />This was a first work for Forsyth, and one can see where the writing could be better at times, but the plot and presentation are generally great.  Forsyth's method is journalistic (fitting to the journalist that he was), and the tone is often like listening to Jack Webb's \\"Dragnet\\" or William Conrad voicing-over on \\"The Fugitive.\\"  For the most part, the facts are presented coldly, and at first this was a distraction.  Later in the book, I realized that Forsyth was gradually, in his method, building characters who are just as rich as any in \\"pop\\" literature.  For instance, the stolid details of the Jackal's dressing and lunching habits were, I thought at first, mere details to fill the imagination.  In fact, Forsyth was presenting, without explicit comment, a picture of this mysterious man as one who so enjoyed the \\"finer\\" things and the jet-set lifestyle that he would do and risk anything for the wealth that he needed to support his desires.<br />I read this book in the summertime - it is that kind of book - the perfect companion to a lazy day with iced tea or a late night with the air conditioner.

B00000117E|5.0|I revisited this two-record set today after reading the April '08  Guitar Player column \\"10 Ways To Rage Like Rory Gallagher\\" (it had been 6 months or so-I know, I was overdue).Armed with my trusty Strat knock off, Bad Monkey overdrive and my Cyber Twin amp I found Blues Rock Bliss. Favorite tracks for jamming were Cradle Rock, Tattoo'd Lady, A Million Miles Away and Too Much Alcohol (weird experience here-\\"Whiskey can make you drowsy,Gin can make you think\\"-Power Surge,then drop-Rory, are you trying to tell me something?).<br /><br />Sometimes I would just set my guitar down and listen to a master at work. An example of this is \\"As The Crows Flies\\". Spectacular playing and even better singing(with some nice harp work).I swear, I have a complete respect for guys who can sing and play and Rory was up with the best.<br /><br />I read Eric Sardinas  recently  named \\"As The Crows Flies\\" as an early influence. A relative newcomer 21 year old Davy Knowles of the band Back Door Slam  who hails from Isle of Man in the Irish Sea, called himself \\"the biggest Rory Gallagher nut\\" in the latest issue of Guitar Player (I've heard a song by his band and they're good). Joe Bonamassa named Irish Tour '74 as an influential recording (via Wikipedia-he also opened his 2001 cd A New Day Yesterday with Cradle Rock).<br /><br />I can see why these guys all dig Rory so much. Rory Gallagher was one of those artists who were in the game truly for the love of the music,with no compromises (at least not until later-I read he actually used a Marshall stack at one point. The Bassmans, which are the fathers of all Marshalls, were fine).<br /><br />In our hearts, Long Live Rory Gallagher!

0143038419|3.0|Yes, it's a classic Oprah female self discovery book. Yes, there is more than the leopard's share (not really a lion's share, somewhat less than that)of navel gazing. But no, Liz Gilbert is not the shallow, selfish bimbo that negative reviewers make her out to be. She's not narcissistic. She's brutally honest about herself.<br /><br />Would I buy a book like this normally? No - glad I picked it up in a remainder table at B&N, because I would have been annoyed at the flurry of similar books amazon would have started suggesting if I'd bought it OL. Do I feel like I wasted my time reading it? No! It was fun, rather touching, one woman's soul searching journey. Yeah, the India part was meditation 101, but it still served it's purpose by showing her movement forward.<br /><br />The last part of the book about Bali is the best. She showed tremendous growth, IMO, and I'm glad she profited by it on many levels. The pettier flames on amazon are most definitely the product of jealous, resentful, childish resentment. It's kind of scary that people can burble over male self discovery ruminations but get so threatened by a very feminine viewpoint of these things. No small part of that is the need for the Witch to Burn (tm) for not being a pristeen character. Wonder how long it will take for that syndrome to shake out of our culture(s)? THAT'S the most appealing thing about this book to me, the very strong sense of balance between negative and positive in human nature.
B000Y179KO|2.0|I purchased this double CD a couple of days after it hit the Walmart shelves. I was a big fan of the Eagles back in the 70s, when the band was still very much a Country Rock outfit, a band born of the sounds of the Byrds. The Eagles were an infinitely more popular version of the Flying Burrito Brothers, which featured Bernie Leadon along with former Byrds Chris Hillman and Graham Parsons, as well as pedal steel wizard Sneaky Pete. I note those things so that it is clear I do not come to this review as one who recently discovered the Eagles, or even discovered them when Joe Walsh replaced Bernie Leadon, or even discovered them when One of These Nights came to dominate the charts.    There are two great things about Long Road Out of Eden: (1) its massive sales at Walmart alone proved that recording artists can bypass the now bloated, even musically hostile, music industry, make their won contracts with retailers, and do well financially; (2) it is defintely superior to The Long Run, which still sounds to me like a series of outtakes (some disspirited performances and some half finished songs, some songs that ring as pale imitations of past work, some that seem desperate to 'be hits') from One of These Nights and Hotel California.     Over the long run, #1 above easily will prove the more important. My hope is that Walmart and Target both work similar deals with various recording artists, which should help free music from the tentacles of corporate board room that at the least emasculates it in the process of homogenization.    The bad about Long Road Out of Eden is that it easily is only the 6th best of 7 Eagles studio albums of new material. To be fair, considering how awful 'rock' is today, how simultaneously perverse and teeny-bopper MTV/VH1 is, as well as how cliched and poppy 'official' Nashville Country has become, the 5th best all time Eagles record is still better than almost everything else released. But at the end of the day, this album must always be compared ultimately to the first 5 Eagles albums, as well as the 1960s Byrds albums, the 1970s Jackson Browne albums, the first two Flying Burrito Brothers albums, and 1970s Southern Rock classics. And when those comparisons are made, Long Road Out of Eden pales to insignificance.    Yes, there is a full album's worth of first rate - not brilliant - material, but it takes two discs to provide it. The shorthand way to see the problem is to know that JD Souther's 1970s song 'How Long' is the best track, is, in fact, the only one I would consider a worthy, uplifting addition to any of the first five Eagles albums. The harmonies sound great, but the songs overall fail to be more than entertainingly adequate. Three or four are very weak, and that many more are insignificantly stronger.    What all that makes me think about is what is missing from the Eagles as now constituted. I doubt there is any chance Frey and Henley will ever make any acknowledgment that the path they have blazed has guaranteed a pop-rock sound, replete with PC posturing and songs that are superficial compared to their great days. That being the case, I would like to see Bernie Leadon, Randy Meisner, and Don Felder get togther for some picking and grinning. My guess is that whatever came from such time playing together again at least would feature sounds more authentically Country Rock than what Frey and Henley have delivered after so long a wait.

B0013J9KOO|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Guillermo Del Toro, and would recommend any movie by him. And, I'm a big fan of the first Hellboy - it followed the more traditional comic book formula, but the style, acting, and cinematography made up for any shortcomings.<br /><br />But Hellboy 2: The Golden Army blew me away. Asbolutely superb - I couldn't get enough. I must run out and see it again, very soon.<br /><br />This was, in my opinion, not only the best comic book adaptation in recent years, this is one of the best movies since Children of Men. It leaves Iron Man, Hulk, Indiana Jones, & Narnia in the dust. It definitely deserves Oscar nominations in several categories: visual effects, art direction, cinematography, costume design, directing, sound directing, original screenplay, and original score (Danny Elfman).<br /><br />There are so many things to love about this movie, too many to mention. And I hope the art direction & cinematography doesn't go unnoticed by the largely younger audiences.<br /><br />One thing I loved was the mixing of genres - it's a superhero genre, but it added fantasy elements reminiscent of Lord of the Rings (only better, in my opinion). Parts were slightly reminiscent of City of Lost Children (also with Ron Perlman), parts were clearly metropolitan superhero, and parts were underworld/fantasy. The nemisis was interesting and sympathetic, and the new characters were extremel original, and often hilarious.<br /><br />The Troll City underworld was an absolutely fascinating blend of costumes and special effects - it was so visually stunning I could watch it over and over. When the old troll woman opened the doors to the underworld, it took me back to the first time I saw Star Wars A New Hope, when Luke Skywalker and Obi-won walked into the bar with all the aliens. That scene, with the aliens and costumes, dazzled and almost shocked so many viewers and critics in 1977... not since then have I been so awe-struck with special effects and costumes. I truly hope that Hollywood is taking note and following the examples set here by Guillermo Del Toro, in breaking the common mold and setting new standards with these special effects and filmmaking style.<br /><br />The plot was terrific, also, with some layers of complexity. It had a good, progressive, environmental theme, and it avoided more traditional dualistic black/white, good/bad heros and villains.<br /><br />Guillermo Del Toro has outdone himself.

I just couldn't see the vermin as protagonists. They're rabbits, for heaven's sake, not a band of warriors nor a nomadic tribe in the Amazon jungle! The plot plodded and the dialogue was excruciating. My mother nearly had to shoot me to put me out of my misery as I forced my eyes to scan page by page, constantly reminding myself that this was a children's literature classic and a Carnegie medal winner.

B00006L83N|5.0|This was the second Symphony X album I bought; first being The Divine Wings...  All I can say is wow!!!  I mean WOW this album is incredible!  First and foremost, the band as a whole seems to gel so well on this album that hardly anything can compare.  Secondly, I love albums that tell a story; \\"concept albums\\" if you will and this is exactly what the Odyssey is.  A true look at Homer's Odyssey, and the bands own interpretation of it!    1. Inferno (Unleash the Fire) - What a hard and heavy way to begin this peice of art!  I love the way this song just hits you with brute force and never lets up until the very last note!  Allen's vocals on this one are hard to match, and he seems to exude the very power they wanted to capture for the album! 5/5    2. Wicked - Although I love the guitars and bass on this track, it took me a few listens to truly enjoy.  I also do like how Allen is able to maintain a heavy, gruff voice, and keep the power at the same time.  May take you awhile to really enjoy, but stick with it because it's killer! 4/5    3. Incantations of the Apprentice - The bad does and amazing job mixing melody, classical samples, and hard rock in to this one song.  The kicker is, it's done so well that the song doesn't seem forced or rushed at all.  Allen again shows his diverse vocal range, which rounds this song out to be an under-rated pleasure on the album! 4.5/5    4. Accolade II - For those who remember \\"The Accolade\\" off of their \\"Divine Wings...\\" album, this is part 2.  This is the song that hooked me into this album and I truly believe it is their most beautiful peice they have ever written!  Everything flows so smooth on this track, it is just heavy enough as to not out-do the melody, and the classical peices are amazing!  Truly a beauty from a rockin' band! 5/5    5. King of Terrors - Symphony X return to their heavyness on this track, but it doesn't falter one bit!  The guitars on this track are top notch, and the bass harmonizes very well with the hook! 4.5/5    6. The Turning - This is one song where I really took a listen to the lyrics!  I love it!  I like the mystical approach here as it fits with the context of the album, and the guitars again do a wonderful job bringing everything together! 4.5/5    7. Awakenings - The melody returns here, but slightly heavier than on \\"Accolade II.\\"  This is another song that might take two or three listens to get the full appreciation for but again stick with it! 4/5    8. The Odyssey - The 24+ minute epic!!  This song is a peice of art within itself and is worth the purchase of this album alone!  Everything in this song is beautifully written, and all parts are essential to the story!  Allen's vocals here are so well-done that you almost feel as though he's living what he sings!!!  A wonderful way to cap the album off, and a beautifully written story!  5/5!    9. Masquerade (Bonus Track) - If you have this bonus track, you're in luck.  This of course is a track off of their self-titled debut album, but is re-done with Russell Allen on vocals!  A true gem, and a classic to have as a bonus on this already outstanding album! 4.5/5    There you have it, one of the best all around written albums I have ever heard.  The story is amazing and the band tells it so well!  If you're a fan of prog metal, metal, or just music in general, than this is a must own!!

There are some really cool songs on each disc but there is also way too much (boring) filler, sometimes you really can't tell the difference from one song to the next.   I love Judas Priest and will listen to this from time to time as a change of pace but I would rather have spent the money on this CD. I can really only stand to listen to half of a disc at one time.

The car chase in the beginning was wild. The story line begins with a simple guy (Wesley) working in a cubicle-job he hates with an annoying, obnoxious, donut-eating, weight-challenged boss, who talks to him like he is gutter trash.  Even his anxiety meds don't seem to help him deal with her not-so-pleasant attitude.  Even his girlfriend is boinking his so-called best friend.  Wesley is just one of those quiet guys that some people take advantage of. Anyway, he soon is invited to join an elite team of assains, called The Fraternity,\\" and they are unlike most assains.  They are smoother than the hairs on a frog's back.  The Fraternity perform executions, based on a pre-selection process of people determined to be not in everyone's best interests to live.

(Guys, you can get a naked-back shot of Angelina.)<br /><br />Wesley just happens to be the son of one of The Fraternity and possesses talents he is unaware of.  These guys and gals can speed their heart rate up to 400 beats per minute (so everybody else is moving in slow motion) and can shoot the wings off of a fly. (Don't tell Green Peace.)  They can even cause bullets to bend around an object or person to hit a target.  Lots of computer work and lots of action. Other than all the blood and head shots, I thought it was pretty good, but that's just me with the blood thing. By the way, Wesley's initiation into The Fraternity and training is pure HELL! Wesley also gets daddy's possessions (arsenal) and money (3.5 mil). Of course, we get to see Wesley tell his boss to go frig herself.<br /><br />Not for the young and impressionable children.

0735619670|3.0|Code complete is the right title for this book. Sadly most people find it extremely hart to read it. Its great as a reference but reading it word for word is as interesting as watching grass grow. Don't get me wrong. This is a great book. Everyone should at least hold it for once. But do not try to read it as a book. The first 300 pages will be boring. When the actual code chapters begin it gets better but still tends to be tedious.     A great book for beginners but a little boring read for advanced users.
B0013J9KOO|4.0|I loved the original \\"Hellboy\\", it was quite faithful to the highly successful comic series by Mike Mignola. The original film was scrappy, clever, comical, slimy, action-packed but above all, it had Heart and Soul. The original was a movie about destiny and choices; \\"What makes a man a man?\\" Boy, that is one awesome phrase. This summer's sequel, \\"HELLBOY 2: The Golden Army\\" may have all the original film's qualities but somehow, you feel it holding back a little bit and it seems to try to fulfill more genre requirements and contains more straight-forward \\"geekiness\\" than the original. Guillermo Del Toro returns at the helm along with Mike Mignola as co-writer; this sequel is a very enjoyable ride.<br /><br />Hellboy (Ron Perlman) is having a ball. He has an intimate relationship with Liz (Selma Blair), he has a lot of cats, an unlimited supply of candy and cigars, and he watches a ton of television. Sure, he has the usual supernatural tussles as part of the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense, but life is good for Big Red. However, an ancient threat is poised to be awakened by an exiled Prince Nuada (Luke Gross). The Prince intends to awaken the so-called \\"Golden Army\\" composed of self-generating mechanical soldiers to take vengeance upon humanity. It's up to Big Red with the aid of familiar faces Liz and Abe Sapien, along with a new comer named Johann Kraus (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) to try to stop the impending war. But that's the least of Hellboy's issues, didn't I mention he has a girlfriend?<br /><br />Guillermo Del Toro is a great storyteller. \\"Pan's Labyrinth\\" was without a doubt one of the most groundbreaking foreign films ever produced and this is Del Toro's next film after that success. Del Toro seems to have a tiny obsession with the supernatural and it shows. However, this film seems to come straight from the Hollywood oven but it didn't limit his imagination and creativity. This sequel seemed too poised to fulfill genre expectations that the heart of the original film may have been left a little behind. I said \\"a little\\", I didn't say by a lot.<br /><br />It is fairly obvious that this film had a larger budget than the original film. The sequences had more action and the special effects is nothing to sneeze at. The cast is an outrageous bunch of characters with amazing make-up. When I saw the \\"hidden\\" world of supernatural creatures, I thought I was in a Jim Henson movie. I haven't seen this much Fantasy elements compressed in one movie in awhile. With Guillermo's larger budget, we get to see the man's visual ambitions. The \\"Golden Army's \\"appearance itself borders on the ancient and the modern, and the movie is an overload of eye-candy visual effects that exceeds the original that it almost overshadowed the film's main concept.<br /><br />Thankfully, \\"Hellboy 2\\" still has the same feel in regards to its clever script. The dialogue is quite comical at times and there is quite an amount of humor dispersed throughout. Also, the film still has a heart and soul. Hellboy is a demon, an offspring of a major demonic entity destined to destroy the world. As such, he is not human, he is not \\"Iron Man\\", whose heroic attributes can easily be developed. Hellboy does what he does by choice, and while Tony Stark can be admired, Hellboy is hated by the very people he has chosen to protect. The film's powerful morality and humanity is on display when ordinary folks misunderstood Big Red's actions. The moral dilemma; that he is one of the \\"forgotten\\" beings and humans will always turn their back to Hellboy in the end is very involving. Yet, he still does his best protect humanity from the things that \\"go bump in the night\\". Liz (Selma Blair) is Big Red's anchor though all of this and provides him with the will to believe in what he does. Love also plays a key role not just in our main couples' lives but that feeling creeps up on \\"Blue\\" as well. (Abe Sapien)<br /><br />The film has more action sequences than the original. The fights are cleverly executed and stay within the realm of comic book action. Big Red loves to \\"talk\\" while he fights and Ron Perlman does an outstanding job as our hero. The man is perfect as the beer-drinking, cigar smoking, candy-devouring hero. The \\"quippy\\" one-liners give the main character a lot of depth despite all that make up. The main antagonist, Prince Nuada seems to have stolen all his moves from a Hong Kong Martial Arts film. Maybe he went to study in the Shaolin Temple while he was in exile? I was waiting on someone to make a remark like that. Johann Kraus also adds a lot of new energy and \\"misty\\" charisma to the film's proceedings.<br /><br />Despite some flaws and its fixation on goblins and monsters, \\"Hellboy 2: The Golden Army\\" stands as a solid sequel. The film seems so bent on trying to exceed the original's special attributes that it almost lost its spirit. Guillermo del Toro and Mignola are to be commended that despite the overload of certain expected genre elements and fantasy tangents, the film still managed to stand on its own. I almost became concerned that all I came to see were a bunch is visual effects and people in rubber suits but the filmmakers still managed to put together a charming, clever, action-packed \\"popcorn\\" extravaganza.<br /><br />At times, goofy and a lot of times also dramatic, the film nonetheless never loses its forward momentum. \\"Hellboy 2\\" comes with a highly recommended rating from me. The film has a ton of sci-fi/fantasy elements to spare but certain key ingredients including its energy prevent the film from becoming mediocre. This sequel may be more fun to watch than the original but with its predecessor's more \\"human\\" approach, I still found the original \\"Hellboy\\" slightly better. This sequel's sense of purpose and humanity, the humorous moments and infused warmth in the proceedings make it more than your usual \\"super-hero film\\".<br />\\"I just can't Smile without you...\\" (that song is so catchy!)<br /><br />Highly Recommended!

B0018CWEYY|5.0|I've been a \\"lostie\\" from the very beginning. I didn't catch it on the reruns...I didn't borrow someone's DVDs...I was right there from the very beginning and I knew from that very first episode that LOST was not just another show.<br /><br />It's a show that requires thinking and not to sound elitist or anything, but thinking is kind of a lost art - no pun intended - this show forces you to pay attention and look not only at what's happening in the forefront, but also at what's taking place in the background. Of course, this cannot be done with a single viewing and there have been many episodes that I have watched over and over noticing little things here and there that I may not have noticed before. Most of us tend to think that just because we have seen something once we know all there is to know about something. This is a false as well as a dangerous assumption because we never really know all there is to know about anything - ourselve included.<br /><br />Of course, most people don't want to invest their time in something that requires so much thinking. Most people want to be entertained. But not only is this show a \\"thinking person's\\" show, it is also a highly entertaining show, as well and this season really packed a whallop with each and every episode.<br /><br />If there was anything good that came from the writer's strike, it was this season because it forced the writers to really cut back on excess storylines and make each episode tight and to the point. There were a couple of episodes where I just sat there long after the credits rolled up just in total amazement at how incredibly powerful one show could be and if you think that I'm that I'm just gushing to gush, think again.<br /><br />Michael Emerson, the actor who portrays the character Ben, is such a convincing actor on every level. He really makes you think about this character; who is he, really? Why is he the way he is? What are his true intentions? And not only do you think about him, you really feel for this character - at least, I do. He runs the range of human emotions from being downright evil to compassionate and concerned. He's a living, breathing dichotomy and if we're honest with ourselves, most of us are.<br /><br />Someone suggested that this show is \\"ridiculous\\". This show is anything but ridiculous. It may leave you scratching your head, it may have you running to your computer and googling a name like Jeremy Bentham to see what possible information can be uncovered or discovered about that particular person, but it is never ridiculous.<br /><br />The creators of this show decided that they were going to tell a story and sometimes stories have to go a long way to unravel themselves fully and completely but the person who stays with the story is ultimately rewarded. I trust the creators of the show. I firmly believe that they know where they are going with this show and it won't end in some way like it was \\"all just a dream\\" in a character's mind or it was a child's \\"snowglobe\\" or anything remotely similar. I think it will end like it started - a complete mind blower. Most television shows don't want to \\"blow minds\\". They want the viewer to feel \\"comfortably numb\\" and safe.<br /><br />True safety lies not in the known but in the unknown and if you are willing to take the time to get \\"LOST\\" you will be ultimately rewarded in the long run.<br /><br />Peace and Blessings all you losties,<br />john 'the Light Coach'least, I do.

B000B5XOY8|4.0|I'll be the first to admit that nostalgia fuels a sizeable percentage of my purchases. I remember when Dave Matthews Band was cool in high school and I keep buying their records now, even if I don't like them like I used to. The same goes for the original, animated Transformers movie. I bought that before the 2007 movie came out, watched it once, and realized that my tastes have changed since I was five. That movie is almost unwatchably bad. This Batman film, however, is still awesome. I love it. It's still my favorite, even after Batman Begins blew me away. Jack's Joker is great and Michael Keaton will always be my Batman. The look and feel of this movie is dark and exciting without being oppressive. Occassionally the strain on your suspension of disbelief is a little much, but this movie is still well worth your time and your money.
B000JVT09C|1.0|No, its not that I didnt want to like this movie. I loved Superman and Superman II but the series went downhill with Superman III and IV: The Quest For Peace putting the nail in the coffin. But even though Superman 3 and 4  were awful they were more entertaining in their badness than this movie. Bryan Singer made X-Men and X2-X-Men United sizzle on the big screen. But where he succeeded in X-Men he fell on his face here. The whole plot is that Superman(played by Brandon Routh) returns after searching for some so-called remains of his home planet. He comes back a bitter Lois Lane(played by Kate Bosworth)who is upset that he left without saying goodbye. In the meanwhile Lex Luthor(played by Kevin Spacey) finds Superman's hideout and steals his crystals with a peculiar scheme in mind: use the crystals to create a land mass that is practically inhabitable(as you find out later in the movie).<br /><br />Opinion: I dont know where to start when criticizing this movie but here goes nothing. Brandon Routh is bland as Superman/Clark Kent. Christopher Reeve brought some type of charm to his role as Superman while Brandon Routh is just there. Another mistake is Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane. She's bland and doesnt have the spunk that Lois Lane is known for. On a positive side Kevin Spacey is perfect as Lex Luthor(he's no Gene Hackman but he'll do).  Parkey Posey's brainless character \\"Kitty\\" provides some laughs which break the moments of boredom this movie causes. When they're not on the screen, the movie just drags on and on which brings me to my next point: Superman Returns moves at a really slowwwwwwwwww pace. There's hardly any action and even though the special effects are good and Metropolis is nice to look at the movie still feels longer than it has to be. Another complaint is the movie insults the intelligence of its viewers and leaves them with a lot of questions to ask like: If Lois Lane's son was strong enough to kill one of Luthor's goons with a piano than why couldnt he get himself and his mother out of the pantry? How can Superman lift a whole island made up of kryptonite(his Archilles heel)when he had trouble handling Luthor's henchmen on this same island? Why would Lex Luthor, Superman's clever foe come up with such an idiotic idea such as making an island no one can live on? Why would Superman leave withou saying goodbye to Lois Lane? Wasnt he the same one who was willing to give away his powers to be with Lois Lane? Who's bright idea was it to cast Harold of Harold & Kumar fame as one of Luthor's henchmen. You get the drift. This is an incredibly dull superhero flick that just looks good visually but is a bland soap opera that is 154 minutes longer than it needs to be.t himself and his mother out of the pantry?

141694740X|5.0|Although this book seems intended for women who have never been married before, as a recent divorcee, I found this book had a lot of good advice.  I wish I had read it before I married the first time!  Now dating for a second time and really the first time as an adult, its helped me understand why men act the way they do.  The letters interwoven in the book really help illustrate exactly how men are not really into certain relationships.  I, like Greg, know there is someone special out there for me and feel I can better decipher when to get out of a dead-end relationship and get to the relationship I'm meant to have. I've passed the book onto my 18 year old niece so she'll be smarter as she dates. Thanks Greg and Liz!
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|I found out about this new CD (her first in 17 years!) by accident.  I ordered it...and have just about worn it out already.  There are 12 tracks on this CD, and I enjoyed every one of them--something that is very rare for the garbage that is being released under the guise of music these days.<br /><br />The CD starts off with four upbeat (and very danceable) tunes:  Stamp Your Feet, Mr. Music, Crayons, and The Queen is Back.  The Queen is Back is Donna's self-parody.  I did a little reading about this CD, and she was actually reluctant to entitle this tune this name because she thought that was being too snooty!  The one torch song on here is \\"Be Myself Again.\\"  It's words are haunting.  \\"You can have all these hopes and dreams.  The ones I can't use anymore.\\"  The last song, \\"Bring Down the Reign,\\" moved me to tears.  Although not pinpointed as to exactly what \\"reign\\" she's singing about, I think it would be safe to say Darfur and Rawanda leap to mind.<br /><br />Ms. Summer wrote (or co-wrote) all these songs, as she did when she first began recording way-back-when.  That takes talent, my friends.  She doesn't have to be \\"over produced\\" because she can sing.  My friends used to (well, they still do) kid me about a statement I made about her.  I always said that if angels DO exist and they have a singing voice, it will sound like Ms. Summer's.  Her pipes have not lost any of their power and I, for one, am glad the Queen is back!<br /><br />Highly recommended.

1563894696|5.0|Frank Miller might have all the kudos, but Jeff Loeb's story and the artwork by Sale in this graphic novel deserve a place in the Comic Book Hall of Fame.  The story takes place shortly after Batman: Year One ends, and Gotham and Batman are still getting used to each other. Selena Kyle is featured prominently in this novel, and though Batman is the main character the driving force behind this story is Harvey Dent's war on crime.<br /><br />I will be rereading this for years to come (not repeatedly, but once every six months or so).  Strongly recommended.
B0019IB26I|5.0|Young Johnny Boy is really starting to shine with his 30 years of maturity.  I really never cared for his popish stuff a few years back pre electric guitar playing.  He was good, but not really my style.  Since he has been doing the electric thing with his trio and has played with some very veteran blues guys (not to mention any names) for these past few years, I think he has made some huge leaps and bounds.  Something he was always into personally but did not show that side of himself until the last few years.  Now he is really expanding more and more as an artist.  Pretty amazing how he can pull off the SRV and Hendrix vibe but really doing his own thing while making his own statement.  I have to admit, I really like his acoustic playing and singing on the this CD.  Just shows his well roundness as a guitarist / singer.  I like his vocal quality much more now which is showing his maturity as a singer.  Being an excellent guitarist and vocalists, you can go a lot farther in today's market.  Anyway, look forward to listening to him for years to come.  Great CD.  Also bought the DVD of this live concert.

B000YAA68C|5.0|I didn't know what the movie was about when I purchased it, I never read the back before watching it, I had no idea of what it was about. It was a very moving picture, a great love story in which at times I couldn't help shedding a few tears. Gerard Butler is a hunk and it makes you wany to marry an Irish man. This would have to be the best movie I've seen in a long time, Couldn't wait to give it to my daughter to watch and have told all my friends about it.
0743496736|3.0|The book was a little confusing in the beginning by bringing in constant new people from past, present, back to the past, then present. It made sense (looking back), but it could have been better written and planned out.     Anyhoo, the book itself seemed to drag on to get to the point. Once it started building the anticipation, it could get interesting, until it went back to the past again.     The end was somewhat predictable. Anyone with any sense could figure out what would happen to him. The twist at the very end was the most interesting part of the book.

B000WGWQG8|4.0|This is an excellent film biography.  It is clear that great pains have been taken to get the historical details right.  The close involvement of Pullitzer prize-winning biographer David McCollough no doubt helped to ensure this.  At the same time it is not dry history, but engrossing and entertaining, as we get a sense of the truth that history is -- in large measure -- the history of real people.  This is not an exercise in hagiography, not an exercise in myth-building.  John Adams and the other Founding Fathers -- as well as Abigail Adams, and others -- are painted \\"warts and all\\".  Yet at the end we come to respect them and admire them more truly as people we feel that we really do know.    Highly recommended.

Yes I know the CG zombies were too \\"CG\\"....yes I know the ending wasn't anything like the book...blah blah.

0618526412|3.0|This book deals with life in shades of gray, and my feelings about this book are also in shades of gray.  Carson McCullers tackles issues that were prominent in the 1930's, including socialism, poverty, and racism.  The writing is excellent, but I found this book dreary.  Pretty much, it is about disappointment in life.  If a positive message was tucked in, I couldn't glean it. It was hard to read - I would put it down and avoid picking it back up. The author did a good job of drawing her characters in an interesting way, and at a book club we had a lively and riveting discussion on the meaning of the deaf-mute character.  I have thought about this book a lot since finishing it - a characteristic that I usually consider the mark of a great book.  Nevertheless, I wouldn't recommend it to just any casual reader.

B000KX0IOK|4.0|Half Nelson is one of those movies that's so courageously truthful that at times it's hard to keep your eyes on the screen. After the end credits rolled I shuffled out of the theatre still feeling its impact - and then carried it around with me all day.<br /><br />Ryan Gosling is outstanding as Dan, a dynamic eighth grade history teacher in a downward spiral of drug addiction. His young co-star Shareeka Epps is equally compelling as a student with her own share of problems. Most of the things Hollywood has led us to expect from this scenario don't happen in Half Nelson and when they do it's with complete honesty, minus any hint of clich&eacute;. Even the minor characters are entirely convincing but Gosling is so good here that he'll make you flinch and probably even want to cry.

So, guess I am saying this book may appeal to almost anyone!  Enzo is a mixed breed canine, adopted as a pup by a young, up and coming race car driver.  Enzo tells his story, and his master's story, both which have their share of tragedy, heartache, exhiliration and redemption.  And, it is not shallow in its approach to death, the unfairness of life, the sacredness of our relationships, and the importance of being the best we can be, despite our imperfections.  It's an easy read but very satisfying.  Even the most stoic will find a tear form in their eye, especially the last few chapters.  Enjoy!
B000J10EQU|3.0|It sure can't be easy to live up to audience expectations set by movies generations have grown up with like Star Wars. However, I think Superman Returns succeeds where the new Star Wars films failed. After languishing for what seemed an eternity in development hell, Superman Returns, directed by Bryan Singer, is a credit to Singer and his crew, and quite a marvel to behold.<br /><br />Like with Star Wars, audiences have had more than twenty years to process, scrutinize and savor every moment of the 1978 movie version directed by Richard Donner and starring the unpretentious Christopher Reeve. In fact, I found myself at once nostalgic hearing the familiar score by John Williams and from watching the flying blue credits preceding the film. And for but a brief moment, I even expected Christopher Reeve to appear on the screen--just as he was remembered.<br /><br />Though Christopher Reeve did not appear, his presence was definitely felt. A relative unknown, Brandon Routh had an uncanny knack for capturing that which audiences loved about Reeve and adding some of his own personality to the dual roles of Clark Kent and Superman. Even Kate Bosworth brought her own to the role of Lois Lane, made famous on celluloid by Margot Kidder. Her Lois Lane appeared more conflicted than frazzled the way Kidder's Lane always appeared, and it was a welcome and fresh approach. Equally notable was the continuity of a story line from the second film of the original movie run; a perfect segue to this updated rendition. And as the CGI effects of this version dazzle and amaze, the third and fourth installments of the former franchise are easily dismissed like a bad dream.<br /><br />While in recent years iconic comic heroes have been brought to the screen with flair and heart, I think for the updated Superman franchise, the best is yet to come. Though it's clear the film is an homage to the director of the1978 version--with everything from the visual to the spoken echoing its former incarnation--Kevin Spacey's characterization of Lex Luthor was tiresome, trite, and just plain distracting. It was especially disappointing considering the complexity Michael Rosenbaum has given the television version in the Smallville series. That Lex Luthor would have been a wonderfully frightening addition, considering the heart and soul of the Superman Returns script; one in which takes pride in its portrayal of a more complex protagonist, and could have had an equally complex adversary. Instead of wondering what other scheme Luthor might concoct in future installments, I found myself wishing for an indefinite reprieve.<br /><br />But where this movie succeeds in revisiting the celluloid version introduced nearly thirty years ago is the wonderful marriage of special effects and storytelling. This relationship invokes a welcome nostalgia for the old while appreciating the new, complete with a story full of layers and action. Though the length of the movie may turn off some movie-goers, running at 154 minutes, it's well worth viewing for two reasons: first, for fans of the Christopher Reeve Superman, it will leave them feeling nostalgic for the kid who first sat before the giant screen hearing the resounding musical score and watching Reeve fly effortlessly as no one had done before. Secondly, even if you're not a fan of the original movie series, the ease with which Routh's Superman defies gravity, and the impossible task of stepping into roles made cinematically famous three decades ago handled capably, it makes it all too easy to get caught up in the Superman lore.<br /><br />Here's hoping this Superman stays a little while longer.  And unlike the last set of films, only gets better with age.cterization of Lex Luthor was tiresome, trite, and just plain distracting.

B000VSBX34|4.0|There isn't that much left to be said...the Beatles and their songs are what you buy this movie for...it certainly isn't for the acting or the story.  It is a bit like watching an extended music video; the songs are draped across the plot here and there, and the plot often is there to support the songs. My 4-year old loves it and dances around and around when the title song comes on, and with a couple of the other songs, and I confess I get up and dance with her.  The restoration of this 40+-year old movie is really, really good and as a Beatles fan, I sure appreciate and applaud the work that was done.

B00004ZAV3|5.0|What else can you say about the greatest pop band in history to date?  This album showcases all the bands \\"number 1 hits\\".  All the tracks are remastered, and there are enough of them on the disc to keep the new or old Beatles fan singing for quite some time. Yes, all these songs are available on some other album, but this disc reveals to you in chronological order how the Beatles tunes could change and the listeners changed with them.  From the poppy love songs of the beginning, to the trippy songs in the middle, and back out the other side with the mature songs of the later years.  All in all a great summation of the Beatles amazing talent.  If you're an old Beatles fan who wants to hear them again, or a newbie who's just getting started, this album is a great compilation in my opinion.
0385040253|3.0|I recently bought the Ashely book of knots because I thought it would tell me how to tie every knot on the planet.  I found it a bit confusing because it did not use colors to illustrate the knot ties.  It was hard to follow most of the knot patterns.  Also it did not have climbing knots used by most rescue people.  I found a great site that does animation and colors: [...] .  Perhaps if the book came with a DVD it would be better. I know it is an old book...but come on...we have new technology now!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I saw the mini series on HBO. So, I purchased the DVD immediately when Amazon made it available. The DVD is excellent. It can be used as a great educational tool. I learned alot more about the general history of of our country and ,also, the history and the beginnings of politics in our country. The DVD is now being shared with some friends.
B000TLMWMY|5.0|These DVD's brought back wonderful memories of many great artists of the country, rock and jazz era of the 60's and 70's.  This is the America I remember.  These 4 hours of entertainment can't be recreated again.  This collection is a must for the Johnny Cash lover's out there.
B00097A5I6|4.0|Ever since their second album, the blockbuster \\"(What's the Story) Morning Glory\\", Oasis have been fairly hit-or-miss when it came to the songs. Their third: too bloated and too long. Their fourth: too cerebral and not enough hooks. And their previous record felt like it was trying to replicate their previous success but they only remembered half of what it was. However the maturity seemed to get a little improved with each record and songs were created that were not just simply radio-geared but focused a bit more on their songwriting, as borrowed and/or cliched as it is. \\"Don't Believe the Truth\\" was marked as a return-to-form and while they've gotten better in key areas, there's some things that they still haven't been able to replicate: that of a killer pop tune hook.    Turn Up the Sun: Opening with some minor arpeggios, the track then becomes a big rock track with Liam's vocals coming in which sound a bit raspier than usual. It's pretty simple as far as tunes go but it grew on me and while I wouldn't consider one of their best, it's decent enough as a song. 7.5/10    Mucky Fingers: Just like \\"Force of Nature\\" with its irritating beat, we have this song. It's basically 3 chords repeating for quite awhile with pounding drums for the beat and it gets old really quickly. Noel basically yells the lyrics and there's really no redeeming value to this one. 4/10    Lyla: Despite the band's claim that this isn't even in the top 5 songs on the record, I have to disagree. Catchy rhythm, a chorus to sing along to and even though its pop hooks are a bit more obvious than other songs on the record, doesn't stop it from being quite listenable. The long outro is back though (they gotta stop doing that). 8.5/10    Love Like a Bomb: A Liam-penned tune that isn't quite as great as \\"Songbird\\" but it's quite good in its own right with some good vocals in the chorus and some la-la-la's for extra catchiness. It's pretty short but a good one. 8/10    The Importance of Being Idle: Quitedifferent than they normally do and while one can tell based on the guitar tones it's not that different, musically it's not as balls-to-the-wall rock or acoustic pop that they normally do and Noel does a good job singing the falsettos in the chorus complete with staccato chords. 9/10    The Meaning of Soul: Barring the \\"Jumpin Jack Flash\\"-sounding line in the chorus, this is a nice burst of acoustic rock penned by Liam. It's quite short but it's a cool song and quite enjoyable to hear. Nothing else to say about it really. 8/10    Guess God Thinks I'm Abel: Bit of Middle Eastern-type chords and it's probably Liam's best track on the album. The song could've easily fit on the \\"Giants\\" record since it's a bit more experimental than usual. One complaint is the loud burst of sound at the end. It kind of kills the feel of the whole thing. 8/10    Part of the Queue: To tell the truth, this track is kind of boring. It just sort of lurches on with Noel doing a similar yelling/singing like on \\"Mucky Fingers\\" only the song isn't quite as annoying. I love the piano riff during the bridge and only thing that really saves this one. 7/10    Keep the Dream Alive: Quite an enjoyable track and even though it's pretty basic during the verses, the chorus picks up and Liam sounds really great and is one of the more enjoyable tracks on the record because of it with some nah-nah's to top it off. 8.5/10    A Bell Will Ring: Another underrated highlight and it's got that classic Oasis feel with Liam sounding great and it's \\"all will be brand new\\" might get stuck in your head. My only complaint is like most of the songs on the record, the mix sounds a little too noisy but oh well. 8/10    Let There Be Love: If \\"Acquiesce\\" was the loud anthemic rocker duet, this is on the other end with delicate acoustic strumming, piano chords and it's pretty enjoyable with Liam and Noel both taking turns singing the track. Another highlight off the record and ends the record on a bit more somber-yet-hopeful light. 8/10    There's some records bands will do where they seem less concerned with getting a top 10 hit and just want to write solid tracks. \\"Don't Believe the Truth\\" is basically the same and while only a handful of these tracks can compete with their best work, it's a pretty solid record in the end.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|My dream since I saw it when it first came out has been to own my own copy of this film, and DVD now makes that possible. It is in surprisingly good condition after all those years.
B000062X90|5.0|\\"Argus\\" was and still is Wishbone Ash's ultimate statement.  Part progressive rock,  part blues / boogie rock and a bit of fok rock thrown in, this album really put all of the band's strengths together to form what is in my mind one of the classic guitar albums of the early 70's.  The band actually had a hit single from this one with what is in my opinion the weakest track \\"Blowin Free\\".  Even though it is my least favorite it is still a good song.  The move towards more progressive material with \\"Warrior\\" and \\"Throw Down The Sword\\" was a great move and both tracks provide some of the best twin harmony guitar jams of the 70's.  Tracks like \\"Time Was\\" and \\"Leaf And Stream\\" retain a folk consciousness and \\"The King Will\\" come remains a cool mini-epic song.  If you have never explored Wishbone Ash this is the album to start with.  Some of their other discs are very good, but this is the band at their high water mark.
B000ION79Y|1.0|I cant even tell you what the plot of this movie was cause it was so damn boring. 40 mins in, i had turn it off, i could not take anymore of this crap. Avoid it at all costs.
0452289963|5.0|I read thePower of Now because there is no way that now is not very powerful, so, I thought, why not? Now he's at it again with this new book that's getting really good reviews from Orpa Winfrey. I was like, why not, again? Also I forgot to mention that Tolle has a beard like nothing I've ever seen before, which is impressive.<br /><br />Many spiritual leaders have beards, and Tolle is no exception. Especially Buddhits, who Tolle resembles in many of his nonviolent ways, except if you think that egotistical is a weapon. In which case Tolle is egotistical enough to be deadly or at least controlling. This book makes me kind of think he wants to be the boss of me. Which is his own awakening, so who am I to argue with that? Maybe everybody is supposed to be the boss of everybody else. That is my awakening. I call my philosopy \\"Boss Love.\\"
B000002O4X|5.0|This movie is a classic and one never tires of the music. Took and amazing trip through Eastern Africa and visited areas where the movie was filmed.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|... and better than ever! I do not know which process they used to re-master the movie, but it is, quite frankly, better than the laserdisc version. Absolutely outstanding.     I have always been a fan of the original theatrical version and unfortunately was only released on the laserdisc format under the criterion collection prior for the North American market.    The visuals are stunning. The first sequence on a blu-ray player and a 1080p television will simply take your breath away.     Just one glitch: they did not remove the awful cables taking the car up when it is raining; in this digital time, it would have been easy to remove; especialy that they re-shot the scene of the snake lady being shot (you were able to make out quite easily it was a man in a 'lady suit'); they should have done this one too.    But hey, that's me... Otherwise, absolutely stunning. The one Blu-Ray that is not computer-animated that is worth every single penny.    Now I just hope that Disney will come up with Tron for Blu-ray and that they will use the same technology to clean the movie and make it pristine.
1594489505|5.0|A Thousand Splendid Suns and The Kite Runner by Hossein are both splendid  and skilled writings; page turners.  His ability to transfer you into the scene, the emotion, the tragdy, and the profound depths of a better understanding of another Country, Culture and Beliefs are enlightening, soul moving and educational.  I am looking forward to his next book.
B00005JMXX|5.0|Product was in excellent shape and arrived in a timely fashion. Thank you thank you thank you *****
B000002JPA|5.0|I picked this album up on an impulse and I must say, it was a good buy.  This was Dream Theater's second studio album and contains their only big radio hit, \\"Pull Me Under\\".  The whole album is an awesome display of musicianship and is a real treat to listen to.  If you are a fan of the band, or liked \\"Pull Me Under\\", it is certainly worth the buy.
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|This film is really action packed as Jason again tries to find his identity.  The subconscious skill level with which he protects himself and outsmarts those they created him is fascinating and portrays what a human can do with proper training. While I could personally do without the level of violence used in the film it certainly is nowhere near the amount or gratuitous violence one would experience with a Quentin Tarantino film. I would recommend this film if you liked the first one... great sequel!  Peter Anderson
B000021XS0|5.0|I picked this album up on a recommendation from a friend, and what a recommendation it was!  The musicianship shown by the members of Dream Theater is jaw-dropping.  It is an album that I can say beyond a shadow of a doubt will constantly be in any playlist that I make!  The song \\"Through Her Eyes\\" nearly brings me to tears every time I listen to it.  I can safely say that if you are a fan of Progressive, Metal, or any mix thereof, you will love this album.  It has some hard driving rock, some searing solos (on guitar, keyboards, and drums, occasionally all at once).  If you are even a little bit interested in Dream Theater or have heard them through the grapevine, pick this one up, you won't regret it!
0399103422|5.0|This book has differences with the movie, in fact Mario Puzo was kid mad with Coppola por the arrangements on the movie but it is marvelous is a must to every fan of The Godfather. You got more nervous, tense and excited with the book!
B0017MO10U|4.0|Several weeks ago, I was invited to a Special Viewing of Stargate SG-1 Continuum.  I was, obviously, very excited and shocked that I was chosen to see the movie before it came out...  Plus, with all the reviews stating that this would be a typical SG1 episode (With Rick), I couldn't wait!  (What can I say, I'm a HUGE RDA fan!)...  The beginning of the movie was perfect.  To see the \\"Old Gang\\" together, again, made the opening that much more enjoyable!  Plus, RDA was great with the character moments, and just him being himself!  Trust me when I tell you that you will not be disappointed in the beginning...!  After the beginning of the movie, it seems that the writers had to \\"cheat\\" to allow the main characters to keep their memory of the altered time-line!  The other problem with the movie is that it seemed to be rushed to a certain degree!    I will admit that is was extremely nice to see so many old faces, but the problem was that there wasn't enough time to spend \\"quality\\" time with all of them, and the fact of the matter is that the writers had to keep the story moving!!  I will admit that they did, thankfully, have a few more character moments between the cast than in SG-1's \\"Ark Of Truth\\", but it still wasn't enough in my opinion.    Please do not get the idea that this movie was bad...  In fact, I'd recommend it to anyone that enjoys the Stargate show, but at the end of the movie, you will feel like something was missing, and you'll want more, but you'll have to wait for another Stargate movie to be made!!  (BTW, don't forget to look at Col. Mitchell's locker...  Something will have changed; can you see what it is?)  What was it Jack O'Neil said, \\"Even us humans know time travel is nothing but trouble...!\\"  In any case, I would still recommend this movie to any Stargate SG-1 fan, but in my opinion, I believe that \\"Ark of Truth\\" was a better movie, though not by much!  However, I will be purchasing this movie, and hope you all do the same!  Besides, if we all purchase this movie, then MGM may make more SG1 movies!  (Or, perhaps they'll bring it back to T.V)
B00024I15U|5.0|This is an excelente movie, despite it's age and the theme it's more enjoyable than any of the copies that we see these days, this is the original, the one, with the magnificent cast, and the beautiful scenery and the passion of Franco Nero that only he can deliver
B000002UYZ|4.0|A very good compilation, nothing to say about the songs included here. But I think that if you're looking something to start, you can buy this item and the blue album. Another good choice would be the CD called \\"1\\", but you wouldn't get some tunes included in this item and its companion (the blue album), but surely a far better sound since the \\"1\\" album was given a very good remastering that this compilations lacks, (that's the reason for which I rate this item \\"only\\" with four stars) and you will pay less for a single disc compilation. Both choices are here, and each one has its pros and cons, but anyway you can't go wrong with any choice you take.
B0010KHOS0|5.0|First I have to state that both Witherspoon and Phoenix really captured the essence of the two real life characters.  I was also impressed by their ability to pull off doing their own music.  The extended sequences, musical scenes, and all the featurettes really fleshed out the Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash's early days.  Their story brought out by the strong acting abilities of the cast and shows how love can develop and, if you know the rest of their story, last.  Quite rare these days.  So BRAVO for this excellent film...plus the soundtrack that goes with it.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Excellent value. Will purchase again. Delivered as promised. The cost of five is what one battery will cost retail.
B000002J03|5.0|How can anyone give this album less than 5 stars? This is Led Zeppelin at their best. Every song on the album is a hit.
B000002J1Y|5.0|... the best album in the history of recorded music. Sit back, relax and enjoy!
B000068IEU|1.0|I know a lot of people who love this movie and swear its the best thing since Suspiria. NOT TRUE!! At least in my humble opinion. I watched it when it came on demand (cable people know) and I am so glad I did not waste my money on this ridiculous movie.<br /><br />Two idiot girls are chased and raped and everything else by these dumb convicts. Unless I am wrong, and believe me, I tried to give it a fair chance and watched it twice, I just don't see what all the fuss is about. Proven by the fact that every used dvd store in my area has a hundred copies. Don't waste your money unless you like low budget torture movies with a ridiculous plot.
B0017KP93U|4.0|It is a good collection of the songs.  The remastered sound is good.  but I like their albums a lot better.
B000FSME1A|4.0|Its great it has both versions, the only problem is that the extended version is a little bit long. But its Great.
0930289234|4.0|People told me that this would be the ultimate graphic novel experience and it was in a way, but dated Cold War elements have made this one a little topheavy.  I wonder how the forthcoming movie version will play, or if the nuclear threat plot has been toned down or something?  Time, or AICN, will tell, I suppose, but at the end of the day I found myself thinking, when the ridiculously contrived superplot was revealed, that how was this supposed to actually alter the course of history?  At any moment any number of its complicated twists and turns might have gone wrong.  Just like the Roger Moore Bond films, the villain brags on and on for hours at the end, detailing every move he made for otherwise we would never be able to grasp the extent of his skullduggery.  Well, this \\"bragging\\" scene happens in every action show or novel now, but Moore disappointed me, I thought he was above such showboating.<br /><br />The storyline is great for the most part (till the last 3 or 4 comics) with the triangle of Silk Spectre, Nite Owl, Dr Manhattan tantalizingly slow to resolve itself--though how did Laurie deal with that little blue nub of Dr. Manhattan's, bobbling above that ponderous sack ofballs, that nubby nothing which looks so huge in the scenes where he stalks the earth as a giant?  No wonder she fled to Dan's more normal size masculinity, even though he's fortyish and his body nothing much.<br /><br />The minor characters are uniformly perverse, unsympathetic, nasty and brutish--made it hard to care about the world's possible destruction.  And Laurie crying about the pink and yellow rice spilled on the bodies of the scattered New Yorkers--it was an inspired and risky choice that just doesn't cut it, if you ask me.  But for many the scene is probably one of the most wrenching and powerful in the whole of literature, so don't go by me.  Same with the \\"Tales of the Black Freighter\\"--rigorously plotted allegorical masterpiece, or confusing sub Knut Hamsun junk?  Eye of the beholder, brother.beholder, brother.
0553213105|5.0|Not someone properly suited for such a task, I can tell you that.  What I can do, however, is give an honest and heartfelt account of what I thought of Jane Austen's 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE'.  I have always wanted to read some of the classics but have never up until now dug up the courage to actually do so.  I thought if I was going to start reading a classic novel Jane Austen would probably be a good author to start with and what better choice was there than her stand out 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' ?  I was pleased to find out that I was absolutely right.  'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' has to be one of the most romantic novels that I have ever read.  The romance between Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy literally made me swoon quite often (and I don't swoon!).  Romance mixed with a little bit of drama and Austen's most descriptive prose made it impossible for me to put this book down.  Now I see why 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' is on so many people's favorites list because now it is most certainly on mine.
B001437DMA|3.0|Certainly, the last CD I REALLY loved was Crystal Planet. Why can't he make me feel good- like life -he try to? Asik Vaysel is great I used to expect from Satch.

B00004YRQA|1.0|I gaving a rating of one star because I can't say anything about this product since I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED IT (it was my FIRST online purchase via amazon)..the seller advised that the commercial invoice was sent, but I got notice that they are STILL waiting for said INVOICE to release my purchase.

1582701709|5.0|It is amazing to me how a \\"law of attraction\\" book can be so polarizing to its readers. Whether it is The Secret, or Think and Grow Rich, or The Science of Getting Rich, et al; readers either love the law of attraction and embrace its principles or loathe it as being pseudo-science new agey nonsense.<br /><br />A friend of mine introduced me to The Secret and I was quite skeptical. She relayed several stories of how the law of attraction had been working in her own life (since even before her reading The Secret; she has been a student of the metaphysical for some time) and it seemed interesting but not compelling enough for me to look into it. I frankly thought she was just *lucky*.<br /><br />Then for my birthday she gave me the book and The Secret Gratitude Journal. I read the book over the span of a week and began using the journal a few days later. Encouraged by a few small positive changes (and unusual, um, coincidences) that took place, I borrowed the DVD. The three tools together were very powerful! I have put the principles into practice, and they are indeed working for me. Others have explained their situations eloquently and articulately, so I won't go into detail. But just quickly: my husband took me on an unexpected vacation just weeks after we came back from a planned trip, I sold my car for more than I asked for, I bought my new car and was able to effortlessly negotiate a ridiculously low rate for my auto loan - just to name a few...all in the space of the two months since I read the book and started using the mindset expressed within it.<br /><br />The Secret is not the be-all and end-all of law of attraction studies; I have been now reading Wallace Wattles and Deepak Chopra among others and finding complementary principles with which to work. No, I do not think the universe revolves around me nor do I think that we attract everything to us. (For example, in the case of mass murders, etc., I think the opposing forces strongly attracted the event and the victims were caught in it. That's my \\"short\\" answer for purposes of the review. This isn't a message board so I will not elaborate here.) But I do think that how we think about ourselves and our circumstances does have a major affect on what plays out for us.<br /><br />If you at all open to new ideas (or, in this case, old ideas in a new package) then you owe it to yourself to at least have a look at The Secret your local library. Take what you can, leave the rest. If you can be grateful for what you have, it makes it that much easier for good things to come your way. Just don't take the book so literally that you sit and waste your life daydreaming. Visualization without action is simply wishful thinking. Read the book, read other books on the same subject, and then DO SOMETHING. If you act from the heart, I think you will be as pleasantly surprised as I have been.in it.

B0000DJZ8R|4.0|While I loved the book madly, I simply liked the film version of it very much.  I guess my only complaint, if I had to list one in order to justify not giving it five stars, is that it was made in 1940.  The actors are good; the story is great.  If you like classic movies--like I do--you'll really like this one.  It's better than most of the classics I've seen.  But I can also sympathize with those people who find that the older movies put them to sleep.  If that's the case with you, you probably won't enjoy this one, either.
0061537934|4.0|I wanted to rate this 3 1/2 stars but Amazon does let you do that :-)    It was worth reading.. As a dog lover, I found it a little weird to have a dog who was smarter than me :-)  I kept thinking, if the dog was that smart.. heck he could have typed something up for his owner on the computer.  He was smart enough to read the child custody papers :-)    I also don't like knowing the ending at the beginning of a book.. Maybe that is just me.    All in all, it was a worthwhile read at 3.5 stars.
0393312836|2.0|I can see how people would find this book to be neat.  It's defintely unique.  I didn't enjoy it, though.  I am a reader who likes to get swept onto the page and become the protagonist's shadow, and with this book's inventive language I found that impossible.  I could never get into a flow because too often (every paragraph for at least the first seven chapters) I had to stop and figure out what the protagonist was trying to say.  I nearly put it down for good when I got about halfway through it.  I'm glad I pushed on, though, because the last third of the book--the point in which I had finally figured out enough of the protagonist's language to not have to work so hard--was pretty good.        If you like Shakespeare, you'll probably like this book.
006074815X|4.0|I won't go into the plot of the book because it seems every other reviewer does.    I found it entertaining to read.  It develops and brings together characters nicely.. he paints a nice picture of what is going on in your \\"minds eye\\".      Luckily I had never seen the movie to provide me with any input other than my own little brain :-)    I will be reading more of his work.
0345349571|5.0|Barbara Tuchman's A Distant Mirror is a study of European Medieval history centered on the Black Death (1348-50) and encompassing the period between 1300 and approximately 1450.  Written from the narrative perspective, she follows the life of one Enguerrand de Coucy VII (1340-97), a member of the senior nobility of France whose barony in the center of Picardy was the largest in France and who took part in nearly every major French exploit of his time.  He was also the patron of Jean Froissart, the preeminent chronicler of the time, whose works have been preserved in history, and thus much is known about Enguerrand de Coucy that might otherwise have been lost in antiquity.  Tuchman chose to base her study of this period on a known person of the period in order to ground her study in factual occurrences, and this she accomplishes to a marvelous degree.  Through nearly six hundred pages of thoroughly researched material, she takes the reader from the founding of the Coucy dynasty, through the debacle at Poitiers, the Black Death, the various campaigns of England to capture the crown of France, the Great Schism of the catholic church, French pretensions in Italy, the Siege of Barbary, and the greatest debacle at the close of the 14th century, the Battle of Nicopolis, which, though it was a severe loss to French and European forces nevertheless served to check Islamic advance into Europe.  Throughout her narration of this history, she presents key aspects of life during this period, describing the livelihood of the peasantry, of the bourgeoisie, of Medieval economy and medicine and religion; of military tactics and the flow of political currents throughout Europe (as centered about France); and generally describing domestic life of the great and the humble.  Her recounting of the entrance of the Black Death and its subsequent reappearances over a fifty year period are especially riveting, as she exposes detail after detail of the effects of population reduction on farming, tax revenue, society, marriage, art, politics, religion, and more.  We read of entire priories and monasteries reduced to empty stone halls; of the village or city accountant records describing in woeful detail declining revenue from this or that parish; or of villages that slowly crumble and return to the wilderness as its inhabitants die out to every last man woman and child.  It is harrowing in detail.      The depth of detail that Tuchman brings to her study is enormous and extracted from countless trips to libraries, city archives, and church records throughout France, England, and other countries.  Tuchman also uses first and second person narrative in presenting conversations that occurred in this period, using these as taken from the chroniclers of the period.  Such conversations are not, of course, to be taken literally, and Tuchman qualifies such presentations at the outset.  Yet Tuchman understands the inherent value of such presentations in providing the reader with a sense of mood and choreography of the time.  Readers of ancient literature will be familiar with this approach, for it was common in ancient times to present what were little more than fabricated conversations among historical persons, which were presented less as exact and factual recollections of such conversations but more provided to convey the sense of impact, mood and impression that the actual conversation likely had.  Pericles' funeral oration, as presented by Thucydides, is a good example of this from ancient history.  Tuchman brings the chroniclers into her study for similar reasons, writing as she does not for rigorous historians but for the lay reader interested in this period of European history.  Truly, this book finds a competent middle ground, in that it exposes the reader to countless factual elements of Medieval history, while still adhering to her vision that \\"...the writer's object should be to hold the reader's attention. I want the reader to turn the page and keep on turning until the end. This is accomplished only when the narrative moves steadily ahead, not when it comes to a weary standstill, overloaded with every item uncovered in the research.\\"    Tuchman brought to her development of A Distant Mirror considerable previous experience as a journalist, writer, and historian.  Born into a prominent family with significant international experience - for example, her grandfather Henry Morgenthau Sr. was President Woodrow Wilson's ambassador to Turkey in 1913 and who wrote numerous papers and articles on political events of the time - Tuchman had already written twelve books on various historical topics, two of which received significant literary recognition and to have been awarded Pulitzer prizes - The Proud Tower (1968) and Sand Against the Wind: Stilwell and the American Experience in China, 1911-45 (1971).  Such was the recognition of her talent that she received honorary doctorates in literature from Yale, Columbia, Bates, New York University, Williams, and Smith.  She was nominated and admitted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and was elected president of the Academy in 1978, which awarded her the Gold Medal for History in 1978.  She also received international recognition for her literary talent through her induction into the Order of Leopold, first class.  Yet, for all her academic and literary recognition, Tuchman was still a grounded individual.  When her husband expressed concern about bringing children into a world torn by WWII, Tuchman recounted that \\"Sensible for once, I argued that if we waited for the outlook to improve, we might wait forever, and that if we wanted a child at all we should have it now, regardless of Hitler,\\" noting that, \\"The tyranny of men not being quite as total as today's feminists would have us believe, our first daughter was born nine months later.\\"  Her groundedness was evident in the approach she took in conducting historical research.  Not content to spend hours whiling away in libraries, she toured the sites associated with her historical studies, such as the sites of land battles in her book, The Guns of August, even following the invasion routes that German armies took through Luxembourg, Belgium, and Northern France on route to Paris, taking notes on 4x6 note cards that she stored in shoeboxes.  Later, in recounting her lack of academic title or degree, she noted that \\"It's what saved me.  If I had taken a doctoral degree, it would have stifled any writing capacity.\\"    A Distant Mirror is a masterpiece of fact and narrative of Medieval history, accomplishing, in Tuchman's summary of the historical process, \\"a sense of history as accidental and perhaps cyclical, of human conduct as a steady stream running through endless fields of changing circumstances, of good and bad always coexisting and inextricably mixed in periods as in people, of cross-currents and counter-currents usually present to contradict too-easy generalizations.\\"
B0009QZ4CO|5.0|In response to Onelove's review, I have to say that if you're just dipping your toe into Hammill/VDGG, you're not in any place to make comparisons or give advice. Gentle Giant and Tull are great bands, and they were contemporaries of VDGG in the good old days of 70s prog, but comparing them is pointless as it implies imitation when VDGG (well, all of them really) were originators. \\"King Crimson with keyboards\\" might be a more meaningful analogy, because of the complexity and the collaboration between Fripp and Hammill. Either way, if you don't know already, you're way behind the curve. Posting a review here is preaching to the converted, after all. My Room (Waiting For Wonderland) was the first track I ever heard by the band and is still their purest ballad -- a beautiful song.  As for the rest, dark, intense prog, with Hammill's voice like Bowie on mescaline and Messrs. Banton, Jackson, and Evans  firing on all six cylinders.  The earlier Pawn Hearts also gets 5 stars, VDGG fans (IMHO).

B0000AUHPG|5.0|Looked many places and finally found on Amazon. It arrived here promptly and I have been enjoying it very much.
B00168OINK|5.0|Want to know how Chinese think about it? I'm a typical Shanghaiese living in Shanghai forever, guess my voice counts. Everybody loves the movie here, including myself. Simple as the story is, it is beautifully done -- the rhythm of the story, the use of Chinese elements and the kung fu moves.     None of us complained that the movie was not China enough, 'coz nobody expected for that. How could you expect an English speaking panda to be Chinese? If dreamworks ever tried to make *real* Chinese characters, I think they failed on this, badly. All characters in the movie are very American, they were just in Chinese outfits. But still, Po is such a cute lovable panda, and Shifu and Wugui are also impressive. \\"The Five\\" are a little bit weak. The worse is the bad guy - I cannot even recall his name - it's no personality, just a bad guy.    I was also very happy to see lots of Chinese elements too. Although they were used in a little bit exaggerated way (for example, the building style, and the outfits of regular people in the valley), it's relatively better than other *fake* Chinese movies, especially the music.
0486446859|5.0|I heartily concur with all the other reviews as far as the necessity of exposing children to Rackham's illustrations as soon as possible.  Hopefully this would happen in part through his books, like his Aesop's Fables, Favorite Tales From Grimm, Alice and Wonderland, etc.  So my purpose is more practical:  to say that the two Dover collections of his pictures, this and Rackham's Fairy Tale Illustrations are very true to Rackham's original color illustrations.  I have seen reproductions of some of his illustrations that make his colors seem muddy.  He uses a lot of dark colors in his work, but he also used many subtle light colors which have been captured well here.  A great value for the money, along with the Fairy Tale book.  All the pictures are suitable for framing.
B0018AK9RK|5.0|It was obvious from the beginning that some people would love this CD and others would hate it. Hardcore fans who want little else than a regurgitation of Painkiller will be severely disappointed. Those who are able to open their minds and explore a new world of Priest will find this CD to be an absolutely amazing journey. This piece of work displays a depth that most bands never reach.    There is no one formula or sound that makes this album. It is a combination of musical styles that requires you to listen to this album multiple times to actually \\"get it.\\" This is precisely why some people will never \\"get it.\\" Sadly they are missing out on one of the most amazing concept albums ever written. There are no instant radio hits here.    When you do take the time to be absorbed into the world of Nostradamus, you find layers of music rather than just a catchy guitar riff. With Nostradamus, Priest are again pioneers, blending heavy metal with operatic verses and orchestral accompaniments. If for no other reason, this CD is worth purchasing just to hear Rob Halford sing in Italian on \\"Pestilence and Plague.\\" Halford shows that he is not just The Metal God, unleashing screams that will shatter glass and fragile ear drums, but that he is also a vocalist who SINGS with far more energy and talent than any pop tart that Fox Television tries to make into an \\"idol.\\" This is not bubble-gum rock boys and girls. This is not pretty. This is not the 4 minute hit single they play on MTV with a bunch of screaming kids who don't even know what they are screaming at. This is Judas Priest. This is Rock & Roll. This is Heavy Metal. But this time, it's done with finesse that's usually reserved for much different musical genres. Congratulations to Judas Priest for taking the chance, and for doing it exceptionally well. There's a reason why this band is selling out arenas almost 35 years after their inception.    My final advice to anyone looking to purchase this CD. Do it! But you need to put in the time with this album to appreciate it. Priest took over two years to write and record this album. Listen to it in full- from beginning to end. Then do it again. And again. You need to immerse yourself into the world they created to truly appreciate it. If you put in the time, you will reap the rewards that this masterpiece has to offer.    All hail to the Call of The Priest and bow before The Metal Gods!     Also note- the deluxe addition is a beautiful package with a hardcover book and all the lyrics, as well as a short biography of Nostradamus' life. It's well worth the extra few dollars.
0452289963|5.0|It looks like wolves in sheep's clothing to see the attacks from supposedly good Christians on books like this one extolling the details on spiritual connection.   Jesus was a revolutionary teaching that the Kingdom is Within and overturning the tables of the money changers in the Temple.  Looks like we need more revolutionaries like he today!!!!   So it is very Revealing just who stands up for what in their examples.  Look carefully at these analyses people, for the Kingdom is close at hand and you don't want new age inquisitors messing it up. . .   If you haven't heard of the newer quantum science behind these spiritual ideas, just read Dr. Rick Strassman or Amit Goswami, the Self Aware Universe.  Or Graham Hancock, Supernatural: Meetings with the ancient teachers of mankind.   The new quantum physics and mechanics realizations are helping us understand who we really are as eternal souls, and that includes everyone, not just so called good christians connected with powerful money-grubbing churches.
B000UJCALI|4.0|Since I suspect that most people reading this have already seen \\"The Shining\\" and already have an opinion, I'm not going to comment on the plot.  Instead I'm going to review the extra features.    \\"Crafting the Shining\\" - This was the first DVD extra that I watched, and I enjoyed it a lot.  I thought it was a concise, well done look behind-the-scenes with a lot of interesting trivia and interviews.    \\"Visions of Stanley Kubrick\\" - This is a short homage to Kubrick.  It looks at all of his films to showcase the sort of artist he was.    \\"Making of the Shining\\" - This is the exact same documentary as on the \\"Collection\\" VHS tape.  However, a nice addition is the option of listening to a new commentary by Vivian Kubrick.  I enjoyed hearing her stories.  She had the unique perspective of being a 17 year old bystander on the set.  I wish they had asked her to take part in the commentary for the full movie on disc 1.    \\"Wendy Carlos\\" - This is an interesting look at the musical sequences that didn't make it into the final cut of The Shining and Clockwork Orange.    Disc 1 special features - The only extra feature on disc 1 is the commentary by the steadycam operator and a Kubrick biographer.  This commentary is why I gave the dvd only 4 stars instead of 5.  The biggest disappointment was that they repeat a lot of what was already said in the extra features on Disc 2.  The two commentators were recorded separately and then spliced together.  The steadycam operator was humorous to listen to and he also keeps you interested because of his unique perspective as a crew member on set almost every day during filming.  The biographer's commentary, on the other hand, was disappointing.  A few of his comments were insightful, but everyone watching with me felt he sounded pompous.  A lot of his comments sound like an art critic fawning over Kubrick while pointing out the obvious.  Suffice to say, I wish they had paired the steadycam operator up with someone different for the commentary.  It's a shame they couldn't get Nicholson or one of the other actors to provide commentary.   I would have enjoyed it more listening to a second person who had actually been there during filming.    Overall, I felt it was worth paying the extra money for this 2 disc dvd as an upgrade from my old VHS copy.  The picture quality looks good.  I'm happy with my choice.  But anyone who isn't a huge fan will probably be completely satisfied with the cheaper 2001 \\"Kubrick Collection\\" dvd instead.  You are basically paying the big price difference for this special edition only to get 3 short featurettes, Vivian's 30 minute commentary, and a very mediocre full-length commentary.  According to Amazon's editorial, the old \\"Collection\\" version was supposedly the aspect ratio that Kubrick approved of, anyways.      A five star movie, but only a four star \\"special\\" edition.

0060931736|5.0|Don't give up on this book if you don't like it the first time you read it. It improves with age...your age.    At 14, I just didn't \\"get\\" the book. Going to an English all-girls' school I could absolutely identify with the opening passage relating to the dreaded Panama hat, and like many of the girls in the book, boys to us were pretty much a foreign country. However, apart from those aspects I felt the book was irrelevant and rather dated compared to my school days in the late 1970s.    Twenty plus years later, I came across the Prime of Miss Jean Brodie again, and understood its power.    For such a slim volume, this book has remarkable depth, and other reviewers have done a tremendous job of outlining the story.  Jean Brodie was not a frustrated spinister in general terms, but she was frustrated and bound by the conventions of that era, however daring she appeared to be at times. Her passion was her girls; to shape their minds, broaden their horizons, and to be honest, share her view of the world.    This a book that works once you understand more about life. To learn that however passionately you may believe in something, in hindsight some things are not all we understood them to be, but to never lose that passion.     Most of all, to know that one's prime is a state of mind, not an age.      I've read it several times now, and alongside [[ASIN:0143039598 Cold Comfort Farm (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)]], it is my favourite book from that era.    There is also an excellent film, whilst not entirely true to the book, has Maggie Smith in probably her best performance, and definitely worth watching. [[ASIN:B0001US78G The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie]]
0743454537|5.0|I really enjoyed this book very much. I thought it was really amazing. I was angry with the mother (Sara) at one point because she just didn't get it. The fight between life and death was really eye opening and the ending just really threw my off. I loved it and would do the same for my sister.
B000W8OM5Y|5.0|Mel Gibson shines in this movie. Well scripted and plenty of action. Battle scenes are tremendous and reminds one of the slaughter the Scots went through. I highly recommend this movie.
1416955070|4.0|I found the book City of Bones, the first in the Mortal Instruments Series, to be fascinating on many levels, but not completely engrossing. I think a lot of history, legend, and myth study went into the creation of this book. I loved reading about the runes and the use of weaponry, but I couldn't completely sink myself into the work because it often felt too over-the-top. Unlike Stephanie Meyer's books, which dealt with one fictional realm at a time, and really held to that one thing, Clare's book took on a whole fictional realm at once. This leaves two different problems in its wake. One is that the book tends to just lightly touch on many aspects of the world, and not get really deep into any of them (for instance, the Silent Brother's self-mutilation rituals or Izzy's temporary and firey fascination with Simon). Also, covering an entire world at once meant that the characters spent a lot of time explaining things to Clary instead of Clary learning things for herself. A lot of the rules and details of Shadow World were dictated to Clary instead of the reader experiencing it through Clary, first-hand. When that happens, the book can feel more technical rather than emotional.     Still, I would say that I was interested in the world of the book enough to buy the sequel and see where it goes.
B000FA57NK|2.0|Apollo 13 is a spaceman movie about three guys who travel to the moon.  But, due to an equipment malfunction, they are unable to land on the surface of the moon.<br /><br />Unfortunately, science does not support the theory that men have traveled to the moon. In reality, no human has traveled more than 400 miles into space. So the film Apollo 13 should be considered fiction.<br /><br />(Since we did not really go to the moon, what did NASA do with the billions of dollars that they received from U.S. taxpayers? Did they use it to fund films like Apollo 13?<br /><br />Should Ron Howard be arrested for making this film?<br />Or does Ron Howard really believe that we went to the moon? And what about Henry Winkler? Does Henry Winkler believe that we went to the moon?)<br /><br />The acting in Apollo 13 is great.  But, because of the unrealistic storyline, I can't give more than two stars.<br /><br />(This is an updated review.  I originally gave Apollo 13 only one star back in Feb '07.  But I watched it again recently and decided to add one star in my rating because of the great acting.)
B000YABIQ6|5.0|It would be hard to imagine a more absorbingly intelligent American TV series--in terms of writing, acting, and visuals--than MAD MEN. Just before the final season of THE SOPRANOS began in late 2007, AMC presented us in the summer with the thirteen episodes of this marvelously atmospheric series created by one of the main writers of the series, Matt Weiner, that HBO insanely took a pass on. Ostensibly the series is about a group of advertising agency working for Madison Avenue advertising agency, the fictitious Sterling-Cooper, in 1960, during the Nixon-Kennedy presidential contest; yet on a deeper level the show wrestles with much larger questions about the meaning of obsession with having (and marketing) happiness in mid-20th-century America. The series centers primarily around four characters whose lives are inextricably linked with one another: Don Draper (Jon Hamm), a handsome advertising executive at Sterling-Cooper of few words but enormous creative gifts who hides a mysterious past; his beautiful but childlike wife Betty (January Jones), whom he keeps entirely separate in the suburbs from his work life and his mistresses in the city; Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss), Don's new secretary, whose naive affect and kind heart belie her tremendous ambition; and Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser), the smarmy account executive who trades on his ties to the Old New York \\"Knickerbocracy\\" to get him ahead. The four central actors are absolutely first-rate, as are several within their near orbits: John Slattery as Roger Sterling, the roguish partner who is both Don's friend and his competitor; the gifted Christina Hendricks, as the firm's femme fatale head secretary; and Robert Morse, as the firm's wily and eccentric senior partner.    Morse's presence ties the series to his famous work in both the Broadway and Hollywood production of HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS WITHOUT REALLY TRYING, and the episodes make intelligent reference also to any number of important American fictional works about the NYC business and suburban domestic worlds of the post-War era, including THE APARTMENT and THE BEST OF EVERYTHING. (Richard Yates's REVOLUTIONARY ROAD and the films of Douglas Sirk are also repeatedly evoked too, if in less direct ways.) One of the pleasures of this fine DVD set are the superb extras which allow us to see the especially thoughtful work done by the series' set designers, hairstylists, and (particularly) its head costume designer. The commentaries are generally excellent, and it will come as no surprise to fans of the series that not only the series creator, Matt Weiner, and its writers are especially eloquent but so too are its actors, especially Hamm and Kartheiser. The eye-catching design of this DVD package (fashioned to look and open, naturally, like a classic American manufacturer's product: a Zippo lighter) has been rightly praised for its innovation but also rightly criticized for its unwieldiness.
B000ECX0QU|5.0|A great Hitchcock film. It's the supposed effort of one French intelligence   man & the US   to expose the Russian missile buildup in Cuba in 1962. The mix of fact & fiction is seamless. I found it to be entertaining & full of  twists & turns that kept me on the edge of my seat. Hitchcock in top form.

B000LT2IHI|4.0|My son recieved this as a gift on his first Christmas.  He's two years old now and he still likes to play with it every once and a while.  It's cute, it's colorful.  The sounds and jingles are cute.  My son loves feeding the giraffe or just pressing the button on it's forehead.  He also gets a kick out of watching the balls slide down.       While the name says \\"Sit to Stand\\" I wouldn't buy it for the purposes of having your child lean on it as he learns to stand.  But, the good news is that a child can play with it while sitting or standing.  If you want you child to learn to stand, just have him rest up against the couch.    I think that your child will enjoy this toy just as mine did.
B000WGWQG8|4.0|I really did enjoy viewing John Adams.  I also have been reading the book by David McCullough and the movie is accurate from that point of view.  The movie brings out just how important John Adams was to the formation of this United States from its inception.
B0012BTBQU|5.0|I first heard of the author as \\"The Guy Who is Finishing Wheel of Time\\" as a fan of the WoT series I was curious about the author who was deemed worthy to fill those big shoes.    I bought Elantris and plowed through that book, the story was thrilling and captivating and even though it ended conclusively (no dangling plot-lines ... pet-peeve of mine when no sequel is planned) I still wanted more of that world.    I bought the 2 available Mistborn books as soon as I finished the last page of Elantris and found this world to be even more unique and enthralling. I am eagerly awaiting book 3 or the Mistborn series and am on the edge of my seat to see what Sanderson does with WoT.    About the book: I don't want to give any spoilies but suffice it to say this world was totally unique. I have read a lot of fantasy and sci-fi and have never seen anyone else work up such a completely new set of \\"magic\\" powers and rules.     The characters felt real and while I didn't always like how they reacted to certain situations the reactions were always believable.    Worth the read and then some!
B00004UFTU|4.0|When I look in the mirror of a morning I see (apart from outstanding natural beauty!), some-one who likes Marillion staring back at me. This is a gut wrenching admission on my part but what can I do? From an initial position of deep mistrust and even mockery, I have to be completely honest and confide; I have liked every record of theirs I've ever heard, and I'm not sure why.<br /><br />'SFAJT' is the absolute zenith of my confusion. A punky soul's worst nightmare. I firmly believe if you can't say-what-you-gotta-say in 2 minutes it's time to pack up - yet 6 songs only, nothing under 5 minutes. Why am I doing this to myself?  What can I possibly be gaining?<br /><br />The title track is a good example - nearly 9 minutes!!  It starts all slow and piano and then livens up in predictable rockist fashion. (and isn't saying 'predictable' when referring to music, really predictable?)<br />This is something Busted or Avril would do, in a forced and feeble attempt at 'surprise'(to let it stay a ballad would be a REAL surprise!), but here, it just seems to work.<br /><br />Ditto 'the Web';<br />\\"The rain auditions at my window,<br />It's sympathy echoes in my womb.\\"<br />What!? There's a grown man writing this stuff! It invites scorn  and derision on every level and yet there's a dignity to it. A child-like aloofness which appeals.<br />You can almost hear Fish's schoolboy giggling off-mic, as he nudges excellent guitarist Steve Rotherhay (very much his partner in crime) and whispers: \\"Did you hear THAT!?\\"<br /><br />Like a rock (good analogy. - imaginary Amazon ed) it's its own purpose, good or bad, black or white, hard or soft, it's simply just there. It exists in the world, and some of us choose to just live with it.<br /><br />I tried unsuccessfully to oust this unhealthy Marillion fixation when I finally reviewed 'Misplaced Childhood'. I felt better afterwards but not completely cured. I'm a cheery, intolerant punk-rocker, bold and true. I can't be seen to be liking (and I'm sure I'll get my reward in hell!) this Marillion stuff, but I do. It's a funny thing, but I have friends, (I do, honest!) who like hip-hop/rnb and stuff, who like them as well!<br />It's got me beat.<br /><br />Anyway, 'SFAJT'. Long, pompous songs that don't make any sense and unintelligible (bravo! - imaginary Amazon ed) lyrics straight from the worst excesses of Yes and Wishbone Ash.<br />Can it get any better?<br /><br />Four stars only because I don't like it as much as 'Misplaced Childhood' but (somehow!) it's a great album nonetheless.uff, but I do.

B000HIVOI2|4.0|Have always enjoyed this movie.   The transfer to BluRay is okay.  No doubt sharper but because of the age of the original movie it seems as though the transfer also boosted noise and grain.    Still enjoyed the movie in the BluRay format alot!
0312427999|5.0|Wow! And all along I thought the Bush administration was filled with inept, blundering fools. The truth is much darker and scarier.  To realize that there is an actual logic/philosophy behind their actions that ties the past 8 years together was a shocking and sickening revelation.  And that the roots go much deeper into the 1950's. Articulate, damning, forceful....it was truly a shocking doctrine to read, but one all Americans should read before November 2008.
B00139W3NE|3.0|Going into this movie, I was either expecting to get hit over the head with the atheist book of nothingness, or sit through a torturous movie that defines why the fantasy genre should just give up now. And while I did not get hit over the head, nor was I tortured, I was just bored. And yes, the fantasy genre just keeps sinking lower with every copycat that tries to make a fast buck with a big budget. Really people, not every \\"bestselling\\" book that has the genre of fantasy should be made into a movie.<br /><br />The story and mythology had me more confused then that time when I woke up on the moon, then realized it was just a dream. And if confusing wasn't enough, it was just plain weird. I mean, everybody except the polar bears and the witches had an animal following them all over the place, which was somehow connected to their soul or whatever, and these animals were called \\"demons.\\" Which is even more confusing since the demons or witches in the movie aren't really \\"demons\\" or \\"witches.\\"<br /><br />The visual effect and action are what really keep the movie on its feet though. The \\"Steam-Punk\\" look of the cities, and the sheer magnificence of the backgrounds are sure to impress. In terms of action, to add to more confusion, the fight between polar bears, reminded me a lot of the fight between Peter and King Miraz from Narnia 2, in the fact that it didn't excite me, and tended to lean boring, since it was fight for the sake of fight, for fight's sake.<br /><br />But don't let cute, almost Narnian look of this movie fool you, this is not for kids at least under 13, because you will scare the crap out of them, and even kids under 10-13 will have a hard time processing the film's more tense moments, and the sheer evality of the villains.<br /><br />However, the film does deliver in the climax when Lyra escapes from the \\"experiment\\" proceeds to blow up the place, then run into a battle with a bunch of Russin lookin' characters with swords. And although it would have been a lot cooler if the Polar Bear brought his army to the battle, but hey, I'll take what I can get from this film. The battle offers the film's most exiting moments, and actually shows a glimpse of hope of a good movie.<br /><br />The casting is rather good. Whether the cast was used to their full potential is another thing. Sam Elliot is great in his role, as is Nicole Kidman. The girl who played Lyra was good and kept you interested. But the voice cast on the other hand was thrown away. They were all interchangeable, and could have, and probably should have worked with lesser known actors portraying the roles, since no voice performance really stood out, or was in the least bit memorable. And even though Daniel Craig was put as a featured star, he was in the film for all of five minutes. Christopher Lee on the other hand could have had 30 seconds.<br /><br />Fortunately, this movie is an hour and 40 minutes, instead of the 2 hours it could have been. Unfortunately, this movie banked way too much on having sequels, so the ending is hanging off a cliff with 1 finger. It offers no satisfaction, and it makes you wait for a sequel that probably will never come now. I mean, nothing is really resolved, except for a couple of side-quests. No bad guys are killed, and nothing is really done.<br /><br />And to make matters worse, the credits song takes the award for WORST credits song of all time. It's a lazy effort with pathetic lyrics that has the musical-quality of singing rocks. And frankly, singing rocks is a lot more entertaining.<br /><br />Random Rant: I was disappointed that the polar bear didn't drink Coke at any point in the movie, and Coke didn't have any advertising campaign associated with the movie that I can remember.<br /><br />And although I have not, and will not read the source material, I'm glad they didn't stick to it. The movie was made better for me because I didn't feel like I was being preached at, although I expected to be. And while watching themovie, you don't feel like you're being whacked over the head with some atheistic crap. Sorry to offend all you people that believe in nothing, which is something (confusing I know), but Philip Pullman is the most offensive thing this side of a Nas record.<br /><br />So overall, while this movie does have its moments; they are few and far between. Between the moments are a lot of information that flies over your head, a story that doesn't make much sense, and plot-turns and side-quests that are there just for the sake of being there, and don't really make sense. I don't care if the movie is congruent with the book, just give me a good movie.atheistic crap. Sorry to offend all you people that believe in nothing, which is something (confusing I know), but Philip Pullman is the most offensive thing this side of a Nas record.    So overall, while this movie does have its moments; they are few and far between. Between the moments are a lot of information that flies over your head, a story that doesn't make much sense, and plot-turns and side-quests that are there just for the sake of being there, and don't really make sense. I don't care if the movie is congruent with the book, just give me a good movie.

B00177Y9ZC|3.0|Doug Liman seems to have done nothing but freefall since The Bourne Identity, which was five stars. Then he did Mr. and Mrs. Smith, (4 stars), and now he's done this wannabe (3 stars). I don't even want to know how the sequel is going to turn out, although it has the potential to be a whole lot better. Anyways, this movie has a great concept of teleportation, used in sort of a anti-hero and selfish manner. Add a girl that was better off out of the picture, and you have a somewhat entertaining disappointment.<br /><br />Hayden Christensen, while no Oscar winner, isn't as bad most would have you believe, but on the other hand, you almost never see his true colors because they're hidden under boring, one-dimensional and whiny characters. And that's what this character is, boring, one-dimensional, whiny and just plain dumb. In fact, Jamie Bell's Griffin is a whole lot more exiting, experienced, has his act together, has no girlfriend dragging him down, and he's just plain cooler. A movie centered around that character would have made for a much more interesting movie. Hopefully, he'll be around in sequals as an ally.<br /><br />But the main problem with the movie comes in the form of Samuel L. Jackson, who gets his revenge from Hayden kicking his butt in Star Wars, and in turn shocks everybody, and stabs them with a knife that probably has a deleted scene to explain its strange mysteriousness. Or maybe it's just bad filmmaking. Anyways, Sam Jackson and his group of Jumper killers are so over the top, Evil Knievel couldn't jump over it. Sam Jackson especially. He's just so evil, he's beyond evil, not believable, and again, over the top.<br /><br />Then there's the \\"twist\\" of Diane Lane, which is not only disappointing but confusing. She's a bad guy? Now, any path they take with her character is going to be so muddled a Hummer couldn't get through it. Then there's the girlfriend, who seems pretty cardboard, and who I never could quite get into. She isn't bad lookin', but her character development seems rather predictable, and again, boring.<br /><br />But for all those wrongs about this movie, there is also plenty of good ones. The prologue is interesting and does a good job setting up the character, although Hayden's narration does get annoying after the first time. Then there's the action. Ahhh yes, the action. The action is entertaining, interesting, and pretty darn cool. My personal favorite was when they brought the London bus to the Egyptian desert.<br /><br />So overall, you have a excellent concept and tons of potential. Unfortunately, this potential doesn't formulate into much thanks to poor writing, bad characters, over the top bad guys, questionable casting, and way too many lulls, both intended or otherwise. I look forward to a sequel, where hopefully they'll make it an action film. It won't have much depth to it, but as long as there's no lulls it should be pretty entertaining at least.t seems rather predictable, and again, boring.

B000YRY8BG|5.0|When I watched \\"State of Play\\", I made a BIG mistake:  I put it in my DVD player at 10:00pm, saying I would watch only one of its six episodes.  Famous last words.  When the sun rose the following morning, I was still watching, thoroughly enthralled.  This is TV at its best, and Kevin Macdonald has a high bar to reach in his forthcoming film version, although he certainly has the skill to bring it off.  But...don't wait for the film.  See this splendid BBC mini-series today.  You won't be sorry.

0385751532|4.0|This is an excellent addition to Holocaust literature for young adults.  When nine-year old Bruno and his family move to \\"Off with\\" because of the \\"Fury\\", he is confused and angry- throughout the book, Bruno never really learns what is happening next door.  Showing the camps through the eyes of a child on the outside of the fence was a novel technique and allowed for spare descriptions that underlined the looming horror.  Once Bruno befriends a young Jewish boy, the reader knows the story isn't going to end well.  Despite that knowledge, and the fact that the actual friendship is so unrealistic, Boyne's writing is so powerful that I still found myself tearing up at the end.  I highly recommend this book for adults and teens alike.

1435247418|5.0|Garth Nix changed the face of dark fantasy (usually just horror with a prettier cover) with his instant hit \\"Sabriel.\\" It spun up an alternate world full of un-cute talking animals, deadly and dark magic, and a likably strong heroine.<br /><br />And he doesn't disappoint in \\"Lirael: Daughter of the Clayr,\\" a strong sequel that reenters the world of the Old Kingdom, and brings out a new threat and new heroes to combat it. Without missing a step, \\"Lirael\\" follows in \\"Sabriel\\"'s footsteps, with the same dark blend of humor and horror.<br /><br />Lirael is a daughter of the Clayr, but she won't be a full Clayr until she gains the Sight. On her fourteenth birthday, she is the oldest girl to not yet have gained the Sight.<br /><br />After contemplating suicide, Lirael is assigned to work in the library, and inadvertently sets loose a hideous Free Magic creature. Desperate to deal with her mistake, Lirael calls up the Disreputable Dog (somehow made both of Free and Charter Magic), and soon finds ancient birthrights and buried secrets in the Clayr's citadel. And before she knows it, she's being sent off to deal with a rising evil in the Old Kingdom...<br /><br />Elsewhere, Sabriel's teenage son Sameth has his final day of school disrupted by a swarm of Dead, and a mysterious necromancer who is attempting to enslave him (but nabs his best friend Nick instead). After months of ever-growing fear and confusion, Sameth sets out in secret to accompany Nick to the Old Kingdom -- but he finds that he's in far more danger outside the castle walls...<br /><br />\\"Lirael\\" is somewhat different from Garth Nix's first Abhorsen book, in that it takes a long time to wind up to the action. Instead, he takes the time to explore the rich world of modern/high fantasy that he's conjured, and spins up an increasingly complex plot with everything from endangered immigrants to a masked necromancer of mysterious origins.<br /><br />And Nix spins a truly exquisite little world in here -- we have glacial citadels, medieval castles and British boarding schools, full of ice, shadows, malignant creatures and dark forests. And there's plenty of gruesome content -- rotting bodies, the Book of the Dead, or the secret plot of the evil necromancer. Yet he never forgets to include little moments of humor, such as the magic-animals' frequent snippy remarks, Nick's flaky missives, or Sameth's schoolmates singing their school song during an attack from the military and Dead.<br /><br />And old favorites return -- we have thirtysomething Touchstone and Sabriel, as well as a cameo by the dangerous kitty Mogget. And while they often seem rather overburdened with angst, Nix handles Lirael and Sameth well -- one of them is a perpetual outsider who is only just finding her place in the world, and the other is a prince who is literally terrified of what is expected of him. The scenes where he gets panic attacks at the Book of the Dead is well done, and makes the dissatisfied boy seem like more than a bored prince.<br /><br />The Disreputable Dog is a lot like Mogget, in that she's more than she seems and a handy source of info, but not as quietly menacing as Mogget was and is. She's more humorous and maternal. Ellimere was the one character who fell flat; she seemed a little too \\"bossy princess\\" with few dimensions beyond that.<br /><br />The biggest problem with \\"Lirael: Daughter of the Clayr\\" is that it ends on a \\"to be continued\\" note.

B0013J30W2|4.0|I admit that I rolled my eyes when ever I saw the trailer for Wanted. It just looked dumb with stuff like shooting the wings off flies and curving bullets. While at least in the Matrix, there excuse for such unrealistic things was that they were inside a fake computer world. The plot is familiar too. A normal guy (James McAvoy) that works in an office and gets treated like crap by his boss until his life is turned upside down. Which is similar to Keanu Reeves in the Matrix and even Edward Norton in Fight Club.          The movie is as silly as I expected but it's so well made and goofy fun that I actually liked it a lot. James McAvoy is fantastic here and owns the movie. By the cover, you'd think it was Angelina Jolie's movie but no it's actually James McAvoy's. His complaining and whining can be annoying in the beginning but when he starts to kick ass, he's awesome. While it's not Angelina's movie she's still sexy and is better here than she was in either Tomb Raider movie. Morgan Freeman is even fun here with cursing one liners that you wouldn't expect from him but someone like Samuel L. Jackson instead.        I originally thought the movie was gonna just be a wannabe of a lot of other action movies and that it wouldn't be a good worthy summer movie. However it was more watchable than I expected despite how silly it can be. That's mostly due to a super cool James McAvoy. Of course though it would have been more entertaining if he was dressed like his Fawn character from Narnia while kicking ass lol.
B0018C7Q60|5.0|Guillermo Del Toro has become the new master of dark fantasy -- first with the quirky clockpunk \\"Hellboy,\\" then with the Oscar-winning \\"Pan's Labyrinth.\\" Not to mention forthcoming travels to Middle-Earth.<br /><br />So you know he has the skills to pit Mike Mignola's scarlet anti-hero against an army of fairies and elves, and not make it silly. Instead, it's a spectacular dark fantasy full of humor, action, quirky appeal, romance, and some truly astounding special effects. But what really shoves this movie over the top is Del Toro's brilliant direction, and the stunning performance by Ron Perlman.<br /><br />Decades ago, Professor Broom (William Hurt) told a small Hellboy a yuletide bedtime story about the Elf King Balor and his unstoppable Golden Army, and how the crown that controls the Army was split into thirds and divided among fairies and humans.<br /><br />Well, you can't really expect that kind of power to never be revived.<br /><br />Cut to current day. Hellboy (Perlman), Liz (Selma Blair) and Abe (Doug Jones) investigate a strange supernatural attack on an auction house, where the archeological curiosity known as the Crown of Bethmoora was being sold -- only to be attacked by savage tooth fairies. Turns out the crown was stolen by Prince Nuada (Luke Goss), a resentful young elf who is determined to take the world back from humanity -- using, of course, the Golden Army.<br /><br />And while Hellboy chafes against strict new commander Johann Krauss (a suit filled with ectoplasm), Abe encounters Nuada's sister, Princess Nuala -- who also happens to have the last third of the crown. But Nuada will not allow anyone to oppose him as he searches for the Golden Army's location, and Hellboy and his friends must venture into a strange, ancient kingdom to stop him from destroying all of humanity.<br /><br />The worst you can say about \\"Hellboy II: The Golden Army\\" is that it retreads the idea of a demonic outsider with a dark destiny, and his continuing romantic woes. Hellboy realizes anew that he'll never fit into the world of humans, because he's big and red and has horns and a tail. Okay, we got it. Next big psychological issue!<br /><br />Fortunately those flaws are relatively minor ones. Del Toro is able to spin up a straightforward fantasy story, but then he conjures up some truly glorious trappings -- a fey civilization running parallel to ours. And he populates it with truly bizarre creatures (the eye-winged Angel of Death), clockpunk robots, and trippy underground goblin markets. And when this ancient civilization lashes out, Del Toro does not pull punches -- giant thrashing tentacle-vines and a one-on-one duel between Hellboy and Nuada are among the highlights. And the Golden Army itself is all gears and fire -- pretty amazing.<br /><br />But Del Toro doesn't neglect the script -- lots of solid snappy dialogue and some poignantly romantic moments, including some startling actions from dear ol' Abe. And he also adds little moments to this epic story that remind us that these are supposed to be people -- such as Hellboy's bickering with his new ectoplasmic boss, or Abe and Hellboy getting drunk and having a little Manilow singalong together. It's just so cute.<br /><br />But what really sets this movie apart is the \\"children of the Earth.\\" No flitting Victorian sprites -- these are creatures that are weird, grotesque, dangerous and immensely powerful, from nasty little tooth fairies up to creatures with buildings for heads and plant gods. There's an alien, bizarre aesthetic to these creatures that feels wholly real, as if Neil Gaiman casually dropped a few sketches onto the drawing board.<br /><br />But as amazing as the visuals are, Del Toro never neglects the characters. Perlman is perfect for the role of \\"big Red\\" -- he's gruff, sarcastic, moody, but also endearing and self-deprecatingly likable. There are more hints of his potentially dark future and the temptations he faces, but Big Red's good heart is still verymuch in the forefront.<br /><br />Blair gives a more lively performance here as a spunkier Liz, who also has some surprising developments in store. Jones is pitch-perfect as the fish-man, who experiences the first pangs of young love for Nuala, and Goss gives a chilling, whispery performance as a rebel prince who is willing to do whatever it takes -- even kill members of his family -- if it helps him restore the fey kingdom.<br /><br />\\"Hellboy II: The Golden Army\\" is a wild, darkly ornate ride through the world of half-forgotten gods and fey. While it has a few flaws, those are far outweighed by the brilliant of Del Toro's vision.nkier Liz, who also has some surprising developments in store.

A warm hearted story with a wonderfull star cast. Richard Gere has always been one of my favourate actors and this is probably one of his best performences ever. Jennifer Lopez, well what can I say, truely unique performence by her, she was very adorable in the whole film and brings perfection to the charecter played by her. Each and every individual in the film delivers a good performence, its one of the best warm films I have come across. The Dvd wont dissapoint you in either way, the quality and sound are terrefic and there are good special features like 'Behind the scenes' etc.

We watched the first episode immediately, and it took my breath away.<br /><br />I've since viewed other Blu-ray movies and TV series on my new system and though the clarity is impressive, nothing holds a candle to Planet Earth.

044024238X|4.0|If this is your first encounter with Sophie Kinsella's joyous writing, you will not be disappointed and will be eager to read more of her work. For those fans of the Shopaholic series, this book will be another addition to your collection of fabulous, fun reads in the Kinsella style! However, be warned that Samantha Sweeting is not Becky Bloomwood. Although Bloomwood from the Shopaholic series is great fun and addictive reading, with Samantha Sweeting, Kinsella brings more depth to the main character.<br /><br />Sweeting is a lawyer nearing her 30's and on her way to becoming a partner in a prestigious law firm. However, her work is her life spurred on by an over achieving mother and what Samantha has thought is the life she really wants. When she discovers a crash-and-burn mistake she made at her Carter Spink Law Firm, and that it will cost the firm dearly, she flees London with no thoughts in mind as to where she is going or what she will do.<br /><br />This is what brings Samantha Sweeting to a tiny suburb of London and to the home of Trish and Eddie Geiger. The Geigers mistake Samantha for a housekeeping job applicant they had been expecting. In her frantic need to get away from the problems in London, Samantha goes along with the mistaken identity and takes the job thinking it will at least give her a place to stay for a few days to think things through. She fails to consider the fact that a housekeeper is expected to cook and clean, something that is low on Samantha's list of qualifications. Cooking to her means \\"order in\\", and cleaning is something that miraculously has happened when she gets home from the firm and the help has taken care of things. With the reader's imagination allowing for a few impractical and unreal situations, Samantha is able to fool the Geigers with her quick thinking and chicanery.<br /><br />Things go fine for a bit until Samantha encounters a wise and dreamy gardener who is not so blind to what she is doing.  With \\"creative\\" genius, Samantha keeps things going in the house for a while but the gorgeous and clever gardener becomes a problem as she finds herself attracted to him. The hilarious situations, quirky almost believable characters, and a Samantha that you care about, is what Kinsella creates in The Undomestic Goddess and what makes for an enjoyable, funny, and light read that will entertain you and keep you turning the pages to find out what happens to Samantha.s things going in the house for a while but the gorgeous and clever gardener becomes a problem as she finds herself attracted to him.

B000YXMMAE|3.0|'In Rainbows' was the most anticipated Radiohead album since 'Kid A'. But UNLIKE that album, this one was expected to be a new beginning for the band. Thom Yorke said himself that 'Hail To the Thief' was going to be the last of Radiohead \\"as we know it\\". However, it appears Yorke & company didn't feel as adventurous going into this project as they made it seem.     The Negatives:  'In Rainbows' does not feel like a fully formed album. Instead, like 'Amnesiac', it seems more like a loose collection of outtakes. The music is really more of the same. There are three songs here I find terribly boring. The really frustrating thing is that the bad songs here aren't actually \\"bad\\", they just lack a certain punch. It's like they belong with all those other numerous Radiohead b-sides. With the rather lackluster state the music world has been in for a long time, we really need a groundbreaking and unique package of music to stir things up once and awhile. So, to quote an old member of the music business, 'In Rainbows' seems more like \\"a bunt instead of a home run\\".     The Positives:  In spite of the fact that this collection feels so non-cohesive and lackluster, there are still seven songs here that are INSTANT Radiohead CLASSICS! The band still sounds confident and inspired. Thom's voice is as strong as ever. Most importantly, the melodies here are still original and interesting. The only reason I'm still giving 'In Rainbows' a lower score is that these songs seem better taken individually. They really do not sound like they belong together. In fact, any of them could fit into any of Radiohead's previous seven albums. That is great praise for the songs, much less for 'In Rainbows' taken as an album.    The Songs:    '15 Step' (Man, this is their weakest opener ever, with a sort of been-there, done-that impression. It's still a good song.)      'Bodysnatchers' (A great song that is unmistakably Radiohead to the core. Sounds like it belongs on `Hail To the Thief'. In fact, itsounds like a hybrid of `2+2=5' and `Where I End And You Begin'. In any case, it REALLY rocks.)     'Nude' (Another instant classic. Very slow, ethereal, and haunting, with an impressive orchestral buildup to a nice crescendo.)    'Arpeggi/Weird Fishes' (It just seems to hang in space without much of a memorable melody or impression.)    'All I Need' (A fantastically dark and foreboding song. Think of a darker 'Morning Bell'.)    'Faust Arp' (A great, fast-paced acoustic song, a lot like 'Thinking About You'. Just too short!)    'Reckoner' (Another great one, with crashing cymbals driving along a sorrowful melody. Also features outstanding vocals from Thom.)    'House of Cards' (This is a very soothing sounding song. It has a very slow, very meditative and peaceful atmosphere.)     'Jigsaw Falling Into Place' (Just incredible! An acoustic song that starts off slow and builds and builds up to one heck of a crescendo. Plus, Thom just BELTS it out during the second half. I really wish he'd sing like that more often. Thom's BEST vocal performance yet, and one of the very best Radiohead songs!)     'Videotape' (Their worst closer ever. It's a peaceful and sad sounding piano song, but it's also terribly boring and under-developed.)     So, 'In Rainbows' has seven OUTSTANDING songs on it. However, taken as a whole, this album doesn't really stand on its own. Perhaps it just needed more songs, along with an infusion of different styles of music and instrumentation. With this latest offering, Radiohead proves they still have what it takes to make a great song, but the next album needs to be much more cohesive.
0780631684|2.0|** 2000. Written and directed by James Wong. Six students and a teacher manage to escape a plane crash thanks to a premonition of Alex Browning, one of them. A few weeks later, Death starts to kill the survivors one by one. FINAL DESTINATION is basically a stupid movie about a good idea. There isn't here only one smart scene or idea, it seems that the director wanted to please the teen audience by delivering another pimply shocker and that's all. In these perspective, a film like Peter Jackson's [[ASIN:B000ASATYO The Frighteners (Director's Cut)]] which handles some of the themes of FINAL DESTINATION is a masterpiece! This one is unfortunately already forgotten.

0743289692|5.0|The last few weeks, I have been enjoying my commute in the company of Ayaan Hirsi Ali, as I've listened to her fascinating book Infidel. I love books that transport me to a foreign place or time, and immerse me in a culture that I didn't know about before. And I love books that provoke thought about important ideas. Infidel does both of things exceedingly well. It is the autobiographical account of an independent-minded woman who was raised in a traditional Somali Muslim family and grew up to be a Member of Dutch Parliament advocating for women's rights. The first half of the book is a vivid account of her childhood in Somalia, and later in Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia, and Kenya as her family escaped the turbulence of their war-torn homeland. Her description of life in places like Mogadishu, Mecca, and Nairobi is rich in detail about their houses and neighborhoods, their food, their culture and traditions. Her portraits of her parents, her siblings, her grandmother, and other family members are richly complex, infused with the emotional perspective of her childhood at the same time balanced by an unflinching retrospective assessment of their good qualities and their weaknesses. The genealogist in me was fascinated learning about the Somali tribal culture that puts such a premium on one's ancestry that children at an early age can recite their ancestry for nine generations, and when two Somalis meet, they can readily ascertain their kinship even to tenth cousins. And her description of the variations of Muslim practice between countries, and the rise of Muslim fundamentalism, was illuminating and especially relevant today. She does a remarkable job of making comprehensible such alien traditions as polygamy, arranged marriages, and female genital mutilation. What is especially remarkable is how, even though she would later come to condemn some parts of the traditions she was raised with as being completely barbaric, she describes them in the context of her early life subjectively and dispassionately, neither concealing the barbarity nor revealing anger, judgment, and condemnation. The account is all the more powerful for that, allowing the reader to understand how such barbarity could be accepted and tolerated because of how it is embedded in traditional ways of life and in how sons and daughters are raised. And it allows us to understand this amazing woman on all the parts of her journey, from childhood, to adolescence when she was drawn to fundamentalism, to adulthood when she escaped to discover liberal ideas. The latter half of the book describes her life in the Netherlands, where she becomes not only a parliamentarian but a political lightning rod after making a controversial film with Dutch filmmaker Theo Van Gogh which lead to his murder and death threats for her. The book then becomes more about politics, ideology, and her intellectual autobiography, though embedded in personal experiences of immigration, learning Dutch culture, and ultimately life as a figure in hiding from death threats. She raises significant questions about whether a liberal society can survive being tolerant of a growing immigrant community within its midst that remains insular and perpetuates an illiberal way of life. (These questions have reverberations here in America, not only regarding Islamism, but in issues like the recent Texas FLDS raids, and in the fault lines of conflict between religious liberty and civil rights protections -- issues I hope to explore in future blog posts.) And she makes a compelling argument that Islam needs to undergo its own Reformation if it is to be reconciled to modernity. Her ideas and the amazing life experience that formed them make for vital and fascinating reading.

Soon he discovers a method of looking back into the past when he is recruited by an FBI handler (Val Kilmer), and begins to have feelings for the woman, so much so that he contemplates going back in time and saving her life.  The time travel element could have felt hokey, but it manages to work surprisingly well here, and Scott's visual flair only helps.  What hurts Deja Vu is that it's pretty predictable.  Some of the twists, well, just aren't all that twisty.  Not to mention that when looking at Deja Vu as a pure action movie, it just meanders quite a bit.  However, much of Deja Vu is compelling, and Washington is great as always, and there's solid turns from Kilmer, Patton, Adam Goldberg, and Jim Caviezel to boot.  All in all, Deja Vu is certainly worth a look at the very least, but the end result just doesn't live up to it's potential.

0385341067|4.0|Yes, this book is very well written. But is Matilda's voice really authentic? To some extent the maturity of the young girl's voice and her infatuation with a book from a different culture could be explained by the selection process; after all, such a story wouldn't be narrated by someone without these features, and maybe one girl out of a village could pass this unusual filter. And the enthusiasm of the other children could be partly her projection of her thoughts and enthusiasm, as it is her narrative.<br /><br />Yet Mr Watts is a bit too much a caricature to elicit the reverence he receives. (And, yes, Dickens is full of caricature.) He's more whatever he needs to be for the plot, rather than a coherent whole. And why does someone so well versed in one book, no matter how much he loves it, appear not to have any other books? Having finished Great Expectations there was nothing left for his class but to start it over?<br /><br />Then there are the plot devices, such as \\"the\\" book disappearing at exactly the moment when it was needed to avert disaster. (Again, yes, Dickens is full of such plot coincidences.) But does it really make sense that to show some fighters a book with a name in it would make them happy, and prevent disaster?<br /><br />Even though I might have swallowed all of this, the ending just didn't ring true at all. The author's need to tie up the loose ends forced him into more compromises of his protagonist's character than it seemed worth.<br /><br />Very well written, but too many distracting questions for five stars.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I bought this series only because it had so many wonderful reviews. I figured I'd hide it until Christmas for my 13 yr old. But when it arrived I was like a child at Christmas myself and I couldnt wait. I love westerns and I love sci-fi. Never knew I could have both. Awesome stories, fabulous characters that I feel like I know and a beautiful ship! Why someone cancelled this show I'll never understand!
B000I2JDEY|4.0|Very good remastering of the Albee classic, with great, insightful commentary by Mike Nichols, as well as the iffy one by cinematographer Haskell Welxer that was on the first pressing in the late 90s. A lot of specific information about how the play ended up pretty much whole in a still code-ridden era. Good new documentaries about the film and a minor one about Taylor's career round out the package.    The film itself is a definite classic, maybe a bit too serious in tone, whereas a good production of the play is riotously funny. This seems pretty heavy going and somber most of the way through because they felt they had to be so in order to pass muster with the censors.     All four of the stars are perfect. Burton probably has his finest moments ever on screen, and there's nothing like this anywhere else in Taylor's career.    The plot is a puzzlement, but that's as it should be. This is not THE VIPS, BOOM or THE SANDPIPER. In fact, it's not a Taylor/Burton film at all. It's an honest attempt to turn one of the top pieces of dramatic literature in the last half of the 20th Century into a marketable big studio film. It isn't destroyed, as is so often the case. Although, to listen to Nichols on the commentary. it came dangerously close.
B0017APPSE|3.0|I think it was worth watching. I like both Nataly and Scarlet's performances. It make me want to know more about king Henry VIII and search his history. Nice way to motivate learning!
B000PC6A3E|5.0|I recently bought Batman Begins on Blu Ray, and I have to say it was the best buy I have made yet.  I enjoyed this movie when I saw it in theaters, more when I bought it on DVD, but now on Blu Ray it's amazing.  Not only is the transfer amazing, the sound in TRU HD clear and crisp, but the movie itself is even better now with the Dark Knight on the horizon.<br />The special features offer us a glimpse at the new Dark Knight film...well at least 6 minutes worth.  Not to mention tons of other added features no the reincarnation of the dark knight to the locations they filmed in.  I have to say that anyone out there who is a Batman fan has to own this movie...even if you own in on DVD.
0689877803|5.0|This book is not one to disappoint. In fact I am a slow reader and I was able to read this book all the way through on a five hour flight! Muchamore's best writing characteristic is his characters they are deep and REAL which makes this book and all his others excellent beyond comparison. In fact I ordered some of his other books from England because they were not available in US.
B0016Q56C4|3.0|I thought this was an okay summer action flick.  It won't win any awards, and I think it's only good for one-time viewing, but it kept me interested in the movie until the end.  Of course, I think the fact it was 3-D helped some as the 3-D parts did cause the \\"oohs\\" and \\"ahhs\\" and were neat to watch on the screen.  Watching objects fly out toward you and reach for you is always fun to watch.<br /><br />Unfortunately, other than the 3-D effects, the movie wasn't all that great.  Characters are somewhat flat, there wasn't much you knew about any of the characters besides surface level details.<br /><br />Also, the world beneath the surface wasn't fully developed and explored.  Sure, there were a few action-packed scenes (the ride on the ocean with the sea monsters, the chase by the T-rex, and the man-eating plant scene), but I felt a bit disappointed.  I was expecting to see *more* of this underground world, but there wasn't much given, before the main characters all leave to the surface.  Another thing that puzzled me was the little glowing bird that followed the nephew of the professor, Trevor, everywhere.  Oh well, it was a cute little glowing blue bird, but I felt it was a bit pointless and didn't do anything except make you, the viewer, think, \\"Aw, how cute!!\\" LOL.<br /><br />I felt there also wasn't enough conflict either, not much struggle while they are in this underground world.  Not much going on, of course, I noticed a lot of people bringing their families to this movie so maybe the less unpleasant conflicts going on the better.<br /><br />My opinion:  I think perhaps the makers of the movie decided to skimp out on a lot of substance and meat to the story and instead relied on 3-D effect to carry the movie.  It is easy to be distracted by the 3-D effects, and not notice that the movie is lackluster.  If you like 3-D movies, go see it for the 3-D, but not for any good storyline.
1582701709|2.0|Without doubt, this series does not have ill intent. However, I personally feel that there are things in here that can actually be harmful. It is definitely true that ruminating on negative thoughts is very harmful, and ultimately creates a self fulfilling prophecy. But here's the main problem, as I see it: Everyone has positive and negative parts to themselves, like it or not. While stopping the rumination is very good, forcing yourself to think only positive thoughts does not get rid of the negativity within. Without getting to the root of the negativity, I don't believe that real changes can be made. By ignoring the negative, it is allowed to continue, instead of being dealt with. This type of thought control creates a distortedly positive view of self, and likely leads to an exaggerated sense of self importance. Ignoring problems does not make them go away, facing them does.     The Secret seems to pander to our immaturities, our childishness. One of the first messages it sends is that I can have anything I want. REALLY???? I want to rule the world... I want to fly by flapping my arms... I want to have 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 dollars. Not happening, and we all know it. Those things are not going to make me more happy anyway. Things of value, I believe, have to be worked for, and our thoughts are the beginning of that process.     Which brings me to my next point... the things people are shown wanting to have, are almost always materialistic. I can't remember any depictions of someone getting over a major illness, or finding love or friends, ect. All depictions seemed to be of people gaining status, wealth or something from the store.     The popularity of this series says much about current American culture, and I definitely do not feel reassured.
B000M4RG42|5.0|This flick is right up there with Saving Private Ryan as far as WW2 movies are concerned. Maybe the gore wasnt on the same level as SPR but the story was great. I am a Solider my self and I was really touched and satisfied of the portrayal of the Corps, I realize this film has been un carefully scrutinized by the likes of Mr Bruce Bains but I completely feel that his negative reviews are flawed and biased. This movie is a wonderful Eastwood masterpiece. It deserves 5 stars. The following is for Mr Bruce,<br /><br /> Bruce Bain you are defeating your purpose, you try to come across as some Intellectual Jarhead who is trying to educate the ignorant public. Well having said that you really portray yourself as some pompous left-wing narcissistic elitist scum of the earth that is probably in love with his so called writing abilities. Your message is so uncompelling and painful to read, you should try to be an editor for children's books instead of dedicating your slimy fingers to contradict anyone and anything. Please quit hiding behind that you are or were a Marine, there are good and bad, smart and stupid, strong and weak, in every faction of society not excluding the Devil Dog society, you just happen to fall into the ladder category assuming you are who you say you are. But who cares? Probably just yourself, now go ahead and over analyze my comment and scrutinize every little character that I have written I will not be waiting for your egotistical response. Hooooahhhh!!!!!!!!!!
B0000AUHPG|5.0|Sergio Leone created one of the greatest western epics in \\" Once Upon A Time In The West \\" and uncut it did pretty well when released in Europe.When the film was released in the USA it was cut and the result was a poor box office, and as such it recieved no Academy or Golden Globes the year it released, too bad because we now know in it's complete uncut version it may be the greatest western ever. If you watch close you can see some scenes similar to other classic western of it's time but what makes this so watchable for me is the MUSIC! The great Ennio Morricone is responsible here for a soundtrack that is really a opera. The musical parts have chosen a character to represent and the music cues the action. it is at the same time heartbreaking, brutal and exciting. Henry Fonda is simply unforgettable, his blue eyes are almost unreal, able to portray menace and humanity in the same momment. In a twist that was controversial for it's time you will never look at a curly red haired child the same ever, Fonda sheds his good guy image with his portrayal of this hypnotic psychopath. The all star cast has stand out performances by Jason Robards and Charles Bronson, and though the Italian female lead was relatively unknow in the USA at the time she is spellbinding in her dignity and beauty. I notice this 2 disc set is currently selling for under 7 bucks, if you don't have this film and love westerns, well you really have no excuse to collect this, very highly recommended.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|This CD is amazing and was cheaper here on Amazon than anywhere else.  I got it quick after it was released with no hitches or waits.  Thank so much!  I knew I needed the CD and haven't stopped listening to it!

B0010AN7Y0|4.0|Rita is a great writer and this situation \\"comedy\\" has its lighter moments, but it's really a heavier topic for most of the characters' lives.  It's also great to see Rita in a role as compared to her stand up comedy routines.  The biggest surprise of all was seeing Huge Laurie and Stephen Fry in different roles from their Jeeves and Wooster characters, and of course, House.
B0014KD46W|4.0|This is another fine piece of work from Steve Winwood, who's unique voice and keyboard playing have blessed the world for over forty years.<br /><br />After all these years it is difficult for an artist such as he to stir up the emotions of youth but the experience of the years of playing with some of the best in the world shows through.<br /><br />For me this is a direct descendent from the Traffic years with the jazzy and funky orientated pieces and the homage to Chris Woods with the hauntingly beautiful flute contibutions. I may be reading too much into this by suggesting that this is Winwood's Eulogy to his former bandmates, most of whom are no longer with us.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed Hungry Man which could well have been a jam with the Grateful Dead from their second album Anthem of the Sun.<br /><br />This album grows and grows with repeated playing and at higher volumes and is particularly appropriate in these long hot days of summer here in North carolina. If you liked High heeled Boys or On the Road, then you will like this.
B00125WAWS|3.0|THE GREAT DEBATERS is an interesting historical look at the first black debating team to ever compete at a white college. And although it is interesting as a film, it isn't very historically accurate.<br /><br />The good is that, as a film viewer, you care about the main characters. Denzel Washington ([[ASIN:B00005JPD0 Deja Vu]]) stars in -- and directs -- this ethnically challenging movie, and does so in his usually adequate way. Melvin B. Tolson (Washington) is the teacher of the Wiley College debate team in 1935 Texas. His team is comprised of three bright young black people: Henry Lowe (Nate Parker), an overly-clever man with a possible future ...if he can stay out of harm's way; Samantha Brooke (Jurnee Smollett, [[ASIN:B0009WPM1Q House, M.D.]]), the first female debater in Wiley College history; and James Farmer Jr. (Denzel Whitaker), a chubby lad with a penchant for research.<br /><br />Growing up in the South (that's South with a capital \\"S\\"), the team must not only fight to win debates against local colleges, but must also battle the prejudices of the times. They come into close contact with ignorance and racism on a daily basis. Even their teacher, Mr. Tolson, is threatened at various crossroads.<br /><br />This is what stood out in the film ...and rightfully so. But there were some serious flaws in the film, too. The biggest was the debates themselves. Many of them were based on emotion and not facts and statistics. It would've also been nice to have had the names of the actual persons within the film and not some made-up ones (some were real, like Tolson, but others were not).<br /><br />Some praise has to be made for Forest Whitaker ([[ASIN:B000NIVJF4 The Last King of Scotland]]) as Dr. James Farmer Sr. His role was understated and held much of the powerful, emotional punch toward the final third of the movie, especially when his son James Jr. discovers why his father reacts the way he does during an embarrassing prejudicial moment.<br /><br />That Wiley's black debaters made it to Harvard and debated their team is now history. But I would've liked to have seen more of the actual history than this Hollywooded version. Still, it's an interesting movie that'll give many viewers an insight into something they probably knew nothing about.and debated their team is now history.

B0013FSL3E|4.0|By the vote counter up there, I can tell you all agree with me!!  I'm on a real hot streak now; three films in a row that people are all lathered up about and three films I didn't hate but didn't love either.  Wall-E is the latest film to squander great potential on a few poor decisions.  I need to make this clear newspaper style:<br /><br />SOME OF THIS MIGHT BE CONSIDERED SPOILER:  CONSIDER YOURSELF WARNED.<br /><br />-MACHIINES WITH PERSONALITY<br />Unlike the unaffecting characters in \\"Robots\\", Wall-E robots are full of loveable personality.  They seem to have an innate ability to love and care for things often trivial.  How they recognize what is of value is assumed to be part of whatever AI they have been given.  They also seem to crave physical contact, regardless of their lack or need of tactile sensitivity.  These machines have traits that their contemporary humans have forgotten despite these traits being instinctive to the species.<br /><br />-DOING THE EASY THINGS SPECTACULARLY<br />Pixar should get credit for making the first half of Wall-E as realistic as any CG film ever created.  The cityscapes are haunting, the environmental effects palpable, and the machines detailed and gritty.  The virtual lack of dialogue causes the viewer to stay mentally locked to the screen.  Despite the implausible scenario taking place, I was immersed in this film with heart and soul.  Of course, true animation genius is in the depiction of organic life forms<br /><br />-A WORLD OF POP-N-FRESH PEOPLE<br />At some point in this film, we meet the people out in space.  Inexplicably, they are all Americans, they are all divided into 2 age groups and we don't know how they have survived 700 years without procreating.  That's right folks; out in the depths of space, all of human kind is either a 30 something adult or an 18 month-ish toddler and they are all Americans.  I don't need to tell you about their grotesque, atrophy induced obesity; I'm sure you've heard about it.  As real as everything else looked, the people all look like well animated, pink pop-n-fresh's and my immersion into this film ended.  It seems Pixar has yet to master the most difficult subject matter; people.  Introduction of humanity started to beg questions; since people don't make physical contact anymore (they don't even look at each other), where did the babies come from and where are the old people?  Where are the Africans, Mid-easterns, Asians and Hispanics descendants?  Also, even in space without any natural resources, humans still produce enormous amounts of trash.  Where are the materials and the food coming from? This brought up many disturbing scenarios in my mind; Soylent Green anyone?<br /><br />-CRUSHING SOCIO-POLITICAL MESSAGE<br />Do you go to a Pixar film to be hammered with socio-political commentary?  Do you think it's ok to preach your views in a \\"children's film\\" regardless of the message?  If you think this film was not heavy handed in its message then you must be compliant with the message and not mind your kids being taught Pixar's views.  The film \\"Fern Gully\\" made a strong ecological message without blaming anyone specifically or implying it knew what the real consequences were.  Wall-E gets pretty specific about whom to blame; American consumerism, Big Box Stores, Industry, technology culture... ...well, everything perceived wrong with America by Pixar (ironically).  It also gets very specific about what \\"will\\" happen to the Earth.  I can't say I disagree with all of their views but is this kid's film the proper venue?  They couldn't have been less subtle.<br /><br />-KIDS WON'T GET THIS AND SOME ADULTS WILL IGNORE IT<br /> Many people would suggest that I should just enjoy Wall-E as a family film and move on; why get all wrapped up in the message?  Believe me; I did enjoy much of this film.  Artistically it has a lot going for it.  Overall, it's a fairly fun movie.  But, if I should ignore the message, why is it there?  I guess I'm damned for actually thinking about films that I watch.  In the end, the message stood out like an ugly tumor.  It had a clear agenda and was obtrusive in this family film.  I teach my kids to learn by observation, education and to think for themselves. This is what Wall-E is suggesting we do; isn't it?<br /><br />-SIT THROUGH THE END CREDITS<br />Artistically speaking, the end credits are very unique.  It basically wraps up the ridiculously optimistic future of the formerly (not but days before) incapable American Humans.  It depicts them reviving the earth armed with one plant.  I don't know how they gleaned other species of plant life through this one plant, but that's really not the point.  As the credits take us through the new human legacy, the art style progresses from cave painting up to digital, pixilated art (with some nice art periods between).  Some pretty cool Peter Gabriel Music fills the gaps; very nice.<br /><br />-I'M NOT A HATER... ...REALLY!!<br />I recommend you go see Wall-E.  It's a good film though it missed greatness.  When you put strong social statements into a film, you have a responsibility to support your argument.  The story lacks the required details to support the statement, and rightfully so.  In fact, the statement should have been handled in a much less obtrusive manner or not made at all.  Please go see this armed with the knowledge that Pixar is voicing a specific socio-political opinion.  I'm not admonishing the opinion, but rather the forum in which they voiced it.  Apprise your kids that other opinions exist before entering.  Talk about ecological issues.  Talk about humanities loss of intimacy in our society if you like.  Talk about perceptions of the big-box mentality.  I don't care what you talk about, just talk to your kids before Pixar does.  If you don't, you will be guilty of the very complacency Pixar so cleverly admonishes us for in this film.

B001ACY8D2|3.0|Anyone hoping for an album along the lines of Takk or () will be disappointed with this latest offering.  Having turned their backs on their post/progressive rock roots, this latest offering is much more of a commercial mainstream pop/rock album.    Whilst not a bad album in its own right, with the exception of the second track which sounds like something from the Eurovision song contest, I can't help feeling that Sigur Ros have taken a commerical decision to cash in on their success by going more mainstream.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|The creators of LOST have done it again when their third season went beyond my expectations. It is well worth the price to purchase it for the amount     received in the package. I found this season both entertaining and suspenseful. I can't wait till season four comes out on DVD.
0553381687|5.0|&lt;first chapter spoilers below><br />This book violates enough of my heroic fiction stereotypes to be worth highly recommending.  For example, the first chapter involves an execution, but there's no bold rescue of the prisoner, and the lord who ordered (and carried out) the execution turns out to be a nice guy.<br />&lt;first chapter spoilers end><br /><br />This turns out to be a theme of the book.  Deciding who are the \\"good guys\\" and who are the \\"bad guys\\" is difficult here (although there are some exceptions).  There are shocking events and some good twists and surprises.<br /><br />As I perused the reviews here, I noticed that this book does have some detractors.  I suppose that's to be expected, and I appreciate even dissenting views.  Count me among the many fans, however.
1592533868|5.0|I own several paper quilling books and this is one of my favorites. I highly reccomend it. Claire shows off beautiful work, ranging from the simple to the complex. I also enjoyed her gallery in the back a great deal. The only thing is that nearly all the pieces are floral themed, which I found to be perfectly fine.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|While I was in HMV, the track \\"Cemeteries of London\\" was playing; I thought \\"I NEED  to have this album!\\" I took it home, my dorm, and had a party to listen to it and everyone loved it. I feel this is Coldplays' best album, thus far. I tend to favor, besides previously mentioned, Violet hill, Viva la Vida but all are good.<br /><br />\\"Cemeteries of london\\" has a mellow and dreary touch between the lyrics and composition. The placement of the guitars are wicked. It gives off a hippie, mystic celtic and freeness emotion.<br /><br />\\"Viva la Vida\\" that song you hear on that ipod commercial with the lovely lights. This song has a refreshing sound with a blast of classical instruments! It makes me feel like dancing, honestly. It is just beautiful.<br /><br />\\"Violet Hill\\" had a strut feeling to the music composition alone. The lyrics make you pat attention to the story.<br /><br />My only complaint about the album is the shortness of sme of the songs but the timing seems perfect; I'm just super picky. I love the hidden track of \\"Lovers in Japan,\\" it feels connected.
B0015FWRHS|4.0|I'm not a big jazz-head, but I happened to flip to my local public radio station just as song from this CD was playing, and I had to find out who the musicians are.  There was a freshness, especially to the drumming, that really drew me in.  I contacted the radio station and the jazz programmer told me who they were and that my reaction was typical--drummers seem to really love this CD.  I haven't drummed in many years and was never more than a adequate rock and blues drummer, but I know enough to appreciate talent when I run across it.  This is an unusual CD with a several truly wonderful songs on it.  And by playing up the drum work I don't mean to damn with faint praise the other two members of the trio, the bassist and pianist.  All the musicianship is top-notch, solid stuff.  It's just, the percussion work really rises above the norm.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I am really impressed with this workout!  I was sweating and out of breath in each interval of Level 2!  I did this workout On Demand twice and will definitely be purchasing it!  I work out about 5-6 times a week and 2 of those times w/ a trainer for an hour.  With Jillian, there is no down time and I am working really hard.  She motivates you and just when you think you can't do another minute, she lets you know that there's just 2 more reps, etc., So you'll push yourself to get those last few reps in.  I think it's time to save some money on the gym trainer and start picking up the pace w/ Jillian.  I'm hoping to be able to do two of the workouts back to back for one incredible workout!  That's my goal!!!  Give it a try!  You will not be sorry!!!

0452289963|2.0|Sorry, maybe it's just me but I just don't get it.  I'm more of a practical bent but this book required slogging through a whole lot of vapor to get anything out of it.    There are books you read where you have a hard time putting them down.  Then there are books you have to force yourself to finish.  \\"A New Earth\\" fell into the latter category for me.  I had heard much of the Oprah-cized hype over the book which I met with high expectations.    At the end, though, it seemed over-reaching in its quest for spiritual profundity.  Be mindful.  Be in the moment.  Be a human being, not a human doing.    You could have boiled it down to that and spared us all about 280 pages.
B00140PK6O|5.0|Excellant viewing.  I watched all the episodes in one evening.  I had to see them all and was sad when it ended.  I am gettting ready to watch them again before summer is over!It's a classic must see if you like Jane Austen too. I loved all the characters, they were well developed. You felt lilke you really knew them.  It's a good clean, wholesome movie.  Very rare.
0060558121|2.0|I initially went to Barnes and Noble to pick up Neil Gaiman's \\"Neverwhere\\" after reading many positive reviews on Amazon.  It was not in stock, but the sales clerk, who claimed to be a fan of Gaiman, said that \\"American Gods\\" was her favorite book of his.<br /><br />This was the first novel of Gaiman's I have read and was very let down.  At points it would peak my interest, but these were few and far between (and mostly occurred at the end).<br /><br />I also believe there must have been at least 200 pages that could have been removed with no detrimental effect to the story being told.  Lots of frivolous, too-much-information going on here.  The book never felt cohesive to me, like the author never found proper direction in it and instead just zig-zagged through the whole story.<br /><br />I have been on a hot streak of good books lately.  For well over the past 6 months I have managed to find books that I found amazing and absorbing.  That streak ended with \\"American Gods\\".  .<br /><br />Solid/interesting premise, poor execution, hard to relate to characters (even those who are not gods), and some down right annoying characters and dialog choices.  I'm doubting whether or not to give any of his other books a try after this.
0517123207|4.0|I read this book, here in Brazil.The author, Darwin was an atheist and a racist.Writen at the same time and place, as Francis Galton and Karl Marx, Darwin didn't followed both of these charlatans, to the sewages of history.  The theory of evolution began first in Greece and was also supported by another english, Wallace; but Charles Darwin, with this book really put evolution in mankind's mind.This book was read by Karl Marx, Adolf Hitler, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Winston Churchill,Mussolini,etc.  Someone will claims that Darwin knew nothing, about the genes and DNA.Fossils found decades after this book be published, also put new evidences to evolution.Even so, the main claim of this book,evolution, was increased in believe, by time.Begined by this book, darwinism is alive and good today.
B000RPTQ1C|2.0|this album is pretentious and bad.  it sounds nothing like any other coldplay album and i do not recommend it.
0385340567|2.0|I'm a Lee Child fan and a Jack Reacher fan. I actually bought the Advance Review Copy of this one on eBay for (relatively) big bucks well in advance of publication, as I have for the last few in the series. Typically, this is money well spent. Not so much this time out.<br /><br />Reacher books are usually guaranteed page-turners, but this one was plodding, forgettable, and limp. It's as if Child subcontracted the series to a lesser talent, as Reacher almost felt like he was going through the motions trying to understand the comings, goings, and whatnot on the road between Hope and Despair (I mean, puhleaze).<br /><br />Can't wait for the next one -- I'm still a fan -- but here's hoping Child returns to form.
B0001932ZA|4.0|Arnold Schwarzenegger is a game show contestant in which the stakes are his life.  Framed for a crime, he must literally run from his life from \\"stalkers\\" that are cheered on by an in person audience of thousands and a TV audience of millions.  These assailants could pass for Marvel Comics supervillians.  \\"The Running Man\\" is a game show has a contract with the government to place people convicted of major violent crimes on its show and satisfy people's desire to see these criminals hunted down.  Full pardons are supposedly available to those who survive.  Although this government is totalitiarian and is not big on free speech, they do allow \\"The Running Man\\" because it satisfies a poor and hungry population and serves as a valuable distraction.    The movie features Richard Dawson as the game show host, someone who was also a game show host in real life.  It also has Jesse Ventura, long before he was governor of Minnesota, as one of the stalkers.      The scene in which Schwarzenegger is running in loud colored tourist garb from police who are chasing him to get close enough to shoot a net over him is hilarious.    This is an example of what I call political science fiction.  It features a possible future social political scenario that is dramatic and far fetched.  Unlike traditional science fiction, this movie is not concerned with technology or speculations of what scientific discoveries and inventions will have been made by a particular point in the future.      Although our government is a far cry from \\"totalitarian\\", it is amazing how much in The Running Man has come true.  We do indeed have a government that has encroached more on our privacy and our civil liberties.  I generally agree with the DVD's special feature on civil liberties, but I would like for them to have given some examples of what they are talking about.  We also have contest shows that border on exploitation, courtesy of broadcasters that will put anything on TV for ratings.  The recent glutof reality TV is an example of this, as confirmed by another special feature on this DVD.  The set for \\"Climbing for Dollars\\", a TV show which Amber is watching in her apartment, eeriely resembles the set of \\"Fear Factor.\\"    Who would have guessed that this 1987 movie would be able to tell us so much about our world today?
B000Y1ZXUM|5.0|For my first concert Blu-Ray, I picked this, and I feel pretty much any other concert film I see/buy will somehow always fail to live up to this experience.    Seriously. The combination of an amazing performance, vivid visuals and crystalline sound was, in a word, thrilling.    Let me get the technical stuff out of the way.     The Hi-Def picture is outstanding, only having a bit of difficulty during scenes lit in a certain hue of red. Otherwise, the \\"you are there\\" feeling is overwhelming. Faces in the crowd, dazzling light spectacles, certain glee-filled glances from Shakira...    The sound is, as expected, terrific. Crowd noise envelopes appropriately...although the filmmakers decide to reign in some of the singalongs so we can better hear the artist herself. Wise choice, as the initial emotional swell, like in \\"Antologia\\" is tremendously effective, but you don't want to hear it for the whole song.  The stage has an aural three-dimensionality to it.    Now, the performance itself. Volcanic. I found myself thinking during the show, that I can think of no other superstar that demonstrates such breadth of talent in such a short period of time. She sings, she dances, she plays guitar and harmonica...she does a ballet thing, she does lots of belly-dancing-like moves...some more hip-hop (\\"Hips Don't Lie\\") and some more traditional (\\"Ojos Asi\\").     She is absolutely engaged with her audience; there is a phenomenal  mutual attraction going on here. Listen to the roar when she starts \\"Pies Descalzos\\". That song may not be as well known to her English-speaking fans, but here it will cause anyone who hears it for the first time to seek it out. It will become your new favorite song based on her infectious, enthusiastic performance. It's awesome.    There are some songs that are traditional Latin ballads, other rock out like she's channeling her inner AC/DC.  She hits vocal notes that'll send chills down your spine. One song impossibly has all three...\\"Inevitable\\".    Thereare guest spots that amp up the energy. Alejandro Sanz comes in on \\"La Tortura\\" and the place comes unglued. The song is positively molten hot; they have chemistry to burn. Plus, her chest and her hips seem to move completely independently of one another, and you can't take your eyes off of her.    This is not one disc you can leave on in the background while you clean the house or read a magazine. I couldn't take my eyes away from the screen.    Wyclef Jean appears for \\"Hips Don't Lie\\", the joyous finale to the concert. Shakira dances with such abandon that at one point, I was worried she would dislocate several major joints simultaneously. The grin on your face will match the huge, glorious smile on hers...    Shakira herself looks absolutely beautiful here, and the cameras take every opportunity to show her off. The number of close-ups on her 1) face, 2) breasts, 3) belly and 4) posterior is a number far too large to fathom, but from this guy's point of view, it wasn't enough. : )     Come on, nobody moves like Shakira, and when those non-lying hips fly around like that, it's hypnotic. And based on the crowd's response, I'm not alone.    She exhibits a refreshing pleasure in the sheer act of \\"entertaining\\"; it reminded me a lot of Springsteen actually. It's an unfettered joy of entertaining an audience so completely that the experience elevates itself to a level higher than a simple \\"I'll play music, you cheer\\" regular concert. The Rolling Stones know how to put on a show, but you never feel as if they \\"need\\" to do this.     It feels like Shakira needs to perform in the same way she needs to breathe. She's a force of nature...    Trust me: you can't WAIT to see this.
B000WGWQG8|4.0|HBO's John Adams is a good miniseries. I love to view programs about the revolutionary period/early U.S. Government period. Very enjoyable program!<br />~Dan
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This was a gift to my husband who is a history buff.  He loved it and it was nice that he could watch it at his own pace.  The bonus of having the extra facts come up was interesting to know.
B0002234LS|3.0|If I hadn't seen that \\"Secret Window\\" was adapted from a Stephen King story I wouldn't have been surprised.  This flick just smacks of deja vu.  It's not bad King but it's not particularly great.  The blocked writer in a remote setting with murder and mayhem ensuing is just so familiar.  What elevates the film beyond the mundane are game performances by Johnny Depp as the harried writer and John Turturro delivering an inspired turn straight from \\"Night of the Hunter\\".  Maria Bello looks hot but essentially wasted.  Forgettable in the near extreme.
0307237702|2.0|Obama's book, is much like his political career, all style no substance. Look, I voted for Kerry in 2004-would vote for him again in 2008-but Obama just turns me off. I bought this book, thinking that it would change my opinion, but he seems much more like a \\"life-coach\\" and less like a Presidential candidate.
B0008G2IRO|5.0|I love the CD. After 2 years I still can't get enough of it. However, I sprung for this enhanced version when I read that it contained complete lyrics. FYI: it does not.     There are only fragments from each song and even those are clearly NOT what went to tape in some places.
B000I0RNV6|5.0|I saw \\"Cinema Paradiso\\" more than 30 times. Each time I cry like a baby and each time I like it more. It's the best film I ever saw and I'll be seeing it at least 30 more times. Don't miss it!
0765309408|3.0|I ordered this book used, which helped lessen my overall disappointment with it, on the basis of a recommendation on a review of a Alistair Reynolds book. The poster on that review pointed to this book as a superior example of the theme of that book (Revelation Space).    Don't get me wrong, it wasn't awful, it was OK hence the three stars. The characters while somewhat engaging, were kind of formulaic and one dimensional. Plot line could have been lifted from a WW II movie and proceeded pretty much as expected.    If you want a light weight sci-fi beach book, you'll be fine, just don't expect much else
1591841992|4.0|If you need to communicate ideas get this book. Simple to read and understand. Great thoughts on how to get ideas across visually. It isn't about the quality of the drawings either. You can do it.
0061537934|5.0|This was a good book. Quick read, there was a decent amount of drama, and the main character took it all in stride. All the while Enzo reporting in his \\"dogish\\" way. I like that he felt he was almost human, he responded in human ways, but every once in a while his \\"dogness\\" would come through. Case in point; the zebra. Makes you think about how a dog thinks, and how, maybe, they do want to respond when you talk to them. I like his racing interjections, great stuff, especially the Ayrton Senna introspec, as well as simple, but excellent, points about racing in general. It almost make you feel that you can go out and race, at least with the philosophical side of racing all wrapped up, in a few simple statements. Ahh, if it were that easy.  Hmm, I am not sure I like the way it ended though, a little too nicely wrapped up. I guess that makes everyone feel good at the end, but it is a little too perfect. That is a transition is hard to make, and he doesnt seem to be of that caliber. I will not go into spoiling it, but you can decide. No doubt, this will become a movie. enjoy.
B0018AK9RK|5.0|Judas Priest is one of the most talented heavy metal bands. They started almost 40 years ago with a mixture of hard rock and progressive rock, then turned to heavy metal, speed metal, whatever they call it. They are so diverse, it is difficult to define their style. None of their albums look alike, each and every one of them is different. They always try new things, and, besides Turbo, never failed. But with Nostradamus they have outdone themselves. Nostradamus is metal opera, and at the same time, vintage Priest. I don't think Rob Halford has ever been able to show the whole beauty and range of his voice. Deep Purple's Don Airey is probably the best keyboardist one could think of to invite for such an ambitious project. Lost Love and New beginning are the two songs I would remove from the song list, but the rest is so great! A stunning album, a masterpiece from one of the best bands ever!
0446677450|4.0|Worth the money for the authors approach about assets and liabilities.  His personal story is not very interesting but I like the way he focuses on different types of income. Do not expect a lot of detailed information since most of his \\"examples\\" are BS.  His wife needed a new car so she just went out and found a property that would give her $500/month cash flow with no money down.  Yeah right.  All said and done though this book will motivate you and help keep your head in the right mind-frame.    Do not bother buying ANY of the other Rich Dad, Poor Dad books, they are only a re-hash of the information in this one.
B000005H3M|4.0|Buddy's speed and crispness are simply unmatched.      This is big band material, not the traditional jazz I typically listen to.    The tightness of the band and horn arrangements is remarkable.    The additional cuts here on the remaster are a welcome addition.
0316143472|4.0|While looking though the other reviews of this collection of essays, I have to admit that most reviewers seem to be leaving out an important aspect of this book.  Yes, David Sedaris is an amazing author with the ability to turn minor day-to-day traumas into laugh-inducing tales, but he is also excellent at portraying the less-than-glamorous side of life into riveting, sometimes shocking tales that often make the reader reflect upon their on life experiences.  I found that this collection is filled with more of the latter and less of the humerous essays, which isn't a bad thing.  Granted, I will admit that I prefer the ones that make me laugh out loud, and there are a few of those in this book, but not as many as his others; this book seems to be more of a reflection on happenings that have shaped or touched the auther.  While I have thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good read, maybe a warning could be issued to some Sedaris fans that this collection is definitely on the heavier side and that this is not a book filled with laughs, though, of course, it does have it's moments!
1932100660|5.0|The reader should carefully study the credentials of the author and the dept and breadth of the study to establish credability of thw work. That done, you can't disbelieve the findings. It will change your life.

B000063JDE|5.0|After his father has a stroke, clean-cut college student Jeffery Beaumont (Kyle McLaughlin) returns home to help out in his father's hardware store. While walking in a field one day, he discovers a severed ear which leads him and girlfriend, policeman's daughter, Sandy Williams (Laura Dern), on a Hardy Boys-esque investigation that takes them to the dark underbelly of their perfect American small town existence.    Imagine a 1930's film noir with sex and drugs, and the Hardy Boys as detectives, and you've got a pretty good idea of what this film is about. \\"Blue Velvet\\" takes standard crime film elements that you have seen dozens of times before and combines them into one of the most original films you have ever seen in your life. The central theme of this film is the battle between all that is wholesome, or good and that which is corrupt, or evil. The side of good is represented by Jeffery Beaumont, sort of a real-world Frank Hardy and a forerunner to McLaughlin's \\"Twin Peaks\\" character, Dale Cooper. Between Jeffery Beaumont and Dale Cooper, to me, McLaughlin is the face of innocence and this film is all about the loss of that innocence and its redemption. On the side of evil is drug-addicted, expletive-spewing Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper), truly the most frightening and disturbing villain ever.     \\"Blue Velvet\\" is a very nasty, in-your-face movie that is most certainly not for all tastes (I read on the internet that many people walked out when this film was first shown in cinemas and I can see why). It is also a very weird film (although, by the standards set by David Lynch's other movies, this film is positively normal) and many scenes in it are designed to be endured rather than enjoyed. Yet, unlike many other similarly dark films, I didn't come out of this film feeling dirty (something that I felt after seeing \\"Sin City\\"). I felt that, just like Jeffery Beaumont, I had journeyed to the underworld but had returned, and in the course of that return, any evil thatI had encountered had been washed away. For this reason, if you do see this film, I recommend that you stay with it until the end. The middle might be bad, but in the end, all is restored.
0440178002|5.0|What a great read--kept thinking about the story while I was off in normal life. It was very interesting to see the main character transform from one culture to another as the storyline progressed. Just one of those books where you're sad that it ended, the magic over, and you're left cleaning up your mind space from such a great literary party.
B0013FNC38|3.0|I didn't really care for the 70s pop flavored tunes on here. I liked I'm Yours and Lucky. And, while the music style of Butterfly wasn't to my taste, I dug the sensuality of the lyrics. Coyotes and A Beautiful Mess are also worth listening to.
0446677450|4.0|The book has some great ideas, but I get the mental image of a late night infomertial.  The basic storyline of the book is a bit far fetched, but there are plenty of ideas about finances and investing to get you thinking.
B0014XCMVM|2.0|Alanis has always been one of my favorite artists since Jagged Little Pill. And her albums, for me, go right down the chronological line in terms of depth, power to move, and just pure awesomeness. And that is with very few degrees of separation between each release because they are all marvelous.     I have to disagree with the \\"starred reviewer\\" in that I felt that Flavors of Entanglment was her LEAST emotionally satisfying album. Alanis was trying too hard to keep her intelligent lyrics and flawless melodious sound intact, which results in the songs sounding false and forced.     There are some interesting elements (the music styles, beats, instrumentation), but the clever lyrics are not up to par. I still have not been able to listen to this album all the way through.     However, this release DOES prove how superior Alanis is to many of the female pop artists out there. This is her weakest effort but it is still head and shoulders above her pop peers. I just hope her next album touches me like Jagged through So Called Chaos.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|What others have said is true:  this is a clumsy hybrid of Blair Witch and the most recent Godzilla film with Matthew Broderick, right down to the baby monsters popping up all over.  There is nothing original here at all, actually.  (Orson Welles used the same techniques on radio nearly 70 years ago - but his \\"War of the Worlds\\" was ground-breakingly brilliant!)  This flick's poster is more rivetting than the actual film - yet even the poster is derivative of the closing shots of the original 'Planet of the Apes.' I also never knew any camcorder battery to last as long as Hud's does in this movie. The monster also looks totally fake and stupid. Anyway - a far better film in this same genre is \\"The Host\\" out of South Korea a few years ago.  Now there was a well-made big monster movie with big human themes! Terrific special effects and music score, too.  Lousy dubbing...but still a thousand times better than \\"Cloverfield.\\"
B000002HK4|5.0|If you are into progressive metal at all ... or, dare I say if you are into metal/rock music at all, then you owe yourself to at least once hear the title track from this song.    Don't just 'listen' to it.   Put on some headphones.   Get the lyrics down in front of you.   Read the lyrics when the vocals are sung, and close your eyes in between.    Hopefully you'll agree that it's one of the greatest tracks ever -- a mirror of a passage through a man's life, and through the change of seasons that come in everyone's life.    A masterpiece of sound and emotion.

B000ZK0KKK|5.0|When you're just beginning to learn guitar there are two things you want.  You want to play LOUD, and you don't want anyone to hear how bad you play.  This thing solves both of those problems.   Sure you could get one of those \\"Mini\\" amps,  but they aren't really all that mini,  then you need a cord from your guitar connected to the mini amp,  and then you need headphones connected to the mini amp.    With this,  it's so small, you just plug it into your guitar, and plug your headphones into it.  Done.
B00081U7HC|1.0|With all the \\"careers\\" they could have used for Julia Roberts in this film, why was prostitution the first choice?<br /><br />She could have been the desk clerk, a cab driver, the cashier in a book store, a chef in the hotel kitchen, a nanny, a manicurist, the president of the damn bank across the street... anything, anything, anything but a hooker! What is romantic about VD, rape, jail time, pimps, etc?<br /><br />What does this film say about relationships between men and women? I know this is a popular film, and that scares me even more. A big studio put big money into this, and it tells me all I need to know about their attitudes.
B0000931QA|5.0|Love this album and it is hard to find in stores. I am glad I found it at such a resonable price. Shipping was great and speedy.
B000024ZZ0|5.0|Let me start with saying that I love this album and find it well worth the purchase.  HOWEVER, if you are not familiar with \\"Backstreet Symphony\\" and are just getting your feet wet with this band, that may be a better place to start.<br /><br />Although this album is quite catchy and in good form, it is a bit more \\"pop\\" than their prior effort.  It seems as if the producers tried to smoothe out their edge a bit, but this is definitely a fine follow-up to their first.
0441013597|4.0|Dune truely is one of the absolute finest fantasy (and sci-fi) novels ever and subsequently has become a role model for many science fiction works that came after including George Lucas' Star Wars. The complex plot throughout is stunning, how Herbert creates a fantasy world that is so flawless down to every little detail shows how much dedication he took in writing it.      The only problem with Dune is--the writing isn't as smooth and easy to read as it should to make this a true masterpiece. Herbert might be capable of creating a plot around his entirely fictional world flawlessly, but Dune is not a fast easy read. Unlike writers like Kurt Vonnegut for example you find large parts of this book are far too wordy, making it at times a slow, and other times, occasionally Dull. Plot events don't just flow from one part to the other. Herbert also has a strange habbit of throwing in far too many obscure vocabulary words into characters dialogue. In descriptions this is actually a blessing, but in all seriousness, who talks like they're reading out of a thesarus in conversation? With better writing this book would be totally flawless. Because of the writing the plot is occasionally cumbersome and jagged, but the ideas behind it are so stunning that the read is certainly worthwhile. Rest assured...if you have ANY bypassing interest in this genre check this out.

0142000663|5.0|As a former resident of California, I was often shocked on how the locals treated the Mexicans. After working all day, some were paid virtually nothing, and some were actually paid nothing. And because they couldn't complain to the government they were just \\"out of luck.\\" This book addresses that very issue, if only dealing with the white \\"oakies.\\" The point of this novel makes about migrant workers is just as valid today as it was 80 whatever years ago.<br />  Steinbecks writing is occasionally criticized, but I cannot figure out why. Steinbeck takes a quasi-journalistic approach to his writing, flawlessly fusing fiction and reporting throughout the writing. This is a book that is simultaneously interesting and informative. Its like a newspaper thats also entertaining. The writing is very fluid, and despite the novels length (my edition was over 600 pgs) its actually not a boring, slow read. The characters are well developed and interesting, if in some cases a tad unbelievable.<br />  A great novel. The only people that probably object are middle and upper class conservatives that can't accept that anyone should be able to speak out against those less fortunate than themselves

B000WZAE1I|5.0|Bought this movie at Blockbuster as part of their previewed movies for sale - totally worth it.  Great cast, great story, great script.  Yvainne (the fallen star) is awesome.  First of all, glad to see Claire Daines in something again 'cause I haven't seen her in a while.  But when you first see her, knowing she's a fallen star, you expect her to be all sweet and chipper - but she's really not.  She's much more real than that.  Love the comedy from the three witch sisters and the entrail reading and everything.  Really good movie with a good fairy tale ending - but a unique one.
0743290119|1.0|Needless to say, I picked this up because I loved her book, The Devil Wears Prada.\\" This novel in comparison is CRAP. The whole way through I kept hoping I would begin to like or relate to to care about her characters, but they always fell flat. The writing is blurry at best and cluttered with cliches. I wish I had spent my money on a better book.

B000MRAAJM|5.0|Superb time-lapse photography!  Best Hi-Def documentary i've seen.  (Only drawback:  David Attenborough talks too softly, and when you increase the volume to hear him, the music is ear-splitting!)
B0013FSL3E|2.0|WALL-E exemplifies how stale the genre of computer-animated movies has become.  The film is cloying and clichéd and looks like other Pixar motion pictures.  Wouldn't you think that by this point in time, Pixar could find a way to make people not appear to be inflatable sex dolls?  The movie is as lazy as the people who inhabit its dystopian future (of course, being a Disney movie, WALL-E has the obligatory uplifting, Disneyrific ending): It barely is long enough to be a feature film (hence the featurette \\"Presto\\" that precedes WALL-E, a short cartoon that is much more entertaining that the main feature), it uses a visually boring and ridiculously easy-to-animate probe (Eve) as one of its main characters, and its plot elements are so perfunctory that, for instance, when WALL-E appears to have \\"amnesia,\\" the scriptwriters don't bother to come up with a solution that would strain the characters or, for that matter, the scriptwriters--instead, after a few fretful minutes, WALL-E miraculously regains its memory, and all is again well in the world.    The movie has a political message against consumer culture and against people who live only virtual lives, but, like everything else in the movie, the message is derivative: Idiocracy mined this thematic territory with better results a few years ago.  The musical and thematic allusions to 2001: A Space Odyssey only reinforce WALL-E's unoriginality.  But worst of all, the film's heart is as artificial and uninteresting as the robotic protagonists.  Could anyone really care or buy into the love story between these two cartoonish robots?  Perhaps children will find this film to be interesting (although the movie begins so slowly, I don't know that they still would be paying attention when the movie picks up steam later), but this movie has little to offer adults.

B000J5NXLY|4.0|The Sekonic L-208 is the least expensive professional light meter on the market, and has been a standard for years as a result. I have been using mine for over five years. I use numerous older cameras, some of which have no integrated light meters, and the accuracy of those that do is unknown, or they rely on batteries that can not be found, or which are too expensive for the value they would provide. It's easier and, in the long run, cheaper, to master a single external meter that works with all the cameras.<br /><br />Operating the L-208 is simple -- dial in your ISO setting, set the lever to \\"incident\\" or \\"reflected\\" light, hold the meter where you want to measure the light (pointing at the camera for incident light, or at the target for reflected), and press the button.<br /><br />Pro: it works, and the needle indicates a range of choices, the shutter speeds appropriate for a complete range of apertures. The battery lasts forever. It's small and light.<br /><br />Con: it is too easy to accidentally spin the ISO dial, resulting in nonsense numbers. The \\"incident/reflected\\" lever is unmarked; I added my own labels, otherwise I could never remember which way was which. When I use it in public places, people sometimes think I am using a geiger counter to test for radioactivity.<br /><br />Though the device is entirely plastic, I have had no problems with reliability. If I should ever replace my L-208, I will get another Sekonic.
B000WC3A0S|4.0|I was very happy to find the entire Rocky series in one package, and for such a great price!  However, we sat down to watch Rocky II and discovered that there is a big scratch on the brand new disc, rendering that episode unwatchable.  I will be contacting Amazon for assistance in returning/exchanging, after I check all the other discs for similar flaws.
0930073193|5.0|You will be surprised by this book.  Economics will be so much easier to understand.  If my economics teachers required everyone to read this book instead of the textbooks we were given it would have been a better class and more students would have really learned economics.    He explains through example that nothing in life is free.
067960085X|5.0|Almost everyone has seen or at least heard of the movie, Breakfast at Tiffany's, but how many have read the original story?  This book is a classic almost fairytale type story of a girl who is struggling with her past and trying to make herself, as well as accept, an identity.  Truman Capote's Breakfast At Tiffany's is an enchanting story, but is much darker than the movie version that the beautiful Audrey Hepburn graces the television screen in.  Much of the slightly disturbing details were left out of the movie, keeping it light and airy and masking Holly's true role, whereas the novel holds a deeper interest, giving specific ups and downs in the life of the fairly subtley depicted call-girl, Holly Golightly.  Happiness, pain, and a final finding herself ties the story together in a beautiful way.  Also, at the end of the book, there is a sweet suprise, with three short stories also written by Truman Capote. Such a good read that I couldn't put it down, and finished all four stories within 24 hours.
B000Q6GX5Y|3.0|There are two sides to this. However, I will begin with the story.    The movie is done well and the story telling is epic. The action is slow. Too slow.. Slow motion only has it's limits, but I guess they wanted to push the CG in this movie. The story of 300 vs a vast army. Very violent and mythical in it's story told. I would suggest watching this.    The two sides. I watched this on blu ray and was sorely disappointed. I guess they tried to make it old looking or something because there were black speckles all over it. In fact it made me sick, and dizzy to watch the quality all speckled. I expect super sharp quality. I have tested this with a different disk and different player. Same effect. Then I watched the DVD version at a buddies place. It looked great. In fact it looked perfectly fine. That's the only issue I had with the movie, was the format.
B0015FHDRW|5.0|Awesome CD.  I'm a big Green Day fan, and anything by Billy Joe Armstrong.  This is a great CD - highly recommended for all Green Day fans.
B0015XHP3G|4.0|Not to expect too much from a film that old. It surprisingly watches really well. Mostly was looking for just smoothed edges. The movie itself is a classic.    The quality is watchable for blue ray. It probably makes out better than some movies because it is just normal.  No crazy special effects. If there were they were not put in by computer.    It's John Rambo before he got all huge.
B000RPTQ1C|4.0|After what seemed like ages when the band was on tour and working on this CD, when I finally got to hear it, it was awesome!  The songs are typical of Coldplay:  contemplative, meaningful, ironic, and beautiful, but I think the album is also a step in a new, more provocative direction for the band.
B001AGXEA6|4.0|More than a review, I would like to know if this Blu Ray comes with Spanish subtitles. Thank u.
0743454537|1.0|I agree with some previous reviewers that the character development is thin, the format is annoying, and the ending is manipulative. The author's hand is so visible in this book that I could never lose sight of it. In spite of a good premise, the story never reaches its potential. Someone told me that it was a well-done view into the teenage mind. For that purpose I would suggest the book \\"Miss American Pie\\" by Margaret Sartor instead.
0790729644|4.0|Before I begin, I would like to give a disclaimer. Although I liked this film, I have only viewed it once and I am also I young man who has not seen many westerns. Therefore, it has not yet grown on me (as many previous reviewers have stated that it does) and also I have very little to compare this film to. With that said, on to the review...    My first impression of this film was that it was very well done. The plot of the film is thick and dark and has many parts, the main segment being the story of Will Munny (Clint Eastwood) and his companion Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman). Munny is a retired assassin in from Kansas who has decided to live a life of rationality in tribute to his wife, raising two children and working (and failing) as a pig farmer. One day Munny is confronted by a young assassin-in-training known only as \\"The Schofield Kid\\" about going to Wyoming to kill two cowboys who slashed a prostitute (there is a $1,000 reward put up by the prostitutes). The film, in an extremely summarized version of the extremely dense storyline, is the story of Will Munny struggling to come to grips with his haunted past.    Although I enjoyed the suspense of the film very much, there were two aspects of the film that I didnt particularly enjoy. The first was the constant use of shadowed lighting which spread shadows across the face of nearly every character in the movie and which made the film extraordinarily difficult to concentrate on. While I understand this technique is used in emphasis of the darkness of the film, I still don't think it added anything to the emotions running within the movie. The second was the use of Richard Harris' character, \\"English Bob\\". I didn't understand how his portion of the storyline was relevant to the rest of the movie other than to allow for an excellent soliloquoy by Gene Hackman inside the town jail. There were many more portions of the film that I did appreciate very much, especially the youthful enthusiasm of the Schofield Kid, who beautifully contrasts Will's bleak denial of his true identity with yearning for adventure.    I will probably watch this film again at some point, but even after one view, I strongly reccommend it for its dark and brutal storyline and excellent acting performances. Watch it several times if you get the chance, and let the film mystique grow on you.
386521584X|5.0|I am a photographer and one of my projects (google \\"LA MACHINE &Agrave; HABITER Emir\\" in if you're curious) is directly related to street photography.<br />Robert Frank is one of my favorite photographers and it is a shame I did not have his \\"The Americans\\" in my posession till this very moment. It is a bible for me.<br />The book is printed very well, paper is exellent, no color shift on B&W images, solid binding. Great quality.<br />And the images, of course. If you like photography, you have to check it out. Highly recommended.

B0014I4KH6|5.0|I am not a big fan of country music but it is a great CD for any woman. I love every song on this CD and hope her next CD is as good as this one.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I didnt have cable when I saw this series advertised on Oprah, but from the clips I saw, I just had to have it!  I was not disappointed, and couldnt get enough of the crystal clear picture and unbelievable video they captured.  You learn something new with each chapter, and it leaves you wanting more!  If you love nature & learning about it as much as I do, you will LOVE this series.
B000LPS47U|3.0|This deserves three and a half stars. If you enjoy a little schlock with your horror SciFi then you should definitely catch Re-Animator. Jeffrey Combs (Star Trek: DS-9, Voyager, Enterprise, etc.) is great and the rest the cast aren't bad. Your typical mad doctor brings the undead back to life to rip peoples heads and insides off. A bit grisly for those unacustomed to horror gore. The production values were not bad for a B movie. Overall a fun experience for teenagers and adults. Contains some nudity. Good quality DVD with some replayability. If you enjoyed this catch \\"Van Helsing\\", \\"Frankenstein\\", and \\"Army of Darkness\\". - C. Luster
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|I loved this cd. I dont think it is Cold Play's best, but it is on par with X&Y, and A Rush of Blood to the Head. If you like Cold Play, I would buy this CD. You will not be disappointed!!!!
B000EQ5SRK|3.0|I have the \\"Unrated Edition\\" but I can't figure out what that is supposed to mean. There are no special features, no content that would merit a rating more restrictive than R. I don't get it.    I understand the ending is different from the book and apparently some of the famous plot holes would not be if the book's ending was used.
0151013837|5.0|This is a really classic book.  This is an allegory within an allegory and therefore is a doubly deceptive book. If you try to read reality into it, you have missed the point. Remember this is a novel; it is not real life and and I do not refer only to the seeming confusion on the end.  This is the story of the difficulties of a young man forsaking one culture to live in another, when he is given no choice. Think of this boy moving from India to Canada and the difficulties that he faces particularly the pull of India that, if he does not conquer, will destroy him: the 450 pound tiger he has to control. Think of the alien character of the sea: Canada is as alien as the sea.  This is a truly exciting book that I recommend people re-read from the double allegory perspective.

0143038419|4.0|Elizabeth Gilbert is a funny, authentic, quirky, liberal, and openminded person.  Very expressive and creative in her writing.  She didn't pretend to be anything other than what she was.  She spoke about very personal things and what really happened to her on her journey.           Some other reviewers seemed to think her insights were shallow and self-absorbed.  It was a memoir - was she supposed to focus on others?  As a woman - I heard myself in things she shared and not so much in others, but I appreciated her honestly expressing what she went through-regardless of whether I would have done the same or not.  It's not easy to open up with so many judgements out there on how we \\"should\\" be - especially for women.  I've had friends who have been through divorce, depression - and they all related a lot to those parts and how much pressure we have to be \\"selfless\\" and just fit the mold.     As for her insights in the Ashram - I've been to meditation treats - intense ones, and it was like that for me as well.  I found her very amusing in her recount of it - and resonated with the challenges and the insights she had there.  I'm not sure if I would have got it before I went.  All in all - a thoroughly enjoyable & amusing book.
B000F9RB8A|5.0|Kung Fu Hustle paints, from a palette consisting of badassitry, comedy (in true Chow fashion) and nostalgic emotion, a unique, exciting, hilarious, heart-felt film that dazzles and entertains from beginning to end. The main character Sing, played by Stephen Chow (Shaolin soccer), chooses a life of crime after an experience as a child which causes him to view chivalry as a futile path trodden by the weak, and thieving and killing as the true path to success and power. Thus, he desires to be in the evil Axe Gang, and not being a member, decides to pretend he is a member of the nefarious gang. But he is not alone in his ruse, his overweight underachieving sidekick goes along with him. They enter a town and begin to pick on the inhabitants. The town is run by a landlady and her husband, and its inhabitants consist of hardworking poor residents who struggle to get by. Perhaps due to skepticism, pride, or stupidity, the town's people do not fall for or submit to Sing's threats. Sing backs off in one hilarious scene, muttering excuses for why he cannot physically take out certain of the town's inhabitants who are much more than meets the eye (no, they are not transformers). He fires of a firework, the distress call used by the actual Axe Gang, and the gang actually shows up. A huge kung fu battle ensues. Much of the rest of the film amounts to an escalating feud between the Axe Gang and the town. The kung fu becomes more awesome and unbelievable as the film progresses to a final climax which clearly took a few ideas from Neo's final battle with the Mr. Smiths in The Matrix. In other words, there is Kung Fu aplenty. The artistic ability, cinematography and special effects in the martial arts battles is very artistic and at times it is difficult to find the line between comedic excess, beauty and badassitry. That, in essence, is the most wonderful quality of this film. But there is a story here and it is quite nostalgic and beautiful as well. We see Sing quivering between the two sides, the kind-hearted town's people, and the dreaded axe gang's members, until finally he chooses good over evil. Perhaps the most beautiful moment in the film involves Sing executing a particular kung-fu move that has him flying quite high into the air. I will not spoil it for you, suffice to say that it is one of the most awesome scenes I have ever witnessed in Cinema, blending together the aforementioned qualities of comedy, badassitry, beauty and emotion and tying together the entire story quite well. It is the final kung fu scene in the film, and following that, the film wraps everything up quite nicely in a heart-felt manner and then seemingly ends where it begins. But alas, the film is not for everyone. Some may not appreciate the story, and find the whole affair silly and over-the-top. But I am not one of those people. The first time I watched this film, I immediately started it over and watched it again. It has immense replay value for me and each time you watch it you seem to catch something new, whether it be a new joke, a new thought, or a new image of beauty and artistry, this film just keeps calling me back again and again.
B000093FLA|2.0|I know this has been said before but far too many scenes in this film were stolen from Pulp Fiction, Trainspotting, Go, and the Italian Job.  Remember the scene where the three guys try to rob the gangster in the bar and he remains calm and scares them away?  Yeah, I liked that one better when Samuel Jackson was sitting in the diner while John Travolta was in the bathroom.  Remember the part when the two guys were sitting in the car getting philisophical before committing a crime?  Yeah, that was also better when Travolta and Jackson talked about the Royale w/ cheese.  They even had the plot centering around a boxer for god's sake?  Hello....Bruce Willis was a boxer wasn't he?  Spare me people, these five star reviews are funnier than the picture.      The only reason to give this two stars is because while watching it I was reminded of happier times watching better movies.  Yay Brad Pitt in another fight movie.  Maybe later he'll make one with a fighting club or something similar.  Hey I'm onto something there.........
B000HL0EEE|5.0|[...]Where in blazes is season four? Earth just been taken over by ugly aliens in Nazi uniforms after they destroyed the Xindi weapon (I'm serious) and you have the gall to leave us on a cliff hanger like this. SLEEBA!!!  (calms down)  I love Enterprise. Its the best series out of all of them bar none. This is the last Star Trek series I've seen (I've seen the Orginal first btw)It was at first the one I was most predjudice against, but I watched a few more episodes, and boom, I'm converted. Now, if you don't mind, I DEMAND you but of season four REAL soon. What do you want? What can I do short of giving you one million bricks of gold pressed latimum (If I can find any) kissing your feet and hell, I probably walk through New York wearing nothing but a thong to get it, and because I really dont want to sacrifice my dignity, I beg to you, just get season four on, please!    Do I sound crazy? I just got finished watching Zero Hour, and found there was a big, big cliff hanger. Not to mention I'm as crazy as Klinger for Enterprise.  Thank you for listening to my sensless (yet perfectly accurate) rambling. Now excuse me, I got to go meditate before I become something close to a very angered Xindi Reptillian.
0790749858|4.0|The movie was great and we received it in a timely manner.    Thanks

0691126658|5.0|This book includes all the birds; the birds that also live in California, the amazing colorful birds, the little brown birds.  It is a nicely illustrated, organized field guide.      It has the information that one expects from a field guide; maps with the geographic distribution, habitat description, call description, brief information on behavior.     If you consider the cost of a trip to East Africa, the cost of a good bird book is insignificant.
B000P12LWY|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this show. JRM is gorgeous and oh so perfect for this role! I know there are about a million horrible reviews on this series, but most of them are from history buffs, not folks who simply like to be swept away by beatiful people, lush cinemetography, breathtaking clothes, steamy sex and chilling drama. A must-see for those who don't mind so much about the historical inconsistencies.
B000066C1N|5.0|For me.......this is one of those music CDs one could listen to over and over again.  Most often music CDs might have a few favorite songs and the rest being so so.  This one I love from start to finish and over again.
0061537934|5.0|I came across this book in my library's new book section.  I have never finished a book in less than a day's time..... much less read 321 pages...... but yesterday I did.  The story is told through the main character: a dog named Enzo.  He had me at \\"hello\\" (or woof!)....... it's impossible to walk away from him after the first page.      The physical setting is in Seattle, Washington but the real setting is in Enzo's mind and heart.  He attaches himself to the reader immediately and you find yourself needing to see him through to the end of his life and the life of his human family.    Seeing things through his eyes was enlightening.....especially his plea to humans to be more like a dog when someone's telling you a story -- listen and don't say anything...... don't interrupt.  I even found myself struggling along with him through what he views as the biggest limitations of his \\"dogness\\"..... namely: his too-big tongue that doesn't allow him to form words for communicating his thoughts and feelings and his lack of opposable thumbs, which prevents him from grabbing someone by the collar at times to shake some reality into the person.    I'm not a racing fan but some of the analogies that Enzo makes between racing well and living life well are \\"spot on\\"!  The story isn't all about racing......... it's all about life....... with racing thrown in here and there, to \\"drive\\" a point home (pun intended).    It's about love, family, devotion and staying the course to the end and being willing to fight for what you believe is right.     You will fall in love with Enzo!  I know I did................
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Cannot recommend this series enough to the history fan.  Really didn't want it to end.
0743297334|5.0|Perhaps it is some measure of how far American culture has fallen that a novel like the Sun Also Rises, depicting as it does people who are essentially lost and appear set to remain so for the rest of their distressing lives, appears paradisiacal.  Who wouldn't enjoy a European vacation like Jake Barnes'?  Especially those sections where he is alone in San Sabastian swimming, eating and drinking or fishing with Bill on the Irati River.  Even Jake's life as a newspaperman in Paris, filled with long, lingering lunches, and visits by eccentric characters and hard-noised newspapermen with snappy, peppy comebacks, creates a picture that is far from alienating.  This is, in some ways, part of the appeal of The Sun Also Rises.  The nostalgia is contagious. Throughout the novel many of the characters have nostalgia for the First World War, a war which damaged them all physically, psychologically, or both.  Compared to the muddle of civilian life in the 1920s, the simplicity of war's exigencies created a mix of nostalgia and forgetfulness.  The same holds for us, the readers of The Sun Also Rises, the heirs to its vision of disillusionment.  Our losses and extractions are so dramatic, our culture so debased, that The Sun's bleak landscape of loss is appealing, poetic, romantic.
B000K7UG20|5.0|There is nothing better than seeing Michael Douglas in trouble! That always makes for a good movie, but kidding aside great story and good acting on behalf of all the actors.
0312427999|5.0|The late Milton Friedman, the renowned economist, believed that democracy and a free-market economy went hand-in-hand, that the greatest threat to both was nationalization, government regulation, and social spending. He preached this philosophy to his disciples at the University of Chicago School of Economics, and they would go forth spreading the Gospel according to the Book of Milton.<br /><br />There is also the International Monetary Fund, an agency founded after World War II to help struggling countries and their economies get back on their feet. Many of its managers and policy makers will be graduates of the Chicago School of Economics, and they will begin to impose the Friedman creed wherever possible.<br /><br />There is only one thing wrong. No population seems to vote in the people who support their brand of economics. Its first success is when a socialist, democratically elected President of Chile, Salvador Allende, is overthrown and killed when the presidential palace is stormed by fascists. Augusto Pinochet comes into power and immediately places the \\"Chicago boys\\" in charge of the economy. With the death of price controls and lunch programs, Chileans find themselves spending one quarter of their monthly salaries just to buy bread. They will leave hours earlier for work than usual because they can no longer afford public transportation. Even Chile's social security program, once a model of efficiency is privatized, becoming virtually worthless overnight. Chilean children begin fainting in school from lack of food or milk and many stop attending altogether.<br /><br />The story of Chile will be repeated in Argentina, Bolivia, China, Peru, Poland, South Africa, Sri Lanka, and Russia where the IMF will demand that borrowers meet Draconian conditions before they lend money. In each case these austerity measures will be made overnight, all at once. A shocked population will come to their senses if such radical changes are made over time. They will be able to organize, mobilize and challenge the implementation of such policies. It has to come all at once, right after elections, a coup, or a hurricane when the population will be too dazed and disorganized to respond. This will be the shock, or as author Naomi Klein calls it, shock doctrine. For those who are still lucid, there is the next step in the shock doctrine, terrorize, torture, or make them disappear.<br /><br />In each case, in each country, prices on food and other common items will go through the roof, the number of destitute will increase exponentially, and democracy will be squashed. In China, the communist elite will impose these changes on the masses while ensuring that they will profit handsomely from the economic and social upheaval. President Clinton will cheer the economic shock doctrine instituted by Boris Yeltsin as he dissolves the Court and the Parliament, bringing the Russian army out to attack the latter, which killed more than 300 people and several deputies. A new class of super mega apparatchiks will emerge increasing the divide between the \\"have mores\\" and the \\"have nothings,\\" and Russians will put up with a few KGB murders and disappearances for the promise of stability that Vladimir Putin will provide.<br /><br />The Polish people, fed up with the broken promises of Solidarity who succumbed to IMF demands to relieve them of their crushing debt, will be thrown out of office in 1996 elections. Nelson Mandela will focus so much on achieving political control of South Africa he will neglect the real political power of controlling the economic engines that run the nation. He soon discovers that without economic power, he has no political muscle. He becomes a slave of economic apartheid. Shanty towns will get larger and people will become poorer. The population is disillusioned with their new-found \\"equality.\\" The tsunami in Sri Lanka will allow the hoteliers to make a deal with the government, and place security guards around the beaches of whatonce belonged to villagers who fished from there for hundreds of years. After all, what right did they have to be there? Besides, the smell of fish made their guests complain. They will be driven inland where they will be given boats and houses, just no access to water to fish.<br /><br />But that could never be allowed to happen here, or could it? One of the first things President George W. Bush does after he finally realizes what happened in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina is remove union wage scale that contractors would have to pay to laborers. (After all, it is the corporations that must benefit the most from disaster capitalism, not the people of New Orleans). The shock has begun as developers are already seeing how they can take over the utterly destroyed neighborhoods of the poor and turn them into luxury condos and hotels. Charter schools are replacing the public schools and teachers. Contractors will wake up illegal laborers in the night to tell them that the Immigration officers are coming to arrest them. They will run away without having been paid. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, once a functional, effective, national emergency response unit, has had so much work farmed out to contractors, it cannot mount an effective response to the disaster. They will pay top dollar for roofing that can be done at a fraction of the cost. They will supply trailers for homeless that are made of material unsafe to breathe, and people will die in a stadium because no one can take care of them.<br /><br />In Iraq, the local population rose up after our invasion and began to elect their own leaders and councils. They announced plans to take over city governments, services and industry. When Iraqis were asked what they wanted more of when  surveyed, they clamored for more government jobs. But L. Paul Bremer wasn't about to allow democracy to get in the way of disaster capitalism. He ordered the military to disband all local democratic initiatives, which he replaced with a council not chosen by the Iraqi people, but by him.<br /><br />George Bush talks democracy (in Iraq), but walks capitalism by performing a Marshal Plan in reverse. The original plan implemented right after World War II called for keeping foreign investors out of Germany. Our government wanted the Germans to be able to build up their own industry and wealth. Not so in Iraq. Unemployed and starving Iraqis watched how American contractors brought in cheap Asian labor to rebuild their country. Iraqi unemployment remains at approximately sixty percent. American oil companies and American banks make long-term contracts with the new Iraqi government, and the IMF wants Iraq to sell off its own oil industry to foreigners. The second largest military commitment in Iraq, after the Americans, will be mercenaries.<br /><br />Does anyone wonder why there is an insurgency? \\"No 'capitalization' without representation!\\"<br /><br />The author makes it clear. In every country that holds free elections, no one votes for the shock doctrine of disaster capitalism. No one will vote away social programs, controls, or selling off their industries and companies to foreign investors. Klein's conclusion?

George Bush talks democracy (in Iraq), but walks capitalism by performing a Marshal Plan in reverse. The original plan implemented right after World War II called for keeping foreign investors out of Germany. Our government wanted the Germans to be able to build up their own industry and wealth. Not so in Iraq. Unemployed and starving Iraqis watched how American contractors brought in cheap Asian labor to rebuild their country. Iraqi unemployment remains at approximately sixty percent. American oil companies and American banks make long-term contracts with the new Iraqi government, and the IMF wants Iraq to sell off its own oil industry to foreigners. The second largest military commitment in Iraq, after the Americans, will be mercenaries.    Does anyone wonder why there is an insurgency? \\"No 'capitalization' without representation!\\"    The author makes it clear. In every country that holds free elections, no one votes for the shock doctrine of disaster capitalism. No one will vote away social programs, controls, or selling off their industries and companies to foreign investors. Klein's conclusion? Capitalism and democracy are not inherently compatible as Friedman always believed. It was just the opposite.    This book is powerful and moving.

B00008PW3Q|4.0|Simply love this album and I am a huge fan of the Mac going back to the pre-Rumours era. Stevie and Lindsay's songs sparkle, this is NOT a going through the motions venture whatsover. You can tell that gallons of time and effort were poured into \\"Say You Will\\". Both Stevie and Lindsay brought top tier songs to the table on this one, nary a dud. When Mick and John add their efforts to the mix the results are amazing. Lots of muscle that you havn't really heard going back to Tango. Its too bad but on thier last 2 Studio efforts before this, these guys get buried in a haze of crappy production. These albums may have been saved with more of an emphasis on one of the Mac's obvious strengths, the rhythym section.    Its a very Poppy album, I won't say the songs have the depth and breadth of a Rumours or Tusk but again , they are finely writen and played.     Miranda, Say You Will, Red Rover, Whats the World Coming to, Bleed to Love Her and Peacekeeper are all pop gems, well writen, hooky and played with authority by the boys. Lots of magic still kicking around here.    Forget the term \\"comeback album\\", its unfair to refer to it as that, its just a good album. I'm not giving it a 5 although it is one of my favorites.    I hope there are more to come like this, bring in Christine and try for the 5. I could see that happening at some point in the near future. This is an album that has its place in the Fleetwood Mac legacy and I think its something they can be very proud of.    ML

It also discusses the optimal teacher-student relationship in the context of problem-solving.
B00005JPLW|2.0|There is no point discussing this film in terms of history or historical accuracy, since there is no attempt made, or intended to make this film have anything to do with reality (and if I go down that road in this review I would have to write a book!).  That is obviously not the remit of this film! In fact, the characters of this film really don't have to be Greek, or Persian, but could be Elves and Orcs, or any other mythical creatures you might care to summon up for that matter.  Call 'em all 'wombats' if that makes it politically/historically correct for you! Nor is there any great 'message' involved, any more than there is some intended message in a round of 'Grand Theft Auto,' or any of the other more sophisticated video games.  Not much of a plotline either, except as a simple vehicle to get the characters to fight in a well-defined space (also suitable for video games!).    So, with all that put to one side, really, all there is left is to discuss the film on its technical merits as an essentially animated film, and as an animated film, there is not much point in examining the 'acting' either, since acting really requires a live subject on film, and anything else is just 'voice overs.'  The animation technique used in this film reminds me of 'Lord of the Rings' as done by Ralph Bakshi many years ago, and although obviously upgraded through technology (CGI), the effect is still a bit unsettling, as 'live action' film and animation (CGI, in this case) still don't blend together well, though they can work well side by side.    In sum, I view this film as an interesting technological experiment in working with computers, possibly with good applications in future video games, and/or adjuncts to future films.  And as such, it's a pretty good cartoon (I particularly liked the 3-D ending credits).  As a film, with a believable plot, believable dialog, interesting character development, etc, etc, it's pretty much a bust!

B0017R5UAA|3.0|of My Morning Jacket in any of these reviews. That's surprising. And yes, I am starting my review from that angle since the singer is tone for tone a very well formed copy of Jim James. I'm not knocking the singing because of it, but the \\"originality\\" tag I keep hearing about this band loses its shine because of the similarity. That and the abundant use of reverb, which is a staple of the MMJ sound.    Yes, this is more folk than country and that is where the MMJ comparison ends. The songs bring me back to growing up in the Appalachian foothills, which is refreshing to hear from a band stationed in the Pacific northwest. The songs are fairly masterful in creating a wonderfully haunting tone, but I believe I've heard this before . . . on an album called \\"At Dawn.\\" It appears I can't get away from the MMJ comparison and while that may be a flaw in me personally, I still enjoy this album in spite of it, though I'm not inclined to sit my friends down to hear it. Well, except for \\"White Winter Hymnal\\" which haunts my dreams.    I really feel it is unfair to not mention MMJ when talking about this album. Perhaps in the future Fleet Foxes can further differentiate themselves from MMJ, but on this album, I hear little more than a folk homage to My Morning Jacket. I'm sorry to harp on the subject, but I can't distance myself from it.
B0013J9KOO|4.0|It is good to see Mike Mignola's Dark Horse Comics working-class (SUPER) hero character return...along with most of the cast and original director Guillermo del Toro (now a bankable guy, thanks to PAN'S Labyrinth). Hellboy himself, again played by RON PERLMAN (TV's Vincent of \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" from back in the day), who has been under latex pretty much is entire career, infact, Hellboy maybe the closer to revealing his actual face than many of his other roles. But thankfully he returns to his greatest achievement to date...the gruff, working man archetype stogie and all. Of course he is nearly invulnerable, although that invulnerability is tested in the Golden Army as he faces plenty of Fairy folk, the supernatural and monsters for the Bureau of Paranormal Reserch and Defense (the bridge between the MIB and the Ghostbusters). RED is still a cat-lover and feeling under appreciated, ready to break into the public arena to receive to much deserved thanks for \\"savin' the world\\" on a daily basis. Selma Blair returns as Liz, the girlfriend who happens to be a \\"firestarter\\" aka pyrokinetic. Doug Jones returns as Abe Sapien's faceman empathic body (sounds like he is again voiced by David Hyde Pierce who refused on screen credit last time out of respect for Jones' impressive physical portrayal...so I think this is the case this time...) Abe is the smarts in the team and this time gets a love interest in Princess Nuala, which opens for so great scenes with RED giving advice while the pair get drunk and sing Manilow.

0060775858|5.0|I started reading Goodnight Moon to my son at 4 months of age and it became his favorite bedtime story.  When he reached about 9 months I started pointing out objects to him and naming them for him, like the cat, moon, fireplace, red balloon etc.  Before long he'd point them out to me as I read.  He's nearly 2 and he still enjoys this book, although he gets to choose each night and he often now chooses another book.  I know he still likes it though, and he still will point out things to me.  I think this is a great book to get someone as a gift or just to add to your baby/toddlers library.

We own The Mixed-up Chameleon book, but my son isn't as into that one, maybe it's for kids who are a bit older, as my son isn't quite 2.  However, this book seems to be perfect for him, he loves to put his fingers in the holes the catapiller ate into everything.  So, I'd say this might be the best Eric Carle book for the young toddlers, esp. since it's not a long story.

0060723513|4.0|An excellent read.  Engaging story, compelling message.  Did I feel a little deceived after a Google search turned up the controversy?  Yes, so I dropped my rating from 5 stars to 4.  But the reviewers giving this book a \\"1\\" rating appear to have an axe to grind.  Maybe they need to re-read this book, recognizing that's it's fiction, and keep an open mind to the timeless messages contained in this book.      Morgan's fuzzy intro leaves the reader unsure whether the story is based on the author's actual experience, or whether it's a novel. Sort of like H.G. Well's War of the Worlds.  Smart way to get her message out IMHO, in that controversy increases the number of people that will read her message, and it's definitely a message worth reading.    Morgan weaves many new age themes into a story that paints an unbelievably beautiful picture of an Aborigine tribe, leaving the reader contemplating our modern society's pitfalls, excesses, and abuse of planet Earth.  Contrasting \\"civilized man's\\" ignorance is the Real People's tribe higher order view of our relationship to the universe, the creator, and to each other.  The book provides thought provoking spiritual lessons, an increased respect for nature and awareness of mankind's abuse of it, and a plea to be thankful for the little things in life that we all take for granted.  Very entertaining and impactful.  Read it and judge for yourself, but keep an open mind to the message.

B0017U7PT6|1.0|So glad I didn't waste money to see this in the theater. I am upset I bought the BR version thinking it would be ok to watch.<br /><br />The story was all over the place and there were many flaws to be had. I am not talking about flaws in history.  None of us were alive then, so nobody knows what it was like anyway. A few of the special effects were done horribly.  The sabertooth was obviously fake. The golden pyramid tip falling down looked very fake.<br /><br />Another flaw in the story was the giant birds. The one guy gets attacked and even injured, but when whats his name returns, the guy is still alive.  So everyone is dead and eaten except for him.  So what? His bird got full and gave up?<br /><br />Did anyone notice how well groomed these \\"cave men\\" were.  If you pay very good attention, did anyone notice that the women had shaved legs and arm-pits?  Wow, didn't ever think they would shave those things way back when.  I so hate when the film makers do not pay attention to detail.<br /><br />I don't know. We watch a lot of movies and usually find the good in even the bad ones. This one has nothing good. We were never so bored in our lives waiting for something to happen. We got the blu-ray version and it really doesn't look all that good compared to other movies.<br /><br />What a shame. What a good story idea that was made so badly.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This series is WONDERFUL!  We watched the entire series, then watched all of the extra material as well.  The attention to detail is extaordinary for the 1700's period.

She was fortunate to be able to spend a year jaunting around the world. Did she see the poverty in India? Her final awareness of God and the universe was accurate, but she wrote too much about it. She is an entertaining writer, though, and she was reinventing herself after a failed relationship. It was a relaxing, enjoyable read, but very few of us will ever have the luxury of this kind of year.
B000AADYYO|4.0|I think what this band is trying to do is bridge the gap between progressive rock, and death metal on this album. At times it sounds like prog rock, at other times death metal.    A fan of prog rock and death metal would probably like this. However if only one of those is your preferred genre, you'll probably hate it.    I myself think they show a lot of talent as musicians, but they aren't legendary. If you want a legendary guitarist, listen to Dream Theater or Symphony X for your prog rockers. For you death metal people, I'd suggest some Deicide.

B000025JJ4|5.0|Deep Purple fans have got to be the most spoiled in the world. For some odd reason, many have badmouthed this album, and yet, from all the reviews (including Amazon), at least half of the songs are loved. Not one, but half a dozen! The title track, Anya, Ramshackle Man, A Twist In The Tale, Nasty Piece Of Work and Solitaire. Also, my favorite, Time To Kill. With so many winners on one album, it really has to be pretty good. Even the \\"filler\\" such as \\"Talk About Love\\" and \\"One Man's Meat\\" are well above average.<br /><br />The sound quality is solid, a mix between Perfect Strangers and Slaves & Masters; with good musicianship all around. As it turned out, this became the final album of the \\"classic\\" mkII lineup, and so that's reason enough to get this album. A solid entry into the amazing Deep Purple catalogue, and still sounding good after ten plus years.<br /><br />4 1/2 stars. A must, for any Deep Purple fan.

0307386171|1.0|A mediocre attempt by an otherwise great author.    I read this novel during a three hour layover in the Atlanta airport, and I can't help but feel McEwan didn't spend any more time than that writing it. I'm astonished I made it through the whole thing, and if my flight hadn't been delayed I probably would've given up on it and opted instead for the AirTran manual in the seat pocket--it probably would've been more riveting.     Not to mention, there was a HUGE contradiction in the narrative that made the plot absolutely moot and aggravated me so much I complained for a good 15 minutes to the person sitting next to me in the terminal. It just felt sloppy and also lacked any conclusion whatsoever for the female lead character.

1401216676|5.0|[[VIDEOID:22577631]]\\"The Killing Joke\\" is widely considered to be the be-all-end-all of Joker stories, so what better way to pay homage to the greatest comic book villain of all time near the eve of his re-unveiling in [[ASIN:B00005JPY0 The Dark Knight]] than by reviewing his definitive story?  This is the comic that (sort of) revealed the origin of The Clown Prince of Crime, humanizing him to an extent never before, and truly examined -with pictures rather than words- the antagonistic symbiosis that exists between Joker and his arch nemesis, The Batman.  A beloved Gotham regular will never be the same and another will be put through hell before this story is done.  Oh, and there are creepy little henchmidgets as well.  Gotta love the henchmidgets.<br /><br />The art is outstanding, the storytelling superb, and the character examinations are vital to understanding both combatants.  The \\"one bad day\\" premise highlights the \\"two sides of the same coin\\" argument that Batman and Joker are in fact more alike than dissimilar.  As if Bruce Wayne took a right when his arch-nemesis took a left.  The controversial ending leaves little doubt as to Alan Moore's take on the debate, and I like it like that.  While many critics have strongly resisted both the comparison and the somewhat sympathetic look at The Joker's past, the truth is that every great character -villain or hero- needs that sort of intricacy to their story to remain relevant in the world of modern fiction.  Comics are no longer for children and adults realize that the world is seldom black and white, that all monsters were once men, and that unspeakable darkness and insanity resides deep inside each human mind.  It can take years of suffering to bring them out or it can take one bad day.  One bad day could ruin your very existence and everything you were; it's a frightening reality that cannot be overlooked while reading this comic.  The more the reader is willing to ponder the ideas put forth by this story, the more you are likely to appreciate \\"The Killing Joke\\".  An outstanding achievement in storytelling any way you look at it.<br /><br />I was tempted to knock this down to four stars because with this book you are buying a single issue of a comic for what you could easily pay for a full trade paperback or graphic novel of equal quality like, say, Frank Miller's [[ASIN:1563893428 The Dark Knight Returns]], which is so good it may very well cure cancer (can you prove it doesn't?).  But the fact is no Batman fan should be without \\"The Killing Joke\\" and I would rather stick to reviewing based on quality rather than haggling over price.

It allows you to really build your business so that it can be successful... so that your business fits into your life rather than your life fitting into your business.    The principles offered in the E-Myth are also helpful to existing businesses.  I think so many people start businesses thinking, \\"I know how to do this work.  Instead of working for these guys, I should start my own business...\\"  So many of us have felt that way... restaurant workers, plumbers, engineers, consultants... but doing the work does not make a successful business.  Being the \\"technician\\" without the vision to see where the business is going to take you is deadly.  The E-Myth tackles those problems for you.

Not a lot of action, the villian was dull, and the plot was meandering. Started out great, then went nowhere.    People seem to be dinging it on the politics, but I found that neither suprising nor distracting - in fact, I found the brief statement of Reacher's view of the war to be very much in character.

Get over yourself, get back in the studio, and give your fans what they deserve, Portishead.
B0013J9KOO|5.0|HellBoy II was great and definitely leaves you wanting more. Yeah, there were the special effects and the great fight scenes, but what I loved most about this second installment in a decent series, was the dilemma that HellBoy (AKA Big Red) faces throughout the movie.......Why continue to save a race (the humans) if they are frightened of you? Not uncommon, the tension between oath and duty is blurred when you feel like you are the enemy, and when those who you chose to protect are frightened of you. Although this is typical of most superhero/mankind relationships (for example Superman, Spiderman, Batman, and countless others), what makes this dilemma more visceral is the fact that HellBoy is actually believed to be the eventual destroyer of the world.  What would make a super hero (who it is foretold will be the destroyer of the human race) continue to do a job for virtually nothing (no praise or recognition), especially when the very people who you have sworn to protect, shun you? How in the face of that, do you fight your natural instincts (to destroy mere mortals) and continue to fight those that are in the same situation you are (different, not human)? Hence, the plot of the latest HellBoy movie.     Prince Nuada wants to claim (the world) what is rightfully his, by any means necessary (meaning kill his own father and awaken an indestructible army...known as the Golden Army).  Reconstructing a magical crown, that will give him power over the Golden Army, he sets out to steal some of its parts during an auction at a museum. Releasing several hundred cute but deadly \\"tooth fairies\\" (who love calcium and start by eating human teeth), Prince Nuada is in possession of most of the crown, but needs his twin sister's remaining half. Through a series of events, Princess Nuala comes to stay with Big Red and his family (all misfits with amazing powers) and assists them by keeping the remaining piece from her twin. Abraham, the loving and kind aquatic-man, finds himself falling in love with the fair princess and is willing to do anything to save her, even if it means destroying the world.     Meanwhile, on the domestic front....HellBoy can't imagine why Liz (fire girl) is so angry with him. He can't for the life of him believe that she is mad about his being junky, smoking cigars, adding more cats to his collection or eating candy before dinner. Although Abraham quickly figures it out, HellBoy is at a loss. So with the end of the world looming, and his better half angry with him, Big Red also has to deal with the prophecy that he is going to cause the end of mankind. Even Prince Nuada reminds him of his role in the big scheme of things, and tries to encourage him to turn on the humans! Regardless, it all makes you yearn for future HellBoy movies, to see what the outcome will be.  And there is another scene when it comes down to choosing Red's life, even if it means the end of the world in the future (the creature says......clearly....not today, or tomorrow but eventually it is foretold), Liz makes the ultimate decision and chooses life for Big Red and maybe the end of the World as we know it. She is willing to risk the future of mankind on her love and belief that HellBoy will ULTIMATELY make the right decision and stay with the forces of good.      With special effects and tons of mystical creatures galore, HellBoy II is extremely enjoyable and entertaining. Watch it, and when it becomes available to purchase, do so, I don't think you would regret it.
B00003CXB4|5.0|Great movie, ordering from Amazon was a necessity as the Lion King is not yet released on DVD in Australia.  Arrived quickly, within the allocated time.
B0013J30W2|4.0|First, I had absolutely no expectations of \\"Wanted\\" when I went to see it. Second, I wanted to simply see something FUN and from the previews, \\"Wanted\\" looked like it would have a lot of action and some great special effects. With that in mind, I really enjoyed this mind-numbing, fantasy tale about a bored and beat-down Corporate Accountant turned assassin. It is my opinion that Wesley was an extremely sympathetic character who was able to escape his mundane and boring life (as well as his stress induced episodes) to bring revenge upon the man he believes killed his father.  There were great fight and car chasing scenes that made the movie extremely entertaining, although Matrix-like.     Wesley, who is plagued with a cheating girlfriend, a nagging boss and a trifling bestfriend (who even gets him to buy condoms that he will later use on Wesley's girlfriend) has been recruited to kill the man (Cross) who the Fraternity believes killed his father (their top assassin). Recruited by Fox (played by Angelina Jolie), Wesley sets out to enhance his seemingly natural instincts and abilities (by taking various lessons) and learn all that he can from his fellow assassins (fighting, cutting and maiming), who all take their orders from information \\"woven\\" into fabric and deciphered by Morgan Freeman's character. Although the plot wasn't terribly original, I didn't leave feeling that I had wasted my money or that the movie was the worse that I had ever seen. I was entertained and enjoyed it!
B00006CXSS|5.0|Very happy with the product. The packaging was nicer than the description. And amazon delivered fast. As always, it arrived quickly and well packaged.
0440539811|1.0|No, this doesn't work - far from it, I'm surprised it has even been released. Foremost the plot doesn't make sense, it seems like a cross between \\"X-files\\", \\"Das Boat\\" and \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" on speed and then it doesn't seem to have been beta-red (or even delta- or gamma red) at all.     It might have been a good story if someone had sat down and made an efford in editing it, chunking off dead meat, killing darlings, tying together plots and sorting out unnessesary spin offs and characters.     Now it resembles more a fan fiction party in a High School computer hall than a finished novella...
0786838655|5.0|This book was for my ten year old son, who read it in two days and said it was very good. I have not read it myself.
B0017ZB8M6|5.0|I love her music!  Very original.  My only complaint about the CD is that I didn't realise it was going to be edited when I bought it.  Of course, I think there is only one or two words edited out of the whole CD so its not a big deal.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Like any movie it is not as good as the book but viewing this DVD series after reading the book was like bringing the past back to life.  I highly recommend this product!  I also appreciated viewing the video presention on the Amazon site from the author.
B0017IKR7K|5.0|I absolutely love this cd!  The songs are fun and you get to hear many older country artists that you do not hear on the radio.  I recently saw Brad Paisley in concert and he put on an awesome show!
B00166BL6Y|5.0|this is everything it should have been..  It breaks my heart that Jethro Tull didn't put more effort into their blues roots after this album.
1400079179|1.0|Ok, I have neither bought nor read this 'book', and never will, but I read the excerpt.<br />If English is Dan Brown's first language, then he has major problems, unless he is a 10 year old slow learner. Ok, he has made a lot of money from this piece of rubbish, but why not take a quick course in creative writing beforehand to learn the basics of style.<br />The Hardy Boys books are advanced literature in comparison!
B00005JPS8|3.0|I think the effects and the plot were fairly outlandish, even for this type of movie. Basically, I didn't think this was as good as any of the Spider Man movies. It was predictable in a lot of places too.  I thought Robert Downey Jr. was great in the role, however Gwyneth Paltrow seemed bored and out of place in it.
0316168815|1.0|Wow, I can't believe I read this book based on the hype of not only professional book critics, but also friends. As most of the critical reviews have mentioned, the book starts off great. The grief experienced by the family as described by the author seemed genuine and very well written. And then it goes downhill from there. A mother who leaves her remaining two children because she can't cope with the death of the other? A mother-in-law who moves in in the interim? A sister who starts a sexual relationship with her boyfriend at 14 and has a perfect mature relationship resulting in marriage 10 years later? A friend who barely knew the deceased in life and then is obsessed with her for the rest of her life? A boy who had a passing schoolboy crush on the protagonist at 14 and can't let go of her? And then who has sex with her through another woman's body 10 years later? Should I go on?   I'm sorry I wasted $14 and hours of time on this.
B0013FXWU6|3.0|This movie is about greed and pride and how ugly they can be. Its long and tough to watch in parts. I really don't think I could sit through it all again. The movie starts out well but becomes less entertaining as Daniel Day Lewis character becomes meaner and greedier.
B0014BECF8|5.0|GREAT CD. Has a wide variety of his music and some i had not heard before. He is talented, what can i say?
B000MCH5P4|4.0|No big review here, just that it was interesting and involved 4 separate yet linked events going on around the globe. Brad Pitt more angry than concerned of his wife being shot while Cate Blanchett didn't really get to do much acting, besides laying there. The kids in the village were the key to the movie.
0061537934|5.0|I have never written a review for Amazon.com, but I felt compelled to do so now. As a bicycle racer and dog lover, the title caught my attention while standing in line at Starbucks. I picked it up, and was captivated by the first two pages. Some time passed before I could afford to buy the book. In that time, my niece posted a review of the book on our family website, which made me want to read it even more.     Finally, this past Saturday, I got my chance. I picked up the book, brought it home and started reading it at 2:00. By 10:00 I was finished. I have never laughed, AND cried so much while reading a book. As I posted on our family website: There are a lot of good books, there are a great many very good books. However, there are very few special books. This book is special. I recommend it highly.
B000MZHW40|4.0|Surprisingly good movie. Decaprio played the part well and Jennifer Connelly had a movie she actually had to act in. Obviously the movie was for a political cause - not supporting diamond smugglers because of the atrocities they commit. And thats not a bad thing for Hollywood to do as long as their up front about it like this.
B00140PK6O|5.0|We had planned to watch the Cranford episodes as they unfolded on PBS, but because we had a houseguest, I taped them. When we finished viewing the series, my husband had found them so interesting and engaging that he asked to view them a second time. Consequently, I ordered the DVD and we thoroughly enjoyed watching the \\"Making of Cranford\\".     I first learned of Elizabeth Gaskell while reading Phyllis McGinley's Sixpence in Her Shoe, when I was newly married. Years later while visiting a London bookstore, I found several of the Gaskell novels and added them to my library. I couldn't resist rereading Cranford the week after seeing the final episode.     I liked the blending of three of Gaskell's novels into this telling of the story. My Lady Ludlow and Mr. Harrison's Confessions give the village a larger context and paint a more complete picture of England at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. However, nothing of the charm of the perfect English village is lost in this delightful retelling of the story. Each actor seems to catch his character's virtues and foibles perfectly.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This is the best use of your entertainment money.  It is an amazing, well-written docu-drama about the evolution of our country from English colonies through Jefferson's presidency.  To put words into the mouths of our Founding Fathers and get a strong sense of their personalities - John Adams in particular, of course -- is the best history lesson you can get. And be entertained to boot!!  The acting is superb, the visuals are stunning and the story, well, we all think we know it but it is astounding to \\"see\\" it in a modern way.  Beats a history book in high school any day.  Well worth the money.  Family can watch it together, too!
0142000663|5.0|One of the greatest American novels written. Period. I read it about three years ago and whenever I see this book in stores the feelings and images I had while reading Grapes come flooding back to me.  Read this book! You may, like me, be slightly disappointed with the ending, but you will not be disappointed that you took the time to read Grapes of Wrath.

B00005JPNY|1.0|What in the world are we trying to do here?  Forget all the hype from the religious sect about the story, there is no story.  One's soul exists as an animal that travels with them??  The; to top it all off, there is no ending to the movie.  I guess the production team (New Line) wants to sell the ending as another trip to the theater and more DVD sales.    Not worth the trip to the theater, and no need to desire to own this one.
B0002F7I9Y|4.0|great disc, different style than ray usually churns out.  interesting combos - ray and willie nelson on \\"a very good year\\"; ray and johnny mathis on \\"somewhere over the rainbow\\".  you can tell a good time was had by all making this cd, it shows through the sounds created!
B000002MFE|4.0|This cd is worthy of its reputation, and is the last great recording by Eric Clapton. \\"Malted Milk\\", \\"Walkin' Blues\\", \\"Layla\\", which he was able to successfully alter to fit an acoustic setting, \\"Nobody Know You When You're Down & Out\\", the classic made famous by Bessie Smith and later covered by an aged Scrapper Blackwell, and \\"Tears In Heaven\\", are all exceptionally great tracks. \\"Hey Hey\\" is not one of Broonzy's better songs, so I'm not sure why Clapton chose to record it. \\"Old Love\\" is mediocre, but \\"Running On Faith\\" is wonderfully done. This disc would have been even better if Clapton would have performed the material solo, much like the legendary Bluesmen he so greatly admired used to do, day in and day out. However, he has admitted in interviews that he is not a good enough musician to do what his idols did. For those of you who doubt this, simply look up interviews with Eric Clapton done by Guitar Player magazine. This is also the reason that his tribute record to Robert Johnson was not done alone.
B000001E3V|5.0|with energy pumping from a live concert, clapton burning up his guitar strings, this disc is outstanding!  70's rock, blistering guitar, monster drums, treats for your ears!
B00006878K|5.0|This album and Earl Hooker's \\"The Moon Is Rising\\" are two of the greatest electric Blues albums of all-time. There is not a bad song on this disc. Albert King also displays great versatility; \\"Born Under A Bad Sign\\" sounds nothing like \\"The Very Thought Of You\\", perhaps an odd song choice for Albert, but very well-handled. This is one of the albums that the late Stevie Ray Vaughan most admired. He was heavily influenced by Albert's playing on this record, as were scores of other Blues guitarists and Blues-Rock performers.
B00005UW2B|5.0|This set is a remarkably economic collection of strong performances of the complete Shostakovich symphony oeuvre.      An important note is, however, that, despite some reviews, this set does not include much in the way of liner notes.  I've sold a lot of this set as well as having it in my own collection, and in none of these sets has there been more than a small booklet.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This is a great DVD set.  I recommend it for all you history buffs out there.

Rock Hudson as the U.S. sub commander, Patrick MacGoohan as a mysterious British agent, Ernest Borgnine as a Russian defector and Jim Brown as a hard nosed Marine officer.  Not quite up to the novel from which it was adapted but still, an entertaining window on a past era: the Cold War. Also starring Tony Bill as a young Marine Lt. and Alf Kjellin as a Russian officer.
B0019VTKIM|5.0|A magnificent adventure with powerful actors--men, not boys.  With its sweeping scenery--the sets are made of stone and iron rather than CG--this is movie is an epic which speaks to the deep desires of men and women; honor, pride, courage, and above all, LOVE.  This is a movie worth your time though told in an older cinimatic style.  Be ready to appreciate all it is.

B000TGQDZQ|5.0|From the moment I heard the first track to the title track at the end it was nothing short of perfection! Simone Simons has an exquisite voice and the choir throughout is a great touch. The orchestration of the album is fantastic! It gets you pumped right away and keeps you pumped to the end. Tracks like \\"Menace of Vanity\\",  \\"The Obsessive Devotion\\", and \\"Sancta Terra\\", a song with a great opening,  are exciting tracks mixed with some slower songs such as, \\"Chasing the Dragon\\", which is slow but also picks up pace because it is such a long song, and \\"Safeguard to Paradise\\", which showcases Simone's beautiful voice! I can't name enough songs from this album. Though I have to agree a bit of a down side are the death grunts, but after a few listens you can get past them and you can just fall in love with it because it is a brilliantly put together album!
B00004YRQA|3.0|It worked.  Still working after a few months.  What else can I say about a memory card?
B000URDEB0|5.0|Beginning to like Nightwish after Tarja left made it easier I suppose to me to like this album, but I went back and acquired all of the others as instructed. People told me it would change my opinion, but it didn't! Anette is a fine replacement for Tarja! Her vocal skills are not quite soprano, but they are very reputable and she holds her own! \\"Sahara\\" is a great track and so is \\"The Islander\\", though it takes a bit of getting used to at first. The album is the first step into a new era for Nighwish and with this one as good as it is I can't wait to see where the band will go next!
B0014I4KIK|4.0|Duffy's got a very unique sound--a sweet voice with a tremolo edge, and a good bit of soul for a cute white chick from Wales.  Nearly every track is a winner.  Make sure you go past \\"Mercy\\", which through no fault of its own is suffering from radio overplay.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Okay, so finally it looks like it will be there in a bit more two months! Let's hope the material it's worthy of blu-ray... because all DVD/Divx streams I came across so far were between horrible and average. For all of ous too young to have witnessed these movies on the big screen (or at least the first two), this will certainly be an entertaining experience!     Now, why the hell it's only region A (or 1, whatever you want to call it, US and Canada only)??? Will it take another year for Paramount to issue a Worldwide/Europe version perhaps, and that one will have missing chapters or messed up disc structure?   God, I really hate those guys and I wish I understood what goes on in their tiny brains...
0385340567|2.0|Though I enjoyed the book in general I found the plot a little tired and the transitions from scene to scene anything but fluid.  Reacher's ability to prevail against overwhelming odds is one of his characteristics we all love -  BUT - this time it was ridiculous.

0689835604|3.0|I will say that my daughter did like this book.  It's a \\"peek-a-boo\\" type book.  The problem is that, of course, babies want to open and close the flaps themselves, and these flaps are thin, flimsy and hard for little baby fingers to get a hold of (and avoid ripping or curlling once they do).  Many of our flaps are missing, but the kids still read this book from time to time.    It would be better if it was a little sturdier.
0316143472|1.0|Totally disappointed after reading it.  I struggled to get through it actually.  It was more depressing than entertaining.  Such a let down after being so excited to read another Sedaris novel.
0756404746|5.0|You know how sometimes a book, or a movie, or a concert gets so hyped up in the press and you have such high expectations that when you finally get around to reading/seeing it, it disappoints? That's what I was worried might happen when I decided to read The Name of the Wind. I purposely came to it late, hoping to wait until Patrick Rothfuss was nearly finished with the trilogy before I starting it. But, the book has received so much attention that it became inexcusable for me, as the editor of a fantasy review website, not to read it. So I did -- in two days. (It's a huge book.)<br /><br />And I'm very happy to report that The Name of the Wind did not disappoint -- I was completely enthralled. The pace was quick and never lagged. The plot was tight and had just the right amount of mystery -- I always understood what was going on, but Rothfuss regularly added new elements, twists, and layers to keep me wondering where this was going and what would happen next. In fact, by the end of the book, there are more unanswered questions than answered ones. Throughout, the writing style was smooth and pleasant, with enough wit, humor, foreshadowing, and artistry to be intellectually stimulating, but never pretentious. Furthermore, the magic system in Rothfuss's world is thoroughly explained to us, bit by bit, and it is complicated and makes sense.<br /><br />Perhaps most important, Mr Rothfuss writes excellent characters. I especially appreciated what he did with his hero. Kvothe's circumstances are familiar; he's an exceptionally bright kid whose parents are killed by something evil, nobody cares for him, he manages to get into magic school on long odds, he has trouble fitting in with both students and teachers, he makes two close friends and one rich and handsome enemy from a powerful family, he's obsessed with finding out about the evil people who killed his parents, he regularly gets punished for his exploits at school, he has no clue about girls, and he actually meets one who lives in the pipes under the school .... Hmmm... This does sound familiar.<br /><br />But I'll bet that most people who read The Name of the Wind never thought of Harry Potter, because Kvothe and his world are new and refreshing. Kvothe is a product of his liberal education and a lot of time spent trying to survive on his own as a beggar. Sometimes he is selfish, sometimes he is cruel, sometimes he does the right thing. At one point in the book, while Kvothe was living on the streets, he had an opportunity to help someone in distress (a particular distress that Kvothe himself had experienced). I was nervous -- worried that Rothfuss would ruin his careful characterization by having Kvothe perform a heroic deed too soon. But, no, Kvothe pulled a Kitty Genovese, which gave me a deeper respect for Mr Rothfuss. During Kvothe's maturation, we see him make more right choices and fewer wrong ones, but he is complex and inconsistent enough to make us lack confidence that he's going to turn out okay. And that makes for a very interesting story.<br /><br />I'm very much looking forward to continuing this mystery next April; so much so that I'll pre-order the hardback of The Wise Man's Fear (something I rarely do). Patrick Rothfuss is a much-needed bright young star in the fantasy field. Let's hope that he can keep it up!  --FanLit.nethe pipes under the school .... Hmmm... This does sound familiar.

B0018OAPAW|5.0|When you look at the most successful albums of The Offspring's career to this point, Smash, and Americana stand head and shoulders above the rest. When you look at the enduring quality of their songs, Ignition and Smash have among the best. Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace, may not be the juggernaut that was Smash, I'm sure The Offspring's decline in popularity over the years will see to that.<br /><br />But their newest album is definitely among their very best.<br /><br />The Offspring have shown a return to their roots in violent lyrics and outrage, but they've also shown a maturity that's never been seen before either, at least not to this extent.<br /><br />Hammerhead may be their first single, but already I can tell you it's their worst by far, and that's not a slight against Hammerhead, rather a compliment to the rest of the album. Half-Truism, You're Gonna Go Far Kid, and Kristy Are You Doing Okay?, are three standout songs on this album that will sit along side songs like Genocide, Smash, Kick Him When He's Down, and Gone Away as some of the very best the band has ever written.<br /><br />Kristy, Are You Doing Okay? in particular shows a maturity and retrospective that's really touching. Very different in feel and sound than anything The Offspring has done. After having just listened to Jennifer Lost The War, it really brings out the sadness of this song. The concern and sorrow expressed by Dexter is truly moving. I hope they make this song a single, because it's probably the best song they've ever written.<br /><br />This will be a defining album in The Offspring's career.<br /><br />After having read some of the other reviews I'm wondering if they've ever listening to The Offspring's first album, and heard songs like Jennifer Lost The War, and Beheaded. This is was the first band I ever listened to (them and Green Day, back when there was a battle of the punk bands headlined by these two) and for years they were my favorite band ever. The Offspring after having been releasing albums for 20 years are growing up, they're not just the same band the wrote songs like Bad Habit and Beheaded. These \\"emo\\" songs people are whining about are a show that they don't understand the story of what is really going on in the lives of The Offspring's lives. I applaud the bands maturity, they're not feeling sorry for themselves and whining about how their girlfriend dumped them, they're trying to help those closest to them, that's not \\"emo\\" that's called caring.
B000TGJ80S|5.0|The '92 cinematic release `Dracula' is a dark, exceedingly eerie and surprisingly romantic gothic rendering of the Dracula mythos containing a magnificent performance by Gary Oldman as the infamous Count D.<br /><br />While `Dracula' incorporates all the usual horror elements the horror fan has come to expect from a bona fide horror classic (creepy monster(s), marvelous special effects, lots of blood, etc...,) it raises itself to a higher level supplying its audience with an intelligent, insightful script and conveying a sympathic portrait of the lovelorn vampire.<br /><br />Going a step further into the darkness, I'm deeply impressed by the directors (Francis Coppolas) ability to create a truly demonic atmosphere to the film that seems to ooze from the screen and permeate the viewing area of the audience. Ultimately one can't help but ponder the possibility that such unearthly beings might actually exist.
1401207529|5.0|Many \\"Classic\\" Batman stories don't live up to the hype and Frank Miller's work is not always 100%, but this tale definitely is.<br /><br />I don't see it as a re-telling of the Batman origin as it is often touted to be, since the story mostly focuses on Jim Gordon and his introduction into the world of the GCPD.  Batman is only seen in brief glimpses.<br /><br />Miller's often extreme tendencies are toned down a bit in this book, although it still has plenty fo rough edges and he does a good job of non-chalantly mixing in recognizable characters with new plot points.<br /><br />Definitely worth a read, it's just too bad it seems so short.  Although the sign of a good book is when it leaves you wanting more, so I guess that means they did their job!
B000RPTQ1C|3.0|...so my ratin is 4 of 10 or via this star rating it has to be 2 of 5 stars 2.5 so 3. coldplate hasnt changed their sound style & u have to wonder by past know if they ever can or will. i do like that they're old softsmooth rock like late 60's vs when most style of 60's was different from this. i find more girls like coleplay. theyre such coldplates-ha, ha, whatever. im more of a musicjam listener than lyrics unfortunately but w/ a lil effort... . again, sample previews only let me hear/like 4  of these 10 jamz, 30 secs ea. on this lp so i would only pay 1$ per good song, never changing the price of price per song higher. it may be a better lp hearin all but im not willin to pay again apx 10.5 for the lp to find out at this pt. COLD PLATE-theyre so cheezy but thats just bein mean but not as mean as cliques clash w. the simply oppressed suttle-peaceful clash, OH, ohhhhhh-ted j. l.---an aside.
B0017I1FP8|5.0|The best word to use to describe the score to The Dark Knight is EPIC.  Having loved the score to Batman Begins by Howard and Zimmer I was really looking forward to this collaboration.  Listening to this dark, brooding score it's clear that we've moved on from the introduction to Batman with slower, nicer themes overall and are presented with a negative aspect in the film and the music within.  The best tracks are the Joker's theme \\"Why So Serious\\" and \\"Like a Dog Chasing Cars\\".  The Joker's theme is warped, misaligned, off with a rough edge that you don't expect.  This could be used to describe the acting by Heath Ledger and I feel that the composers really got 'it'.  'Like a Dog' is set for the action part(s) of the film and it works well.<br /><br />From the Batman Begins soundtrack there were a couple of themes that I absolutely loved and while I still give this work 5 stars, I feel that the Begins soundtrack might be a bit better.  Maybe it's because when you have a sequel there are recycled themes that while you might enjoy/love, the fact they are not new makes it not as fresh.<br /><br />Having said all that, this is a great score to the EPIC movie that accompanies it.  Easy to recommend, perfect for enjoying years to come, if you enjoy movie scores, Zimmer/Howard work or the Nolan Batman films, you will be happily satisfied with this effort.<br /><br />***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B000OY8NII|4.0|Eureka is a town shielded from the world by a force field, keeping unwanted visitors out.  What a wonderful concept.  To be sealed away so you can work in peace.  This simple premise doesn't even scratch the creativity of this new series.  Eureka gives us a glimpse of the inventions of the future, but if it tells us so much more.<br /><br />The story revolves around the Sheriff and his family.  The sheriff is one of the few people in Eureka without a genius IQ. The Sheriff is also the only one who can solve the interesting problems that plague this scientific community.<br /><br />I find this an interesting concept.  I can see where focusing on only part of a problem makes it impossible to solve.  However, I think this series is going one step further.  I think it is a gracious way to say that our problems will be easier solved with the common man than by the inventions and brilliance of the Einsteins of the world.
B0013J9KOO|5.0|So I just saw this today in the theater. Having seen the first one but not remembering a damn thing from it, I was expecting to feel confused as all hell. But once the movie started, I was already sitting back, relaxing, and enjoying it.<br /><br />Hellboy II: The Golden Army is one of the few comic-book based sequels that I call better than the first! It has a great script, great plot, great acting, and even more so, a great conclusion that will leave you feeling good about yourself.<br /><br />The movie's plot: Red AKA Hellboy is back, and better than ever! This time, a prince from the mythical world named Prince Nuada has recieved a crown that will give him power to reign over the mythical world to wake up The Golden Army. But the thing is, he has already taken his toll on the real world, and sends a bunch of creatures that only Hellboy, Abe Sapien (my favorite character), and Liz can defeat! The only thing holding them back is the Austrian bugger named Johann Krauss, a steam generator that not only leads them, but pisses them off too.<br /><br />Hellboy II: The Golden Army is an amazing movie put forth by a stellar cast. It has everything required to be a great movie: Comedy, tragedy, action, great acting, plus one of the greatest battle sequences ever put on film. I laughed, cried, and was totally blown away.<br /><br />Hellboy II was directed by Guillermo Del Toro, the guy who directed the first one as well as the amazing \\"Blade II\\", \\"The Devil's Backbone\\" and \\"El Laberinto Del Fauno\\" (A.K.A Pan's Labyrinth). This is his greatest Achievement since Pan's Labyrinth, so this is totally recommended to those wanting a great sci-fi/fantasy flick, as well as as Hellboy fans around the world. Bring on Hellboy III!
0743290119|2.0|I was very disappointed with this book. My review will probably echo what a lot other reviewers have said, but here it is anyway -    I found this book to be incredibly shallow and severely lacking in plot. In fact, I just finished it last night and already I can barely remember the main plot points. I did laugh in a few spots and very occasionally found that I was able to identify with a particular character or situation.    One of my biggest peeves about this book was Emmy's resolution. I literally cringed every time I read the phrase \\"Tour de Whore\\" and references to Emmy wanting to \\"prostitute myself out.\\" Am I the only one who was bothered by this? If you want to write a book about a women's journey to sexual freedom or whatever, then great, I'm all for it. But does she have to refer to herself as a prostitute and whore throughout it? Also, it was clear throughout her \\"affairs\\" that she was not comfortable with what she was doing. Apparently it's not okay for a woman to want to know someone on a deeper level before sleeping with them...    Another big problem that I had with this book was the fact that the characters were entirely unoriginal. Samantha, Miranda and Charlotte, anyone?     I also felt like there was a serious lack of organization and flow. There were also characters who appeared to be important and then pretty much disappeared (the hairdresser, Emmy's sister and her family,) situations that never got resolved or explained. The narrative was often confusing and jumped from present to flashback to internal monologue and back again with little to no transition.    The ending was ridiculous and boring at the same time. I also don't really understand the title, it really doesn't fit the story. As soon as I finished reading this book, I wondered, \\"WHAT was the point of that?\\" As I said earlier, I finished it less than 12 hours ago and I've already forgotten what it was supposed to be about. Don't waste your money on this one - if you must, get it from the library.
006088732X|5.0|Remember the first season of \\"Desperate Housewives\\"?  This first installment is better than that! The first book of this highly addictive series starts with former BFFs Spencer, Aria, Hanna and Emily receiving disturbing e-mails and texts from someone called \\"A\\".  \\"A\\" seems to know there deepest, darkest secrets from their past and their present.  Could \\"A\\" be Allison, their former Queen Bee and frenemy who mysterious disappeared  a few years ago without a trace?  Unexpected twists, turns and the girls' bond over an incident dubbed \\"The Jenna Thing\\" force them back together to solve the mystery of the person behind the mysterious texts while trying to keep \\"A\\" from exposing their damaging secrets.  The subject matter (eating disorders, underage drinking, underage sex , homosexuality, shoplifting and cyberbullying), which seems to be the norm for most young adult series these days may seem off putting to sheltered teens and adults.  Alternately, the mature subject matter can also provide opportunities for discussion, awareness and how peers and parental pressure contributes to these issues.
B000QQH4YS|5.0|So, does this release come in a steelbook. I heard from some people saying that they got a regular package. Can anyone clarify?
B00009W0WM|5.0|Simply can't go wrong with this movie. It is considered a classic and for good reason.  Well staged, great music, intrigue, and plot twist.  Of course first rate acting from the entire cast.  This one has it all.  Added features of this version are well worth any extra price.  The video quality is high as well.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|The epic discovered in retrospect.  Not until many years after its theatrical release did 'Once Upon A Time In The West' become a \\"succes d'estime\\".  In fact it failed horribly in 1969.  The french and germans loved it under its name 'Play Me The Song Of Death'.  But its birthland Italy and the US found it to be too slow and too long (originally 161 minutes).  ....Filmed in Almeria and the USA it was Leone's homage to the art of the western cowboy genre.  He included visual and verbal quotes from his favorite westerns, including High Noon, the Searchers and Shane.  He honored John Ford by filming scenes in the iconic Monument Valley (reminicent of many a John Wayne movie).  This was Leone's last real Western thus with it a parting and tribute.  ....... . . .Seven years after 'The Good The Bad and The Ugly' Sergio became more realistic in his approach.  Leone, Corbucci ,Barboni, Petroni Spaghetti westerns followed fanciful plots with fauvist characters.  Then Leone got serious, real serious in this authentic view of the west.  And with this movie surpassed the westerns of Ford, Boettcher and Mann.  Indeed he did paramount well in his hybrid hard hollywood/spaghetti western.  ..... . . . Leone's cinematic geometry is poetic.  Circularity and panoramic movement add titanic dimension to both the grandeur of the landscape and depth of character interaction..  ....... . . .The magic in this classic also lies in its risky casting.  Gone are the angular italian machismos.  The very jewish Jason Robarts as the noble bandit Cheyenne?  The very poilish Charles Bronson (Buchinski) as our harmonica playing cowboy?  And Henry Fonda (our socially just hero in dozens of classics) as an amoral childkilling villan?  The casting bet payed off!  The contrasts are perfect.  The interchanges mythic.  Each character carrying their personal sountrack.  Unique.  ...... . . . . I must diagree with the tongue in cheek amazon profile.  This is one serious western.  . . . .  The last 20 minutes are the absolute best western drama on film.  Harmonica's vengeance turns out to be a back-handed heroic act.  Saving Jill and McBain's land. . .  In truth there are no heros here.  Just men -- \\"an ancient race\\".st 20 minutes are the absolute best western drama on film.  Harmonica's vengeance turns out to be a back-handed heroic act.

B000092ZYX|5.0|I don't know where this album ranks in terms of the band's entire catalog, but I absolutely love it. I've loved it from day one (yes, I bought it on the day it came out). I didn't feel compelled to write a review on Hail To The Thief until I started reading magazine articles about In Rainbows. I agree that In Rainbows is a masterpiece in its own right, but Thief is a great album as well. It infuriates me that even the band is starting to second guess the genius of this album. In all the interviews I've read the band basically apologizes for this album, which is ridiculous. It's actually an insult to people who were truly moved by the material on HTTT. Until IR was released, this was the best album of the new millenium. Don't listen to the naysayers. This album is a wonderful mixture of the old guitar driven Radiohead (The Bends, Ok Computer) and the more adventurous, experimental Radiohead (Kid A, Amnesiac). No band should apologize for the work they produced in the past. This is the space they inhabited at that time and this how they chose to express themselves. For me, Hail To The Thief actually confirmed, in my mind, that Radiohead is the greatest musical phenomenon since The Beatles. I'll never forget when I saw the band perform live during the HTTT tour. They opened with There There and it totally blew me away. I implore the band to stop soiling my memories with negative vibes. This is a great album and a worthy addition to the Radiohead catalog.

B0016Q56C4|5.0|Saw this one in the theater and I loved it! It was great 3D fun and I don't remember seeing anything that you couldn't take your kids to see.  Of course, it's the same journey to the center of the earth type story that you expect, but Brendan Frasier is good in these adventure flicks and the movie is neat.  3D is also great fun because they do little tricks that make things jump out at you so you holler.  Of course, they encounter dinosaurs and sea monsters and attack fish that make pirahnas look like minnows.<br /><br />Although it seemed like they got back to the present place kind of quickly (or so it seemed) the movie was still a lot of fun. The whole thing was in 3D, unlike some other past movies that are only 3D in part.<br /><br />Just in case anyone reading does not know what 3D is: You wear special 3 Dimensional glasses to watch these movies (which they gave you at the theater).  Then objects in the movie have depth to them.  They stand out like the objects you see in real life, as opposed to objects appearing flat on a screen.  Then they do their little tricks, like someone may spin a yo yo toward you and it gives you the sensation that it's going to hit you in the face.
B000J103OI|5.0|Behind Pretty Woman this is my wifes favorite movie. I even liked it, but don't tell anyone.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|The scientific evidence for human-accelerated climate change has been laid out clearly over the past 30 years, each year becoming clearer. Gore has taken on the task of presenting the information to thousands of audiences around the world and this movie documents that. The film is not about political positions, which have only served to polarize this issue. This is a scientific phenomenon that some wish to ignore because of the myth that you can't be pro-environment and capitalist at the same time. I have a degree in Earth Science and the evidence for human-induced climate change seemed overwhelming as an undergraduate student 15 years ago, now we have clear effects rapidly materializing.     The film makes clear the moral responsibility to address our impacts on global warming, and that decision makers who continue to ignore or otherwise dismiss the issue are jeopordizing the balance in earth systems that permits life to thrive on this unique planet. There is hope, but we must act now. If you are not sure where to begin, start with this film. If you are one of the dwindling number of skeptics, please put your assumptions aside and watch this movie. We owe it to our offspring to do what is in our power to reduce our impacts on the atmosphere and preserve the ability of Earth to provide for intelligent life.
B000RPTQ1C|4.0|Coldplay can do no wrong in my eyes...and I didnt even like them when Yellow dropped years ago. But my wife got me into them and they grew on me enough to become probably my favorite band. Love love love their previous albums. This is new ground on \\"Viva La Vida\\" and it's more about the sounds, the music, the experimintation than the vocals...which I was sad at first, since I love seeing them live, and singing along their songs. These songs HAVE to grow on you...you won't be singing them word for word in the first listen.   My BIGGEST Disappointment are these:   Life In Technicolor- unbelievably AWESOME song...but way too short, and even if it still remained mostly music, rather than vocals included, it should've gone on for another minute or 2. Still...really moving song! LOVE IT.  LOST- The song starts out great with this thumping beat and handclap (makes me think of Kanye West doing the production on this track) but then the beat gets soft and the vocals keep getting soft, until it goes back in tune again and the bassline kicks in. Not sure if anyone else is pissed about that, or if I just got a bad cd. Otherwise, the track is really good.   Only other complaint, is the two songs in one...Lovers in Japan   (AWESOME) Reign of Love (AWESOME) why not have them as two separate songs??  Same thing with \\"YES\\" Really good downtempo beat type song, kinda dark, but then we get this great arena rock guitar/beat solo....and that should've been made into a another good track all on it's own!   Those are the only complaints. Otherwise, SOLID album..different, but they achieved what most cannot. Really are channelling the Beatles and, Peter Gabriel, and U2 on this album.     Highlight Tracks:   Viva La Vida- can see remixes of this one in the clubs real soon  Life in Technicolor  Violet Hill  Lovers in Japan

B00168OINK|5.0|`Kung Fu Panda' is a brilliant film in every possible way. It's one of the funniest animations I have ever seen; whoever wrote the script is a genius. I've never laughed out loud at an animation for such a long period of time.    The first part of the film in `Chinese style' cartoons is a perfect beginning, depicting Po(Jack Black) as some sort of animal animation of a samurai.    Po is a panda and the son of a stork who is descended from a long line of `noodle folk' (yes, it's pretty weird).  Po dreams of kung fu but in reality he makes noodle soup. One day, at a Kung Fu event in which the `Dragon Warrior' will be chosen, it appears that Po's dreams might not be so far out of reach.    The film contains quality animation - it's probably the best to date. The creators of this film truly have a wonderful sense of imagination, as the characters and scenes are so astounding.     Jack Black is wicked-funny as the Panda's voice, you can feel the actor's charisma through the animation. Dustin Hoffman's wonderful `rusty' voice brings the character `Master Chifu' to life; the serious and unamused Kung Fu master.     For those who haven't seen 'Kung Fu Panda': Go see it and be prepared awesomeness!

B000BT97AO|5.0|A girl who's fondest desire is to run away from the circus falls into her own drawings as her mother lies dying.  Wait, what?  Helena performs in her parents' circus, but deals with the same issues as most teen girls.  Her mum passes out in the middle of a performance and Helena's world turns, well, more topsy turvy than it already was.  She had been drawing to escape from her extrodinary adolescent angst, and falls into the world that she had created.  She meets exotic people and beasts as she explore her own drawings, then it gets weird.<br /><br />The Dadaesque world of Helena's drawings is rich with the most powerful and complex imagery rendered, mostly, in black and white.  It is visually overwhelming, with subtle and sublime symbols of good and evil.<br /><br />Normally, soundtrack music doesn't blow wind up my kilt, but \\"Mirrormask\\" had a brilliant mixture of jazz, african style strains, and circus riffs that really caught my attention.  It complimented the visuals and story perfectly.<br /><br />I'll make the mandatory comparison to \\"Labyrinth\\" - after the basic theme of the angst of a teenage girl and the brilliance of execution, there is none.  They're both incredibly well executed, but after that, their lives took different paths.<br /><br />\\"Mirrormask\\" is a treasure of the cinematic arts and if there is any justice in the world and any sanity in academia, it will be held as a shining and exemplary study in how to get it right for centuries to come.<br /><br />E.M. Van Court

B0000AUHOH|3.0|Many people write off \\"Star Trek V:  The Final Frontier\\" as the worst film in the Trek franchise.  However, it's like the old saying goes, \\"A bad day fishing is still better than a good day at work.\\"  \\"Frontier\\" has its downfalls but it still manages to be a solid science fiction film.<br /><br />In this tale, we are introduced to a renegade Vulcan named Sybok (Laurence Luckinbill) who has embraced the ways of the ancient Vulcans who deemed emotion more important than logic.  He has plans to find God (or at least the Vulcan version of Him) on Sha Ka Ree, a planet that is supposedly the Vulcan equivalent of Eden.  How's a religious zealot to do this?  By simply kidnapping Federation, Romulan and Klingon officials on Nimbus III, the planet of galactic peace.  Sybok determines that by doing this, the Federation will send a Starfleet ship to rescue the hostages.  When this occurs, he and his small band of followers will overtake the vessel and fly it to the center of the galaxy which is where Sha Ka Ree is supposed to be located.<br /><br />Kirk and the gang are called away from shoreleave to take an undermanned and malfunctioning Enterprise to Nimbus III to save the hostages and find out what's really going on.  Also en route is a Klingon Bird of Prey guided by the eager and cocky Captain Klaa and his right-hand man, er, woman, Vixis.  Klaa longs to fight a Federation ship.  When he learns that it's Kirk's ship on the way to Nimbus III, his hunger grows stronger.  Vixis also longs for power, and uses Klaa as a means to gain it.<br /><br />Of course, Sybok manages to overtake the Enterprise and gains the trust of most of the crew by allowing them to \\"show him their fears.\\"  Kirk doesn't fall for this so easily and Spock is more familiar with Sybok than even his longtime shipmates know but, in the end the Enterprise does make it to Sha Ka Ree.  Do they meet God?  Have they really discovered the final frontier?  What happens when Klaa decides to give cloaked chase to the Enterprise on its way to the center of the galaxy?  I'm sure most of you already know, but I won't spoil it for anyone.<br /><br />What is good about this film is the fact that it doesn't make light of Sybok's religious beliefs.  Sure, he's a bit \\"out there,\\" but he has true feelings for his god and for his followers.  I also like the fact that he isn't seen as a tyrant.  While Kirk questions the \\"god\\" creature in the film, he doesn't necessarily eliminate the possibility of there being an actual God somewhere out there.<br /><br />The beautiful shots of Yosemite National Park are also welcome to this film.  In a future cluttered with starships and technical jargon, it's nice to see some green for a change.<br /><br />Jerry Goldsmith's music is spot on as usual, and is one of the highlights of the film.<br /><br />The downside to this film is the fact that it has a rather cheap feel to it.  The special effects are poor even when compared to other films released at the same time.  Paradise City looks like it was built from the scraps of \\"The Road Warrior\\" film.  Also, in the reveal of the god creature, I felt that this all powerful being was just too hokey to be feared.<br /><br />This DVD release does up the ante for those who are on the fence about purchasing this film.  Highlights include an interview with William Shatner, a conference on the bridge of the Enterprise, a few deleted scenes that are worth looking at, Rockman test shots and a very lively interview with \\"That Klingon Couple,\\" Klaa (Todd Bryant) and Vixis (Spice Williams-Crosby, billed as Spice Williams in the film).  An Easter egg awaits those who take the time to search for it as well.<br /><br />Overall, the Enterprise and her crew took a hard blow from this film.  While I enjoyed the added humor and even the storyline, most were turned off by it.  This DVD is a must-have for Trek completionists, but casual fans may want to skip this entry into the Star Trek universe.  For those who tire of watchingfilms based in a bleak future, the breathtaking shots of Yosemite are more than enough reason to check this film out.  Is this a terrible Trek film?  Maybe, but I like it just fine.are more than enough reason to check this film out.  Is this a terrible Trek film?  Maybe, but I like it just fine.
B0016A2FFG|5.0|Lay It Down by Al Green is an outstanding CD.  The classic soulful sound of Al Green truly comes through on every song.  I highly recommend this CD.
B0017HRCQU|3.0|The movie is excellent, the High-Def transfer is great, and while the extras aren't new, getting to watch them in a picture-and-picture commentary mode is very nice, presentation-wise.    However, the collectibles are lame promotional items for the new movie \\"The Dark Knight\\".  The packaging says a \\"16-page comic book prologue\\" is included, but this is simply a poor adaptation of the first six minutes of new \\"The Dark Knight\\" movie.      But, the packaging also says there is a \\"32-page booklet\\", but this, again, is another adaptation of the SAME six minutes of the new movie, only with excerpts from the screenplay, side-by-side with photos.      And the only NEW feature (as compared to the SD DVD release) on the Disc itself is the SAME SIX MINUTES OF THE DARK KNIGHT from the comic and the booklet, admittedly in gorgeous 1080p and full 16x9 aspect ratio.    A 32-page booklet would have been better used to show stills from the behind-the-scenes of the FIRST Batman movie, or showing promotional posters, or re-printing the original marketing info, like I've seen on many other DVDs.  And a comic book is useless if it is an adaptation of the movie, since the movie will always be a better experience.  Better to reprint comics that inspired the movies, like the ones that were re-printed for the SD DVD edition of \\"Batman Begins\\".    Also, you get a movie pass for the new Batman film, but it is only worth $7.50! That's not even half the cost of a non-matinee ticket!  And I bought the special edition thinking the cost of the movie ticket would reduce the added cost of the Limited Edition versus the standard Blu-Ray, but with these paltry collectibles, it was not worth the extra money.    My honest opinion is that you should buy the other Blu-Ray edition, with just the movie, and save your money.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|I'd like to thank the other reviews on Amazon.  More negative reviews than positive? Rejoice.    I do not understand why this movie received A ratings in papers and magazines.    Were the reviewers conned into giving this movie and A by some need to fit in with a pretentious \\"art\\" loving hive mind? If so, then then I can only imagine that this hive mind is the same one that compels people to like fecal art and those square box kindergarten finger paintings  hidden in the modern sections of every museum.    Horrible nauseating camera shaking does not qualify as spectacular artistic genius.     I have plenty of home videos from the 80's where my father left the camcorder on while he was walking, looks just like this.     If I add a lump of purple clay that goes RAAAR and splice in some footage of buildings blowing up will you people pay me too?    Horrible plot. Or lack of plot.  Tons of plot holes.   Lame five second explanation of what's going on.    If you like B-list films, by all means.
B000WS4OZM|5.0|Not being an expert on country music or on Johnny Cash, I must say this album is moving and very very suggestive; with simple but clever arrangements, beautiful songs and amazing vocal...<br />Obviously more than merely touched by age and various ailments, mr. Johnny Cash performes with great passion and suggests wisdom no young singer can convey (or even come close to conveying)...<br /><br />I like it very much!
0743496736|3.0|Like one of the other reviewers, the happiness formula (happiness = reality divided by expectations) was one of the most intriguing parts of this novel.   However, I felt that the relationship between Alex and Josie was cardboard - two dimensional.  It seemed like Picoult had in mind the story she wanted to tell and she wasn't going to let her characters get in the way of it.  Often the characters seemed like they were chess pieces being moved around by an omniscient narrator - they didn't feel real to me.  And many of their decisions seemed outside of the bounds of what someone would do in their given situation.  I enjoyed reading the novel but it seemed to lose steam towards the end... I was looking forward to hearing what Peter had to say on the stand, but was disappointed with how that was handled.  The twist at the end had little impact because it was not believable to me.  I went along with it but was not emotionally involved anymore.  Overall, the novel was fun to read and well written.  Perhaps having less characters to juggle would have given Mrs. Picoult a chance to go deeper in creating life-like people who I could connect with.
B0000028VT|5.0|1993 was a really good year. With janet. and Toni Braxton releasing their great albums. I was only 5 and starting school and meeting my best friend around this album came out. The only two songs I remember from this album were Hero and Dreamlover which were two of her biggest hits back then. The album was mostly comprised of ballads with a few dance tracks, but I didn't find this album to be boring. I find it to be a beautiful masterpiece. I love all of the songs on this album. I could relate to nearly all the songs and they have been inspiring. Music box is definitely in my top 3. so let's start out with the tracks, shall we?<br /><br />1. Dreamlover-i remember watching the video where she was in the cornfields. it was a great summer song to start off the album with. 5/5<br /><br />2. Hero- this song has got to be the most overrated song in Mariah's career. it comes close to Whitney's Greatest Love of All or I will always Love You. lol. but i do like how the lyrics sends out a good message. 5/5<br /><br />3. Anytime You Need A Friend-I think this song is the underrated version of Hero. It's uplifting and comforting the same way as Hero. And the lyrics remind me of Janet's Lonely song from Rhythm Nation (also a great album). both songs talk about you can always rely on them whenever you need a friend. 5/5<br /><br />4. Music Box- i really like how the music box is playing in the background. the melody is kind of similar to Just To Hold You Once Again. and speaking of music box, i have one myself but don't know if it still works tho. 5/5<br /><br />5. Now That I Know-great dance track if you feel you feel very happy at the moment. 5/5<br /><br />6. Never Forget You-this song kinda reminds me of Boys II Men's End of the Road. it was produced by babyface. i love him and his work! 5/5<br /><br />7. Without You-i've never heard the original so i can't make comparisons but whatever the original sounds like, i think she did a wonderful job on this song. i could actually feel the emotions in this song. i can so relate to this song. great job, mariah! 5/5<br /><br />8. Just To Hold You Once Again-i swear Mariah is psychic. it's like she really knows what people go thru. I can relate to these lyrics alot and it makes me cry. this reminds me of something to remember by madonna. both songs say even though i'm not ur lover and friend, i guess u will always be a part of me. 5/5<br /><br />9. I've Been Thinking About You-i love it 5/5<br /><br />10. All I Ever Wanted-yes, yes, yes, i do!!!! 5/5el the emotions in this song. i can so relate to this song. great job, mariah! 5/5<br /><br />8. Just To Hold You Once Again-i swear Mariah is psychic. it's like she really knows what people go thru. I can relate to these lyrics alot and it makes me cry. this reminds me of something to remember by madonna. both songs say even though i'm not ur lover and friend, i guess u will always be a part of me. 5/5<br /><br />9. I've Been Thinking About You-i love it 5/5<br /><br />10. All I Ever Wanted-yes, yes, yes, i do!!!! 5/5

B0018AK9RK|5.0|The metal gods Judas Priest have outdone themselves in their latest release, an ambitious 2 disc opera about Nostradamus.  As other reviews have mentioned, the first time you hear this album there is a certain WTF? aspect of it.  But once you listen a couple times, you can figure out what Priest has done and they should get kudos for it.  This is definitely not a disc of filler and regurgitated old riffs.  Priest put a lot of thought, effort, and tender loving care into the album.  As Priest have occasionally released albums in their catalog that capture a certain metal sub-genre (e.g., Painkiller's thrash), Priest have released an epic neo-classical metal album in Nostradamus.  Think Yngwie Malmsteen crossed with Operation Mindcrime.  There are individual cuts here that are as good as anything Priest has ever done (e.g., Persecution).  But the album needs to really be listened to in a single block of time to truly appreciate it.  Halford's voice is awesome, if somewhat restrained (I understand they are going to tour the album so I understand why he would pace himeself).  The production is beautiful and multi-layered.  The music is very melodic, with recurring themes, and with tidbits of Italian thrown in for good measure.  The guitar work is impressive, with lots of guitar synths to color the music.  Not the best Priest album, but right up there in the pantheon of great Priest albums.
B0012QE4Q2|2.0|I am still trying to figure out who the \\"other\\" Boleyn girl is (sarcasm).  In this unemotional, historical drama, director Justin Chadwick and screenwriter Peter Morgan miss the mark not because of poor acting or directing, but because the writing is anachronistic and stale.     Once again, Natalie Portman, Scarlett Johansson and Eric Bana deliver as actors, but there is not enough substance in the script for them to rectify the film.    The dilemma of the film is given early on - King Henry's wife cannot conceive children anymore.  The solution - The Boleyn whores!    The love triangle that the film creates is on par with lifetime movies.  There is no purpose/no good reason to feel any empathy for any of the characters.  The characters are all robots - doing what they are told to do mindlessly for the aristocracy.      The strength of the film is the cinematography, but the weaknesses of anachronisms and continuity are too much (or too little?) to make up for impressive cinematography.     Ultamately, the film fails because the characters are lifeless and the pacing is unsure of itself.  I'm not sure how the film makers went about making this film without constantly asking themselves, \\"what is the purpose here?\\"
B001BWDG0W|5.0|I am a big musical fan, having played in the pit orchestras of several musicals including Sweet Charity and Anything Goes. For hollywood actors, this is a wonderful soundtrack. I hope the movie will live up to the standard set by Chicago and Hairspray.
0156034026|2.0|This is a strange book, and I'm not even sure why I finished it, except that it is a short, fast read.  The device of having Changez speak the whole time is odd.  His love interest is just bizarre.  He continues to pursue her, even though she clearly is emotionally unavailable.  Finally, I could not figure out what happened at the very end of the book.  I would really like to know if anyone thinks they know what happened in the final scene of the book.
B0012QE4Q2|4.0|I just finished watching this film based on Phillipa Gregory's best selling novel by the same name.  Some of the words that come to mind are dark, brooding, tragic...beautiful.  The movie is decidely more heavy than I would have expected but beautifully filmed and for the most part well acted.  I found Natalie Portman not quite up to the roll as Ann.  As a scheming, ambitious woman, she just lacked substance.  This character definitely calls for a more well rounded and experienced actress.  On the other hand Scarlett Johanson does an incredible job as Mary, the second daughter.  Believable and rich in ways Natalie Portman could never be, she plays the betrayed sister, victimized by her family perfectly.  I too wish there was more from Henry in this film, but true to Phillipa Gregory, he is always in the background as an important but secondary character.<br />This is really a story of family, about two sisters and their love for each other, even when not deserved.  About betrayal and runaway ambition.  In the end, it passed my test for period films, it was entertaining, and I had a sense of the time.  No, it may not be entirely historically accurate, but who cares?
0743454537|5.0|I loved this book.  What a fantastic read - and ending in a way you don't really expect. Although the book seems to be from the perspective of one sister - Picoult gives insights to the characters in the entire family (and others) - this adds depth, understanding, and helps the reader to see the situation with a more balanced view.  Did Picoult change my mind about this controversial issue? No - she actually opened up more questions for me as now  I see more sides to this complicated social issue made prominent by the advances in medical technology.  I couldn't put this down.  I highly recommend this book - it really gets one thinking about life from the view point of others.
B0016A2FFG|5.0|Love it! This is Al Green as he was in his prime; strong,sensual vocals, tracks that draw you in. A plus is the coterie of guest artists, especially Corrine Bailey Ray.  Al Green's still got the goods!
B000002O1P|4.0|The run-of-the-mill [[ASIN:B00005ABKB Long After Dark]] was the first album from Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers to garner a less than stellar reception. The frustration Petty felt became evident in the tales that emerged during the recording of \\"Southern Accents,\\" including a broken hand incurred when Petty punched a wall in frustration. The desire to create something outside the box was evident when the first single appeared. \\"Don't Come Around Here No More\\" twanged out with psychedelic sitars and a wild \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" video, and was unlike any Petty song before it.<br /><br />Dave Stewart was feeling his oats outside [[ASIN:B000BGR0OM Eurythmics]] and it was his eclectic production spiced up \\"It Ain't Nothin' To Me\\" and \\"Make It Better,\\" yet he was just one of three outside producers, including [[ASIN:B000000OQL Robbie Robertson]] and long-time associate Jimmy Iovine. Petty and Mike Campbell also indulged in self-production on three numbers. It does make for some odd juxtapositions, like \\"Spike\\" veering close to Randy Newman territory and the soul-inflected \\"Make It Better.\\" If you're looking for that traditional Petty sound, both the title track and \\"Mary's New Car\\" land on target.<br /><br />This was also Petty's slickest album. It was given some criticism for that at the time, but the album's best songs (\\"Mary's...,\\" \\"The Best Of Everything,\\" \\"Don't Come...\\") still make this worth having. It's really a three and 1/2 star effort; INHO, the oft slagged \\"Long After Dark\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B000002O3B Let Me Up (I've Had Enough)]] have aged better.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|As I watched the 2008 Masterpiece version of Persuasion I was appalled at the blithe rewriting of the story, inadequate acting and interminable unnecessary pauses that doubled the run time.  I love the novel and the story came alive for me as I watched this movie - perfection in every scene.  The actors fit their characters so exquisitely that I could not imagine anyone else playing the roles, and certainly there are none that could come close to Amanda Root and Ciaran Hand playing the leads.  Their respective transformations from rundown to radiant, and aloof to passionate were subtle and spot on, and completely matched my personification of the characters as I read the book.  I watch the final scenes every time I need a romantic \\"high\\" - Wentworth realizing Anne still loves him has he hears her say that women love the longest when there is no hope, and Anne reading his amazing letter that brings her total joy then madly trying to be alone with him to say \\"yes\\".  Well done!
B0013NS6EU|2.0|This review refers ONLY to the kindle version.    The way that the kindle converts the text to an e-format forces the images at a fixed size -- a size that too small to be able to see details.    You can resize the text, but not the pictures.    Obviously, this was more than a little annoying in a book that is all about using pictures to convey information.    Also, there were several places in the book where there was a caption for a picture but just a blank space where the picture (presumably) was supposed to appear.
B0017I1FP8|5.0|\\"The Dark Knight\\" is a mature, confident film score.  It builds upon themes from \\"Batman Begins\\" but adds to it a depth of emotion that the prior work was missing.  The tempo and style remain very similar, but what \\"Batman Begins\\" lacked, the music for \\"The Dark Knight\\" provides in excess- raw, exposive energy.    The score begins with \\"Why So Serious?\\"-- the introduction of the Joker's theme.  This is an angry piece, starting with a buzzsaw of strings and quickly exploding with a menacing percussion.  I was greatly surprised by this piece, mostly because it doesn't follow a typical composition's elements.  It is fierce, dissonant and tense.  It's chaos!  I absolutely love it.    \\"I'm Not a Hero\\" picks up directly from the first track, lightly introducing the recognizable refrain for Batman from the first movie.  This piece is more typical of the score from the first movie, more incidental and mood-driven.  Other tracks that follow this \\"incidental\\" style are \\"Aggressive Expansion\\", \\"Blood on my Hands\\", \\"I Am The Batman\\" and \\"Watch The World Burn.\\"    \\"Harvey Two-Face\\" is a sweeping piece-- starting with a melancholy combination of strings and piano.  It opens up into a rousing theme that is both noble and sad.  This track typifies what is excellent about this score- its ability to use simple motifs to develop a full emotion.    \\"Always a Catch\\" is a quick track, starting with Joker's theme (which is akin to a stick of dynamite going off) and recovering with a quiet combination of strings and low horns.  And again, \\"A Little Push\\" brings back the Joker in all of his menacing glory.  Your skin will crawl when you hear this moody piece.  By this point in the score, you feel enveloped in the darkness of this villain.    \\"Like a Dog Chasing Cars\\" is the most rousing action music from this score.  If you want to drive a little faster to work, play this in the car.  If you enjoyed \\"Molossus\\" from the \\"Batman Begins\\" score, then this will be your new favorite track.  Thisis a tense march, heroic and persistent.  And this track represents the best in what is an unlikely collaboration between Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard.  Excellent music.    \\"And I Thought My Jokes Were Bad\\", \\"Agent of Chaos\\" and \\"Introduce a Little Anarchy\\" are strong action pieces as well.  Without overdoing it, the score is able to switch its focus from the pulse-pounding percussion that was typical in the first film's score to this score's unique mood swings into melancholy territory and the Joker's insanely raw anthem.    The score closes with \\"A Dark Knight\\" and this is truly an all-encompassing piece.  Throughout listening to this entire score, I kept thinking to myself that this was an \\"urban-industrial opera.\\"  There is something very machine-like in the music to this film-- like you are listening to the rhythm of a large engine blasting away at work.  I think my biggest gripe with the score to \\"Batman Begins\\" has been resolved here- that being the lack of a recognizable theme for Batman.  In an interview, the film's composers states the reason they didn't give Batman a \\"Danny Elfman\\" theme was that they believed it would \\"reveal\\" too much about the hero.  Batman's theme is meant to be more of a presence, not an anthem.  And when contrasted with the new motifs of this film's score, it makes a lot more sense.  While Batman's music is pulsing, Joker's theme is insipid and disruptive.  Joker's music cuts through the score, like I said before, with explosive anger.      In all, this is an excellent score, an improvement on \\"Batman Begins\\" (without abandoning the prior film's established universe).  It is not easy to evaluate a score prior to seeing a film, but this music stands on its own rather easily.  Enjoy!
B000067J1H|5.0|As a female reviewer of this film, I'm definitely in the<br />minority. But I really enjoyed this movie....so much so<br />that I bought it for my best friend from college. His<br />response was basically, \\"What were you thinking?\\" I<br />think its one of the most creative, symbolically<br />loaded mixture of male angst and social commentary<br />I've ever seen. It's funny, scary, witty, creative, dark,<br />and utterly thought-provoking. I can't wait for the<br />female version of a movie like this to come out.<br />Thelma and Louise ran its course. If only film<br />makers were as daring when it comes to portraying<br />all the facets of being a woman in modern Western<br />society. Hopefully, for someone brave and willing<br />enough, Fight Club will lead the way.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|It's so rare to find a satisfying romance at the movies that I nearly dissolved into raptures of delight to discover not one but two of them this weekend! On Friday I had the distinct pleasure of going to see the new theatrical version of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE with Keira Knightly and Matthew MacFadyen. To be honest, I was prepared to be disappointed. I had seen the rather murky looking trailer that made even the gorgeous Keira Knightly look washed-out and blotchy. Plus as we all know, every version of P & P must now be compared to that platinum standard of the 1995 BBC mini-series with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.<br /><br />But I found the new movie to be thoroughly delightful and exhilarating! At just a little over 2 hours long, it couldn't cover quite as much ground as the mini-series (Wickham and the two younger sisters had very minor roles), but it beautifully captured the romance and robust good humor of Austen's story. I was caught off guard by several laugh-out-loud moments.<br /><br />Keira Knightly embodied Elizabeth Bennet's intelligence and wit. (Her portrayal also reminded me a little of Jo March in LITTLE WOMEN.) One glimpse of her smile and you knew why Darcy's heart was captivated. MacFadyen as Mr. Darcy won me over in the moment when I realized his voice had the exact same timbre as Alan Rickman's. The murkier cinematography actually ended up making the movie seem more vital and historically accurate. The gritty images of daily life are contrasted with breathtaking shots of the English countryside, including one of Mr. Darcy striding out of the mist that almost rivals Colin Firth's rising up out of Pemberly's pond on the female gasp of appreciation scale. (Yes, this is an actual scientific device. I have one in my office.)<br /><br />(Originally published on the website of author Teresa Medeiros[...])
0321544080|4.0|This is an excellent book that lives up to the phrase on the back of the book. It contains excellent illustrated images as well as instructions how to perform the shots.  The book is an excellent choice for beginner and experienced shooter.  Like many other books, it stirs up the creative thinking.<br /><br />Joe McNally presents various methods to create interesting shots.  Although many of us might never have the opportunity to shoot the same images in the book, we might be in a situation to combine various techniques taught.  After owning the book for a short period of time, I put to use many of the techniques from the book.<br /><br />It is a keeper compared to other books that I buy and sell immediately.
B00005JO20|5.0|I have to confess that this is one of my all-time favorite movies.  Yes, I know the jungle scenes are a little over-the-top and my stoic husband can't even watch the \\"bug\\" scene without covering up his eyes but all of its excesses only make me love it more.<br /><br />This new version soars from the breathtaking imagination of director Peter Jackson. The same strengths Jackson showed in LORD OF THE RINGS are in dazzling display here. Although there are enough amazing CGI special effects to satisfy even the most jaded STAR WARS/STAR TREK geek (including me), he's never willing to sacrifice heart and intimacy for spectacle. While KONG is a sprawling rollercoaster thrill ride of a movie--the original KING KONG meets INDIANA JONES meets JURASSIC PARK--it's Naomi Watts luminous portrayal of Ann Darrow that steals our hearts (and Kong's). An incurable romantic at heart, I actually turned to my husband after the movie and said, \\"I wish they'd have shown more scenes developing their relationship\\" before remembering that I was talking about a woman and a giant gorilla.<br /><br />If you don't mind your guys a trifle bit hairy, you've always found a little Alpha male chest thumping to be endearing, and morning breath isn't an issue, the new Kong just may be the guy for you!<br /><br />It occurred to me as I watched the movie that this Kong has a lot in common with the heroes of many of my favorite romance novels:<br /><br />1) He adores Ann and finds her antics endlessly amusing.<br />2) He's so attentive he can recognize her by her smell alone<br />3) He rejects every other woman once they meet (hurling them out of his path like rag dolls)<br />3) He's keenly jealous of every other man in her life (hurling them out of his path like rag dolls)<br />4) He'd do anything to protect her, including sacrifice his own life.<br /><br />What's not to love about a big old monkey like that?<br /><br />(Originally published on the website of author Teresa Medeiros at [...]
B000SQJ2JG|5.0|A surprising gem from the much maligned mark four line up of Purple. While this version of the group turned into a train wreck ( with a few shining moments) on the road. In the studio they were in there element. New comer Tommy Bolin not feeling chained to living up to Blackmore's barouqe bluesey style injects the band with new life. Tight sinewy arrangements fill this disc from start too finish. Veteran Purple members Lord and Paice deliver fantastic performances. Relative new comers Hughs and Coverdale come into there own here. Dumping the tacky duet format of Burn and Stormbringer each one get there own spotlight.This album is a dark horse favorite of Deep Purple fans the world over.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|Here we have the rather luscious and dangerous Joaquin Phoenix channeling Johnny Cash in WALK THE LINE. At the literal heart of the movie is Cash's longstanding and long-unrequited love for June Carter (the ever ebullient Reese Witherspoon finally being allowed to put her Nashville accent to good use) and the trials and travails he must suffer before finally settling down with the love of his life. From the foot-stomping power of the very first scene, music is the thread that binds these two restless hearts and what makes the movie even more remarkable is that Phoenix and Witherspoon did all of their own singing!<br /><br />(Originally published on the website of author Teresa Medeiros at [...])

B000EGCITG|5.0|Yes, that's right. I'm a 30-something-year-old woman (cough cough...) who is coming out of the closet to admit that I adore P!NK! I first fell in love with her music for one simple reason--the girl can sing. In a music industry where pop stars are manufactured from every pretty girl who ever appeared in a Disney movie or hosted her own Nickelodeon show, P!NK is the genuine article--talented, smart, brash and bold enough to get in your face if she has something important to say. She acknowledges this paradox in Don't Let Me Get Me from MISSUNDAZTOOD: (Hey, I said she could sing, not spell!)<br /><br />\\"L.A. told me<br />You'll be a pop star<br />All you have to change<br />Is everything you are<br /><br />Tired of being compared<br />To damn Britney Spears<br />She's so pretty<br />That just ain't me.\\"<br /><br />She revisited the subject with Stupid Girls on her most recent CD I'M NOT DEAD. The song was accompanied by a hilarious video of P!NK mocking her less talented contemporaries by writhing all over the sudsy hood of a car a la national brain trust Paris Hilton.<br /><br />MISSUNDAZTOOD is the only CD aside from the hallowed BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER: THE MUSICAL that ever stayed in my car CD player for an entire year without me ever getting sick of it.<br /><br />Part of P!NK's charm is her diversity. She sings pop laced with a sly wit and self-deprecating humor. She sings soul. She rocks like a latter-day Joan Jett on songs like Humble Neighborhood from TRY THIS and Numb from MISSUNDAZTOOD. And she can break your heart with songs like Family Portrait from MISSUNDAZSTOOD, which has to be the most honest account I've ever heard of what's it's like for a frightened child to wake up in the middle of the night to the sounds of breaking glass and her parents screaming at each other.<br /><br />When we lost our 20-year-old nephew to an accidental drug overdose in August, there was very little that could give me comfort but P!NK'S song Who Knew (written for a dear friend of hers who died from an overdose three years ago) gave my anguish both a voice and a melody.<br /><br />I've always been a sucker for smart, angry young women who have something genuine to say and refuse to take any crap off of anybody. (Alannis Morissette anyone?) They remind me of what it's like to be racing down the road at seventeen with the windows down and the stereo blasting. But P!NK is even more fun than Alannis because she knows when to wink at her own foibles and ours.<br /><br />(DISCLAIMER: P!NK's CDs TRY THIS and I'M NOT DEAD contain some profanity. I buy the edited versions for myself and my niece but it's still not too hard to figure out what's missing. The good news is that she doesn't use profanity frequently or gratuitously.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|As some of you probably already know, Joss Whedon, the genius behind BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, did a short-lived TV \\"space western\\" called FIREFLY on Fox in 2002. The network pulled the show after only 11 episodes (obviously taking a cue from the Mensa candidates over at the SciFi network who cancelled FARSCAPE). But the show had already spawned a loyal fan base who called themselves \\"Browncoats.\\" They recruited more devotees when the entire series was recently released on DVD and it was their passionate campaigning that helped get Joss Whedon a greenlight to bring his ragtag crew of space explorers to the big screen in SERENITY.<br /><br />I havn't yet seen a single episode of FIREFLY (although I have the DVD's sitting on my bookshelf) but I have to confess that I liked SERENITY better than all 3 of the most recent STAR WARS movies combined. Captain Mal Reynolds seems to be a combination of Captain Kirk, Han Solo, and that wisecracking pilot from your last Southwest flight. (Ya gotta love a captain who picks up the mic and announces, \\"We may experience some slight turbulence...and explode\\" and a crew member that whines back at him, \\"But I don't WANT to explode!\\")<br /><br />His crew members all had distinct personalities and you truly believed that they were as devoted to each other as they were to their battle-scarred ship. The movie had the best futuristic dialogue I've heard since MAD MAX: BEYOND THUNDERDOME. The music worked for me, the visuals worked, and all of those thrilling episodes of derring do were deftly mixed with the wonderful touches of humor and humanity that are Joss Whedon's trademark as a writer.<br /><br />If you enjoy space opera, if you enjoy a good western, if you simply enjoy interesting characters doing interesting things while tossing off genuinely amusing wisecracks, then you should probably find some SERENITY now!<br /><br />(Orginally published on the website of author Teresa Medeiros at [...]

It is so good, so logical and rational, that it will probably exarcerbate the religious fanatics and denounce with the usual hate his thoughts.  Buy this book...
0385335989|5.0|Diana Gabaldon is an amazing story teller.  I really enjoyed this the fourth installment in the Outlander series.<br /><br />I don't know what I could say about this book that someone hasn't already said.  I will add my two cents and say that I like the character Brianna.  I think that it's important to put into perspective that she comes from a time when people aren't considered adults at the ripe old age of seventeen.  And she has been given a lot to deal with in a short period of time, she seems a bit impulsive and immature but she's twenty two years old...<br /><br />I enjoyed the love story between Brianna and Rodger and the adventures in Drums were just as exciting as all the others.<br /><br />I am hooked!  I will be reading ALL of the books in the series!  It's wonderful escapist adventure with a fabulous background in historical fiction.<br /><br />If anyone knows if there are more books coming out after Snow and Ashes will you let me know...I read in The Outlandish Companion that Gabaldon was going to publish a prequel to Outlander and I tried to find out more but couldn't.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|Simply put this album is amazing.  I was never a big Motley Crue fan, and never really payed much attention to any of the members and what they were/are doing.  For some reason I picked up this album, I think after maybe hearing an interview with Sixx on my local radio station.  I thought \\"hmmm sounds like an interesting concept, a soundtrack to a book.\\"  So I bought the album, and absolutly love it.  One of the best albums I've heard in a while.  It's emotional, it's depressing at times, uplifting at others.  Finally an album that makes me feel something and moves me.  Plus I can't get \\"courtesy call\\" out of my head.
0670020745|5.0|I am a speech pathologist and found this book to be the best book I have read in years. The perspective of someone knowing the anatomy describing the stroke experience was very powerful and informative.  A must read for anyone in the helping professions.

B0015GDVTU|1.0|I was looking forward to a love story, but ended up wasting time watching one of the top 10 worst movies ever.<br />Why would straight woman spend time at a gay man bar? The Hillary Swank character's husband isn't dead 5 minutes and already she's out man hunting. Hillary and her hubby were arguing in the beginning they couldn't afford to have a baby, yet hubby can afford tickets to Ireland for Hillary and her 2 friends. The man is dying of brain cancer, yet is well enough to write and send all these letters. PHONEY!!!! OH...and what was with the annoying sister? Who hired that girl???<br />I didn't even bother watching to the end b/c a person can only take so much torture.
0385340567|1.0|What a sad disappointment!  Three members of my family have been avid Jack Reacher fans.  We buy the hardbacks because we believe in supporting authors we like, we have bought multiple copies rather than wait for one person to finish for the same reason, and one of us always buys the unabridged book tape version.  But after this book we will never spend another dime on an item that might provide profit to this author.  In fact, for the first time we threw a book in the trash.      Once again, our \\"betters\\" can't just write a book that entertains people.  They must educate their \\"stupid\\" readers about what to think about political views.  And God forbid that they write plots about the actual Muslims who blow people up on a daily basis.  No - once again we are subjected to those crazy so-called right-wing Christians as the bad guys and Jack Reacher of all people encouraging desertion in an all-volunteer military.      Enough already - this is so old and tired as to be beyond belief.  And what a coward Lee Child must be to take this approach - Go ahead Lee.  Attack the Christians and \\"speak truth to power\\" because you are such a brave individual.  We encourage everyone to go look at the discussion thread to see Lee Child's comments about those \\"neocon dittoheads\\" who are so immoral they can't rise up to his high level.    We are sick and tired of this attitude.  Lee Child - you are entitled to your opinion and your sanctimonious elitist attitude but we are also entitled to say you and Jack Reacher are dead to us.
B000F5GNX8|2.0|This movie made no sense to me. It was boring after the opening scene.<br />Not sure what the plot was. Some girl rehooks up with Robert Downey Jr., there are car chases, people get shot and killed, there are trashy Hollywood chicks at parties.<br />Only saving grace to this film was Val Kilmer.
0374280967|3.0|Short novella about how the Queen of England becomes sensitive and human after she unexpectedly becomes an avid reader. This has her staff scrambling to find a way to stop her new obsession so she can get back to her normal duties. Cute story, though the writing is a bit dry and repetitive, with hardly any dialogue. Would have been better served as a short story.
B0013FNC38|5.0|I have all of Mr. Mraz's CDs, and this one outshines them all. It's intelligent, catchy, and if you can get Coyotes out of your head, you're a better man than I.  That's my favorite of this collection, but Live High is a kick-butt anthem, and all the other music is heads above most of the current pop, rock and hip-hop.  Beyond all that, the man has a VOICE!  Love it.
B000ION23A|2.0|I thought \\"Ant Bully\\" would be a lot like \\"Ants,\\" but I was mistaken and disappointed in it. What I didn't like about it was the gratuitous rude and uncivil dialogue between the characters which I felt was in poor taste and a very poor example for kids.  I would not show it to my grandkids, as they learn from movies and videos and I would not want them to emulate the attitudes expressed by the characters. There are already too much iresponsible and negative attitudes expressed on TV. I am amazed that Tom Hanks and the other Hollywood actors got involved in this cheap take off on \\"Ants.\\"  The insects did not even look like insects, but rather grotesque charactures that were unnatural.  Made for a quick profit, not any redeeming value.
B0019GOT2Y|5.0|After a very disappointing release in 2005, Shinedown is back as bright as ever.  I've been a fan since I first heard \\"Fly from the Inside\\" on the radio back in the spring of 2003, and it was four long months of waiting before \\"Leave a Whisper,\\" quite possibly the best alternative rock album of the decade, was released.  The new album, \\"The Sound of Madness,\\" is almost as good as \\"Leave a Whisper,\\" and that's saying something.    1. Devour 9/10: This is the first of several hard-rocking tracks on the album.  There's definitely some new (for Shinedown) guitar work going on here.  The song reminds me of Drowning Pool and Rob Zombie's \\"The Man Without Fear.\\"  Of all the songs on the album, this one is the best opener.  Shinedown is now 3 for 3 choosing the best opener.  2. Sound of Madness 10/10: The lyrics are great, the post-chorus riff is very distinctive, and it's an all-around complete song and a perfect title track.  3. Second Chance 6/10: I liked this song the first time I heard it, but it's gotten worse and worse with each listen, and that really shouldn't happen with a Shinedown song.  4. Cry for Help 9/10: Another hard-rocker, harder than anything on either of the previous albums.  Like most Shinedown songs, there are religious overtones, but here, they're a little atheist.  5. The Crow & the Butterfly 6/10: Like \\"Second Chance,\\" I like this song less and less each time I hear it.  I assume it's about a friend dying of an overdose.  6. If You Only Knew 5/10: This is the worst song on the album, but in all fairness, it's very hard for an alternative metal band to perform a good love ballad.  7. Sin with a Grin 8/10: Yet another hard-rocker, and this time, the religious overtones are downright satanic.  8. What a Shame 8/10: This song gets points off for being preachy (or anti-preachy), but it's done very well.  The third chorus contains Brent's only real attempt at hitting one of those power notes that made \\"Leave a Whisper\\" so great.  9. Cyanide Sweet Tooth Suicide 7/10: This is the last of the hard-rockers, some really heavy drums and whiny guitar on this one.  The chorus needs work, but not a bad song otherwise.  10. Breaking Inside 10/10: This is my favorite song on the album.  It's got the lyrics, a Pink Floyd-inspired first verse, and a really catchy chorus.  11. Call Me 8/10: This song tries to be \\"45,\\" but it doesn't quite have the content to make it.  The piano works well.  It was probably the best choice for a closer.  12. I Own You 9/10: If you have the special edition version of this album, you saw the chorus to this song printed on the back of the lyrics booklet.  This song moves fast, and it certainly could've made the regular version of the album.  13. The Energy 9/10: I think this is the only song that has really grown on me.  Yes, it's a cliché rock song about how they're charged by their fans, but it's still pretty good.  14. Son of Sam 6/10: What could've been a very good song was killed by terrible lyrics, a true b-side.    Overall, this is a great album, probably the most solid rock album of 2008 so far, and probably the most deserving of a Grammy.  Still, there is not one track on here as outstanding and memorable as more than half of \\"Leave a Whisper.\\"  I'm learning to accept that there will never be another Shinedown album as amazing as \\"Leave a Whisper.\\"
B0017I1FP8|4.0|Read Heads: If you preferred Hans Zimmer's incorporation to Batman Begins with familiar action sequences and abrasive percussion work. You thought the biggest problem with Begins was its incoherency and atmosphere.<br /><br />Read Tails: If you preferred the quieter more abstract moments of Begins, courtesy of James Newton Howard. You thought the biggest problem with Begins was its reliance of Zimmer's action sequences and overall lack of a signature superhero theme.<br /><br />Heads: The Dark Knight returns with Zimmer/Howard on board with a change in dominance. The score is almost entirely Zimmer now with a much louder and in your face presentation. The Joker's theme which is included in the opening, \\"Why So Serious\\" features Zimmer's very debatable one note motif (if you can call it that). The theme does do justice to a character that simply does not care about any set of guidelines or rules to society. It is only fitting then that his theme be a demonic siren like sound to introduce true madness. Does it work by itself? Not entirely, there are moments of build up that sound like symphonic metal bands Dimmu Borgir or an interlude from Behemoth. The Batman theme is layered more but disapprovingly scarce on the score (featured only in \\"I'm Not a Hero\\" and \\"A Dark Knight\\"). Most of the other cues are pretty standard Zimmer material. \\"Like a Dog Chasing Cars\\" is the highlight track from this point of view. For Zimmer fan boys, it is a dream come true. To others, they can certainly hear bits and pieces of Last Samurai and Crimson Tide. However, I do not consider an unholy terrible thing done here. Zimmer's past efforts like Pirates have sounded eerily too much like The Rock, The Peacemaker, and Broken Arrow to enjoy. The suite ending the effort is reminiscent of The DaVinci Code's more bombastic moments. If you have enjoyed any of Zimmer's past action scores, I suggest you give this one a whirl to see what you think. Recommend tracks: \\"Like a Dog Chasing Cars\\", \\"Agent of Chaos\\", and \\"Why So Serious\\"<br /><br />Tails: Now comes the disappointment...As mentioned above, James Newton Howard's presence has decreased substantially compared to his collaboration in Begins. Yet, because of this, the score is much more cohesive and all-together than Begins' sporadic changes from endearing melody to explosive percussion work. The relationship to there being less of Howard and therefore melody should not shock anyone. The atmosphere is shown in small doses but still packs a punch. The highlight of the album has to be Howard's \\"Harvey Two - Face\\" with an emotional six note piano intro that leads to a harmonic performance that is utterly beautiful. Since Dent's character is a more public figure that fights crime in the open, this theme starts heroic and travels to a expressive anguish that follows suit to the character. Other Howard moments include the mournful \\"Blood on My Hands\\" and brief moments of \\"Agent of Chaos\\" that are unquestionably Howard. Even Zimmer's calm after the storm, \\"Watch the World Burn\\" carries the score into it's ending suite in grand style. The other disappointment to the fans' continued frustration of there being a lack of superhero feel to this score. Yes, they add layers onto Begins' \\"Corynorhinus\\" but still a far cry from Elfman's over the top theme. To answer these complaints, it must be reinstated that Nolan traditionally does not have big score or themes for his movies. Just look at David Julyan's barely classified scores for Memento and The Prestige. If you enjoyed Howard's hand in Begins or the more tender moments of Begins, I strongly suggest you avoid buying the entire effort. However, you might want to check out \\"Harvey Two Face\\", \\"Blood on My Hands\\", and \\"Watch the World Burn\\".<br /><br />Therefore if you are heads: 4 stars<br />If you are tails: 2 or 2 ½<br /><br />In the end, this effort will still be seen as a success given to how great the movie will turn out. So why so serious?\\"Why So Serious\\"    Tails: Now comes the disappointment...As mentioned above, James Newton Howard's presence has decreased substantially compared to his collaboration in Begins.

1594489505|5.0|Appreciated the book as much as, if not more than, The Kite Runner. What was most impressive is how he managed to get into the heart, soul, mind of the women, especially Miriam when she had the miscarriage. I've had several miscarriages myself, years ago now, and because he so totally captured the essence of that experience, it brought my own memories back with great clarity. He truly conveyed *from the mother's perspective* that experience and took the reader there (with Miriam). It's not easy to do that with one's *own* experience, much less try to write as a male from a female perspective ... well done, sir!

B000HEWEEE|5.0|This movie is so wonderful. It takes you through an emotional journey. The story is about a man and woman in love that live at a lake house... just not at the same time, two years apart to be exact. They correspond through letters left in the mailbox for each other. An incredible tale unfolds about true love and perfect timing.<br /><br />If you enjoyed The Lake House, then I also recommend Just Like Heaven with Reese Witherspoon, another great love story of timing and fate.
0201721481|5.0|In the last year i had two computer science exams about C++ programming.<br />I had never seriously studied programming before, so i was surprised with almost infinite potentialities of this language.<br /><br />However, modern C++ is a lot different from the one most books try to teach: i've got a lot of C++ books like Deitels' and Schlidt's, but all they offer is a overview of a \\"pre-standard-like\\" C++: a lot of chapters and exercises on arrays, pointers, C-like-strings, just like this was the core of the modern C++ language.<br /><br />This book focuses instead on the things a C++ programmer should know today, his swiss-army-knife: the STL and the standard library. The book introduces vectors and strings first, then compares them with old-fashioned arrays/pointers and char*s.<br />This is not a book about introducing \\"new stuff\\" into the C programming language, but about learning C++ like a whole new language, thus changing the way you approach programming (a lot of other books introduces STL only in the last 2 o 3 chapters!).<br /><br />The only thing i disliked about the book, funny to say, is that while not too long (the fourth edition is about 800 pages long), the book is so full of contents that a newcomer may probably find it overwhelming.<br />Not only it introduces classes and STL in the first chapters, but it also goes in a much deeper level of detail than other books, so if you haven't any programming (and, maybe a little C++) experience, you'll probably be going \\"back and forth\\" searching for concepts and explaination you didn't care too much about (like the notions about constructors given in the first chapter, wich would seem rather abstract if you don't know how a data structure is realized).<br /><br />Anyway, this is one of the best programming books i've ever read: if you are a computer science student, a programmer who wants to learn C++ or a C++ programmer who wants to really understand \\"what's behind the scenes\\", you have to buy this!<br />Ifyou are a novice in programming, this book could make you started with programming in the best way and introduce you to the best programming practices, but it can also scare you in the beginning, so you'd probably want to start elsewhere (probably with Accelerated C++, or C++ Primer Plus).
B000PTYPAC|4.0|i love this CD but the more i listen to it the less excited i am about it for some reason. as great as it is that girls are taking a stand in the music industry, in some bands, a female lead is just an insult to the band. but for paramore, i couldnt imagine a guy singing (especially their lyrics). it may be b/c their lead is a female that the lyrics are the way they are, but paramore wouldnt be paramore w/o hayley. i got to meet her when they played at an imtimate venue in my area b4 the release of RIOT! and she's really cool.
B0000669JL|2.0|great cd if all the tracks worked. I returned the first to amazon because track 7 just stops and won't play. I recieved a replacement and track 7 just stops and won't play. I have to forward it to track 8 to finish listening. My player plays all my other 80 plus cds fine. So the problem is in this cd.
B00132D808|1.0|i wasnt really expecting anything great from them but GOD. this blows beyond any new album that has been released within the past year and a half (w/  a few exceptions). i loved the old CD no matter what anyone said, and i always will. but how did they get so sucky so fast?? like, yeah, w/e i dont mind if they have a few mellow slow songs, that always cool, but why is EVERY song like that?!?!? e[...] i hate this cd.

0743201140|2.0|I have read the book and taken the test. While the concept is sound (focus and develop your strengths, do only damage control on your weaknesses), the test does not reveal anything that could be applicable to my work. Many of the 180 questions are just simply asking you where your strengths are and then telling you the same thing in the result. The applicability of the result is very low. 3 out of 5 of my strenght mean that I like to think, the 4th means that I feel everything is connected (how is that a strenght?) and the 5th is that I like to collect things (ideas, stuff). I don't feel this book and especially the test is worth the money nor the time. On the other hand I would be genuinely interested in hearing from someone who found the test useful in his/her life.
0743290119|2.0|This book was 250 pages long and said nothing in those 250 pages.  I kept waiting for it to get interesting but it never happened. I enjoyed The Devil Wears Prada, found Everyone Worth knowing to be a good read and I have reread both of them several times but I do not think I will be rereading this anytime soon.
0670018651|5.0|This book was a secret vice to me, almost like sneaking exotic candy behind doors, so you will have to share with no one else.  I don't know any of the scientific babble; I only know I love beautiful smells.  The mechanics of them leave me cold, frankly. But...this book was so compelling, and pure fun to read--of course I hurriedly looked up all my favorite scents first, to see how they were rated.  I was thrilled to see some of my favorites with 4 or 5 stars, but nearly reduced to tears (!) to see one of my all-time favorites garner not only a 1, but jeering derision as well. I felt personally stung...but no matter, the reading of the whole thing was still a garden of delight. I actually wrote Luca and Tania a 'fan letter', and I will include some of it here: \\"...due to life-long financial difficulties, I've never been able to access much in the way of expensive perfumes...but your book was the 'unbreak my heart' key to my unrequited love of perfume. I could not embrace my own affair, but I got to look through a peephole at the avid lovers. What a feast! Your lyrical, outrageous, hysterical, insane descriptions spoke to my soul like David's harp--I could almost smell them vicariously....\\"  I did find a website that sells \\"minis\\" and I picked out the ten most delectable scents in the book (to me, by description) and ordered them.  What a banquet of riches.  I am still caught up in smelling them all and deciding daily what I shall wear...oh, heaven!  And I also discovered what will always be my 'signature scent' from this day forward--Tocade. Sweet dreams, perfume lovers.
0385340567|3.0|I've read nearly all of the Jack Reacher books but this isn't one of the better ones.  I thought it started off great but became quite boring in the middle and picked up again toward the end.<br /><br />The constant returning to Despair, CO was weird, the plane missions, the mob scene bizarre.  It was interesting enough to finish but really not that great of a book.
B0007TKNKG|5.0|Over the Top is exactly that, over the top.  The clever title is an obvious double-entendre in that it's a story about arm-wrestling that is completely ridiculous; yet, it somehow manages to be a highly enjoyable movie with real, albeit unanticipated, drama.<br /><br />Amidst the preposterous father-son bonding, in which a borderline mongloid named Hawk (Sylvester Stallone) shares a long-haul trucking get-together with his son, as well as the finer points of arm wrestling - via a pulley system generically rigged up by Hawk (pun intended) - there is one the most comical, unbelievable scenes in movie history.  While stopping for a bite to eat at a greasy spoon diner - in which Hawk's prissy, weakling, snowflake, WASP son preaches about the benefits of health food - Hawk decides that it is high time his son proves his worth and strength via an absurd arm-wrestling match staged between his son and a tough, street kid on top of a pinball machine.  I'll let you be \\"surprised\\" by the outcome.<br /><br />The ultimate arm wrestling showdown seems more like a collection of carnies or psych-ward patients than a group of competitors in an arm wrestling tournament.  There is a pretty good chance that there was no blood testing at the time of this event, and if there were, more than one guy would be found with horse steroids or psychotropic drugs in his system.  The favorite of the competition, Bull Harley, who seems like a villian in a video game because of his epic proportions, probably has stool bigger than Hawk's arms.  Through sheer will and determination, Hawk manages to spin his hat around and channel the energy of 100 suns in order to win the title.<br /><br />I'd feel bad about the spoiler if it weren't so painfully obvious and insignificant.  The pleasure in this movie is the journey, not the destination.  It's a great, mindless movie, and I watch it nearly every time it's on late-night TV.
B0014I4KIK|5.0|After hearing Duffy on NPR, I realized I HAD to get her album, and I didn't regret it. The 10 songs, all of which Duffy co-wrote, combine bluesy tones, soft rhythms, and Duffy's unique voice, which lends a jazzy, emotional quality to the lyrically rich songs. In an age of mass-produced pop songs with tired lyrics and a heavy reliance on synthesizers, Duffy's album provides a much needed organic style that celebrates a voice that, while not too pretty, carries raw emotion and a fun, musical sensitivity right to our ears.
B000KWZ7VU|5.0|If you study every piece before - read more information about each sonata before you list - it gets greater and greater. - I just think the booklet should contain more information than it does. I paid for this package Euros 99,99 in Berlin.

B00005JPLW|5.0|I really like this movive. Yes, a lot of the stuff is not strictly historically correct but it is still a good movie. It has great action and a good message.
B0001O3YD0|5.0|Got the three Riddick movies as a gift and watched all three over the weekend.  I can't believe I liked them so well.  This first movie has beautiful but very bleak desert scenery.  The characters are likeable and interesting, especially the Riddick character.  Much of the movie takes place in the dark, as the title describes.  It is suspenseful and I enjoyed watching it very much.  I was sad that most of the characters didn't make it, but overall I found this to be very well done as far as science fiction.  I liked it every bit as much as the old alien movies, maybe more.
0446402389|5.0|This is one satisfying book!  Smith uses his understanding of post-war Russian society to add additional tension to the plot, without getting caught up in the details.  The metered pace of the book allows you to explore the feelings of the characters as if you were there, but is still quick enough, so as never to \\"plod\\" through.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|I used to own this CD even before it won 8 awards including the Album of the Year in 2005 Grammys. Unfortunately lost it in a rental car from a trip, which is not uncommon I guess. Now I am thrilled to have it back again in my car.
1582701709|5.0|The point of this book is what it can do for you.  And even though it might seem ridiculous, you will never know until you actually try it.  There is no harm in that.  Obviously I've applied the ideas in the book and everything I've wanted has just appeared- I know it sounds impossible, but if I really described my personal situation, you would see that the way the secret works is very simple and logical.  It just makes sense and it works!  I feel bad for people that don't believe in it...they are missing out!
B000063JZQ|1.0|I watched this movie expecting it to be great because of all the good reviews. I maybe to young (27) but this film was very slow hard to understand and very boring. The fight scene at the end looked so cheesy that it made me laugh hysterically. Its not that I dont like old movies because I do. But this movie was just plain BAD. Although the story was interesting, I think that this film should be revisited and should be improved.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|I've been waiting for this movie to come out onto Blu-ray for months.. Amazing movie, great transfer - worth every dollar. The bonus IMAX preview of the Dark knight was pure eye candy.    Note: The region info for this product on Amazon is incorrect. Most of WB's blu-rays are region free. I take my hat off to them for that move.
0143036556|2.0|In Collapse, Jared Diamond utilizes what is on the surface a sound scientific approach to the problems of societies and their eventual collapse. Unfortunately, the focus of this topic is visibly narrow. For his \\"prehistoric\\" examples he used 1,000 year old societies, in addition to more recent ones, and found what he believed to be that all societies were basically inharmonious realities forever striving to coexist with the natural world. Fair enough, but this goes somewhat against common sense. There are certainly examples of simple cultures living relatively harmoniously with nature, even today in South America, despite modern encroachment. Unfortunately, Diamond uses the lens of western civilization to examine the failure of civilization. Truth be told, the greatest underlying cause of collapse is civilization itself and its blood thirsty, energy hungry appetite that always seeks to expand until it collapses. It is apparent that the agricultural revolution changed the landscape of the world deeply. While there are differing reasons for collapse, both on the macro and micro level, it is only that of over-accumulation and destruction of resources that characterize societies that are able to severely alter their own habitats to the point of sudden die-off or collapse with any kind of predictable frequency. In examining human cultures, we must look closely to all of human history and not merely that which dates to the written page (i.e. civilization) leaving out other landscapes of human activity rich with meaning. Where the book excels is at explaining some of the technical processes of societies failing but it is unable to frame the issues in a larger perspective. Writers and anthropologists should not leave important parts of human history simply out of focus, yet this is one of the great sins of the western world, and this book is no exception.
B00008DDRX|5.0|I've been a sportscar racing fan since I was a child. And since my childhood was during the late 1960s and early 1970s, there really isn't any way to explain the impact the onboard footage had upon us back then.    I once raced sportscars as an amateur in the SCCA. There is no way on earth I can tell you what it actually feels like to go \\"out there\\", but at least in this film you can see what it looks like..    Yes, there's no love story...but don't ever say there's no plot. This film is a \\"fictional documentary\\". A study of a very misunderstood sport by a man who loved it so much he just wanted everyone to know what it was really all about. It is our (the racers' \\"our\\") good fortune that this man was a popular actor with enough financial backing behind him to make the attempt.

B00005214X|5.0|The 30th anniversary boxed-set edition was remastered by George Harrison and is much better than the original 1970 release. As a bonus you get a booklet written by George, explaining his views about the old and new versions. Plus, you get bonus tracks not included on the original release.     This was and is George's best solo album and this version is as good as it gets. As you may know, the original recordings made shortly after the Beatles dissolved, featured Eric Clapton, Ringo Starr, Klaus Voorman. Dave Mason, Badfinger, Billy Preston, Ginger Baker, Phil Collins, Bary Brooker and others.     I could go on endlessly trying to explain why this album is great and worth purchasing or repurchasing if you still have the original version. All I can say is, spend the twenty dollars. You will not regret it. This album will last a lifetime. Thank you George. We miss you.

0743298039|5.0|Diane seems a bit out of her time, but in a good way. The book smacks of the Victorian gothics and lives up to their page-turning potential. I coincidentally read [[ASIN:0143034901 The Shadow of the Wind]] immediately after this book and I was amazed at how the same theme with a surprisingly similar result could have such a different, if equally engaging, feel.
B0018AK9RA|5.0|i know there are many judas priest fans out there who thinks this new album is boring or sucks and cant stand the chorus and electrical orchestra ,,but this is a mature priest going back to their earlier music like beyond the realm of death, blood red skies, victim of changes, this is album is a metal journey a story...you could say \\"why couldnt they produce another \\"screaming for vengeance\\" or \\"british steel\\" or \\"defenders of the faith\\" or \\"ram it down\\" or even \\"point of entry\\" but they choose to do this and it is still heavy. There are heavy guitar riffs..and the sound is haunting. i would say this album is a metal verson of \\"pink floyd the wall\\" artistic in form yet keeping the theme dark and mysterious..i have the deluxe copy with the book and the artwork alone is amazing..like 'lenardo da vinci designed it.' it has an ancient look..dont forget this guy Nostradamas was predictor..a prophet who journeyed into the occult and black arts to change his name to Nostradamus..  i enjoyed the cds.  to me as a devoted priest fan and metal fan at heart..it never hurts to explore different avenues as long as it remains haunting in metal..and this record does..it is worth buying. iron maiden did something like this with \\"dance of death\\" or even better \\" a matter of life and death\\" although it was heavier thru and thru..but there are heavy riffs of harmony here with the cords..i give Priest credit for doing this..it is a journey and a journey worth listening too.    priestfan  charlesu  newyork
B000NA1OXY|2.0|Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of Avril. But I heard 'Girlfriend' and I knew that something had gone terribly wrong. I loved 'Let Go' and 'Under My Skin.' It's hard to believe that these are all by the same artist. Complete trash. I hope she'll go back to her old 'style' in the next album. Her career will be a dead end if she continues to release 'music' like this. I don't know why most artists completely change their music by the third album. If you're having so much success with your style as it is, why would you change it? I want my money back.

B0018AK9RA|4.0|I knew I would buy this album before reading the reviews for 2 reasons 1)It is Judas Priest and 2) I heard Nostradamus on their website and rank it as one of their best songs ever. So, why the division here? Here are some of the complaints I have seen.  1) It has keyboards? So what. So did some of the earlier work. Prelude and Epitaph; both from their best album (Sad Wings of Destiny) were essentially all Piano.  2) Production values? Why are people so critical of this lately. I agree it does not have the best production but it is not bad. It gets the job done. Lately, people are being more critical of sound than they are the music.  3) Too many songs....bad songs....? What Judas Priest album did not have bad songs? They all do in my opinion. Are there bad songs on this album? Absolutely. Are there great songs on this album. DEFINITELY! Could the album be trimmed down? Sure. But I didn't exactly pay a lot for this album since it is reasonably priced. You are certainly getting more than a full CD worth of good material here. As far as \\"too many songs\\"? I would suggest not looking at the song counter and just treat the two minute songs as intros to the longer ones (which is really what they are anyone - except for an isolated one or two)  4) Bad lyrics? I laughed when I read this. Noone likes Rob Halford more than me. I even had the pleasure of meeting him in person. But let's be honest, his lyrics were never going to win him any awards. Also, I don't find these lyrics that bad. They are \\"adequate\\" and certainly are appropriate here.   5) Abandoning their past? Actually, I greatly disagree. I find this album to be a perfect mix of old and new. It has the heaviness and the power of the later years and some of the atmosphere of older 70's material. I even found some of the singing to be VERY similar to that found on Stained Class. Anyone else notice this?  6) Vocals? Are some people kidding? I think they are great. He has some awesome screams and while perhaps not as high as past efforts, they fit in nicely and are still better than the grunts and growls that are put out by other vocalists.    I seem to remember people calling Defenders of the Faith   Screaming for Vengeance part 2. Did anyone really want that with this new release?    Personally, I hope they continue to make new albums but if this is their last, it is a good ending.    In a recent magazine review, an excellent point was made. 'Nostradamus is not their greatest CD but it does contain some of their greatest moments' (not exact quote). Give this record a chance.

B00004Z459|5.0|So nearly eight years after its release, Hybrid Theory is still going strong. It is true that some of the lyrics may seem immature or generic, a good example being 'One Step Closer.' This album was directed towards teenagers so we'll ignore that flaw. But, the really special thing about this album is that you can listen to the whole thing without having to skip any song. Each song is catchy and listenable and this is one of the only albums I know that I don't have to skip any songs.  Now I am a big LP fan. A breakdown of all the songs:<br /><br />Papercut: 10/10. Love the rhythm of this song. It talks about someone who is paranoid. Excellent start for the album.<br /><br />One Step Closer: 7/10. Bad choice for the second song. It's listenable, but definitely not a highlight of the album. Don't know why they made it a single.<br /><br />With You: 10/10. Mr. Hahn's talent shines on this. Chester's vocals are amazing here. This should have been a single rather than 'One Step Closer.'<br /><br />Points of Authority: 10/10. One of my favorites when I heard the album. I love the part at the end when Mr. Hahn the DJ mixes up the beat.<br /><br />Crawling: 8/10. Chester's vocals might seem gravelly and annoying after a couple of listens. Not the best, but still good.<br /><br />Runaway: 10/10. Another one of my favorites. I don't know why everyone hates this song! This could even be considered inspirational. This song can easily get you pumped up, especially towards the end.<br /><br />By Myself: 9/10. Has a beat that sounds a bit like 'With You' but still a good song. Mike's and Chester's vocals go together with such harmony in this song, it's very cool.<br /><br />In The End: 10/10. The one and only. With a haunting piano piece and Mike's raps on top this song was sure to be a radio favorite.<br /><br />Place For My Head: 8/10. Just like in 'Crawling', this song might get tiring after a couple of listens. I love the intro of this song. But, Chester's amazing vocal range is clearly displayed in this song.<br /><br />Forgotten: 10/10. Just like in 'By Myself', Chester's and Mike's vocals go together amazingly. My third favorite song off the album.  I love the part at 2 minutes when Mr. Hahn changes up the beat.<br /><br />Cure for the Itch: 10/10. It might get boring for some people, but this song shows how talented Mr. Hahn really is. LP would literally be nothing without him.<br /><br />Pushing Me Away: 7/10. Good, but it leaves you itching for more Linkin Park. This album is too short in my opinion. I wish they had added more songs. But anyways, if you like rap at some limits you will love this album. Hence the title, it is a mix of rap and rock and the product is great. Whenever you're feeling down, this album will definitely help you out. Worth the money.

B0014Z4OQG|3.0|(That's how I talk while the camera's shaking)<br />Thank goodness I saw this on my 37\\" LCD.  The big screen experience would have been awful for 2 reasons;<br />1. The infamous shaky cam would have been unbearable.<br />2. Its not good enough to pay theater prices.<br />On the small screen the shaking camera can get annoying but is not such a big deal.  I thought the film was just OK and here's why:<br /><br />-C-C-COOL M-M-MONSTERS<br />Why monsters are trending towards superfluous limbs, I don't know (see \\"The Host\\").  Regardless, this beasty is pretty impressive in his (her?) 10 minutes of screen time.  It's in these scenes that the shaky cam is at its most effective.  It looks so real and feels like many nightmares I've had of giant creatures invading my neighborhood.  The parasites you may have heard about (the beasty scrapes them off on buildings like a bear on an oak) are equally terrifying.  In their 5 minutes of screen time, we learn so much about them and what we learn is horrific.  So add it up and you get 15 minutes of monsters.  Not nearly enough, but what we get is pretty darn creepy.<br /><br />-S-S-SILLY P-P-PEOPLE<br />I'm not sure what scared me more; the beasties or spending 55 minutes alone with these stupid people who are passed off as the main characters.  The camera man is a complete dope (though he has genius enough to record everything while keeping his battery alive).  He later develops a personal relationship with the beasty.  The films hero is a whiney drip who risks all for his love; ok, I'll go with it.  I'm not cutting the same slack to his stupid friends though.  Let him go and save his girl, you will only be a hindrance (trust me).  Of course, they can't hear me and they will be sorry!  If you don't believe anyone else then you must believe me; THESE PEOPLE SUCK!!!  We see way too much of them and they are not at all interesting people.  Of course, this lends to the believability of the film.<br /><br />-B-BRIDGES AND B-BUILDINGS<br />There is a scene on a bridge that is very convincing and very creepy.  It looks all too real.  I have not heard much mention of the actual destruction of New York specifically, but I was impressed with how realistic it looked.  The ruined cityscape in Cloverfield is one of the most convincing I've seen.  There are definitely some redemptive qualities in the effort.<br /><br />-V-V-VERDICT<br />Since I watched the rental, I am considering buying this (when it costs around $6).  The only reason I would buy it would be to see the monsters and some interesting destruction scenes.  I would not care to watch most of the human relationship aspects of this film; they are painfully boring and comprise about 60% of the film.

B00007GZR5|5.0|Before I wrote this, I read around a few of the other posted reviews here and at the IMDB,( Internet Movie Database ) and what I read surprised me. There are obvious religious arguements to be made in the absense of \\"God\\" in the afterlife, and after death having the abillity to continue to move our fate forward in the afterlife for a better end result. Anyway you slice it this movie will react with the viewer in a powerful way, and it will be different for everyboby. Example, I would feel much different viewing the loss of children perhaps if I wasn't a parent myself, and could agonize with the uncomprehensible loss of a child, for me events like that have impact. The loss of your own life in the middle of busy life events due to a split second tragedy, leaving those behind crazy for your loss...and the guilt you would feel if you could experience what your death did to the lives of the ones you leave behind. This film really is not supposed to be Heaven or Hell, just what momments of your own personal relationships and memories could best describe your own individual \\" forever \\" if you could take it all with you. I think Robin Williams and the whole cast is wonderful, viseral and heartbreaking and they will touch you and make you think, the artificial worlds they inhabit are nothing short of breathtaking. this movie is really an examination of the life of a couple and a family and where these lives end up forever when life on earth is done, and ultimately it's a wonderful conclusion. Very highly recomended.
0316236535|5.0|My son just turned four and loves monsters.  This book is adorable and fun.  A great easy read before bed.
B0000028RR|5.0|I have long been a fan of Rage Against The Machine as they are pretty much my favorite rock group ever.  Just with the way the mesh hardcore rock with influences of rap pulled me in from the first time I heard one of their records back in the mid 90s.  As you look back, you realize they are one of the pioneers in that sort of genre that has led to groups like maybe a Limp Bizkit and most definitely a Linkin Park (who is another one of my favorite groups).  And the fact that their anger is built out of frustration and oppression from what they feel comes from the government is another fact that made me fall in love with their music and the group itself.  Therefore, I had long been in the looks for the first album which it seemed I could never get my hands on.  It had almost become like a white unicorn.  Then finally just recently I discovered that we had a couple copies in our stockroom at the job I work out and was like I have to have this.  I had heard a few if not half the songs on the album, but the album in its entirety.  After playing the CD for days, I have been knocked off my feet and blown away.  This whole album is like one big fireball and can't help but want to be standing in the way of it being thrown at you.    The around hour-long CD has intensity that is off the charts, nothing like I have ever heard before.  Zack De La Rocha grabs your attention as the frontman with ever-scathing lyrics that locks your ears and hooks in your minds to think.  Not only does he have some great lyrical ability in his arsenal that can rival some of these rappers today, he has content that goes has him go out on a plank and dive into an ocean/current that few musical artists back then or today are willing to risk.  And that has him and the group fight back against the government.  And if his yelling through the mic cannot get through to you, I don't know what can.  I don't pretend to be a guitar expert, but the sounds that Tom Morello makes with his are RIDICULOUS!!  One minute it sounds like alarms going off, next minute it sounds like he is mixing and scratching like a DJ, then making it sound like some crazy machine (like a computer uploading or something, kind of hard to describe).  The riffs and solos are insane!  Inventive, innovative and creative.  Those are the words that come to mind when you hear Morello's guitar on these songs.  And just downright sick!  I don't know how most would rank the guitarists from all these different phases and times of rock (with the Jimi Hendrix and all the other various groups over time or even just solo artists), but I would have to think in my view that Tom Morello has to be up in the top eschelon of them all.  And cannot forget about Brad Wilk and Tim C on the drums and bass setting the tone and background for these songs.  The way they can just belt out hard sounds for that whole raging effect, then go low and quiet/soft only to build it back up like anger boiling to the surface to match Zack's emotions is tremendous!  All these guys bring an element that just make this group truly one of a kind.    From the chorus saying, \\"Burn, burn, yes you're gonna burn,\\" from the opening Bombtrack is like pouring gasoline all over and getting the fuse ready and saying get ready for this.  Killing In The Name is one of there more widely-known songs, probably more for the fact that it is one of those rebellious songs aimed at the authority figures of this society in which Zack just puts it plainly, \\"F you, I won't do what you tell me!\\"  Take The Power Back is telling you how the lies that we have been fed and the structural base of this country has held most of us back for generations and now it is time to rip that power back from them and take control.  Which leads into Settle For Nothing, knowing that we (as a whole) deserve much better than what we are getting and not settling for nothing less than that.  Bullet In The Head is an extremely powerful track that explains how a lot of us are braindead tothe fact that we don't think for ourselves (like we get a bullet in our head).  Know Your Enemy is explaining to us to recognize who the true enemy is, not only the government but the American ways/methods that some use to get to the American Dream.  Wake Up, self-explanatory track and one you may have heard by now.  A song challenging (and from Zack's view, screaming) at you to wake up from sleeping and dreaming the American Dream and realize what is truly going on in how we have been blinded from the fact in how the government is dirtier than anyone and the how they have deflected any responsibility in the deaths of King and Malcolm X (from Zack's perspective).  This whole song from the words he speaks to him yelling at you at the end makes you take a step back.  Fistful of Steel has become my favorite track off this whole album.  Tom's guitars sound creepy, but fun at the same time and Zack is using a mic as a fistful of steel to get through to you using it's power instead of a gun (words have incredible power).  Township Rebellion... you think of a township, you think of a quiet part of a neighborhood/city where things seem to be all well and good, all fine and dandy (which equates to this country in some ways).  This group is saying definitely not the case and it's time to rebel against it all.  When I hear Freedom, all that comes to mind is William Wallace (Mel Gibson) from Braveheart when he yells at the end,\\"Freeeddooommmmmm!!!\\"  This is one thing we all long for, the freedom for anything in our lives- whether its the choice to be what we want to be, the choice to speak our minds freely or anything of the nature and with it not being restricted or bucked against.  I find it fitting that at the end of the song, the group ends it with the instruments making all types of noises like a machine going haywire and overloading.  I see as a symbol as us breaking free and putting the country/government (the machine) spiraling out of control and overcoming it.  That was an ingenious way to bring the whole album to a close.    This album came out in 1992, and I can feel what they are trying to get through to people back then now in 2008.  That is just incredible when you think about it.  How what they said 16 years ago can relate to what is going on now (And OH HOW IT CAN!).  The whole late 80s-early 90s era brought some incredible music and groups when it came to rock.  Guns N Roses, Pearl Jam, Metallica, Nirvana, Red Hot Chili Peppers and most definitely Rage Against The Machine with this time-standing debut.  I totally feel like that group came along at the right time with at being at the end of the first Bush era, but was ahead of it's time also with how things are now with this Bush Administration.  I'm not real heavy into politics, but it doesn't take a genius to see how screwed-up the economy and this country is all thanks to Bush and his crew.  And I do have my views.  Rock and all of us needed a group like Rage Against The Machine to say the things most of us may not have the courage to say (a la the movie Talk To Me if I can borrow from that).  And they just didn't talk it, they acted and tried to change things.  That is major when you talk and do instead of just talk.  This group would have a field day with issues to talk about in today's society and you can only wish they were around now.  I feel like no one has really filled that void they left behind once they fractured.  But I have to thank them for what they gave us through the 90s, including their first piece of work.  Rage lives on 4ever!

B0002KQNJU|2.0|This is a flick I remember seeing at the local drive-in as the 4th feature of a monthly horror night. By the time it was shown, our packed car was sound asleep, except for me, but it was definitely worth staying awake. I thought this was the funniest and weirdest movie around, and probably the only comedy-horror-adventure movie featuring two gorgious women and dozens of very, very stupid jokes. I've been looking for it on VHS and DVD for several decades now, so I plunked down my $15 without even thinking about it.     Ooops! Like I say, that was 40 years ago, and a lot has changed. Principal change? Not funny anymore. Even the single best line ('Oy, have YOU got the wrong vampire') wasn't even all that great...absolutely hilarious in memory - on the TV screen? Uhhh, not so much. And while the Count's son was so extraordinarily fey back in the sixties, again, today? Not nearly so much..........     A lot was made of the fact that this was Sharon Tate's last movie before being murdered. For that, it's probably worth existing as a historical document on a library shelf, and that is precisely where my copy's headed. My plan is to donate it to the local bibliothèque in the hope that it will spare some other poor unfortunate soul from purchasing what is now pretty much a P.O.S.     As a movie I give it one star, as a piece of history, two.
6305558167|5.0|All in all, and after watching several recent versions and variations on the topic of Arthurian legends, Boorman's 1981 movie remains an almost perfect combination of script, acting, photography, and music. He takes the legend simply to an epic tale. I highly recommend this over any other of its kind. About the DVD itself, the NTSC version that I own provides a standard picture format only. I recently got a PAL version that is widescreen and the difference is meaningful, particularly when it comes to scenes such as the magnificent ending of the movie.
B00005YUNY|5.0|[[ASIN:B00005YUNY Yes - Symphonic Live]] is a videotaped presentation of a wonderful 2001 Yes concert in it's entirety at the intimate Heineken Music Hall in Amsterdam. The European Festival Orchestra provides the symphonics, and their stimulating sound complements Yes' music in no less than perfect form. What a night this was for the Yes fans who were there!<br /><br />And what a concert DVD this is!<br /><br />The picture and sound quality on this is as good as I've ever seen, and everything else about this concert DVD is just as good. No, wait... Perfect! This is perfect! The members of the band all look healthy and inspired, and they're playing their music as well as they ever have. The lineup for the this show includes:<br /><br />Jon Anderson<br />Chris Squire<br />Steve Howe<br />Alan White<br />Tom Brislin<br /><br />The lightly-bearded Anderson's vocal performance is excellent, and his between-song stage banter is interesting and gracious. Guitarists will enjoy watching Steve Howe expertly play a wide range of stringed instruments including a flat steel and classical guitars. Chris Squire energetically moves all over the stage while playing his mighty bass, and a fit-looking Alan White works his drum kit with a friendly smile on his face for most of the night. And Tom Brislin? He's the young and very capable keyboardist who's jumps and animated arm motions add even more enthusiasm and showmanship to the production.<br /><br />The professional multi-colored lightshow includes fog and animation, and the effect is captivating at times. There are many different camera angles used, and sometimes it even feels as if you're right on the stage.<br /><br />The European Festival Orchestra musicians are young, mostly female and very attractive. They get plenty of camera time, and it's fun to watch them lip-synch the lyrics and bob their heads in time with the music. They even worked out some choreography to go along with a few of the songs. Their sound adds plenty to the concert and everybody seems to be having a great time, especially the appreciative audience.<br /><br />The music is mostly from the classic Yes years, but they also perform songs from their symphonic studio album, [[ASIN:B00005NWMK Magnification]], which was new at the time. They open the show with Close To The Edge, and it sounds just as great as it always has. It's hard to single out just one highlight from this show of many highlights. For me, it's And You And I, but Starship Trooper, The Gates Of Delirium and Ritual are all fantastic, too. Steve Howe does a classical guitar solo that includes Mood For A Day, and that's also enjoyable. The show closes with Roundabout, and the girls in the orchestra set down their instruments and dance in a chorus line on the stage behind the band. It's a lot of fun, and the apparently surprised Yesmen love it.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00005YUNY Yes - Symphonic Live]] is a remarkable Yes visual experience.

The music is mostly from the classic Yes years, but they also perform songs from their symphonic studio album, [[ASIN:B00005NWMK Magnification]], which was new at the time. They open the show with Close To The Edge, and it sounds just as great as it always has. It's hard to single out just one highlight from this show of many highlights. For me, it's And You And I, but Starship Trooper, The Gates Of Delirium and Ritual are all fantastic, too. Steve Howe does a classical guitar solo that includes Mood For A Day, and that's also enjoyable. The show closes with Roundabout, and the girls in the orchestra set down their instruments and dance in a chorus line on the stage behind the band. It's a lot of fun, and the apparently surprised Yesmen love it.    [[ASIN:B00005YUNY Yes - Symphonic Live]] is a remarkable Yes visual experience.

B000002HJD|5.0|Jim Morrison's poetry can obviously seem pretty ridiculous, but this album rules.  Morrison was not by any means a poet in the traditional literary sense; to consider him as such is really unfair and inappropriate.  As the lead singer of a rock band he was more of a performance artist and that's reflected here.  His voice and the instrumentation work very well together to create a vivid, unique sonic journey (as cheesy as that sounds, it's the only way I can describe this album).  It's a necessary experience for any true music fan.  Listen to it from beginning to end with an open mind and it's a lot of fun.  I can appreciate that a lot of what Morrison wrote can be perceived as pretty nuts and at times flat out juvenile, but it all still works big time for me.  I think it's because he really meant it.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I am a Star Trek TNG, Babylon, DS9, Voyager, BSG diehard.  Firefly is amazing.  It's taken me this long to see the series and I wish that I had seen it back when it was actually relevant to try and save the series.  Even though a lot of questions are left unanswered, the series is well worth watching especially the 'making of' clips at the end.   Sometimes you watch a series or movie and you can see that the actors are having fun and enjoying working with each other and in the scene.  Firefly is one of those shows and is absolutely awesome to watch.
B0000AMRJD|3.0|After his renowned roles in the Godfather movies and Serpico, I can't believe Al Pacino agreed to star in this truly sub-par melodrama. I finally got around to watching the entirety of this \\"influential\\" \\"masterpiece\\" and was surprised at how bad it really was. That's not to say it's unwatchable. It's not boring and Al Pacino is entertaining as he overacts the hell out of a one-dimensional role. But it's no cinematic masterpiece either. All it is is mental cotton candy. In fact, this is basically a clone of those low quality Mexican gangster movies from the 70s that you see on Telemundo when you're flipping channels: posturing Latino criminals who shoot and kill, shoot and kill. This is supposed to be a classic? It should tell you something about its shallowness that its biggest fans remain 13 year old boys and crotch-grabbing hip-hop morons. If you don't feel like thinking and just want to indulge in some vicarious, over-the-top violence, then you'll enjoy Scarface, because that's all this movie offers. But please spare me the embarrassing accolades about it being anything more than a poorly-made and silly generic shoot-em-up.
0307388840|4.0|All right, here are reasons to read, or not read, Atonement, depending on what your preferences are. The bad news first.<br /><br /> What you may not like:<br />1. While Ian McEwan does wonderful things with imagery (see below), it becomes a bit much at times, especially when he is detailing landscapes.<br />2. If you are not one who enjoys reading a novel that takes place on the battlefront, beware. About eighty pages center around a character's (who is a soldier) trek through France as it is being attacked by the Germans. 3. Having questions that you don't feel are being resolved. And I'm not just talking about the ending; throughout the novel I felt slightly frustrated at times that I was being left out. Granted, that's how life works, you're not always privy to every piece of information.<br />4. The last section seemed rushed, to me. On one level, I felt McEwan was trying to hurry up and tidy up the novel, but I again felt left out of the loop in some regards.  The premise for the last section was interesting, though, I just had a problem with the execution.<br /><br />What you may like:<br />1. Ian McEwan is an outstanding writer. He develops interesting, multi-faceted characters, beautiful descriptions and an intriguing plot. His writing isn't generic or typical of the genre; you can tell his syntax is carefully crafted, he's trying to create something more than just words on a page.<br />2. There is definitely a feeling of drama to this novel. You have love, rape, lies, war, injury and redemption all in one novel. Because of McEwan's style, it's drama that flows and weaves between characters, places and time periods.<br />3. The two main female characters, who are sisters, are strong, independent women who refuse to rely on their wealthy parents.  Their mother is a perfect contrast; not as modern as her daughters, she doesn't understand their desire to become educated and explore the world.<br />4. The male characters are a diverse sample. There's rich and poor, motivated and unmotivated, honest and deceitful, kind and malicious.<br />5. The concept of justice isn't unrealistically portrayed. Unfortunately, the wealthy often prevail, although that doesn't mean there's no hope for the common man.<br /><br />All in all, I recommend it!nd deceitful, kind and malicious.   5. The concept of justice isn't unrealistically portrayed. Unfortunately, the wealthy often prevail, although that doesn't mean there's no hope for the common man.    All in all, I recommend it!
B000002C25|5.0|Some reviews here state that this album initially had negative reviews.  This couldn't be further from the truth.  Oasis were all over MTV, Rolling Stone, etc. during the lead-up to their third album, and the initial reviews were of high praise.  [...]And let's not forget that in their homeland, the album accounted for two-thirds of ALL music sold for the entire WEEK it came out.  Simply put, very few people were listening to anything else.    It seemed kind of cool at first to have an expanded album; 72 minutes of pure mayhem, starting out with D'You Know What I Mean? - Noel's anti-Wonderwall track which helped hype the album ahead of its release, and one of their best songs of all time.  My Big Mouth continued with the wall of sound, while being concise in relation to the other tracks at about five minutes, and Fade In-Out - though too long, a problem with many tracks on the album - was a truly unique Oasis track.  But after the initial buzz wore off, people realized that seven minutes of Magic Pie was a bit much.  It's Gettin' Better (Man!!!) was a great four-minute song in the body of a seven-minute song; chorus after chorus, solo after solo, it just got worse as the album wound down.  Unfortunately, Noel had relegated some of his best music as B-sides which would wind up in obscurity for casual fans - check out the All Around The World single to hear some of their best work from the period.    Despite its flaws - obviously a cocaine album, and Noel admitted at the time he didn't take any creative chances (\\"it's pub rock\\", he said at the time) - this album still takes me back to a great time, eleven years later.  This was the height of Brit-pop, and yet The Verve hadn't even released Urban Hymns yet.  As the summer turned to fall of 1997, people began moving on to other bands and looking for the next best thing, as Brit-pop had overstayed its welcome with one too many near-breakups, cancelled tour dates, and hubris from these bands, let alone the tabloid drama.This isn't to say that great music wasn't made in Britain after 1997 - I still think this album holds up well against the other albums of its time.  Be Here Now caught Oasis, and the music world, at a very particular place in time; the sound and the length of the album remain true to that.  After Noel realized the drugs truly didn't work, it took a couple of albums for them to regain their footing, but after 2005's Don't Believe The Truth, a cleaned-up Oasis is ready to storm back with 2008's Dig Out Your Soul, which is receiving a lot of early praise.    No matter what Oasis do next or sound like five years from now, this album will always be in my playlist due to the time capsule it has become for those of us who loved good rock music back in the heyday of Britpop.
B000OT6V00|5.0|This review is for the Blu-Ray version of this film.  I really like this film and the transfer is the best I have seen.
0937381888|5.0|I originally read the first edition of this book on his website for free.  If you can't lay hands on this book, it's well worth it to get what information you can from this book at [...]<br /><br />However, if you're a budding zymurgist, or even if you've been brewing for a couple years, this book is well worth the piddly amount they're charging for it.  It's saved my butt a couple of times when I've discovered I was low on a certain type of grain or on priming sugar.<br /><br />Papazian is good, and there are several other books that are good to augment your library, but if you're going to get one book, I highly recommend this one.<br /><br />Easy to read, informative....it'll help you brew some seriously tasty brews.

B000T9OP7G|5.0|Brian Austin Green(BH90210) as Kyle Reeses brother. Never would I have thought of him in this role, or in any other roles  that he cant play a teenager anymore, but here he is superb. He plays his disdain and mistrust of the Cyborgs with the needed restraint. The series does try to fill in the blanks by giving up background, with appearances by Bruce Davison as the former Tuscadero Psychiatrist, who has lost his mind and become a believer in Judgement day in the worst of fanatical ways.       The police inspector who like Inspector Gerard, starts thinking that maybe there is a one armed man after all. Great performane by the actor in this role.    As far as the female terminator, I guess others have seen her in other movies but this was my first encounter with her on the sceen and at first I thought, great, Jailbait Terminator. But she grows on you. She is scary and cold.  The freakiest scene is where she is looking for the parter of the Turk computer creater who is also in trouble with the Russian Mob. She walks out of the room to the stairwell just as the button men show up.    That scene of the Terminator walking down the steps, not in a hurry,  totally oblivious to the gunshots and cries for mercy from the partner and his sister in the room she just left me freaked.      And maybe its just an opinion. But the Terminators being sent at this timeline seem really stupid and have none of the logic and sense of direction that the T-101 or T-800. Opening up fire in a class room full of kids does not help your mission priority.    Overall heres to a great second season and good luck to all us Term fans and hope we will see T4 asap.
B0010X745K|2.0|This was a great ride...until the end. Ups and downs. Loops. Thrills and chills. Great acting, writing, and directing. But an ending that goes against the grain suddenly and violently with minutes to go does that in. Just like going on a great roller coaster ride, but your friend sitting beside you falls out at the end and is killed. The ride may have been great, but the horrible ending ruins what was one a great thing. That's all you can remember.<br /><br />Just like \\"SAW\\", if it doesn't make sense in and of itself, then of course your surprised.<br /><br />Oh, well. We still have the outstanding written work.
0399230033|5.0|There's so very much for young children to see, learn and imagine in this wonderful book, Good Night Gorilla. The illustrations are as wonderful as the text, suggesting the feelings of the characters as the silly and exciting story progresses.<br /><br />Every child will be tickled by the idea of all the zoo animals following the zoo keeper back to his little house, much to the surprise of his wife. All the animals in this book are sweetly detailed, and will keep your child coming back to Good Night Gorilla over and over again.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|This organizer is perfect! It fits my Maclaren stroller and can be moved over to my jogging stroller, if need be. It fits a cell phone, car keys, crackers, a sippy cup and a venti latte, no problem. I don't even have to take it off when I collapse my stroller. Good quality, simple and works great!
1563890119|5.0|I think my title to this little review says it all.  I've read Marvel comic works by Neil Gaiman before, and I have also read his novel \\"American Gods\\".  This blows them away.  It also blows all other comics that I have read out of the water as well.  This may anger some people, but it's even better than Moore's \\"Watchmen\\" and any of the fine works by Miller and others.  This first volume of Sandman was not just a comic to me.  It was like a gift that Gaiman gave to the world.  He may not have created Morpheus, but he crafted him and gave him life.  The same is true with his little sister Death, who he actually may have invented, I'm not sure, and Cain and Able, the House of Mystery and the House of Secrets.  I am talking really heartfelt stuff here.  It's creepy, it's beautiful, it's haunting, it's lovely, it's painful, it's romantic, it's gothic, it's modern, the list could go on and on.  It's just Gaiman at his best and I am really looking forward to enjoying the rest of the series.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes good literature.  Because that's what this is here. It's not just a comic, it's a graphic novel.  A story told with words and pictures.  The art is fantastic as well, but even without it, I feel that Gaiman still could have created a gem here.  Five billion thumbs up.  Peace and Love,  Jake
B0010ZR160|4.0|A couple years ago \\"Crash\\" got all kinds of accolades but although I enjoyed it I wasn't nearly as impressed as I am with \\"Gone Baby Gone\\". I give this four and a half stars which I don't give many dramas. Maybe it's because this is truly gritty and it just feels far more realistic and less made up. Add to that this has excellent acting and story and you have probably one of the best dramas you will see for awhile. When a baby or small child is kidnapped most communities gather to help. We see that unfold in this story. A small detective agency, a local young man and his girlfriend, have had some success in finding kids. The grandmother of the child pleads with them to investigate the case. They decide to try and tackle this media overblown kidnapping. The local police aren't happy about outside involvement but allow it to placate the family. However, what we may not expect are the twist and turns this investigation uncovers even after the case has gone cold. Well worth at least a rental. Good quality DVD with good replayability. If you enjoyed this catch \\"The Departed\\", \\"Cellular\\", and \\"American History X\\". - C. Luster
B001CD6FKI|5.0|I can understand why some people might dislike this movie (just look at its box-office) but the one undeniable fact is that it perfectly captures the spirit of the TV show which was never really associated with profound human feelings. It's amazing how everyone involved in it simply decided to give it their all. Just look at the conviction with which Susan Sarandon and John Goodman recited lines that clearly feel out of a cartoon. Usually I hate movies with quick cuts and gratuitous CG effects and SPEED RACER is 135 minutes of quick cuts and CG so I guess nostalgia goes a long way. I was so glad they included the sound effect of the Mach 5 jumping over and over again. My only real complaint about the movie is that there was a little bit too much of the chimp for my taste.<br />I can't blame anyone for complaining on leaving the theater with a headache. The world outside the theater I saw SPEED RACER in looked so slow once the movie ended, this is one exhausting film but certainly worth it.
B001CB8NQE|5.0|This episode is by far one of the best yet for this amazing show. When SG-1 concluded, I thought that I would go into withdrawls, but Atlantis easily fills that void. Don't get my wrong, no one could ever replace the members out of Chyanne Moutain, but the crew from the Atlantis expedition have done an amazing job of drawing me in. This epidsode has amazing action scenes and from the beginning to the end, I was on the edge of my seat wondering how they were going to get out of this one. Bravo to the creators for starting off the new season with a bang (literally-one more wraith ship gone!) However, I do have a feeling that Micheal made his escape, afterall, if he died, who would they go after next? Kudos to McKay for delivering the baby, it just goes to show that he can be a true hero as well,and did Kennan escape with Sheppard on the dart, we will have to wait and find out next week, same stargate time, same stargate channel.
0571172954|5.0|In her most playful and exuberant novel, Virginia Woolf writes the \\"historical biography\\" of Orlando, a young boy of nobility during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. A wild ride through four centuries, the novel shows Orlando aging, magically, only thirty-six years between 1588 and 1928. Even more magically, he also changes from a man to a woman. As she explores Orlando's life, Woolf also explores the differing roles of men and women in society during various periods, ultimately concluding that one's role as a man or woman is determined by society, rather than by birth.<br /><br />From the Elizabethan period, during which Orlando works as a steward for the queen and also serves as her lover, he progresses to the reign of James I, experiencing a profound love for a Russian princess, Sasha, who is herself exploring the role of a man. An interlude in which he is wooed by the Archduchess Harriet/Archduke Harry leads to his ambassadorship to Constantinople, a period spent with the gypsies, and his eventual return to England--as a woman. New experiences and observations await her there.<br /><br />Throughout the novel, Woolf matches her prose style to the literary style of the period in which Orlando lives, creating always-changing moods and sheer delight for the reader. Some constants continue throughout the four centuries of Orlando's life. Orlando is always a writer, always recording his thoughts, and always adding to a poem he has begun as a child entitled \\"The Oak Tree.\\" He is always returning to his 365-room house whenever he needs to recuperate from his experiences, and some characters repeat through time.<br /><br />Literary historians make much of the fact that Woolf modeled Orlando on Vita Sackville-West, Woolf's lover, and that this study of gender roles was an early exploration of lesbianism, bisexuality, cross-dressing, and transgender identities. The novel is pure fun to read, however, and though it raises serious and thoughtful questions about sexuality and the ways that it controls our lives, there is no sense that Woolf wrote the novel specifically to make a public statement or prove a point. Her themes of gender and its relation to social expectations, of imagination and its relation to reality, of the importance of history in our lives, and of the unlimited potential of all humans, regardless of their sex, transcend the specific circumstances under which Woolf may have written the book. A playful and delightful novel, which broke new ground with its publication.

0670020745|5.0|In addition to all the implications for science and patient care that other reviewers have mentioned, this book has fascinating implications for spirituality as well. The author's experiences during and after her stroke, when she loses much of her 'logical' left-brain functions, and is plunged into her 'intuitive' right-brain perceptions, are downright mystical.  She describes being outside of time and space, feeling herself connected to everyone and everything around her as a field of energy, and engulfed in an incredible bliss. Her experience seems to indicate that meditation and other contemplative practices are actually tools for quieting our left-brain activity and fully experiencing our right brain aspects. While this is hardly a new concept, this book explores it from a more personal perspective than has been done before.

0790729644|5.0|When I first saw this film, I have to admit I thought it was good, but not great.  Further viewings (including a recent one) have made me changed my mind and hang my head in shame.  This is one of the greatest Westerns ever made, and one of Eastwood's crowning achievements as a filmmaker and as an actor.<br /><br />The film is uncommonly dark, even for an Eastwood film.  It starts off with a brutal rape scene, and ends with a shootout.  The cinematography is masterful, arguably the best in any Eastwood film.  Eastwood's character, Billy, is really trying to go straight after spending a lifetime of killing, whoring, and maiming.  His wife is dead, his farm is failing, and he's worried about his children.  He gets a chance to get some money, but he has to find and kill the people who raped and beat up(and got away with it) a prostitute at the beginning of the film.  Over the course of the film, Eastwood's quest becomes more brutal and darker, concluding in what has to be the best, most brooding scene in all of Eastwood's work.  The final scene takes place in the bar/brothel where the rape/assault took place.  The scene starts in a wide shot, then you see Eastwood's rifle make an entrance, but it's only his rifle.  It's a brilliant entrance, one of the greatest in Western movie history, and the concluding shootout is as menancing and as cruel as the West could be.<br /><br />This film won Eastwood his first Oscar, and it's a film that deserved all its accolades.  Most Best Picture Oscar winners are rather safe and tame films, but this is one of the exceptions where an uncommonly dark film swept the awards.  It also rejuvinated Eastwood's career a bit.  He had just directed and starred in The Rookie, a film that is considered his worst film by mostly everyone, including fans (for the record, it's not that bad of a film.  Pink Cadillac is Clint's worst movie).  The Rookie was a box office and critical bomb.  So when this film appeared, it really brought Eastwood back, and he's been there ever since.  Unforgiven is considered one of the greatest Westerns ever made, and deservedly so.<br /><br />For the record, buy the 2 disc special edition DVD, not the single disc edition.  The single disc edition (which is thankfully out of print) is a very poor edition, with an unremarkable, grainy transfer, no special features, and a bizarre scene selection menu that is impossible to navigate.  The 2 disc edition has an excellent transfer of the film, several excellent documentaries, including one where we see Clint making his vastly underrated 1997 film Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, and an episode of Maverick with Clint in a supporting role.there ever since.

0810994739|5.0|I never know whether my son will like a book that I choose for him, or whether he would discard the book and return to his favorit addiction - his Nintendo DS.  Diary of a Wimpy Kid arrived when I was at my office, and I gave him permission to open the Amazon package in that I knew what was inside.  By the time I arrived home from my office, my son had not only begun reading the book, but he had actually finished the book!!  His sitter stated that he pushed aside his video games and his Wii to read the book, cover to cover!!     Needless to say, I am thrilled with the book, my eight year old son enjoyed the story and the interation between the main character and his older brother.  He had never read a book written as a \\"diary,\\" and I was pleased with the way he adapted to the format.  My son asked me whether there were more \\"Diary\\" books, so I also purchased the next book in the series.  I highly recommend the book to anyone with a mature eight to 12 year old child in mind.  (Is that an oxymoron?)

It wouldn't be a sell out to carry a backpack with a week's worth of underwear, maybe a couple of clean shirts.  Reacher is too sharp intellectually to just wander for YEARS with no destination.    The frenetic back & forth between Hope & Despair was bizarre.
B000GY729M|4.0|I can't say I was a fan until I saw the Killers in concert on their 'Sam's Town' tour.  That really made me go back and listen to their material with a bit more interest.<br /><br />Save three songs, I think this disk is extremely solid.<br /><br />At first I was put off by the Springsteen-esque riffs in \\"When You Were Young\\", but they really make them work.  And though I loved \\"Bones\\" when it first came out, I think I overplayed it a bit.  It's still good, I just overdid did it.<br /><br />But I am a huge fan of the title track and actually almost all the songs. I can do without \\"Uncle Johnny\\", \\"Bling\\" and \\"My List\\".  They are the three that keep this from being a 5-star disk.<br /><br />I even like the \\"Enterlude\\" and \\"Exitlude\\" - though like others, I think it would have kind of made more sense for the former song to be the first cut....but that's hardly a big thing.
B0019HQIFE|5.0|Having been born in the middle of the last century my guitar heros have all been the usual suspect, Clapton, Hendrix, Page, Beck etc. but I am encouraged by the work of this young man and his guitar. In the midst of a myriad of dance bands and pretty faces covering other peoples music it is truly refreshing to see an excellent singer/songwriter of John Mayer's caliber putting out CD after CD that seem to get better as he matures. This DVD show him in three different settings; solo, with just his guitar and michrophone, then with his trio of ace session players Pino Paladino on bass and the amazing Steve Jordan on drums, and lastly he segues into his full eight piece band. The videography is tastfully done in the vain of the Band's Last Waltz, with John talking to the camera in between sets.  All in all an excellent video that's well worth the time and money.

B000005IU2|5.0|I could and almost did start this review by stating the obvious.  This is   what rock and roll should sound like.  We have 4 marginally talented  musicians (@ that time anyway) playing with tremendous heart and creative  desire.  This along with the debut was the prototype for every punk record  ever.  Hell, some punk bands made whole careers just rewriting one of these  songs over and over again.  This is what separates Iggy from punk.  Iggy  wanted to make rock and roll records and it came out Iggy.  Punk bands wanted to make Iggy records and they came out punk.
B000OY8NII|4.0|The first season of Eureka is funny, charming, and a little frustrating.  The show is funny and charming because of the delightfully quirky characters and their interactions, which are far more reasonable than one generally finds on this type of show.  The frustration comes with the introduction of major plot lines that are then just dropped, or barely dealt with, such as the information that one or more of the core characters may be acting against the interests of the community. The threat is introduced and then left by the wayside.  Another frustration comes from the teen-aged daughter who is interchangeable with every other annoying teen that you have ever seen on television.   That said, the other characters make sense within the universe that the writers have created, they have depth as people, their own agendas and a reason for being where they are and acting as they do (motivations that are missing from many television characters).  I think that even people who are not particularly fond of science fiction will enjoy this program and I highly recommend it to everyone.
0440238153|2.0|Mrs. Coulter was such a wonderful character in the first two books, because as a reader you truly hate her, and can't wait to find out what happens to her. Then in the third book she has a personality shift ... is it real? Another lie? And then Pullman doesn't let us see her demise, we merely hear about it second-hand, as if it were of little importance. Wha' happened?
B001AUEMFS|5.0|A song with a Spanish title ('Viva La Vida' is literally 'Live the Life' in English.) based on a Spanish painting of the same name.    It's accepted meanings range from Napoleon and the French Revolution to Jesus Christ. Quite a range.    This is one of those songs that I can listen to over and over again and not get sick of (very quickly) and is in my opinion the best song on the album and in my top 20.    As with the rest of the album it is a departure from Coldplay's other work and incorporates orchestral, sweeping themes and tells a story of an apparent loss of power and the lament that follows. The song utilizes a certain Imperial age military beat and when combined with stirring lyrics and voice work it has a semi-epic feel which lifts the spirit, despite the melancholy theme of the song.
B0016Q56C4|5.0|Without making this a long boring review, this movie is a wonderful, wild adventure. It is a great escape film without those dull redeeming values.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Superb acting and writing.  Characters were played as the gritty, real-life people that they were.  Unlike the patriotic myths, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and, of course, John Adams, were real people with strengths and weaknesses.  Both the strengths and weaknesses of our founding fathers were portrayed with what appears to be good accuracy.  John Adams is worth watching from both an historical perspective and as a drama.
0743290119|3.0|I've read all of Lauren Weisberger's books and while Prada was the best, Harry Winston was still entertaining.  It's a very light and fast read but she veers off into some strange fairy tale action that \\"will\\" never and \\"could\\" never happen to anyone in real life.    That said, the character were well thought out and the story was great for light summer reading, but still 100% unbelieveable.
0393061310|3.0|Guns, Germs and Steel is a scientific historical treatment on the rise and fall of civilizations and the reasons why the western world is considered successful. In many ways Jared Diamond has built a city with one stone. He has established the necessity for the scientific method in history, reversed the problem of a western biased orientation of the analysis and identified several challenges to a racist explanation for western success.<br /><br />The book comes about as a result of a fundamental question raised by the friend of the authors from New Guinea. Yali asked in a roundabout way why whites have been more successful than blacks. Diamond felt that human genetic diversity in the form of racism did not answer this question and proceeded to produce this deep treatise which looks more at environmental factors as the causal agent of success or failure.<br /><br />Chapter 1: Up to the Starting Line<br />This chapter does a brief synopsis of the evolution of humans and deals with the Great Leap Forward, extinctions and the Clovis culture in Americas in 11,000 BC.<br /><br />Chapter 2: A Natural Experiment of History<br />Diamond shows that common stocks can produce very diverse cultures based on the environment. He cites the case of the Maoris victory over the Morioris on the Chatham islands in 1835. Both are Polynesian decedents.<br /><br />Chapter 3: Collision at Cajamarca<br />Francisco Pizarro conquers the Inca emperor Atahuallpa in Cajamarca Peru in 1532. Guns, germs, steel and horses decide the victory as well as the Inca making serious mistakes many times over. It is this situation that requires an explanation as to how things got to this point and is what this book is about.<br /><br />Chapter 4: Farmer Power<br />Food production is a huge part of this book and occurs frequently throughout. The book might well have been called 'farming' there is so much of it. This is an extensive fact based chapter that deals with food production. A lot of it is raw data and tables. Crops and animal domestication get the full treatment. There is an important link between animals and human germs brought up.<br /><br />Chapter 5: History's Haves and Have-Nots<br />This chapter deals with carbon dating and is an extension of the last chapter verifying the types of crops and animals various civilizations had or didn't and why.<br /><br />Chapter 6: To Farm or Not to Farm<br />Diamond explains the slow progress of farming and why hunter gatherers simply had more than early farmers but farming eventually outgrew hunter-gathering. He explains why some civilizations didn't adopt it based on lack of domesticated crops and animals and or inappropriate environments.<br /><br />Chapter 7: How to Make an Almond<br />Because wild almonds are poisonous Diamond explains how mutations and breeding selection produces edible crops. More importantly he discusses why some crops are not edible and how this effects civilizations depending on their environment. Some civilizations had it easier than others.<br /><br />Chapter 8: Apples or Indians<br />Here the Fertile Crescent richness is compared with places of sparse productivity. It becomes clear that a very low percentage of biological life can be domesticated for human consumption.<br /><br />Chapter 9: Zebras, Unhappy Marriages, and the Anna Karenina Principle<br />Some animals cannot be domesticated and thus domesticated animals must be imported. This chapter is about the failure to domesticate certain animals and why. It is also about the spread of domesticated animals.<br /><br />Chapter 10: Spacious Skies and Tilted Axes<br />Geography plays an important part in how wide a naturally occurring or bred species can spread. East to west is much easier than north to south because of climate. This explains why species spreading across Europe and Asia is easier than up and down North and South America.<br /><br />Chapter 11: Lethal Gift of Livestock<br />Animals are responsible for a lot of human diseases and plagues. Diamond links animal husbandry and large populations with developing immunity against epidemics.<br /><br />Chapter 12: Blueprints and Borrowed Letters<br />The evolution of writing. This chapter may be worth the book alone. Diamond covers the evolution of writing and is one of the reasons why this book (containing writing!) has a nice twist in its tale. Writing is important because it became a method of communication over long distances and record keeping for farmers and supplies.<br /><br />Chapter 13: Necessity's Mother<br />This deals with the Cretan Minoan Phaistos disk of 1700 BC and is a continuation of the previous chapter but deals more with why technologies develop. Diamond correctly identifies that technologies don't spring out of nowhere. They evolve.<br /><br />Chapter 14: From Egalitarianism to Kleptocracy<br />The evolution of governments. This is a heavy data and fact laden account of the evolution of governments from small bands to tribes to cities. It is all about how societies get organized.<br /><br />Chapter 15: Yali's People<br />Here Diamond applies everything we have learned to the conquest of New Guinea by Europeans. He shows how essentially they are the victims of their own environment. The conquest of Australia is also examined in the same way.<br /><br />Chapter 16: How China Became Chinese<br />This is about how China's many inter-civilizations interacted and the Austronesian migration of people to the Far East and Australia.<br /><br />Chapter 17: Speedboat to Polynesia<br />Moving on from the previous chapter Diamond explores the colonization of Polynesia and the evolution of the double-canoe.<br /><br />Chapter 18: Hemisphere's Colliding<br />Revising everything, Diamond goes back to Chapter 3: Collision at Cajamarca and attempts to explain how things led up to that point. Food production, domestication, metallurgy, weapons, cavalry, transport, writing and political organization lead the way. The environment is given a reason behind the slower development of these points by the Inca. Diamond then reveals that the Norse, not Columbus, were the first Europeans to visit the Americas through Greenland.<br /><br />Chapter 19: How Africa Became Black<br />This examines how Africa evolved internally, the various tribes involved and their long battles that have lasted centuries as well as the slow movement of technologies and discoveries from the north to the south.<br /><br />Epilogue: The Future of Human History as a Science<br />Diamond puts forward his case for scientific history, dispenses with the idiosyncratic Great Man theory, points out that there are social factors involved and possibly even chaotic ones before calling on the use of the scientific historical method to predict future outcomes for humanity.<br /><br />There is no arguing the point that Diamond is making and he has established it very scientifically. Environmental conditions have an impact on how a civilization will appear and act. This is Darwinian in every sense. Using the examples of the same genetic stock from the same culture developing into two opposite lifestyles in short spaces of time because of island separation and geological differences is a good argument. You can't help but note the degree of luck and opportunity involved in success and as Diamond so aptly puts it, this is much more about the quality of real estate than the quality of a race. This is not to say that slight genetic variations don't make a difference, they do and Diamond doesn't challenge that as some have wrongly accused of him of saying (as a note the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins often cites Diamond's work). What Diamond does is to challenge that genetic variations within a species are a sufficient explanation for the success of white man. He may be riding a wave of political correctness with this book but he does dispute justifications for racism scientifically. He also breaks down absolutism by showing that success is relativewhen it comes to doing one's best in the environment they are in. As he points out, Aborigines conquered some of the harshest lands in the world.<br /><br />Diamond himself knows the problem with his oversimplification. His findings when applied to all civilizations throughout history will turn up contradictions that fly in the face of his reasoning but he has explained the big picture of social conquest and doesn't need to shuffle genes to do it.<br /><br />There are a few more problems with Guns, Germs and Steel though. His overall reasoning touches on environmental determinism. Diamond does deal with this serious predicament by elaborating on the social conditions and cultural qualities at play. He believes and states often that human choices influence things. Diamond does his best to cover these in the political organisation sections and throughout but a type of environmental determinism does emerge as the overall message even if it is caricatured by his critics to mean geological determinism without human influence. Diamond is not saying that. What is really the problem here is not that Diamond says the environment plays a major role in the forces at play but that he doesn't do enough to challenge the view that environmental determinism is the sufficient explanation for the success of white man. Diamond doesn't say it is sufficient but it is his conclusion that amounts to most of what he is writing. So he leaves himself open and quite frankly gets intellectually decked quite easily because a lot of people leave this book thinking as environmental determinists. Environmental determinism is just as false as racism. We go from prejudice based on skin color to prejudice based on country. He really deals with this problem in the space of just a paragraph in the epilogue and that just doesn't cut it.<br /><br />The other problems are that sometimes the picture plates are not linked to anything in the text and this book is such a torrent of facts that casual readers may find themselves skipping huge sections about which part of which country developed wheat or camels first and in which quantities just to get to his overall point. Guns, germs and steel can be taxing at the best of times because of this. There is also an expectation that maybe you would find more about evolutionary biology or important battles along with at least some case made for genes. Instead the evolution is minimal, important battles limited and no genetic defence appears. This is all about how much corn Europe can produce, how many horses Asia can tame and how much politics does the Zulu need.<br /><br />There are other weaknesses here but he does have a huge task set for himself into 400 pages. It is doubtful that the truth is the complete opposite of what Diamond is suggesting but more of a deeper elaboration of what is being said while attributing more socio-economic reasons for success along with his geographical ones. You can also just play the probability card by saying 80% of humans lived in Eurasia but the improbable does happen and has happened and the geological explanation needs to be covered anyway.<br /><br />Experts in world history may view this work as being too simple and even go as far as to call it wrong, but Diamond's task is to show the importance of environmental factors not just genetic ones when it comes to the progress of modern humans. Experts want to make that environment plus socio-economic but both are on the same side when it comes to criticizing those who argue solely the race card.<br /><br />The main point behind reading Guns, germs and steel is that it changes how we think about ourselves and the conditions leading to how we got here. At the very least your horizons will be broadened and at the very most you will be hitting the environmental determinism socio-economic debate and both are a far cry from discrimination ideologies based on Ethnic identities.<br /><br />(As an end note it is my understanding that Diamond is aware of these criticism and answered it by... writing another book that includes more of a socio-economic dynamic, called 'Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed'. So see you there for a follow up review).ations throughout history will turn up contradictions that fly in the face of his reasoning but he has explained the big picture of social conquest and doesn't need to shuffle genes to do it.
