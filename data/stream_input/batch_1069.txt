0385523386|1.0|After spending time in Danbury myself, this book is a farce. Orange is not the color! At the camp the women use to wear khaki and in November 2007 changed to a drab olive green. The only orange worn is when you have been placed in the Special Housing Unit (SHU) for disciplinary action. I understand that Piper wanted to tell the story about her stay; I have spoken with women that were there at the same time and they laughed at this book.   We all have a story to tell, but after the journey we have been on beginning with the truth is the best place to start! Perhaps the publishers were looking to sensationalize things and encouraged a different avenue. Too bad. There is much to say and you only get one chance.

B004BSEKH6|1.0|Why didn't she just rap? Honestly, THAT is her talent and strength. I became a fan of Nicki Minaj because her rap skills blew me away! I loved the voice inflections, the growls, even her facial expressions are a delight to me. But her LYRICS were always spot on. I got all the songs she's featured on and she's a BEAST. BUT WHAT THE HELL WAS 'PINK FRIDAY'?!!! I got it and I went through the whole album in mindless confusion and disappointment. The best song on it (and my favorite) is Roman's Revenge. Don't get me wrong, I love her styles, I love her personas, I love her crazy \\"don't give a [...] attitude about the haters, but honey, why not stick to what you're great at? You are the BEST female rapper out now. I never liked Trina or Lil' Kim. But you're on par with the legend that is Eve, so why didn't you stick to where you shine? I hate how Lil Kim is attacking her, Kim doesn't even look like a human being anymore and her lyrics are elementary at best. How many times can you talk about your [...]?! But Nicki, sweetheart, this album was a disappointment because you didn't stay true to you. I hope your next album stays closer to home. I still love you hun, and I'll still support you. But please JUST RAP!!! Rapping can make you a mogul too! Look at Jay-Z! Be a Dungeon Dragon and spit FIRE all over the place!

B003VIW8DU|4.0|I've been a Ferry fan since 1971, when a friend played \\"For Your Pleasure\\" to me and hooked me on a lifelong habit.<br /><br />Over the years Ferry's songwriting style has moved emphasis from complexity in the makeup of the song to complexity in the sound achieved. He always had two distinct styles of song in him - songs with more or less complex musical structure like Song for Europe, The Bogus Man, Same Old Song etc and simpler 4-chord structures like Street Life, Both Ends Burning and Avalon.<br /><br />His solo self-authored works tend to be dominated with heavily layered takes on the second style of song (Slave to Love, Windswept, You Can Dance) and this album is no exception. Musically they aren't overly complex. All the effort has been put into the production of the layered sound, which conveys the classic Ferry Feel so prevalent on the last Roxy Music album \\"Avalon\\".<br /><br />But.<br /><br />On this album I felt that Ferry had moved into \\"Too Much of a Good Thing\\" territory. The opening track \\"You Can Dance\\" is a prime example, in which the layering becomes an aural experience similar to chocolate cake covered in molten chocolate and sprinkled with chocolate flakes - it becomes cloying.<br /><br />As I listened to it the first time I was reminded of the arguments that once raged on he subject of the over-production of the music on Dark Side of the Moon. There's a point at which it gets in the way of the music, and on this opening track, for me, Ferry has hit that point.<br /><br />Other tracks on the album back off the production a tad and allow his voice - aged but still a fine thing - to rise above the hammering guitars, castanets, drumming and whatnot and allow the listener to appreciate the song properly. \\"Alphaville\\" is a fine example of Ferry hitting his stride. Then it all comes down around my ears again with \\"Heartache By Numbers\\", which layers on the sound until the gorge rises. At least the vocal explores the register a little, something I didn't feel for \\"You Can Dance\\" (I know that in his younger days he'd have rescued both songs with his trademark growling excursions out-of-register in the right places; the vocal technique used on You Can Dance is bland and on this song there is an annoying soprano vocal in the backing track).<br /><br />The good news is that once \\"Heartache\\" is over the album settles down, the sound lightens a little and we once again get to hear Ferry do what he does best.<br /><br />The DVD that came with the album was...disappointing if I'm honest. The \\"You Can Dance\\" video was an odd little concept - why a disco full of women would be dancing (solo) to this song sung by a guy old enough to be their dad is not readily apparent - and the song not my pick for a viable single from the available tracks. The rest of the material was okay, I guess.<br /><br />My favorite track from Olympia is Song to the Siren, which isn't a Ferry original, but is a very good showcase of what the artist can do when he starts working.<br /><br />Yes I'm glad I bought it. It isn't the worst Ferry outing by a long shot and we go way back, 'im and me (even if he doesn't know it). There are people I went to school with who remember me only for my rabid Ferry fandom.<br /><br />Even so, he lost a star on this one for over-applying the musical fudge and chocolate sauce.ounger days he'd have rescued both songs with his trademark growling excursions out-of-register in the right places; the vocal technique used on You Can Dance is bland and on this song there is an annoying soprano vocal in the backing track).

B000AGTPUK|1.0|I absolutley LOVE Christmas movies - this came out at Cmas and I thought it was to be a Cmas movie but I just found this movie a tad on the creepy side. The weird animation they are doing now seems to take away  from the movies  either use real life or old timey aninmation the puppety stuff is odd    I would not let children under 13 see this - I think it should have been rated PG 13  not PG    Also the story line was just zilch  nothing made sense.    If you can get a copy from a friend to watch  I'd do that before paying for it
0143118420|1.0|I read \\"Eat Pray Love\\" after a friend recommended it (turned out, she hadn't actually READ the book...).  It's slow-moving and boring, and written from the point of view of a self-absorbed and narcissistic spoiled brat of a grown woman.  I did finish the book out of principle (hoping that it would be worth it in the end), but wish I hadn't.  Don't waste your time when there are so many worthwhile reads out there!  Really, this book gets the worst description you can give writing: BORING.
B002SKZBQS|1.0|I did not give this book one star because it is a bad story or badly written. I did so because when I buy a King book, I expect the presence of certain elements. This book contained none of them. No paranormal phenomena, no suspense, no eerie-ness. Nothing was scary or gruesome. It was just a story of the straw that broke the camel's back. Not awful, just not what I wanted.
B00006AG5N|3.0|This is an incredible selection of Elvis recordings. Every song most casual fans could possibly want is on here, including the awesome newly remade A Little Less Conversation.    HOWEVER, there's something amiss here.  The disc is entirely made up of remixed tracks. While in most cases that's not a bad thing, since they tried extremely hard to stick to the original mix layout, in some cases they've chosen the wrong take (different guitar solo, different lyrics) and in some cases the mix strays a little too much from the original hit version.    My one major complaint, though, is with Love Me Tender.  The application of hiss reduction went overboard and if you pay attention to the high end when listening, you'll find the hiss comes and goes and is not consistent, making it kind of distracting.    Would I buy this again?  Definitely.    Is this the definitive collection of songs?  Definitely.    Is this the definitive collection of released hits?  No, not a single originally released mix here.
B00005NB8K|3.0|So complete and convincing is Val Kilmer's transformation into the complicated personna of Jim Morrison, that many of the flaws of Oliver Stone's bloated homage to The Doors can be at least overlooked. Not only does Kilmer resemble Morrison but he sings eerily similar - so much so that several surviving members of the band were fooled. The early concert scenes are the highlight here but once The Doors get famous the film sinks into extended, bizarre concert shots and Morrison becomes a whiskey guzzling cliche working his way to his eventual demise in a Paris hotel bathtub. Kevin Dillon as Robby Kreiger is effective and Kyle MacLachlan as drummer Ray Manzerek is OK but Meg Ryan is hopelessly miscast as Morrison's longtime love  Pamela Courson, who died of a heroin overdose three years after Morrison. Oliver Stone has commented in the years after the film (and in Disc 2's Making of Featurette) that Ryan never connected with the role and that she played it as if she were constipated. The film also falters as it attempts to go deep into Morrison's head to explain his damaged psyche. But Kilmer's performance, which deserved an Oscar nomination, is worth watching, just as his equally stunning performance as John Holmes fifteen years later in \\"Wonderland\\" lifts that so-so film.
B003NFM3JU|5.0|I Love this Movie, I think the Actors did a very nice Job with syncing there voices to the screen in 3D this Is absolutly Amazing I thought the Whole 3D experience was Great through the movie I cannot say one bad word about it.. if you have a 3D HDTV 1080p and Love the christmas Carrol, Get this movie.. it is worth it. I saw it in 2d and still thought it was a good movie.. 5 stars
B0040YFR1Y|5.0|Ive waited for the ideal follow up to Arnolds Predator, and for the tremendous urban battle with Danny Glovers Predator. Since then, my favorite movie monster,has been crafted into a charismatic hero, hunting mostly Aliens and removing my love for the character as a movie monster to be feared. The excitement was gone. Predators starts off with Adrian Brody free falling through the sky, as does the rest of the cast one by one they land in this jungle, and thats just the beginning. Predators puts us back in the wild, where nature is king, and in the place the starnded heroes are in, nature comes in many deadly forms. Predator dogs, toxic plants, other humanoid aliens, and the Predators themselves.<br /><br />There are alot of elements in this movie that will remind old fans of the best Predator movies, the first two. The Predator theme is fully back, which makes this a \\"genuine\\" Predator film to me! In regards to the AVP movies, okay movies but a waste as a Predator movie.<br /><br />Now, onto the much appreciated recovery.<br /><br />Laurence Fisbourne does an amazing acting job, my favorite since Morpheus in The Matrix. Topher Grace also adds a certain levity thats appreciated amongst all the tension. Until his characer reveals certain character flaws towards the end.<br /><br />If you're looking for certain amount of savage Predator action, you wont be disappointed. The berserker Predator is the most fierce of ANY Predator, period. The Predator dogs are a brilliant design, and although they seem a little \\"Avatar\\" it isnt that much of an impact because they arent a large part of the action.<br /><br />The beginning and the ending of the movie are tied together wonderfully. I was really impressed with how they extablish the reason, and they how the heroes end up in the area they are in.<br /><br />In short, if you liked Arnold, and Danny's Predator, you'll be satisfied. Not a 100% on the money film, but VERY good and worth it for a fan of the franchise.

B002JVWQSW|5.0|It's been a minute since I last witnessed a television program so gut-wrenching, can't catch my breath, foot stomping and howling with tears streaming down my cheeks funny. While cable is the clear winner in raising the bar in TV programming, there's little doubt that network television needed 'Modern's' infusion to try to stay in the game. This program is singularly unmatched by anything else currently featured on the tube. Just chillin' 'til the dvd release of the second season.
0596805888|4.0|This is not a cookbook. If you're looking for a new collection of recipes, this is not the book for you. If you like shows like Good Eats or enjoy seeing how food is prepared and served, you'll almost certainly love Cooking for Geeks. If you like experimenting in the kitchen and knowing why food turns out the way it does, pick up this book!    As a geek, I loved Jeff's analogy: Recipes are code. Follow a recipe as written and you generally get good results. Forget the where clause and you could have unrecoverable errors. Introduce your own changes and you could get something great or you could get something horrible that requires a lot of cleanup. Recipes may have bugs or need corrections. Perhaps there's more than one way to the same result. Oh, and don't forget to comment your recipe. Otherwise you might not be able to recreate something fantastic.    Each chapter of Cooking for Geeks deals with different concepts, each with their own scientific background. Common utensils, ingredients, time/temperature, baking, additives (chemicals), and even some geeky fun with hardware or unusual cooking techniques - all are included in a way that not only gives some neat recipes, but the science behind the recipes.    To me, the most interesting parts were on baking and the chemical reactions that take place as heat is applied. It was great reading exactly why food turns out with all of its various nuances. That science got me thinking about ways to tweak the outcome of various recipes I follow and was just fun to read.    Disclaimer: I received an electronic review copy of this book, though I'd likely have wanted to read and review this anyway.

0385523912|5.0|Nothing To Envy is fantastic book!  It chronicles the true stories of six North Korean defectors.  Along the way we learn about each individual's family background from the Japanese occupation to the post famine condition of the Korean peninsula.  Many of the defector's families were divided after Japanese colonialism and the subsequent proxy war on the Korean peninsula.    Barbara Demick brings each defector to life through meticulous interviews.  She examines the routine life, food, jobs, and customs of the North Koreans and contrasts it with prospering South Korea.  She also pays attention to the cult of personality leadership in North Korea and it's affect upon the defectors.  The totalitarian regime suffocates a population until kimchi and corn is the only currency and the respect for human life is less than the life of a dog.    It was a heartbreaking book and my heart was broken when I finished.  I wanted more!
B00447G2T8|2.0|I really lov(ed) this version of Helloween since 1994 with the release of Master Of The Rings. Andi Deris's voice was fresh and the music was raw and much more technical than when Kiske was with the band. I liked Kiskes voice but it was a bit to Queensryche clonish for me, even though Keeper Of The Seven Keys part 2 was very good. Well along with Time of The Oathe, Better Than Raw and The Dark Ride i became a huge fan. What happened after that? I'm not quite sure. Ever since the release of Rabbit Don't Come Easy my attention span became very unfocused and i just couldnt get into them anymore. That album was ok but lacked good quality song writing and started back with the goofy Helloween theme's that i wasn't very fond of. Well after that with the release of Seven Keys Legacy i really just was no longer interested in the band, i felt they had hit a dry spell. Gambling With The Devil gave some promise but now with 7 sinners its just back to the usual repetition. The choruses here are uninteresting, the music is heavy but very non melodic and unlike anything you will find in the Andi Deris past catalog. Granted they had some pretty heavy stuff it still fit with his voice, and didn't seem, well this cheesy.    How many songs are called \\"Are You Metal\\" or \\"Die For Metal\\" and \\"Fight For Metal\\". Ive never been one of the \\"Metal Warrior\\" types, i leave that to groups like Manowar, Hammerfall and Dream Evil. Who is Mr Madman? More like who the hell cares, this is just another one of those songs thats not nearly as good as Mr. Toture and way worse than Ms God. Where The Sinners go is pretty decent but still lacks that unforced emotion this version of Helloween possess. Raise The Noise just goes, and goes and goes, well no where, the chorus just sounds like every other one they have done in the last couple years, very uninspired. I think World of Fantasy tries a lot to be another Future World but just doesnt cut it, and the lyrics are just horrible, and its about one of the cheesiest songs on the album. Long Live The King would be the second best, with a pretty catchy chorus and hook, Smile of the Sun is just awful, You Stupid Mankind is another stinker with a heavy riff with another uninspired chorus.     So the rest of the album pretty much keeps going in that same direction of repetition and boring music. I'm not sure what happen to the wow that really catches my ear Helloween had in the past, but it seems to be gone to me. I listened about 3 times all the way through(and each time) i really had to force myself to get through each song. Eventually i just scanned through them after losing interest. So i don't know if i just listened to them to much, and got burnt out or if its just not my thing anymore but 7 sinners brought nothing new to the table. It just sounds like another run through of mediocre, borderline cheesy material that doesnt know if its serious or not. Then again i guess thats Helloween, for whom i am no longer a fan of. Sorry this goes in the dumpster.
B004BSEKH6|3.0|This album is soooo disappointing. If you are a heterosexual male, chance are you will NOT like this album. That is where Nicki failed miserably- She put out a Top 40 pop album and wants to be considered Queen of Hip Hop? That just diminshes everything artists like Foxy, Eve, Trina, Lil Kim, Lauryn Hill, Rah Digga established themselves as. I feel this album should be labled hip-pop.   Nicki also has better collaborations that individual songs..     The only hot tracks on this album are -  -Did It on Em - featuring her hype man SB   -Save Me - Nicki is actually singing the entire song  -Roman's Revenge - collab with Em  -Momen 4 Life - collab wiht Drake    Her verses on Monster, Up All Night and Hello Good Morning were MUCH better than this album.     If you want to be a crossover artist - that works.. but don't expect for true hip-hop fans to embrace this.
B00005ASOI|5.0|It's a shame that I wasn't old enough to sue Dario Argento for infringement as Suspiria looks a lot like something right out of my worst nightmare. Yeah, pretty damned creepy if I do say so myself. Sadly, I was only 3 years old when this film was originally unleashed & I wouldn't be so arrogant to say Argento was invading my dreams as I'm sure legions of people have dreams much like what unfolds in Suspiria.<br /><br />By now, any true movie fanatic has more than likely heard of Argento & most would probably cite Suspiria as being their absolute fave even if they aren't hardcore fans of the man's overall work. Unfortunately, it's doubtful that he will ever make anything quite so colorful or unnerving as his quintessential works like Profundo Rosso or the seemingly timeless Suspiria. That's not to imply Argento is a has been or simply has no more music to produce but I just don't anything that could even begin to touch the threshold of something this masterful.<br /><br />Suzy Banyon has decided to pursue her ballet studies abroad in Germany but may quickly regret the decision. Shortly after her arrival, strange things begin to take place such as the mysterious death of a fellow student. Other eerie incidents follow including an infestation of maggots, strange noises at night, & her sudden decline in health. Of course, all of these things could very well be uncanny or perhaps just mere coincidence but Suzy Banyon is about to learn for herself just who or what runs this famous school and it's unnatural origins.<br /><br />Although I could talk all day about the amazing colors which are literally to die for, this is a film you must experience for yourself. Suspiria is nothing less than a kaleidoscope of visual terror which has been frightening audiences for over 30 years. Long live Dario Argento & his stroke of genius.
B003YOZNBU|4.0|I saw this at the movies and enjoyed it.  I had read the reviews and they were awful, but I fine that the worst the review the more I seem to enjoy the movie...and this was the case once again.  I go to the movies or buy DVDs to be entertained for a couple of hours.  I found Johah Hex very entertaining.  It had a lot of action and was I just love these types of films. I will be buying this DVD.  I had not every heard of Jonah Hex as I don't read comics, so I had nothing to compare it to.... I LIKE IT.
B002MW50KO|5.0|I ordered this for my husband who is your typical die hard Dylan fan...When he heard it for the first time, he said, 'Are you trying to get me to hate Bob Dylan?'..My reaction to the first listen was laughter- it was just so incongrous to hear Dylan sing some of the classics.. second listen:  I hear my husband singing along to it- he NEVER sings along to any Christmas songs! It is definitely not your typical Christmas album, but he sounds like he's having fun- the merriment is infectious- I also appreciate the fact that money made from this cd is going to a charity- thumbs up from our house!
B00005YUNY|5.0|There have been many other detailed reviews written on this DVD but I wanted to add my comment that it's an excellent show captured in full audio and video glory.  The video quality is top notch and the sound is almost flawless (there are a few very minor glitches here and there) as one would expect with a live recording.  What impressed me most about this is the version of \\"Ritual\\" they do from the much maligned \\"Tales From Topographic Oceans\\" release.  Chris Squire goes on an improvisational run that really adds to the piece and it just feels really much less stilted than the original. They do most of the major hits and a few new ones.  For even the casual fan, I would consider this a \\"must see\\" performance.

0307454541|3.0|There's a great 350 page thriller in this 600 page book. Let's face it, this book is a global mega-blockbuster not because of the awkward bookends involving Mikael Blomkvist's complicated libel conviction and its drawn-out aftermath against a supposed corporate villain who does not make one single appearance in the book.  It's because of the captivating mystery that gets rolling around page 250--Who killed Harriet Vanger? The pieces of this puzzle come together at such a glacial pace in the beginning you wonder if you're in for a L'Avventura put on--combined with the roaring arrival of the titular tattooed girl, Lisbeth Salander, into the main plot.  The rather jaw-dropping way Lisbeth, with bloodless resourcefulness, solves what looks like an uncontrollable nightmare swarming over her life has us cheering in the aisles (with uneasy looks on our faces), and loosens the joints for the moribund murder mystery, seemingly in a deep Swedish freeze through the first few hundred pages, to get going. Mikael and Lisbeth, the exile and the outcast, work amazingly well together.  As the pieces of the plot begin falling into place, and reliable twists begin revealing themselves, the effect is exhilarating.<br /><br />However, the ending is botched. It's gratifying to see Mikael's and Lisbeth's relationship evolve post climax(es), and the very last scene is poetic. But climaxes work, in part, because they signal the end. Readers eventually want to know about when they are going to be let out of the book, even one they are enjoying immensely. (People who say they don't want it to end don't really mean that--they mean they really like the winning ways the author has captivated us and sped us to the conclusion. If the author took them seriously it wouldn't be long before those same gleeful readers started checking their watches and counting the pages to the end.) Heart thumping, you want a winding down, a pleasing postscript, a tidying up of plot points. Instead, in this book, you get a plodding novella circling back to the complicated libel case you were happy to forget about four hundred pages ago. It doesn't work.<br /><br />Still, Lisbeth, installed into the neverending plot as a kind of all-purpose avenger, is the saving grace.  Is there anything more thrilling in entertainment than the moody rebel who warms up to a cause ? Lisbeth may not be Han Solo swooping triumphantly back into the fray to body-check Darth Vader, hot on Luke's trail (am I remembering this right?), out of the way, freeing up an improbable shot at the Death Star. She's more Bruce Willis taking up a samurai sword to aid of Ving Rhames who, moments ago wanted to kill Bruce, but now is being buggered by a couple of random S&M sociopaths in a way that a fellow man, no matter past grievances, cannot ignore...

B00026WU7I|5.0|Don't tell Bob you \\"enjoyed\\" this album, since it's full of the pain of the break-up of his first marriage, to Sara Lowndes, the Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands.     But the tunes are pitifully beautiful and the lyrics will pierce your heart in two.     This is an album that needs to be listened to in its entirety, as the tracks don't make as much sense on their own. The first time I heard Buckets of Rain was on The Wonder Boys soundtrack. Back then I thought it was nothing special. But within the context of this album, it's mind-blowing: deceptively simple and oh-so heart-breaking.     Other stand-out songs are Shelter From the Storm and Tangled Up in Blue.     Plus, if you're feeling bitter, Idiot Wind will help immeasurably.    Bob, yeah.

B002KSPKRS|5.0|I'm going to try to keep this pretty short. I don't want to put soo much info in here that you've felt that you've read a mini novel or something. Again I am not big on leaving reviews however with these, its a must. I have had these head phones for about 3 weeks now and I was trying to wait to \\"break them in\\" before leaving a review. I've gone through a pack of AAA batteries on these already so I don't think they can get more \\"broke in\\". I purchased these and paid for the expedited shipping so that I can begin to immerse myself right away. Two days later it was like early Christmas for me. So I suppose I will start from the very beginning.    Setup: 4/5  The initial setup is pretty simple, if you are just setting up to your xbox. I'm the typical male when it comes to directions. Look at the pictures and just go. However I decided to read these to try to get the best use out of them. This actually confused me because I first thought I had everything set up properly until I did a closer inspection. FYI I am running these from my TV so I can get the best use from not only my xbox, but blu-ray and TV set also. When I first set these up I expected to be blown away and was disappointed when I only get a \\"meh.\\" I really really wanted to like these so I just bore with it, until I experienced a power outtage and had to set up everything in my xbox all over again. Thats when I found, in the settings, \\"Dolby Surround and 5.1 Dolby\\" I set it to 5.1 and thought to myself, no way...put Fallout NewVegas in and...yes way. Apparently I had never gone in to set this up at all being that I just had my LCD TV with no audio system I left those setting alone. Now when I switch to the HDMI for XBOX the nice Dolby Digital \\"D\\" appears on the TV and also on the receiver. When reading just the instructions I was confused by this. After doing a lot of reading on dolby pro-logic, digital, truHD, pcm, so on and so forth I am throughly informed on these now and went through an entire \\"resettingup.\\" So now back to the game, I began playing there was a clear difference, at least to me. The Pro-logic mimics and the digital delivers. I went into a frenzy playing a few mins of all my games and..*que chruch organ and light from above*...there in was the mouth drop and utter amazement. So then I went to make sure that everything else that was being passed through my TV was set up correctly. Now the xbox, blu-ray player, and HD channels come in, with the switch to that lovely \\"D\\" in all the awesomeness and glory that's to be expected. Now just trying to get the 7.1 movies to come in with the \\"D\\" If anyone know's how to do this please let me know. Also I have the optical cable going through the optical out of my television. If anyone needs assistance with setup let me know.     Audio Quality: 5/5  I continue to hear complaints about popping, hissing, and just overall degradation of signal. To be fair I have heared a bit of popping here and there however for me, it wasn't a deal breaker. At first I thought it was a sign that the batteries were low however I got this even with the insertion of brand new batteries. I believe it could be signal interference however I don't get it enough to where it's a pain. I am running a computer, that I use as my media server, that is constantly on the net pulling down torrents and such literally 24-7, so it is constantly on a wireless signal. I am also in an area where there is a public wifi signal that is on and people are clearly connected to that however again, I don't get it enough to make me send these back. Also I have heard people saying it's not loud enough and at first I was in agreement with them however after taking into consideration that these are not audio headphone's but rather gaming, it made me look at things different. I am the guy that likes to listen to his music at ear drum bursting-bleeding levels however when playing the game these are plenty loud. I will also have to say that this also depends on your environment. If you have kids and they are screaming in your ear these will not drown them out. If you are in college and your boys are blitzed and just being generally annoying, again these will not drown them out, if however you are in a quiet to moderately loud environment these, not even all the way up, will do the job. Once I got the digital processor working, these were truly amazing.   Gaming: The games are amazing and again make sure you change the settings in the xbox console. Able to hear where someone is coming up on me from behind, kiddy corner, or just trying to sneak. NewVegas I can hear when I'm running on the pavement, to grass, to gravel, and even hear him on train tracks. I can hear every nuance that the developers meant for you to hear that makes gaming AMAZING!  Movies: I popped in a few dvd's and before I became conscious of the \\"D\\" they were okay, armed with the new info and research I'd done, they are AMAZING! Popped in 300 and was amazed all over again. I hear the freaking birds chirping in the distance, wind and rain falling, rocks seem like they are in the room falling around you. Found that I could switch from 5.1 to TruHD and well cleanup on aisle 4. Watched the movie again, after watching it through in 5.1, and again, utterly amazed. That being said I am still looking for ways to have that beautiful \\"D\\" appear when playing 7.1 movies.     Design and Feel: 4/5  I have heard people say that these are cheap looking and feeling and I would have to agree. However with that being said, would I like to have something that looks crazy expensive and does not deliver or something where they saved money where they could to give you the best sound possible, I choose the latter hands down. Also they are extremely comfortable! I have had these on for upwards of 8 hrs with no real discomfort. Other than just having something on your ear's for 8hrs or more there was no irritability or discomfort. When just having these on for a few hrs 3-5 you will totally forget that they are there. They set out to try to make these as comfortable as possible and they get an A+ for that. My ears have not sweat-ed or anything so for comfort 5/5. I will say that I had to play with them, and still do from time to time, to get the best \\"feel\\" possible. They can be a bit awkward however once you find its sweet spot, its all good.     Overall: 5/5  Why did I give these a 5/5 when there are obvious down sides, setup a bit confusing, look, signal interference, and most of all battery usage? Because they claimed that claimed, \\"you can play your game without disturbing others\\" check, \\"combines xbox live and the game\\" check, \\"you have the game sound right on top of you and with the 7.1 hear the cues of where they are reloading and sneaking up on you\\" triple check, 2.4 is an improvement over previous analog IR beams\\" check, and my fav \\"become a better player seeming like you have esp while enjoying your overall xbox gaming experience\\" check! Basically they do what they advertised! Yes you go through batteries like you are changing your underwear but one thing I can say is that they also make sure to drain every ounce of energy that they can before dieing, oh wait they said they'd do that also. So I strongly suggest and recommend buying rechargeable batteries with these or you may as well by stock in duracell or energizer. I think they hit the numbers in doing what they set out to achieve and advertised. I would recommend these to any and everyone! These are great! *guess I failed at trying to keep this short..in my defense I did say \\"try\\"...*
0812550757|4.0|Speaker for the Dead is the second book in the \\"Ender\\" saga. However, if you are coming into this book expecting more of the same as Ender's Game you will more than likely be unpleasantly surprised. Instead, Speaker presents itself in a more toned down light and there is nowhere near as much \\"action\\".    Although this book is a science fiction novel, it has more to do with character development and the examination of familial and societal relationships than on the flashy explanations and cool tech which define its' genre. The story revolves around the follies and triumphs of a family of scientists who are trying to study the only other sentient species known to exist in the universe. After the untimely death of the patriarch, the Speaker of the Dead is called in to perform his special brand of eulogy. However, as that speaker is not currently present on the planet, it is many years before his arrival. During this time, more unfortunate events occur. So, it happens that the speaker attempts to dig through the events of the past years, uncovering the truth of the lives that were lived while untangling the hurt, fears and joy present for those who have passed on and those affected by their passing. All this while also attempting to learn more about the \\"piggies\\" culture and society while maintaining the proper relationships with the new and interesting creatures.
B0042RUMEQ|2.0|NO FRIGGIN WAY!!!!!....This is bubblegum rap @ its finest! Take a seat Nicki!...I am waiting on this girl to give us some LYRICAL substance. She rarely TALKS about anything and when she does her vocabulary won't let her use words REAL words, only made up ones that rhyme with whatever the hell she wants them to.I don't understand the hype surrounding this girl. Her whole career is a gimmick and she is riding this hype wave for as long as it will let her. Sure she has a pretty face,and maybe she's even mildly entertaining; she definitely keeps you guessing. The only problem is that I'm never EVER blown away once she finally presents the finished product. I feel sorry for the people who spent their money on the album. Ugghhhhhhhh...and the wait continues.
B003INBNXO|5.0|I echo others who give this first Ip Man film the highest of ratings.    It's really this simple:  to live up to part of the legendary Bruce Lee's legacy, the producers had to get the best; and they did with Donnie Yen and crew.  This movie has it all; tragedy, drama, romance, humor, humility, heroism, a great story and screenplay, and some of the best martial arts choreography ever.    Unlike many Kung-Fu movie stories that are hard, if not impossible to follow; this is an easily understood, yet complex story that transposes cultures.  If you're even the slightest interested in martial arts, Bruce Lee's origins or action movies in general, this is a must see movie that will uplift your spirit like few movies of this genre ever will.
B001ER4CNY|5.0|Given the fact that enough have complained about the packaging; I will be removing the DVDs one by one and putting them is protective sleeves which I have; I have 10 sleeves with dual inserts; that should protect the DVDs  The series is excellent!

0609610570|4.0|Authors    Lawrence A. (\\"Larry\\") Bossidy (born March 5, 1935) is a businessman and author. He is a retired CEO  of AlliedSignal (later Honeywell), and spent over 30 years rising into executive power at  General Electric.     Ram Charan earned a degree in engineering from Banaras Hindu University and later   studied at Harvard Business School: MBA (1965) and doctorate  (1967). Be taught at the Harvard Business School, Kellogg School of Management, and Boston University then became a full-time consultant in 1978.  CHAPTER 2. THE EXECUTION DIFFERENCE   The three examples presented in this chapter are Xerox, Lucent and Exceed.    Xerox    Xerox hired Thoman as COO in 1997 ad elevated him to CEO in April 1999.  In May of 2000 he was  told by Chirman Paul Allaire that he was out of a job.    Lucent    Richard McGinn succeeded Schacht as CEO of Lucent in 1997. Lucent rose from a price of $7.56/share  to a high of $84.  On January 6, 2000, Lucent made the first of a string of announcements that it had missed its quarterly estimates, and when it was later revealed that it had used dubious accounting and  sales practices to generate some of its earlier quarterly numbers, Lucent fell from grace. By October  2002, when its stock price bottomed at 55 cents per share, Henry Schacht had been brought back on an  interim basis to replace McGinn.   \\"In November, 2000, Lucent raised questions about its revenue recognition, and a month later revised its fiscal fourth-quarter results down by $679 million. The SEC took no action at the time. Channel stuffing occurs when a company encourages its distributors into taking on excessive inventory, goods for which the distributor is not obliged to pay if they don't sell.\\" [...]   EDS    The author of this book praises Dick Brown at EDS.  However, when the earnings and stock price fell  drastically, Brown was asked to leave EDS in 2003, the year following the publication of the book.     \\"In the first quarter of 2002, EDS failed to disclose thecost of certain derivatives contracts. In the second quarter of 2002, EDS failed to disclose adequately the cost of those contracts. In the third quarter of 2002, EDS selectively disclosed to certain analysts the cost and early settlement of the outstanding derivatives contracts. In addition, EDS failed to disclose adequately an extraordinary transaction with a major customer that increased its reported cash flow by $200 million in the second quarter of 2002.\\" [...]    Looking at all three of these examples shows that companies normally shortfall in the second building block relating to the company's framework, and the second core process of strategy.  This makes it difficult to effectively execute the third building block of hiring the right people and the third core process of operations.  At the end of chapter two, Mr. Bossidy states that \\" The discipline of execution is based on a set of building blocks that every leader must use to design, install and operate effectively the three core processes rigorously and consistently.\\"  The key word in that statement is \\"consistently.\\"  That consistency needs to be implemented throughout time and the organizational structure, or individuals in the company's core processes will almost inevitably skew the company's operations.  Overview: PART II AND III  There are three building blocks and three core process which correspond with one another.  \\"Leaders 7 essential behaviors\\" in chapter 3 correlates with ''The People Process\\" In chapter 6.  \\"Creating the framework for cultural change\\" in chapter 4 correlates with ''The Strategy Process\\" In chapters 7 and 8.  'Having the right people in the right place\\" in chapter 5 correlates with ''The Operations Process\\" in chapter 9.    CHAPTER 3. BUILDING BLOCK ONE: 7 Essential Behaviors  The leader's seven essential behaviors, outlined in this chapter are:  1. Know your people and your business.   2. Insist of realism.   3. Set clear goals and priorities.  4. Follow through.    5. Reward the doers.    6. Expand people's capabilities.  7. Know yourself.  Larry and Ram both provide examples of their own experience relating to these behaviors.  CHAPTER 4. BUILDING BLOCK TWO: Framework for Organizational Change  This chapter directs on how to operationalize culture by focusing on beliefs and behaviors, which then translate into actions.  Strong achievements and desireable behaviors should be rewarded and a robust dialogue should be open, tough, focused and informal. The points covered are:  1. Operationalize culture   2. Link Rewards to Performance  3. Robust Dialogue  The end of this chapter states that leaders get the behaviors they exhibit and tolerate.  CHAPTER 5. BUILDING BLOCK THREE: Having the Right People in the Right Place  The methods outline in this chapter to employ the right people are outline in this chapter are:  1. Energize people  2. Get the right people in the right jobs.   3. Focus on short term accomplishments.   4. Be decisive.   5. Deal with people promoted who don't perform.   6. Outsource.  7. Follow through. The unvarnished truth: were commitments met?  PART III: THE THREE CORE PROCESSES OF EXECUTION  The three core processes covered in part III are:  1. The People Process: Ch. 6  2. The Strategy Process: Ch. 7 and 8  3. The Operations Process: Ch. 9  CHAPTER 7. THE STRATEGY PROCESS: Making the Link with People and Operations  This chapter covers all the questions which need to be answered when building a strategic plan:  1. What is the assessment of the external environment?    2. How well to do understand existing customers and markets?    3. What is the best way to grow th business profitably, and what are the obstacles to growth?  4. Who is the competition?  5. Can the business execute the strategy?   6. What are the important milestones for executing the plan?   7. Are  the short and long term balanced?   8. What are the critical issues facing the business?  9. How will the business make money on a sustainable basis?  CHAPTER 8. HOW TO CONDUCT A STRATEGY REVIEW  The questions which should be raised when conducting a strategy review include:  1. How well versed is each business unit team about the competition?   2. Are the linkages with people and operations clear?  3. How strong is the organizational capability to execute the strategy?   4. Are we choosing the right ideas?  5. Is the plan scattered or sharply focused?  CHAPTER 9. THE OPERATIONS PROCESS: Making the Link with Strategy and People  This chapter covers how to build a budget in three days:    1. The importance of synchronization and realistic goals with sound assumption.  2. Building the operating plan: the art of making trade-offs and outcomes of the operations process  3. After the meeting: follow through and contingencies including contingency plans and quarterly reviews.  (The chapter contains a sample memo outlining  details of such a review.)  The chapter ends with goals to live by.  CONCLUSION: LETTER TO A NEW LEADER  This chapter contains a cookie cutter letter which can be beneficial to any reader who has taken on a position of leadership.  The letter is outlined as follows:  1. Congratulations  2. Skills required  3. Three core processes:   a. Organization  i. People under you direction: compare with competition.  ii. Are the people under you like minded people?  iii. Stewardship  b. Strategy:   i. Understand customers  ii. Look for improvements.  iii. Inellectual honesty  c. Operations:    i. Feedback and coaching.  ii. Confident who can be candid.  iii. Take care of yourself.  iv. Inellectual honesty    I found this to be a very effective summary of the points covered throughout the book.    I found the concepts and processes described in the book to be very beneficial and effective, when continuously implemented and updated to suit a changing environment.  As is often the case, one in a position of power may lose sight of the organization and operations which led to their success, and thereby let the organization lose its strengths.   If the concepts are applied to one's activities on a daily and continual basis, I believe the effect can be positive to all involved.
B000UR9T82|5.0|I am going to just briefly review the movies. For the most part they are great. The first movie was one of the best Superhero origin stories ever and a great mix of comedy and action. The only issue was with that goofy Green Goblin costume. You would think for the millions they spent on that movie, someone could have come up with a better costume. The second movie is one of the greatest films of the last decade. The acting, the direction, the story, everything hit the right notes and made for a thrilling, unbelievable experience. And finally, the third film. It was ok. It had some good points, but also some bad. Too many villains and a story that did not stay focused. It was a shame the series had to end on such a mediocre point.     The thing that is really important to take away from this review is how awesome it is to watch Spidey swing around in High Def. The Blu-Ray format was invented for movies like this. Even if you own these films in another format, you owe it to yourself to upgrade to these versions. Your eyes will thank you.
B003ZVJFFM|5.0|This is a great CHRISTMAS addition to a video library.The special features are great.My only negative about it is how long it takes to load and access the special features on the blue ray disc.This particular movie is special to me as it was the last movie I saw with my Dad before his passing away.
1401324029|5.0|This is the second book this has been written by Castle. Last year we read the 1st one as we saw the advertisement on TV. we thought if the show was so good, so would the book. We were not disappointed in either the first or second book. As long as he keep's churning them out I will read them !!!
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|I really enjoyed watching the second sex and the city movie. For the first time I could relate to the characters aside from the over the top stuff that makes sex and the city a brand. I could relate to Charlotte and feeling overwhelmed as a mother. Samatha's desire not to let go of her youth. Carrie as she changed from being in love single and compromising as a married couple and how no one else can define what makes your marriage work. Marada's having difficulty in corporate America as a woman but being just a mom wasen't enough for her. I have been in the closet myself on occasion in tears only I didn't have a nanny to save me. I don't often buy dvd's but this one I'm buying and sharing with my girlfriends. Believe it or not going from 30 to 40 married to single is a transition to some degeee we all can relate to and by no means is boring.
B000PDZJ1W|4.0|Since I don't have a Surround Sound system, I was not able to test the quality of that part of the product.  Regarding the rest: One of my top five DM albums, I knew I had to buy the re-issue even though I had the original CD.  The DVD is a nice bonus.  Only quibble I have is that the B-sides, such as \\"Dirt\\" are not included on the CD, and I had to buy the mp3 separately.  Also, my booklet had page errors, but I'm sure most don't.
B003DZX3US|4.0|Received the DVD and showed the movie to family.  It was a hit and the disc played as advertised.  Thanks once again.
B001UE276A|5.0|This is actually the first time I bought a box set, and I find this to have been totally worth it.  Granted, it was on sale for like $35.  Love the three CDs, the DVD and the two books.  There are some other little knickknacks, but these are the main items of value.  Admittedly, the box is a little big for the contents, but it looks nice on the shelf.

1439181780|5.0|I read the Secret and loved it.  I've been trying to implement it's teachings into my life.  The only problems I had were some things that were left a little bit vague in the first book.  Perhaps the point was for each person to figure out the specifics themselves, and all I did was obsess over it, but the Power picks up where the Secret left off.  The teachings are not any different, but much more specific and insightful.  I thoroughly enjoyed this read and can't wait to implement some of the exercises in my life!  I bought this for my brother's birthday, as he's a big fan, too.  But I hurried and read it before gifting it to him.  I just had to see what it said!  I wasn't disappointed.  A grandiose, uplifting read that will inspire and bring joy!

B002ZG98LO|5.0|Ha. Never been an Adrian Brody fan, but that could change. This is an outstanding movie on all counts. Creative, Intelligent, plot! Oh My Gosh...a real Plot out of a Hollywood movie. Dare we say it, could it be, Hollywood hired some actual writers who put their brains to work and created a movie with a...relatively...low body count filled with characters who had stories and which didn't seem like they were drawn from the cutnpaste theory of let's bang it out...!    Not only did I think this movie was great, but after watching The Expendables, you see just how great this movie truly is.    Sylvester Stallone reduced the action flick The Expendables to just another drop-in another round of artillery combined with a bunch of old guys who look ridiculous. Watching Sylvester Stallone make a run for the plane flown by Jason Statham was absolutely painful; Stallone ain't got it anymore and should stick behind the camera if it has to do with action. Jason Statham as always was just awesome, someone who looks truly tough and no nonesense. Ya wouldn't get any fall da rall political correctness from that guy.     We will be watching Predators for the sixth time this weekend, so much fun to watch a movie that was done right. Really. Couldn't we have more of these, puhlease!    Oh, also watched The Sands of Time. Same problem....endless action sequences that exhaust with noise and movement. If I wanted to play a video game I'd play a video game. And some men just aren't manly enough to play an action hero. I was worried about that with Adrian Brody. My mistake. Again, Predaotrs. Great movie! Most likely a classic...
B00433TO52|4.0|I'll say that this is the greatest collection ever, but I would've like that the dialogs would be easier to read because there's no space between them. Can't blame that the publisher threw the ball outta the park with this one but just a suggestion for the publisher. BTW, this one has a good table of contents =)
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I bought the Hyper 212 CPU cooler to use with a new computer build featuring a i7-950 processor. I wanted a cooler that would allow me to overclock in the range of 4ghz without breaking the bank or moving to liquid cooling. After reading a bunch of reviews, I settled on this one, and I'm very pleased with the cooler.<br /><br />Set-up:<br /><br />As others have noted, the included instructions are pretty worthless. They include small, hard to see diagrams, tiny size 5-6 font, and cryptic descriptions that could be confusing to those who haven't installed this sort of CPU cooler before. I found that I was able to install the cooler with about 20 minutes of fooling around, but I have done a fair amount of computer building in my time and usually just rely on my ability to figure things out rather than directions. Apparently there is a video (or videos) on youtube that show how to install the Hyper 212, so if you are really having issues, check them out.<br /><br />One complaint that I have is that once installed, the cooler is a bit loose and can be rotated perceptibly without much effort. Because of the nature of the mounting bracket, which relies on four screws which in turn secure the cooler assembly in the center with a single pin, the whole thing can pivot around the center pin about 3-4 degrees. This probably doesn't affect performance, but I would prefer that the cooler not move once in place.<br /><br />Cooling:<br /><br />The Hyper 212 comes with a single [[ASIN:B0030DL37I Cooler Master BladeMaster 120mm PWM Fan]]. Running the cooler with only one fan isn't really taking advantage of the true cooling ability of the Hyper 212--I'd strongly recommend getting a second fan (preferably one that supports PWM) for a true push-pull set-up. If you plan to do any overclocking or work in an area with a higher ambient temperature, the second fan will go a long way towards keeping your CPU temperatures reasonable.<br /><br />My results were excellent: my core 17-950 stock speed temperatures were:<br /><br />Ambient Temperature: 24C<br />Idle: 29C<br />100% load max temperature: 50C<br /><br />My 4.07Ghz overclock temps were also excellent:<br /><br />Ambient Temperate: 24C<br />Idle: 45C<br />100% load max temperature: 78C<br /><br />I'd prefer that the max temperature be a bit lower, but it hovers around 73C and only occasionally bumps up when running small FFTs in Prime95. Overall I am pretty pleased with the temperatures, and I never really go past about 65C while gaming or doing photo editing.<br /><br />Conclusions:<br /><br />This is a great CPU cooler for the price. Add a second fan to really take advantage of what it has to offer. If you're looking at this cooler, you obviously know what you're looking for. Pull the trigger--this is a great cooler.erature: 24C  Idle: 29C   100% load max temperature: 50C    My 4.07Ghz overclock temps were also excellent:     Ambient Temperate: 24C  Idle: 45C  100% load max temperature: 78C    I'd prefer that the max temperature be a bit lower, but it hovers around 73C and only occasionally bumps up when running small FFTs in Prime95.

B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Heard Little Lion Man on the radio and really liked it. A friend at work let me borrow his CD a week ago and I've been listening to it on repeat ever since.

In Bridget Jones's Diary, you get to determine this for yourself. In this romp through a year in the life of Bridget Jones, author Helen Fielding bares Bridget to the reader via Bridget's diary.  It is frank, lurid, sensational, and detailed.  Bridget has a persona known to her acquaintances, and another known only to her diary.<br /><br />Witty at times, it is a sad commentary on an unsustainable life.<br /><br />[Bridget's friend, Tom, to Bridget]  \\"How many calories are you supposed to eat if you're on a diet?\\" he said.<br />\\"About a thousand.  Well, I usually aim for a thousand and come in at about fifteen hundred,\\" I said, realizing as I said it that the last bit wasn't strictly true.<br />\\"A thousand?\\" said Tom, incredulously.  \\"But I thought you needed two thousand just to survive.\\"<br />I looked at him nonplussed.  I realized that I have spent so many years being on a diet that the idea that you might actually need calories to survive has been completely wiped out of my consciousness.  Have reached point where believe nutritional ideal is to eat nothing at all and that the only reason people eat is because they are so greedy they cannot stop themselves from breaking out and ruining their diets.\\" [p. 224-225]<br /><br />Poor Bridget.
B003HARV3Y|5.0|I read all Lightning Thief books (not the last one though) before I saw this movie, and although they left out parts and was pretty different than the book, I still loved this movie. Effects and acting were great and definitely reminded me of Harry Potter (which I love).
B00275EHJG|5.0|Of course, who doesn't love this movie?  It was so cute and funny and the best part is that I bought it as a set with Disney's Cars Mater's Tall Tales for a great price and it was SOOO worth it!  Thanks Amazon!

B003UYV08E|1.0|Let me start by saying I thought the first Iron Man movie was great.  This movie was really terrible and I wanted to like it so much.  I gave it so many chances and it never got better.  I would have given it less than one star, but I'll give it one purely for Mickey Rourke's performance.  Sadly, not even Mickey could save this piece of cinematic junk.  Yes, there are cool special effects but there aren't enough special effects in the world to make up for Iron Man 2's total lack of story and plot.  Downey's performance as the arrogant genius is so over the top it's boring and the chemistry between he and Paltrow is non-existent.  In fact she doesn't seem to have much of a reason to be in this film at all. She's like a potted plant in the background of each scene she's in.  In order to make up for the poor script and mediocre acting, the film is packed full of so many baffling characters that we don't get a chance to understand them or care about any of them...Including the main character, Tony Stark.  In the first movie we could at least care about him even with his flaws.  In IM2 we have Stark's arrogance shoved down our throats so much that I found myself rooting for the bad guys to do something to make him shut up.  I sincerely hope that there will be no such thing as an Iron Man 3.

I do want to say: Keith Richards, legendary guitarist for the Rolling Stones has finally come out with his life story. As \\"the rocker most likely to die\\" we get a sense of just how intense he life story is. From heroine addict to family man, the details are all here. The book is well-written, exciting, fascinating! A great read for Rolling Stone fans.
B004E9CFZG|4.0|As a zombie genre fan I was eager to see the TV series to release. It has been good so far but with a few flaws. The biggest one I noticed was that the zombies feasting scene are below par. I could totally tell the actors are just grabbing on the organs and tisues and so forth, evidence of lack of devotion and not spending enough money to pay the actors. It's also slow-pace and lacks suspense. but i believe it'd be a good entertainment for the zombie fans out there. hope that helps.

030745455X|5.0|Stieg Larsson, who died rather suddenly and prematurely, will likely be missed by all who have read his millenium trilogy. Despite all the tongue twisting Swedish names for persons and places, Larsson's characters are brilliantly defined and real. Beyond that, the author has either put time into understanding psychodynamics and/or he's had professional inputs with re: his characterizations and his vivid portrayals of various of his characters pathologies as well as strengths. Lizbeth Salander is a most fascinating study. Though it is marginally suggested, both in The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo and The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest that Lizbeth might manifest Asperger's Syndrome, she indeed does manifest that disorder in my opinion. Yet, as in real life, it is tunnel-visioned to pidgeon hole and to perceive individuals as with solely one constellation of traits. And while it is \\"easier\\" to see someone in one way, as sociopathic by way of example, that person my truly be empathetic and available and caring in certain various circumstances. Larsson certainly portrayed such depth of understanding in developing his characters. He was also a wonderful story teller. I grieve that he is no longer with us, that he will no longer be writing.
B001IBIHQ4|2.0|LOVED \\"Band of Brothers\\" for a lot of reasons.  This, I'm sorry to say...not so much.    The actor who played Eugene Sledge was so completely unbelievable and unlikable as a U.S. Marine I couldn't get into any of his scenes, distracted by the constant thought \\"Okay, so I wonder who this guy was related to, to get cast here?  Shouldn't he be auditioning for the 'Nutcracker?' \\"  I realize the filmmakers were trying to have a character with an arc with \\"Sledge\\" (going from green to hardened veteran) but you've got to have someone the audience finds likable, and the actor playing \\"Sledge\\" was annoying with a capital \\"A.\\"        And his psycho sidekick \\"Shelton\\" was also so completely unlikable and unbelievable as a U.S.  Marine (did they really allow people creepier than Hannibal Lecter in the armed forces?), again it made each of his scenes painful to watch.  There's enough on the screen to make you squirm, we didn't need a sullen faced nerd and a Southern psychopath added to the mix.      And with \\"Shelton,\\"  it appears they wanted to show that some Marines had stopped seeing the enemy as human, but it doesn't work when you have a character more suited for a scene from \\"Deliverance\\" (remember the guy with one tooth playing the banjo on the back of the truck?   Well, \\"Shelton\\" is creepier than that guy).  You've just got to have likable characters in the midst of such grotesque violence for the audience to want to stay with the whole thing.    The \\"Leckie\\" character was good, but I would have loved to have seen an even stronger character like Sgt. Winters from \\"Band of Brothers,\\" as well as time spent on the ships with the men.  Instead, we get scenes in Australia??   Nice, and beautifully photographed, but not what fans of \\"Band of Brothers\\" most wanted to see.     Considering the $200 million they spent making this, they just could have done a heck of a lot better.    Best thing here were the historical intro.'s by Tom Hanks.
142311339X|5.0|First off, one thing You should know is that this series is a sequel series to the Percy Jackson series, so, as in a previous review, i would encourage you to read those first, as you will miss out on quite a lot of back story if you don't. Moving on, i chose to give this book 5 stars because it really is an excellent book, with plenty of action, plot, personality, and new baddies to fight. Also, it stumped me.  Which has never happened before. What i mean by this is i could not decide whether  or not i really liked it or not until the end. But don't take that the wrong way. It's definitely a good thing. It just means i had to think more than usual, which is certainly very good. It also has just the right amount of Percy Jackson feel, without being one of those annoying books that the author writes just to keep making money off of the series, without putting any effort in it,which finishes it off nicely. So all in all, i would certainly recommend it to anyone.

B002JVWQT6|5.0|This has to be one of the funniest shows I have watched in a long time. My wife and I usually don't watch much network TV, but we came upon this show at the insistence of friends. We started watching season two every week, and decided we needed to get caught up on the original season. Each episode contains tons of laughs, but also an element that connects it with my everyday life. It is this personal connection with the episodes that makes it all the funnier, with characters that are much more amusing than my family. My biggest complaint is that the episodes are only 30 minutes. I feel they could easily make an hour out of most of the plots each week. Of course it is always better to want more of something... Video and audio quality is excellent (not sure if it is worth the steep cost though...)    Definitely worth picking this up!!

0698116496|5.0|A weary zookeeper says \\"Goodnight, Gorilla,\\" on one of his nightly rounds at the zoo. But the mischievous Gorilla reaches out from the cage and quietly nabs guard's keys, tiptoes the guard as he says goodnight to all the animals and opens up their cages.  Not suspicious of anything, exhausted zookeeper slowly walks to his cottage followed by a parade of animals: the gorilla, an elephant, a lion, a hyena, a giraffe, an armadillo, and a little mouse.<br /><br />All the animals sneak into the bedroom and nestle around unnoticed, until the gorilla gives them out by snuggling right next to the guard's sleepy wife as she turns out the light. In the dark of the night, the whole team gets discovered  - no words needed here - just an ink-black spread with surprised Mrs. Zookeeper's eyes.<br /><br />With few words but lots of humor and vivid, bright artwork, this fun and imaginative story will surely be a hit among the observant preschoolers.<br /><br />Julia Shpak<br />Author of \\"Power of Plentiful Wisdom\\".

B0044LK8J4|5.0|I heard a teaser on NPR of this album on Saturday morning.  After spending Friday thinking how distorted and shallow black Friday is, this brought me back to what the Holidays are all about.  Went to my local Starbucks to buy it.  Sold out - as were four others I checked with.  Decided to download the MP3 version from Amazon even if it means not getting the liner notes.  Bottom line is that I didn't want to wait for the CD to appear in the mail.  Anyway, this album is absolutely great! Great variety and when they do the classics, they do them with such grace and sensitivity. Great horn work, arrangements and of course vocals. I hope I don't play it so much that I get sick of it.  Replaces the Phil Spector's Christmas album as my favorite!
1439152780|3.0|I was enthralled by The Forgotten Garden and liked a lot The House at Riverton but this one is a complete mystery to me as to why she got so off the track. I think maybe a little too many morose classics in her repertoire. In all honesty I haven't finished the book but I don't know if I can stay awake long enough to finish it. She goes on for paragraphs about a dress or the messiness of a room when I just want her to get on with the relevant tale. In The Forgotten Garden I couldn't wait to pick it up again and ignored my duties just to secret away with it. With this one I'm about to give up. Will update this review if I ever get through it. I have been waiting with bated breath for months for this book. What a boring disappointment.  Update: Well I finished the book and after the first third being horrible the real Kate Morton reappeared and authored as she had in the past. The story finally took off moving well and providing sufficient mystery. I really enjoyed the second half. I'm still only upgrading this book to three stars because of the awful beginning (I agree too that The Mud Man is not a story children would really enjoy and opening with it immediately disinterested me). I wonder about the people she asks to read this before publication. Didn't anyone encourage her to tighten up the script? Well, hopefully people pick up her other books before this one.

B00122Z5RI|5.0|3 plus decades later, this album has aged well.   Today, the music harkens back to the days when mainstream America was first introduced to the safety pin in the cheek with ragged biker leathers and the rainbow colored mohawk.   CBGBs was just entering consciousness of the music consuming public. And we burned our Kansas records faster than you could say Johnny Rotten was bigger than Johnny Lennon.  Sure these guys flamed out fast, but not before they set the table for a genre of music that eventually watered its way down to the corporate gutter of MTV.    Today, this is still not your parent's punk rock.  Some of the tracks regarding society at large and the music industry still ring true. And Billy Joe Armstrong ain't got nothing on these guys, simply because he only occupies the house they built.
B002ZG976U|5.0|In Burlesque, the actress Kristen Bell, who I remember from TV's Veronica Mars, does the sort of total reinvention, bordering on scarification, that won Charlize Theron an Oscar when she tried it in Monster.  After the movie we were all sitting there, saying, \\"That was Kristen Bell?\\"  The film has her playing Nikki, a dancer with enormous talent and charisma who's hobbled by two nasty problems--megalomania and alcoholism.  Something's a little wonky with the script, which seems to be playing on two time scales at once....  One in which Nikki is roughly the contemporary of Christina Aguilera's character, maybe a bit older (in fact Bell is five months older than Aguilera), and the other in which Nikki was around when together, she and Cher started the burlesque dance palace around which the movie, and their lives, revolve.  I'm sure I wasn't the only one who was scratching his head when the big parking lot scene took place and Nikki started giving Cher (I mean \\"Tess\\") a guilt trip for preferring the new girl Ali!  That's the part where Cher says, what about all the years I held your hair up out of the toilet bowl while you were vomiting everything but your memories?<br /><br />It almost seems that their memories changed and transformed as the decades passed.  Both Nikki and Tess look pretty ageless, but Nikki actually seems younger than Tess because at least she can still move her body.  Cher parades through the movie as though she had no feet and is being wheeled about on casters by invisible unions whose members are all fieldmice,  On the minus side, there is perhaps one spectacular musical number too many, but outside of that, Burlesque is perfect.

0465043577|3.0|This book was written before the current financial crisis, and recently reissued with a new preface on the financial crisis. The most noteworthy features of this book are (a) its clear presentation of traditional financial theory without any equations, and (b) a systematic critique of the major premise of this theory, which the authors take to be the assumption that error terms are normally distributed when in fact they are often Cauchy distributed (and therefore have \\"fat tails\\" leading to high volatility and higher risk exposures than suggested by the standard theory). Despite the title and numerous photo plates in the book, there is nothing `fractal' about Mandelbrot's explanation of financial theory. However, the authors show clearly that financial markets exhibit a degree of volatility incompatible with the Capital Assets Pricing Model. They also show that, despite the standard notion that only the beta of a stock can be stable across time, the degree of volatility of a stock can also be forecast, and has strong implications for profitable buying and selling.<br /><br />The authors almost always stress that this book should be no comfort for the poor misguided souls who believe they can `beat the market' by analyzing stock movement history. This is a very important point, and authors who deny this are, I believe, misguided or evil. Nevertheless, they cannot resist leveling the standard \\"critique\\" that some investors do phenomenally well, consistently making profits where the standard theory says they should not (e.g., their homage to Peter Lynch, p. 103), even though this contradicts their basic message.<br /><br />It is a very attractive property of a book that its basic argument is correct and important, but it is also nice if the book is well crafted. With the exception of the lucid description of the standard model and clear critique of this model, the book is a scattershot of arguments of tangential relevance and quite excessively too long. The same points are belabored again and again. It is safe to say that the first or second time you come across a repetitive paragraph, you may put the book down for good. You won't have missed much, if anything, of relevance.<br /><br />The authors do go beyond their rather academic critique of modern finance theory to suggest that bad financial theory was largely responsible for the economic crisis, with the implication that if we reform our economic theory of financial markets, there will be no future bubbles of the sort that recently almost destroyed several economies. This claim does not ring true. Bloated state mortgage institutions (Freddy and Fanny), the Federal Reserve Board's complicity in flooding the economy with cheap credit, the irrational present-oriented incentive structure of financial services, the complicity of auditing firms with their clients, and mystical financial innovations such as credit default swaps also contributed to financial fragility.again and again.

B002ZG97RY|5.0|When I finished watching this movie, my first reaction was that it wasn't telling me anything new, so I wasn't all that impressed.  But as I reflected further on the movie, I came to realize that it actually does a fine job of portraying several important themes, often in a fairly subtle way, in no small part because the movie is well crafted and the acting is solid (Matt Damon has yet to disappoint me).<br /><br />These themes include disunity among Americans and Iraqis (not just between them), exploitation of the media through misinformation (and the media's susceptibility to such exploitation because of their own agendas), naive and hubristic miscalculations and misjudgments on the part of American leaders and strategists, the suffering of ordinary Iraqi people, pervasiveness of war crimes, the overall ugliness of war and occupation, etc.  Of course, being semi-fictional, the movie is surely not accurate in all of the specifics, but the overall portrayal of what happened is consistent with what's known to the public today.<br /><br />In the end, I found this movie disturbing, which means that it does its job well.  And, of course, we *should* be disturbed given what happened in Iraq and is still happening there today ...
B0044XV3QY|5.0|There have been many reviews that have covered many aspects of this film (including the different release levels that include different content), so I will be brief and just provide my take.    Obviously the plot of this story is not original, but the movie as a whole gives an awesome effect that leaves me exhilarated every time I watch it. The graphics are great and really show you what Bluray can do.    I bought this set as it came with the deleted scenes, which is what I really wanted to see.    I don't care about the 3D part as I don't think 3D adds as much to the film as suggested, so for me it was a great purchase.
B001F3FUK6|1.0|The film is a turgid remake, dead in the water since its inception. The only good thing going for it is Brandon Routh, but, alas, he isn't given a single moment to shine. Superman Returns lowers the bar even further for paper-thin plots pumped with money and cgi to inflate it into a two and half hour sleepfest.    The plot is simply incomprehensible. What, Superman decided to take a trip? He took off for a five year round trip and then managed to land back in his mom's backyard without leaving a post-it mentioning that he was leaving the Earth to fend for itself? Everyone gets huffy about it now? Luthor's super-genius idea is to make Kryptonite-land? It all doesn't matter because, in the end, what director Bryan Signer is most interested in is hommage-ing the Donner original so much, and so badly it makes Scary Movie seem like high art.    This time around Supie is saddier; he's troubled and mopey because he has to sacrifice. The Superman comic has always dealt with these issues; a godlike character that is orphaned in a world of people he must protect but cannot be a part of because of what he has to do. It's what makes Superman such a tragic figure and provides for recurring readings. A god amongst men.    Sadly, the film does NOTHING with that theme and whenever it falters it throws even-more-cgi in our face to make us forget that it is faltering. Not once did I get the tingly sensation of watching Superman do something super! And what's with casting etchasketch actors like James Marsden and Kate Bosworth?! The idea of going from a comic to live action is to FLESH OUT the characters not dilute them even further. I guess the thinking is that \\"if it's a movie based on a comic then we must make the characters flatter and even more two dimensional because comics are for idiots.\\"    Who cares about yet another blank vanilla character that James Marsden has to play? Singer's heterophobic obsession with straight-shooting husbands reaches a new acme with this bland ramshackle family that has been built around the once-feisty character of Lois Lane. And frankly, when I go into a film called Superman Returns I'd rather see more Superman than Lois Lane's misadventures with humdrum family life.    And it is such a missed opportunity because they monkey-trained Brandon Routh to channel Christopher Reeve's soul from the grave and he pulls it off! Not only a pretty face, Routh manages to be a convincing Superman- it's just a shame that he barely has anything to say or do!    The real fault here, lies squarely in Mr Singer's necrophiliac obsession with the Donner film which, despite being almost 30 years its senior, is still fresher at every turn. Singer lifts entire tracts of dialogue, shots, music, a dead Marlon Brando, and sets from the original and they simply outshine his work by aeons. Where the original had chemistry between the leads, we are presented with stilted dialogue and blank stares. Where a god was ushered into a cold reality by a dead father, we have Supes hearing remixed mashups of, well, the same dead father except that Brando is really dead now. Where witty banter was dished out, we have Kevin Spacey mincing every word to extend it long enough to fill the dead space.    This film is nothing but a bloated effigy of the original and sags at every seam in a manner that made me swear off paying 8.50 pounds to watch anything at the theatre anymore.

If you thrive on gratuitous violence of many sorts - this is the book for you. I have heard of these books being compared to the Harry Potter series. I'll take HP any day.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Love this movie. Every few months I play it again. I so wish they would have used better judgment in which scenes to delete and which to keep in the movie. For instance, I think the school teacher and her sick partner was touching and should have been kept. Also the old rock star's meeting with the record producers was hilarious, also should have been kept. What I think should have been removed was all the scenes with the necked stand-in couple. They just seemed out of place in this movie - if I wanted to see naked couples, I would have rented a different movie. Also the sound track is great - which I also purchased keep it in the car. Otherwise this movie is in my all time top 10.

B00008K7AM|3.0|This is a good movie and that's about as far as I'll go with it. What you get with the HOT CHICK is a switcheroo movie like Freaky Friday, Like Father Like Son, Wish Upon a Star, 17 Again, 18 Again!, Big and 13 Going on 30. In other words, the concept has been done many many many times. The big difference here is that Rob Schneider, a dirty, sleazy plumber, switches places with Hot Chick Cheerleader and all around popular socialite Jessica (Rachel McAdams).<br /><br />This gives Rob Schneider some ample time to show off his hilarious girly side. The problem is, this was Rachel McAdam's first big film in the U.S. and who would have known, at the time that this film came out, that she was gonna be the huge star that she is right now.  Well, anybody who saw the film and the few scenes that she was in, would have known.  Every single fleeting scene that she participated in was hilarious.<br /><br />To watch McAdams portray Rob Schneider was equally or even more hilarious than Schneiders portrayal of her. Yet, once the transformation takes place, we barely see McAdams anymore. This, to me, is the problem. The filmmakers focused all their attention on Schneiders side of the story and lost many opportunities to use McAdams comedic talents.<br /><br />THE HOT CHICK is still a good movie and better than most comedies that come out these days, especially because this is where Rachel McAdams launched from. This is where Rachel McAdams showed how good and funny she was... unfortunately, the creators of THE HOT CHICK didn't have the foresight to use her more.

B003UESJFG|4.0|I'm not gonna say this is one of the best superhero movies of all time, although it just may be, but I will say that what MEGAMIND does, changes the game for future superhero movies. While Spiderman 3 spent most of its time in restaurants, cooking dinners and talking about romance, MEGAMIND spent its time flying, soaring and dazzling with amazing 3D effects that give the city depth and give the audience a true and awe-inspiring feeling of actually FLYING.<br /><br />Future live-action superhero movies are gonna have to up-the-anty sometime REAL SOON. Iron Man 2, had surprisingly little action and shot all of its action load in 2 very well done scenes. Yet, for the rest of the film, Iron Man's costume was locked away in Stark's lab while he struggled with depression because he was dieing, mulled over his childhood and shot fruit in a drunken stooper.<br /><br />MEGAMIND is always interesting and always moving and able to do things that most superhero movies can't. Not to mention, after viewing it in 3D, any superhero movie in the future, that involves flying and isn't in 3D, is dropping the ball.<br /><br />MEGAMIND has personality, emotion, laughs, action and TWISTS and turns that I found refreshing in a 'so-called' kids movie. If there is such a thing anymore. Because this movie and many like it, aren't just for kids anymore. MEGAMIND is a true pleasure on all levels and will be enjoyable for all ages for a long time.

This series continues the story where the Percy Jackson series ended, and many of the same characters are in it, but so are some new ones.  The main addition, Jason, will apparently be the lead character for this series.  He enters this story with no memory and much of the book has him trying to figure out who he is.  Jason, along with the other new additions Piper and Leo are introduced and developed in this book as they go on a quest to free a trapped goddess.  As with the Percy Jackson books, this one is full of non-stop action and includes plenty of set-up for the additional books to come.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Honestly i didnt expect that this album would be such a great album...with the perfect mix of R&B and some reggae sounds, with incredible lyrics and hooks made this album worth listen. Excellent Album
B000FZESY4|5.0|This is one of my favorite OPETH albums. I am a huge fan of this band's unique style and have almost every major album they have made. Ghost Reveries is my definately one of thier best efforts.
B0019N8P2W|4.0|Although the dimension of the thoughtfully and artfully selected original music samples is missing, the presence of all those censored little scenes and the extras that were missing from the syndicated broadcasts (that were hacked into the bootleg set) make up for it.    This is a full quality studio release, and I am happy to have it. But had they offered it with all those hard-to-license tracks, I'd have willingly paid $15-20 more for the set.
B002G1X350|3.0|My wife, My three neer-teen and teen girls and I really dig Leaves Eyes. This is the third album by this Nordic band and it is good. It is not as good as thier previous works and I don't know if it was good enough for the band. It seems rushed together, despite the fact that it took several years to get out. We listen to it, but it isn't as good as \\"Lovelorn\\" or \\"Norwegian Lovesong\\"
0316017922|4.0|Good book. The analysis of the 'Outliers' in the society reminds me of the famous Indian philosophy called \\"sthala mahatmya, kul mahatmya, kaal mahatmya\\" (importance of right place, right family, and right time).  Just one thing though, I would have more liked including the story of the world famous cricket outlier -- Sachin Tendulkar! :)  Not having any special mention of any Indian outlier (except for the names of Ambani brothers in a list) hurts.
B000069HZP|3.0|If you're looking for an unpredictable thriller movie, you'll probably like \\"The Game\\". It's well acted, and it will keep you at the edge of your seat wanting to know what the ending will be. The main character may even resemble someone you know. Nicholas (played by Michael Douglas) is sort of a boring but rich, middle-aged man who feels himself to be superior to his wild and less stable brother Conrad (played by Sean Penn). As a birthday gift, Conrad gets Nicholas a chance to play \\"The Game\\", in hopes that it will change Nicholas's life for the better.<br /><br />Throughout the film, you are taken on a suspenseful and rather violent adventure. When you reach the end, however, you find out the twist, and it is rather disappointing considering all the blood, sweat, and tears Nicholas had to go through to play the \\"game\\". I understand that Conrad was hoping the \\"game\\" would enrich his brother, but he could have done that without threatening the safety of his life. Sure, this is just a movie, so it's okay that the ending is unrealistic given everything that happened, but the movie still takes itself seriously in communicating that sometimes people need thrills to positively change their life. But frankly, I don't see how that would work if the thrills end your life rather than change it. There are other movies out there that more effectively express that one should cherish their life more.<br /><br />Despite the drawbacks, \\"The Game\\" is still a good, action-packed movie to watch once.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|This is another outstanding film from Spielberg/Hanks showing very powerful scenes regarding the graphic horror of war, the emotions of the soldiers, friends, and relatives in various stages of the war, from start to finish. I just watched the 10th episode of the Pacific and I wish it had many more, besides the special episodes, it could have easily had many more episodes. It takes many episodes to develop the many characters that weave in and out through the series. I watched Band of Brothers many times before I thought I fully understood many of the character's roles. Band of Brothers is the ultimate masterpiece of war movies, with Saving Private Ryan and The Pacific both a very close 2nd. They shouldn't be compared to one another, but augment and round out the historical perspective of World War II. I didn't like all the episodes of The Pacific, but I could say the same about Band of Brothers. There are many excellent reviews here, and I don't want to repeat much of the same, but if you enjoyed Band of Brothers and Saving Private Ryan, you will probably enjoy many of the episodes, if not all.    These movies also provide me with some personal healing, since it helps me to understand my deceased father, who lost his leg in Belgium in World War II. The aftermath of war takes it's toll on many people, and Spielberg/Hanks bring out the emotions and postwar trauma in The Pacific and BOB. My heartfelt thanks go out to all military personnel past/present/future for protecting our freedom.
B002VPE1AW|3.0|Overall, while the movie is visually dramatic and slightly overstimulating, the story was lacking in depth, as were the characters.  I expected a \\"wow\\" story based on all the media hype.<br />The story follows the main character, a Marine, who is dealing with the loss of use in his legs, and the loss of his brother.  He's offered a unique assignment, to take his brother's place, on a distant planet, in a sort of scientific experiment of sorts.  Even though he has no training (his brother trained for months or years), he accepts.  Why?  Boredom, lack of direction, curiosity, or stupidity, you name it.  He arrives on the planet, to step into his new job, and his brother's shoes, and oh yeah, take over his brother's Avatar, the science grown alien body that he can link his conscious mind to (because he has the same DNA as his brother) so he can learn about, study, and infiltrate the alien species that the military has interest in.<br />This movie, is obviously, hands down, visually amazing.  I'm not sure anyone could deny that.  The things they did and pushed to do, with technology are astounding, really.  And the movie is very visual.  I did find myself thinking, it was overdone.  It felt to me as if there was too much going on visually, like they overdid the visual effects and animation, just because they could.  And I don't think it needed all of it (example: how every plant in the new world did something extraordinary).<br />However, I found the story lacking.  It lacked depth in story and in characters.  I don't think it had anything to do with the actors.  I wasn't hooked on the Marine, as a person of interest and the main character, the hero of the movie.  I wasn't hooked on his world, and his plight.  I wasn't captured by his story, his dreams or his demons.  I didn't buy in to him at all.  I was more captured by the amazing visuals, that the hero was more like \\"okay, whatever\\".<br />In stark contrast, \\"Terminator\\", one of Cameron's previous films, everyone was hooked to Sarah Conner.  The edge of your seat, hold your breath, hooked on what was going to happen to her, that you ended up becoming a huge cheerleader for her survival.  Even, \\"Titanic\\" had a captivating story.  Not so with this movie's story or characters.<br />A bit of a let down for me.<br />I'm undecided on whether I would buy this for my collection or not.  This movie would be a purchase if I had to have just for the visuals and the action, otherwise I would pass.  It is worth seeing, just to see how far technology has come, if that type of thing interests you.h Conner.

B003CJJYLM|5.0|Breaking Bad is the best television drama on the air at this time.  Smart and witty, the writing is great, the acting superb.  The third season crawls deeper into the drug world and demonstrates the affects it inevitably takes upon the guilty, as well as the innocent.  Worth owning...
0385737955|4.0|This is a science fiction book that will appeal to teenagers who like action adventure books. Thomas wakes up and finds himself in an elevator which takes him to a place called the Glade, inside a maze. Thomas instantly wants to become a runner (a person who's goal is to try and find a way out of the maze and avoid dangerous mechanical blobs called grievers). After Teresa shows up, they realize how much of the maze is a riddle.   The reason why I rated the 4 stars is because it was a very good book. Some of you may feel like I did and find that the ending was disappointing but that doesn't take away from how fast the action moves the plot.
0375851569|4.0|My daughter (2 yrs old) loves these Dr. Suess books.  Her favorite is \\"Hop on Pop,\\" which she happens to do all the time.  She's memorized lines from the books that she repeats throughout the day.  It's quite cute.  We read at least one and usually two every night at bedtime.  I would recommend this collection to any parent who is encouraging their child to read.
B00417HV14|3.0|As a person who loves Joe and the dvd version of this concert I was excited to see that it was coming out on blu ray. My only negative about the dvd was the video quality was very up and down. close ups of Joes finger work excellent. Shots of joes face washed out etc. The blue ray is no better and definitely not worth the upgrade. The sound on both are excellent so save your money and just enjoy this fantastic performance.
B0042JTDXK|2.0|I bought Josh's new albumn as a pre-order so I didn't get a chance to listen to it first. I never thought I would need to. I see other reviews written here are glowing but in all truth, I can't follow suit. I find the album hard to listen to. To me, there's not much musically pleasing in regards to melody, harmony, and even the lyrics. There are a few ok songs particularly the first one which is an intrumental which leads you to think that this prelude sets the tone for the rest but it doesn't. I found the music going back and forth, this and that way, trying to come to a conclusion.    Writing this feels like I'm bad mouthing one of my mother's newest dessert recipes that I didn't like. I love my mother and love what Josh Groban has become and what awesome music he's provided us over the years. So as I won't eat my mother's new dessert creation, I can't also listen to this album again. I love you both but don't care for your new creation.
B004498KPU|2.0|Now, I 'm not going to go through every single song that is on the box set, the other reviewers did it for you. I'm also not going to sucker folks into buying something just because of the NAME. This set was made very sloppy, from GRAINY, DARK scenes, that I didn't recall in \\"The You Make Me Feel\\", to the annoying letter box, in every single video. I have 3 different videos of this song on DVD, not EVER did I see that grainy, horrible scene on those other DVDS. The other BIG problem are the LETTER BOXES. What the hell was the point to do that? Yes, the AUDIO is great, if I just cared about that, I would just BUY the ALBUMS, you get me?     Let's not \\"praise\\" this set, as the FIRST reviewer did, BEFORE the set was even released. So I don't know why he has so much positive feedback, or people that \\"agree\\" with him. When clearly he didn't even WATCH the set before he posted his review. He just wrote the information down for each Music Video, what kind of REVIEW is that?? We want REAL CUSTOMER reviews, to tell us the truth about the products. It seems the First Reviewer might of worked for Sony, or just really doesn't  know the meaning of \\"review\\", and why so many people agreed, I don't know. I got suckered in by his review as well, thinking everything was fine, before I purchased the set last week. Don't be fooled MJ FANS!! Don't listen to the FIRST REVIEW, its not that GOOD AT ALL.    But if your comfortable with watching a \\"TINY black bar screen box, inside a BIG black bar screen box\\", then this set is JUST for you.    I just ordered BOTH History On Films 1 & 2, Dangerous (The Short Films), and Number One's.    This Box Set is only worth the unreleased videos, HONESTLY, thats it. Again, I really don't care about the \\"sound\\", thats what the MJ CD'S in my STEREO or COMPUTER are for. So if you're like me, and you expect the FULL experience of these classic films, in its FULL entirety, your NOT going  to get it by purchasing this box set.    Buy the other OFFICIAL DVDs of MJ FIRST, if you don't have them already. Just buy this box set used, if you can find one. Trust me, I wouldn't lie to my fellow MJ fans...
B003UBTX72|4.0|I just assumed that Keith Richards had his autobiography ghost written.  That was evidently not the case.  Keith lays all his excesses on the table for us to marvel at the sheer audacity of his journey (and what probably should have been an extremely short one) in his own inimitable \\"voice\\".  Although I'm not a complete innocent when it comes to the fast lane, his experience and narration of it had me wincing, reeling, singing and chortling throughout.  I also learned to appreciate his vast artistic talents and not having been a Rolling Stones fan (ever), I find myself drawn to perhaps buy a CD and try to get into it.  Yeah, it was that good!  Enjoy it, buddy.  I did!
0446618322|3.0|I loved 99% of this book. I want that Dog. The kid too.  My only gripe was the climax that I believe lost its punch, Trying to make even the bad guy really a good guy at the end not a good idea. It left me feeling like it did not care what happened to him one way or another. It still was a good read. I love Nickholas Sparks he is one of my Favorites.
0060853972|3.0|The most esteemed messirs Pratchett and Gaiman have teemed up to deliver a good amount of hilarity for the events of a modern era apocalypse. For the most part, it is quite amusing although there is a slight feeling of tedium at times.<br /><br />Most of the story focuses on Aziraphale and Crowley (angel and demon respectively), who seem to like being on earth having stayed there for the last 4004 years. They try to delay the Apocalypse much to the dismay and wrath of their superiors.<br /><br />The book is not an in-depth look at the end of the world, rather it is a comedy as with all works I have encountered of Terry Pratchett. It's fun and lighthearted but perhaps not quite special or absurd enough to be great.
0321356683|5.0|Simply, if you are a amateur or professional programmer who works with Java you must own this book. Excellent advice presented in a easy to use and fun to read format.
0547258305|4.0|Katsa has been blessed with a gift for killing, \\"a grace.\\"  She is forced to play the role of thug enforcer for the king. She ends up fighting a different battle.<br /><br />I think I would have liked Graceling more a few years ago in my teen/pre-teen era. It was somewhat sanitized since its target audience is younger than me. It's a great start for a series and I felt that perhaps the story itself could have been longer, but again it's for a younger audience so I understand. Unfortunately, it lacks a certain amount of intensity and depth, which make some other YA books much better.<br /><br />The magic system in this book isn't so much magic as it is simply those who have special abilities so perhaps more akin to super heroes rather than a magic system. It's certainly an interesting take on how something like this would impact a world.
0062009540|4.0|Not the finest piece of literature, but a real page turner! I literally could not put it down. Recommended for a fun light read.
0316044938|4.0|The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold has created a way to express what the life of a person who has passed might be like. Sebold's creativity lets you imagine things out of this world and feel the pain of losing a loved one. This story might not be suitable for girls that have not been explained the \\"birds and the bees\\" but defiantly will be a great reading for girls around the age of 13. The movie does NOT compare to the book, as though it has other views of the origin it still isn't the same, I recommend reading the book first.
B0042RUMEQ|1.0|How can anyone in good conscience give this crap anything other than 1 star? If it were left up to me this album, or whatever you call it, wouldn't get any stars. For a self-proclaimed 5-star chick, she sure did put out one crappy album. I have no other words except this is by far the worst album I've ever heard. Pink Friday has no substance and for something that took nearly 2 years to create, it seemed thrown together. A 10 year-old could have created a better product. I was once a fan of Nicki's but there's no way I can continue to co-sign garbage.
0374531269|4.0|Close your eyes and imagine yourself in Sierra Leone, a country that has a history of strife and civil wars, living comfortably with your family and friends.  Then in an instant, all of that is taken away, leaving you in a world of pain, fear, and death.         This is the story of Ishmael Beah, a native boy of Sierra Leone.  His tale starts with the establishment of his personal history and lifestyle, telling you of the bonds he shares with his classmates, and the love for his family.  Him and his village hear of the news of a rebel army massacring and burning entire villages, leaving those fortunate enough to have been absent at the slaughter without food, water, a home, and loved ones.  He never predicted that such a tragedy would befall him, yet in a sudden attack by rebel fighters, he and some of his friends were split from their families, left to wander the land in search of sanctuary.         After surviving with the remainder of his classmates, he stumbles upon the government army, who soon recruit him and his friends into service.  After seeing all the effects of the brutality war has to offer, Ishmael is now experiencing first hand what humans are capable of doing.         This is the story of Ishmael Beah, a native boy of Sierra Leone, and his trek through loss, war, and rehabilitation into normal society.  I would highly recommend this book to teenagers and young adults who wish to know the lives of individuals who inhabit a country in a state of civil war, and how these experiences affect their lives forever.
B003EYVXXW|5.0|This movie is pure art and should be nominated for Oscar.It shows us how religion is a cancer of society and without it the world would be a better place.It is a shame that even in the 21st century people still believe in these outdated primitive dogmas.
B0042UE0RS|3.0|I thought that remastered meant the sound quality would be greatly improved, but it isn't.  Thank heavens it only cost $1.99 (black friday sale).  The digital booklet is only 4 pages, with two cool photos of John.  However, if you already have these songs on CD, you don't need this.
030726999X|5.0|I am so sad this is the last book.  I really grew to love the characters.  I feel like the book cleared up alot of questions from the first two books, but still left me hanging at the end.
0316098337|5.0|Unlike other similar plots, this story is told from the perspective of a child, which gives it a unique twist. I was unable to put the book down. However, I was left with a feeling that the author could have written more because I was left feeling that it all happened too fast!  I highly recommend this book.
B001HN694K|5.0|Fearing that another classic would be mangled, I went apprehensively, especially since I am not a huge Tim Burton fan. I thoroughly enjoyed it! It is not a retelling of the classic, but rather a sequel. Most of the characters are there, and handled with a wonderful new hand, in a wonderland that is, well... wonderful. The tale itself is largely based on the poem \\"Jabberwocky\\" expanded to story length of course. Beneath the obvious story, it is rich with archetypes and, of course, The Heroes Journey, which is alway an inspiring classic when well told. And this IS well told, helped along by a long lingering question, \\"What ever happened to Alice?\\" I found myself telling others about it and so, months later, I find myself needing to buy it to share with friends who love a good story.

B000NA28I4|3.0|Eragon (Widescreen Edition) is a movie based on the book by the same title by Christopher Paolini. Not having read the books I did not come in with any expectations how it should be. However, even so I do have the feeling that the movie feels short. The storyline could have been much more developed and some of the scenes just seem rushed. For instance the growth of the dragon happens in an instance. The special effects are alright but nothing special. While I am not a disappointed as many as the other reviewers I can still say that I can only give this movie a 3 out of 5. Maybe a directors cut will come and settle things right. 3/5.
B0036EH3XE|3.0|I was hoping for a somehow meaningful ending to various mysteries in the series. However, the season does not only leave most questions unanswered but also damages the character profiles i.e., characters seem bold-gutsy in previous 4-5 seasons all of a sudden appear weak, unsure of themselves and so on.    All in all a rather disappointing end
B001P9EQH8|2.0|Okay, here's the thing, it works. That is all I can say. Now into my review  I have been using these with a lot of different headphones. I have used different skull candies, sennheisers, sony, technica, I have even used the relatively overhyped monster beats on these things. There isn't any real improvement on anything. The base and sound quality with or without is virtually the same, at least to my ears. I honestly did not expect a whole lot from these guys to be frank, but my friend recommended it to me. However, after countless uses, I could not find any real noticable difference. I honestly didn't want to believe I bought a completely useless product so I decided to test it on my mini speakers to try find a difference in vibration. I maxed out the volume, maybe pissed off the neighbors, but I found the difference. At max volume on the amplifier, the mini speakers would shake consistently as opposed to having the bass booster off. Not the most accurate way to measure ohms but it is the most effective way to confirm if there is ANY change. On the mini speakers, there is actually a really significant change. Bass boost off, the speakers stay fairly still, but when turned on, it shakes fairly vigorously. There was no drastic increase in volume so it couldn't just be a volume increase. As a joke, I decided to use my iPhone ear buds to see if anything changed, and to my surprise there is a slight change. It almost, ALMOST seemed like there was some bass on the buds.  Would I recommend these to anyone? Probably not. It is advertised as a headphone amp but the only noticeable difference is from when I used it with the speakers. Now there may have been a change in the headphones, I just didn't notice it. Use all the tech instruments you want if you want to test these, but with human ears, I got nothing. This may just be me, or I may have just got the short end of the straw and got a crap quality one. However, I did find it funny when I used the ear buds.

0061689246|5.0|The thing that amazes me about Neil Gaiman is how he can write in so many different styles, yet it never seems forced. His voice always stays consistent and works perfectly, so no matter what genre or medium he is writing in, his writing is unmistakable and remarkably unique.<br /><br />Stardust is a lot different than Anansi Boys or American Gods, which are very much in the same vein, and it is different from Neverwhere. I'd liken it more to some of his short fiction that can be found in Smoke and Mirrors. This is a throwback, classic fairy tale, yet one that is ever so dark. The characters have that magical feel to them, yet they are so well rounded and flawed that you almost forget that you are ready a fairy tale.<br /><br />The world that Gaiman creates is alive and breathing, breathtaking and horrifying, and full of wicked people. Enter this world and good luck putting this book down!<br /><br />Gaiman is a huge influence on me, and if you'd like to read some of my own writing, check it out at: [...]
0061433047|3.0|I thoroughly enjoy the \\"Tiffany Aching\\" series that takes place amongst Terry Pratchett's Discworld books, but not so much because of the main character, Tiffany Aching. The real enjoyment in reading these books for me are the Nac Mac Feegles, miniature pixies (for lack of a more accurate designation) who live to steal, fight, and kill anyone whom they consider a threat, an annoyance, or who simply finds themselves in the Feegles' line of sight when they're in need of a cure for boredom. They speak with a Scottish Brogue, believe that the Discworld is a heaven and that they must have been very good to have been sent there, and are fiercely loyal to Tiffany Aching, a teenage witch who has reciprocated their loyalty in the past.       In this, the fourth book in the series, Tiffany, who is finally starting to feel comfortable with her role and abilities as a witch, finds herself up against a force or presence that she inadvertently woke up at the conclusion of Wintersmith.
B0043URV8M|3.0|Alexandre Desplat has created a fairly strong score but it doesn't sound like a Harry Potter movie.  Worse, nothing outside of \\"Obliviate\\" will be recognizable outside the film.  He missed a great opportunity to wring out tears by using a melancholy, mournful \\"Hedwig's Theme\\" early on with the death of a character.  Why choose to score a Harry Potter movie if you aren't interested in using the established themes and adapting them to the new situations?  That sonic development mirrors character development and increases the emotional pull.  Film scoring 101.<br /><br />Intriguing but not very fulfilling.

0765326353|4.0|I really enjoyed The Way of Kings.  It did seem to drag a little in the middle, but all was necessary to setup the ending and future books.  The characters were well developed, believable and mostly likable.  Kaladin is an awesome character, my favorite.  Szeth, however, is the most interesting in my opinion, an assassin with a very serious conscience.  I look forward to the next book.
B001E5FYS8|5.0|This is currently my favorite film.     I hesitated to see it for some time, thinking that I didn't want to sit through two hours about a guy who walked across a wire. When I finally did sit down to watch it, I was enthralled within the first few minutes. There is so much more to this film than meets the eye. (For example, it is one of the best world trade center memorial films, precisely because it doesn't aim to be.) The story is wonderfully and entertainingly told, the characters are genuine, and the film is emotionally powerful. The soundtrack is fantastic as well.    This film is absolutely magnificent. I consider my life enriched to have seen it.
0156034565|3.0|It is easy to see why Salmon Fishing in the Yemen has been so favorably reviewed by both professionals and readers.  It is a very funny book, some parts of which are uproarious, such as chapter 26, which comprises the script for a TV pilot game show, and other chapters of which will not fail to produce laughs and inward chuckles of varying intensity.  The book is an easy, quick read, and as political satire, Salmon Fishing in the Yemen is right on.  The marital troubles of Dr. Jones ring realistic, are maddening and interesting.  The device of having each chapter be either an email, interoffice memo, diary entry, memoir, interview, and even the record of debates in the British parliament, works surprisingly well, and provides the plot with a great deal of forward momentum and variety.  Yes, Paul Torday is a very clever writer, but, perhaps, too clever by half.  By choosing a gratuitous and unsatisfying ending, totally out of character with what has preceded it, Torday retroactively poisons his tale.  But, the greatest failure of the book is that the author appears to take himself too seriously, and ends up preaching to us about the transforming power of faith, using as his unlikely model, a mega rich sheikh who is embarked upon an extravagant, vanity project.  Ultimately, I felt the author was somewhat of a trickster and that I was his all too willing victim.  Like all good cons, he had me with him until the last chapter.  This is a book one could well skip.  It ended on empty.

B001IBIHQ4|4.0|While there were a few technical items in error (Marines wore khaki uniforms at the landing at Guadacanal and the landing boats were wrong) the overall inpression was very good at showing the true nature of the war in the Pacific.
0143112724|3.0|It's alright. I had to buy this book for school, so I am not too thrilled about reading it, but it's definitely informative and explains everything to you like you were a child, so it's a quick way to study basic composition, including grammar.
B00408MS5S|4.0|Anyone who goes through the trouble of leaving a review is usually a die-hard fan and I am no exception.  As my headline says, this Deluxe edition is very good but it could have been great. I am not an audiophile or sound guy but the songs do sound great, so no problem there.  I have just a little nitpicking to do with the live songs that bring it from 5 stars down to 4 stars (though I would have given 4.5 stars if possible).    1 -Five of the twelve live tracks are already on Paris. Not the exact same recordings as on Paris, but if it's the same tour the songs will sound pretty much the same. Maybe between Paris and this disc we hear all of the songs that were part of the tour set list, I don't know, but if they had others available it would have been nice to hear them. I too would have loved to have heard a live Gone Hollywood, Lord Is It Mine, Poor Boy, Sister Moonshine, etc but like I said, perhaps they were not part of the tour set list and were therefore not available.    2 - Too bad they decided to shorten EITQM (one of my favorites) by leaving out the part after the second verse where Roger sings lines like \\"Lord won't you come and get into my life?\\", \\"Say won't you please. Stay won't you please\\", \\"Oh Lord don't go\\" etc. (If you know the song, you know what I'm talking about). I mean, how often is a live version of a song almost a minute and a half shorter than the studio version? And if you exclude the 47 seconds of intro time here that's about what it is. Perhaps minor, but still too bad.       Bottom line? Great to hear anything previously unreleased from Supertramp so definitely treat yourself and get this Deluxe Edition.     P.S. As for the whole Rick and Roger he said/she said thing they have going on, just a few comments. 1-Whether they had a formal agreement to not sing each other's songs or just a verbal agreement, I don't know and I don't care. Rick should NOT sing any of Roger's songs.  Not because I feel he's trying to capitalize on Roger's musicor it's unethical but just because he does not need to!!  He's got plenty of his own music to play, songs that fans would LOVE to hear live.  (Speaking of which if you're looking for live versions of Oh Darling and Just Another Nervous Wreck, they are on the Live '88, though it may be tough to find.)  Heck, even if he played songs from just the post-Roger albums I would still love it (excluding the Mark Hart songs). 2 - They should just put the animosity aside, reunite, and tour together as the REAL Supertramp. And come to the USA!!
B004E9CFZG|2.0|Walking dead is a combination of B-grade zombie movie, the tv show Survivor and the tv show Lost. It is very slow paced and lacks tension for most of the episodes. The acting involves too much acting and there are not enough zombies. The main characters sit around and mope far too much as they apparently wait for the studio to hire a semi-competent writer who could liven things up. The pacing is pretty much exactly the same on Survivor.    It feels entirely contrived.
B003FSTN7A|5.0|This was the first season after I got into the show, and it was fantastic!  Can't wait to relive it again, especially given this current season will be the last.
B002ZG98LO|5.0|I usually don't bother with director commentary but I did find it fun in this case.  I love some of the stylistic ways they honored the original such as \\"the last stand of Billy\\".  Getting original music back was another nice touch including the 1st song as the credits role.  The updates were neat in my book.  A great action flick with cool monsters.  I still think it's amazing that they did this with the same budget as the 1st one.    Edit:  After writing this is someone's comment section I felt it deserved to be part of my review:      Sometimes I wish Aliens started out more like this. One of my all time favorite movies but esp. after the 1st time you almost have to skip the 1st 45 minutes of \\"boredome\\" & start rewatching from then on. No need here. No real slow points. The beauty of Predators is that the whole movie is fun on multiple viewings from start to finish. At least that's my opinion.
B003ZJ0ZX0|3.0|Bruno Mars has, almost overnight, become pretty recognizable in the music industry.  He's like the male equivalent of Nicki Minaj.  If you want a slick vocal to lace your chorus lines, you call Mars (just like if you want a catchy female rapper to spice up your remix you call Minaj).<br /><br />`Doo-Wops & Hooligans' marks Mars' solo effort.<br /><br />There is no denying that Bruno Mars has a beautifully toned voice.  His vocals are crisp and smooth and delightful to listen to.  From the show he made with select radio singles, Mars wet our appetite and got us hooked with his hooks.  We wanted to hear more.  Sadly, this debut album doesn't really deliver 100 percent.  In fact, it leaves a lot to be desired.<br /><br />It's kind of mediocre.<br /><br />In a nutshell, I still love `Just The Way You Are'; it's a beautiful yet simple take on love and I fell for it immediately.  `Grenade' almost feels like the dark side to the first single.  The construction is similar, just more intense.  I like the song, although I must admit that the lyrical content on the chorus can be a tad obvious, which I'm not really a fan of.  It's like `lyrics 101'; very amateur writing.  His conviction though, is very convincing.  `Count on Me' sounds like a Jason Mraz song.  It has a bouncy and catchy vibe.  It's a little cheesy in parts (well, almost all parts) but it will get you swaying to the beat and it's a sweet song.  I know that `Marry Me' is all sorts of ridiculous cheesiness, but I totally adore it.  Maybe it has something to do with the whole `Glee' take on it last week, but I just swallow that track up with nothing short of wholehearted affections.<br /><br />`Talking to the Moon' is a sweet ballad, but it lacks any real punch to make it wholly memorable.  His voice sounds great, but it doesn't `pop' aesthetically.  `The Lazy Song' is just stupid.  It isn't really funny or witty; it's just lazy and amateur.  I mean, aside from the sexual connotation, it seems like a children's song, like commercialized Smash Mouth.  To say I hate the song would be an understatement.  `Runaway Baby' is fun and stands out because of the audaciousness of it all.  It has a spunky and vibrant vibe, so I thoroughly enjoy it, even if the lyrics seem contradictory.<br /><br />I know `Our First Time' is supposed to be seductive and sexy but it's rather bland and boring.<br /><br />The vampire craze hit Mars, so he closed his album with `The Other Side' where he enlists the help of `it-man' Cee-Lo Green and that mediocre flash in the pan known as B.o.B. to help him spit a few verses about convincing some chick to convert to vampirism.  Um, it's a decent track when all is said and done.  It's catchy and stylish, but there is something missing from it.  `Liquor Store Blues' is just weird.  I mean, reggae is not something you just `mess' with.<br /><br />It just doesn't work.<br /><br />So, in the end the album is just kind of `meh'.  I mean, I like some of the songs and then I actually love two or three of them, but overall the feeling I get is one of being increasingly under-whelmed, so I can't say that I really recommend this album as a whole.<br /><br />Download `Marry Me' and `Just The Way You Are'.say I hate the song would be an understatement.  `Runaway Baby' is fun and stands out because of the audaciousness of it all.

1400079144|2.0|The reviews on this have pretty well covered my thoughts, but I echo that this book suffers for need of a good editor. When you need a chapter of back story for each character in the book, you have to think that a good prologue is in order. I think you could easily cut a hundred pages of this book without impacting the story.   Also, the constant cliff hanger chapter endings get tiresome.  The elevation of Noetic (Research?) to a science is not only overdone, its hogwash (As grandpa used to say).  I will admit to enjoying the superhuman exploits of Robert Langdon, and I wonder what level of encryption would be necessary to stop the man? Clearly not pictographs based on obscure and ancient mathmatics. I did see a pretty good code on the wrapper of some Bazooka Bubble Gum....I wonder???

B003DZX3SA|5.0|My husband loves Beauty and the Beast. We have it on VHS, but the tape is dying (FINALLY!) so this release was very timely for us. I bought it for him for Christmas, and I am sure he will absolutely love it :)
B000AMJC2K|4.0|Excellent piece of gear to gain more space on my desk.  Fit and finish are great and it holds my 21\\" monitor without a problem.  My only caveat is the screen swivel (to rotate the screen).  If you don't torque the swivel securely the first time your monitor will flop sideways. Then, you're going to have to remove the monitor from the mount to get at the nut. You might want to have help if your monitor is large and heavy. Other than that it's a great product for the price.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Jazz comes to our eardrums with casual slivers of country grace in Norah Jones's debut album, `Come Away With Me'.  This review, a long time coming, isn't going to rehash half of what everyone else and their mother has already said.  In fact, I'll keep this short and sweet.  Jones has a beautiful voice, one that she uses to caress our ears and elevate her standard fare on the album.  What is so shocking about this album is its unapologetic simplicity.  The album is very subtle and barely moves tempo from one track to the next, and yet it doesn't hurt the overall impact thanks to Norah's slinky vocals that take the album to places it couldn't go alone.  Honestly, Jones has to watch that her songs don't start to run into one another, because when you dwell within a tightly confined musical aesthetic it becomes very easy to create songs that feel too familiar.  That happens a few times here, but when separated from the album as a whole, each of its parts sing beautifully.  Those who haven't heard this album (which I'm sure isn't many of you) should pick this up.  The rest of you, well, I'm sure you already listen to this album plenty.  It's a perfect `mood setter' and the album that launched one of the richest voices in modern years.<br /><br />For those interested; the five standouts are:<br /><br />1) Turn Me One (such a richly sensual song that spices up the album at just the right moment)<br />2) The Nearness of You (beautifully sung ballad that closes the album out flawlessly)<br />3) Cold Cold Heart (validates her jazz vocals while remaining classy and eloquent throughout)<br />4) Shoot the Moon (her country soul shines here by balancing out alongside her signature sound)<br />5) Come Away With Me (the albums title track and one of the most hauntingly recognizable songs of the past decade)

0765326353|5.0|This is actually the first time I've felt the need to review a book on Amazon although I am a voracious reader.  There is only one word to describe this book: spectacular.  I just could not put it down and am now anxiously awaiting book 2.  The character development, the plot, the setting, everything is extremely well done.  I will give you a word of warning, though.  Plan on losing some sleep when you are reading it.  I stayed up too late every night because I just had to see what happened next.
B003PIUC02|4.0|great series adult themed action, a cross between 300,gladiator and Rome.  Has nothing to do with the original spartacus/kirk douglas version beside the gladiator aspect.
6305161879|5.0|A Fish Called Wanda (1988) is for comedy what Citizen Kane is for drama, Godfather Part 1 and 2 for gangster epics, and 2001: Space Odyssey for science fiction  - it is one of the best in its genre. This is a work of the comic genius. It is always funny and never goes out of breath.  The film is shining and sparkling like the diamonds of the highest quality - just like these that made four thieves who have pulled the heist of their lives to stop at nothing, including lies, deceit, backstabbing, and betrayal, in order to possess them. The film was made 22 years ago but time has nothing over A Fish Called Wanda. It has not gotten outdated or stalled and it never will. It is a marvel that can be enjoyed over and over. AFCW has become a cult favorite for my family. Many quotes and jokes from the comedy are the part of our everyday conversations, and we use them often even forgetting where they came from:  \\"Disappointed!\\", \\"Don't call me stupid\\", \\"You have a beautiful speaking voice - when it works\\", \\"You British think you are so superior\\", \\"What was the part in the middle?\\", \\"Avoid the green ones. They're not ripe yet.\\" \\"When you say \\"friendly\\", what are we talking about here? Cordial? Courteous? Supportive? What?\\" There are many more.<br /><br />A Fish Called Wanda is a real \\"treasure\\", and it is not just my opinion. The film which was a great success with the critics and the box offices when it was released has been included in all possible lists of the funniest movies and the best comedies. I looked them all up. :) My younger son, who lists AFCW as one of his favorite comedies, wrote the review about it and posted on this very site. He says in the end of his review: \\"The film is close to 2 hours long, but the plot is so clever and well-structured that it's over before you know it. To me, that is one of the trademarks of a great film. You don't want this movie to end, and you're disappointed when it does.\\" I can add that as soon as it is over I want to watch it from the beginning and experience the magic of great movie making again. Very talented artists participated in making A Fish Called Wanda, and everything in the film turned out simply perfect. What makes the film truly funny all actors, including in the small cameos, created memorable characters because they had wonderfully constructed and written script to work with.  John Cleese deserves the first mention for his excellent triple work as the co-writer of the Oscar nominated script/co-director and the star in the role of Archie Leach, the well-mannered English gentleman whose marriage seems to be in crisis, the defender of George, the leader of the diamonds thieves who keeps the \\"key\\" to the coveted loot to himself. Cleese's partner Python - Michael Palin is excellent as shy, stuttering hit-man Ken who is secretly in love with Wanda, tenderly loves animals but is ready to help an inconvenient witness to \\"meet with an accident, even if it is a very old lady with a weak heart. Loud, pushy and sexually liberated Americans are represented in the film by Wanda (always charming and illuminating the screen Jamie Lee Curtis) and her lover Otto, the former CIA operative, the expert in all kinds of weapons (Kevin Kline in the Oscar winning performance) whom she introduces ad her brother. Wanda is as seductive and sexy as she is clever, unscrupulous, conniving and backstabbing. What she wants she sure will get. She is much cleverer than all men around her combined together but seems that in the end she might find the right man. And finally, Otto, \\"the ape who reads philosophy but does not understand it...the man so stupid that calling him stupid is insult to stupid people\\" who does not realize how vulgar and intellectually challenged he is. In the movie where there is no bad or boring performance at all, Kline is outstanding. A talented film and stage actor who has performed in many Shakespeare's plays, he would never have the role as brilliant and funny as Otto.<br /><br />You canwrite the volumes about A Fish Called Wanda but they will not explain its charm. One of the reasons that makes the film so funny is playing the differences or in this case, the conflicts and clashes between the different cultures, mentalities, ways of living, talking (even if the same language), behaving, presenting oneself. But it is just one of the reasons, there are many more.  I only add that there is documented the known death of a viewer from laughing while watching A Fish Called Wanda. It happened in Denmark in 1989. The audiologist named Ole Bentz laughed so hard while watching the film that his heart rate was pounding between 250 and 500 beats per minute which led to the fatal heart attack. It is certainly a tragedy but come to think of it, a person died while being happy on the top of enjoyment.  I envy such death.<br /><br />And finally, a famous Russian writer and poet of 19th century, Alexander Pushkin wrote in his play 'Mozart and Salieri', \\"If the sad and dark thoughts come to your mind, Just open a bottle of Champagne or Read again the \\"Marriage of Figaro.\\" (Translation is mine)<br /><br />I just would add - or watch again \\"A Fish Called Wanda.\\"volumes about A Fish Called Wanda but they will not explain its charm.

B001AQT11M|5.0|To attack a classic such as `Snow White' could be perceived as sacrilegious by some (or many) but I've never been one to completely shy away from a controversial opinion (note my particularly scathing reviews of `Rocky', `Avatar' and `The Terminator', not to mention my FOUR STAR assessment of `Gone With The Wind' for further proof) and so I will now attempt to state my case.<br /><br />Mind you, I absolutely loved this movie, gave it five stars and consider it one of the best films of the 30's, which was a very rich decade in the world of cinema.<br /><br />So I guess maybe attack isn't the right word to use.  Maybe it's more like `criticize' but in the slightest degree.  Maybe I should start with the positives here.  For Disney's first animated feature (you hear that?  FIRST!) it is beautiful to look at and it really stands the tests of time as far as a visual marvel.  Yes, many claim `Sleeping Beauty' to be that `landmark' in animation, and it was but this was the first one out the gate and look at how heartwarming the visuals make the soul.  The singing, while not as crisp and compelling as later years (I mean, Snow White pales in comparison to Ariel) has a long-lasting quality that adds a certain dynamic to the films overall preservation.  The character development, while seemingly minimal, is actually surprisingly deep, especially when one takes into account the complexities of the allegory.  While seemingly simple, the film's overall stance on the subject of aging and beauty is astute and poignant; and transcendent.<br /><br />With all these wonderful things to say about the film, one thing that bugs me to no end is the fact that this is considered one of the best Children's films of all time.  I have a hard time considering this a Children's film.  The themes are VERY dark and at times even disturbing.  There are always elements of danger and gloom present in Disney films, but there is something almost eerily barbaric about the message this film is presenting.<br /><br />I will kill you because you are prettier than me; and that fact is discussed very openly and without any restraint.<br /><br />\\"KILL HER!\\"<br /><br />\\"BRING ME HER HEART!\\"<br /><br />It can be somewhat scaring to a young child, especially a young girl.  Now one may balk and list other Disney films that have failed to receive the stigma that has been cast in \\"Snow Whites' direction, such as `The Lion King' or `Beauty and the Beast' and I am forced to consider the double standard that seems to be present, albeit relevant, in that the idea of a man being killed out of anger is far less scaring than the murder of a young girl.  Yes, `Snow White' is a classic, and as far as `films' go, this one is at the top of the pier, but denying the fact that the film could be terrifying to a young child is something I cannot do.ause you are prettier than me; and that fact is discussed very openly and without any restraint.    \\"KILL HER!\\"      \\"BRING ME HER HEART!\\"    It can be somewhat scaring to a young child, especially a young girl.

B000PWIF4G|5.0|I cannot wait to reread this book that I had read when it was first published in the early nineties.  As I recall, its poetic prose and moving story line are breath taking and troubling, all at once.  It's a haunting story that stays with you leaving behind compassion and understanding for those who've suffered great sorrows.  A must read!

B0046W5E0Y|5.0|Based on my delight with the first TinkerBell movie, I purchased the other two titles that are currently available and watched them all back to back. I can't wait for the fourth one (and I believe a fifth one is planned, as well). The other reviews capture my enthusiasm for these films, and I do not want to reiterate what they have already said. What makes me an unlikely viewer is that I am a 56-year-old male who's never had a child! After watching Crank 2: High Voltage the other day (over the top, but definitely entertaining), the TinkerBell films were such a change of ... pace! Anyway, I suppose if a 56-year-old guy can enjoy these films, anyone can---if they can just put aside the stigma associated with children's films (especially for the younger set), and watch with an open mind. The child in you will fall in love with TinkerBell. If you feel a bit embarrassed afterwards (for having enjoyed them so much at your age), then, hey, there's always Jason Statham to help you crank up your manlihood again!
B000G8NXZK|5.0|A simply splendid movie. This is one of those movies in which the script, direction, acting, set decoration, costuming, effects, makeup, cinematography, editing (in Gilliam's version) and everything else is done at the very highest level, and everything comes together perfectly. I have no doubt that future generations of filmakers will recognize this as a hugely influential movie.
B003N5VOUO|2.0|for unleashing this film on an unsuspecting world.   If you are considering purchasing or watching this film, let me save you a few dollars and three hours that you will never get back by summarizing the film for you. ...  There are two types of people in this world... good people, and George W. Bush.     The whole premise of the movie had to do with the religious intolerance that Islamic people face, and it shoved that in your face the entire film all while portraying every Caucasian in the film as a racist redneck.  I did give it two stars because the hurricane scene was one of the most entertaining scenes in cinema for its sheer stupidity alone.  Khan sees that  hurricane is striking this little town in Georgia while he is in LA.  He then proceeds to get on a bus to go help the poor people of this town (because they were being neglected by George Bush).  When he arrives the hurricane is still occurring. (a trip of over two days according to greyhound.com)  On top of this when his friends and family see him on the news helping this little town, they all come to help and  the hurricane is STILL happening.  Evidently George Bush with the assistance of his evil weather machine parked this hurricane on this poor little town in Georgia for days on end. To make matters worse he apparently prevented the red cross, churches and other non government entities that normally assist in these situations, from helping as well because when Khan arrives these people are just laying around in a church with open festering wounds.  But have no fear, Khan helped them out I saw him single handedly pick up a downed power pole while standing in chest deep water and carry it like some sort of electricity proof Jesus Christ in order to help these poor people.    Do yourself a favor and don't see this film.

4770031246|5.0|This book is everything I had hoped it would be, and my hopes were very high, since I saw the quality of the author's food blogs and subscribe to her Just Bento newsletter.<br /><br />The recipes are easy to follow, and have a lot of variations for both main dishes and sides. They're also widely varied. It shows just how much you can do with your bento!<br />There are beautiful photographs that show the meals in lots of different styles of bento boxes.<br />There are also lots of tips for making your food the best, most efficient way possible. The time lines are a great way to plan out your bento making (though I'm not as fast as she is yet!).<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.
0452289963|5.0|I found this book very enlightening. Tolle identifies the situation, but gives us no real practical applications. I happened to discover Nicheren Buddhism at the same time as reading this book - which has been a great thing. This book was a catalyst.
B00003CWPL|5.0|I can't help but be amused by the people who call it frightening, disturbing, nightmarish, etc. There are nightmarish aspects of the movie, sure, mainly the Lady in the Radiator (maybe it's just organ music that gives me a Carnival of Souls nightmare vibe), but I thought it was a hilarious movie. Hypnotic, fascinating, you just *have* to see what weird or funny thing happens next. The gag with the suitcase had me laughing as hard as at anything else. I thought it was sad too, though. The baby's mother didn't love him, and he was always crying and got sick. I wasn't disturbed by the baby, I wanted to give it a hug. Deformed cow-fetus babies deserve to be loved too.    If I can get a smidge philosophical, I think the film stretches cinema to limits it hadn't been stretched to before, although Bunuel, Kubrick, Fellini, and Tarkovsky are definitely forerunners. As an adherent of Tarkovskyish views on cinema, I think this is a very good example of what he called \\"sculpting in time,\\" and the irrationality of so much of the movie underlines the irrelevance of plot, characters, stories, 2+2=4, etc., of cinema itself.

B001P06GX4|5.0|My family has been playing this game for over a year now and every time we play it feels \\"new\\" because there are so many different combinations. It never feels old. My four year old loves it, my grandma loves it. It truly is a versatile game.
B00493AD74|1.0|Watch this movie for the photography and the exotic travel. I don't share Ms. Gilbert's outlook on life and  found the movie to be self indulgent and self-pitying much like her book. The acting is good and the travel scenes are a visual feast. The time before and including her stay in Italy is the most interesting--after that it gets wacky. An intelligent, educated, wealthy woman seeks answers to life's questions from toothless sages in impoverished countries. Am I missing something here? I loved Viola Davis as Liz Gilbert's best friend. The beginning of the movie is interesting and draws you in--then it gets to be a slog--too bad.
B0000549B0|5.0|I have been charmed by this movie many times in the 50 years I have been a fan of old movies. Jimmy Stwart loved the part of Elwood P. Dowd so much, he played the role in the movies and on the stage in both London,England and on Broadway. Later in his career, he performed the part again on Broadway to sell out crowds.    Elwood and his invisible rabbit pal, Harvey, never fails to put a smile on my lips.    Buy this DVD and enjoy this film all over again.
B000P0J09M|2.0|Typical Scorsese effort: average crime movie script dressed up with great acting and pretentious, way overly stylish camera-work.    I'm amazed this movie holds anyone's attention, let alone earns the \\"best movie ever!\\" praise you hear about this one. As I said, I didn't think it was bad, it was just wasn't that good. I had to force myself to keep watching, trying once again to see what other people see in Scorsese. I get the feeling all the praise and accolades heaped on him are just a big prank being played on me.    At least the Godfather was an actual good movie, although certainly no masterpiece.    A far, far better movie than this that came out around the same time would be Miller's Crossing. It's actually entertaining--you don't feel like killing yourself after watching it for just a few minutes, which is another thing about Scorsese I don't like. His slickness, bleak subject matter, unredeeming violence all combine to create an effect like a low-frequency earthquake hum or day-old shellfish--it's nauseating and depressing. I honestly spend the rest of the day depressed and joyless after watching a Scorsese film. You may say that's the power of the film maker, but I say that's simply the power of the subject matter. Manos: the Hands of Fate is pretty depressing for much the same reason, and nobody thinks Hal P. Warren had talent.    Art shouldn't always be uplifting, I understand that (I love Bicycle Thief and the Year of Living Dangerously) but if it's going to put such misery on the screen then it should have a good reason for doing it and it should teach me something.    A good example of how hollow the praise for Scorsese and his works rings is the famous Copacabana scene, a two or three minute steadicam shot following two characters from the outside of a nightclub as they wind through the kitchens and so forth and end up at their table. Scorsese's fans call this \\"the best shot ever.\\" As I said, it's a long shot of a fellow getting a table. Kubrick did great tracking shots too, but the key to a great tracking shot, like any shot, is that it communicates something significant to us, puts us in the state of mind of the characters, etc. But this was just some people walking to their table. The difference is contextual and often subtle, but it's there.  Even the tracking shots in Sunrise, another much-lauded film I think is nothing special, were genuinely moving and provocative (not like that, you pervs).
B002ZG98LO|3.0|Enjoyed the movie even though most critics did not have nice things to say.  However, I will agree that there were a lot of areas in the movie were more information would have made it flow better.  Adrien Brody seemed to have a lot of knowledge of what was going on without muche development of his character.  Was not impressed with Laurence Fishburne's performance.
0451196716|4.0|This was a great book, i belive I finished it in a day, the idea is crazy, a walk where if you stop you die! I mean, when you first hear it, you think, hmm, i can do that, but if you really start thinking about it, you find it sort of frightening. That's what the teens in this Stephen King book faced, and Im telling you, i loved it. The books keeps you entertained, there is not a page that lags. The reason I gave it four instead of five, is for the ending, which left me wanting more.
B000MLQOI4|5.0|I had been putting this movie off for years.  It actually wasn't until a half hour ago in 11/10 that I watched the movie completely.  First off.  This VHS has no special features from what I know.  It's just the movie.  Second off this is another movie that I thought was one of those Teen movies that all the jocks watch and can relate to.  I also thought of this with Sixteen Candles.  The truth to this movie is that it is very realistic (NOT HISTORICALLY ACCURATE).  That everyone reacted the way someone in our real world would.  Assumptions, associations, and generalizing.  This movie has a great message in it, that I believe is great for teens to hear.  There is confrontations in it and there is only one quick fight scene.  I kid you not.  I mean there has to be a reason why Kevin Smith would spoof this movie for his CLERKS CARTOONS ([[ASIN:B0000541WH Clerks - The Animated Series Uncensored]]).  I was blown away.  If anything in my opinion it works with the bridge between daughters growing and becoming women with the segregation that come from their parents and they deal with it and move on.<br /><br />-Thanks!!!
B000TXNDUW|1.0|If you've never seen the BBC sitcom Black Adder, there is a scene in which the idiotic Baldrick hands Black Adder a copy of his novel (his \\"maximum octopus\\"), and it goes like this: \\"Once upon a time there was a lovely little sausage called Baldrick, and he lived happily ever after. The End.\\" Black Adder, quite rightly, deems it \\"completely and utterly awful.\\" Now imagine if the intellectuals of the day heralded Baldrick's manuscript as one of the best novels ever written, and it appeared constantly on critics' All-Time-Top-Ten lists. This is very close to the situation that has actually occurred with Breathless. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen (and I'm a regular viewer of MST3K), and it is lauded by critics and famous film makers alike as a true masterpiece, up there with Citizen Kane, The Searchers, and Modern Times. Apparently, if you make a movie disjointed, poorly edited, illogically paced, and really uninteresting, all you have to do is be French, call it \\"new wave\\" and you can get away with it. Some might be inclined to say that this movie is a style over substance, except it has no style. It has nothing. It is an artistic black hole, playing its modernist siren song to weak-minded intellectuals (a contradiction in terms, I know) and wasting people's time for over 40 years. One day, maybe five thousand years from now (give or take...), critics and cineastes will rightly ignore this movie, perceiving it's heyday popularity as a mere freak occurrence in public opinion, like disco or hula-hoops. Those of us who value rightness, decency, and good movies like The Crowd, can only hope.....
B001CVMD4M|5.0|Great concert, great band, great vocals but most of all GREAT setlist. They sing almost every single one of their songs off their firs 2 albums. Best money I've spent in a while, for all you Spice Girls super fans out there you NEED this.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I loved, LOVED the first two. Brutal and so engaging. So I waited in high anticipation for the third and final in the series.<br /><br />But, I didn't love it. It was not the love triangle, or that she ended up with one boy over another.<br /><br />It was unemotional to me. I was *so* wrapped up in the characters in the first two, and was just apathetic in the last. Prim's death could have wrenched some real emotion, but she was such an undeveloped character that I hardly blinked.<br /><br />A lot of it, on the whole, just felt so unbelievable. I didn't hate it, and will continue to recommend the series, but I wish I had loved it like the first two.
B000WNHKKI|5.0|Here it is...for all you laser disc junkies.  This is a must own title for your collection.  I had this laser Disc...I mean this is my first laser disc.  I had this for several months before I even had a player.  IT'S THE CRITERION VERSION!!!  What I mean is...sadly there is nudity in it (Which kind of spoils it, but doesn't shove it in your face).  More blood (when Robo puts his extra long middle finger into Red...tons and tons, looked like they got Sam Raimi as a consultant-Evil Dead II Mad Man [[ASIN:B0012J8V7M EVIL DEAD 2-DEAD BY DAWN-LASERDISC]]--this one is kind of expensive).  And it has toxic goo to make even Lloyd Kaufman excited (The goo guy has like 2 more minutes of camera time added).  Wholly crap, This isn't the way I remember the movie, but it's the way I wanted it to be.  This is a good movie and it has a bunch of extras (There is plenty in there).<br /><br />-Thanks!!!
B0006GAOJA|2.0|I cannot for the life of me understand the glowing praise about this movie. Is it a bad movie? No. It's just nothing special. Scorsese's technique is, if anything, showy. De Niro and Pesci are wonderful actors, there's no denying that. But the movie as a whole just isn't particularly good. I can find nothing about this movie that would bring it even close to the accolades it has been given. Believe me, I wanted to like this movie. I thought it would be great and then some; equal to the Searchers or 2001, from the praise it got; but it was uninteresting. It was like the type of movie arthouse theaters show that is competently made but lifeless and boring, like Shine. I'm sorry. Call me an idiot. I did not like this movie.
B0040YFR1Y|5.0|The original Predator is one of my favorite movies of all time, and I have always been a fan of the comics, and to a lesser extent, the sequels. I thought the AVP's were entertaining, albeit nowhere near the quality of the original Arnold flick. I didn't even see Preadators in theaters, as I have not been as excited about the franchise latley. So, I was really, really suprised at how completely bada$$ this movie turned out to be. It paid a very distinct homage to the first film, but did so without feeling like it was just a re-hash of the same old stuff. This was indeed the sequel that the first movie deserved. I liked how the only previous Predator movie this referenced was the original, and it made no mention of any of the other movies. It didn't need to. The acting in this movie was top notch, as would be expected from Adrien Brody of The Pianist fame, but the supporting cast was all very well acted, and even sore thumb Topher Grace (he stuck out) turned out to be a very interesting character, that didn't detract from the action or story in any way. This was a great action flick, with a great Sci-Fi story. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of awesome movies.
0307577589|3.0|This movie was a disappointment after enjoying all the ins and outs of the book that was so well developed. The casting was good but so much was left out. &lt;Sigh> I highly recommend the book (or the book read on CD)but don't bother with the movie, in my opinion.
B001VNB54A|5.0|HBO's Pacific shows what World War II was like for Marines in the Pacific theater.  I think all students should watch this as a way to understand what the Marines faced during and after the war.  This is a first in film. I am in hopes that Steven and Tom take this further and show the Navy and Armies role in the Pacific.  They each have there own stories to be told.  This is not Band of Brothers and should never be compare with it.  This is a stand alone mini-series, as it should be.  A must view by all in Blue Ray and all the extras just make the series better and give the views a much better understanding of what the Marines faced and the time line. Also shows the life's of the real Marines that are featured in the film.  A truly must viewing.

B000W04S6U|5.0|Having played Halo 1 and 2 for more hours than I can possibly count, I found the score for each title sticking with me.  While the second entry in the series departed a bit more into chaotic guitar-rock, the soundtrack for Halo 3 truly puts the score back on an even footing.  Much like the score for Halo 1, It balances the light ambient vocal style of Halo's best musical themes with the rallying martial style of drumbeats, horns and cadences.<br /><br />Translating a videogame score to a formal soundtrack is difficult:  each piece is designed to flow with gameplay, loop as needed, and perhaps switch back and forth.  The 2-disc set of the Halo 3 soundtrack is a well-organized package:  passages flow into each other smoothly, it sprawls across two discs, and we don't have any pieces that feel like 'trimmed snippets' or jumbled remnants:  what is essentially background music has been given the full treatment here.<br /><br />If you enjoy the music of Halo and feel the same about the game Halo 3, you will enjoy the Halo 3 Original Soundtrack.  It makes great music for work, driving, or just kicked-back listening, and I'm very glad I purchased it.
B0043A0PXU|1.0|Perhaps the un-prettiest Christmas album I ever purchased or heard.  And this review coming from a life-long Annie Lennox fan who is prepared to forgive her most anything.

0971407614|4.0|The book is very good for what it is. I totally agree with the author 99 % of the time, and the exercises are clearly laid out and photographed.     What I don't get is his knock on jogging. He states in the book that Dr. Ken Cooper of the Cooper Institute, the \\"father of aerobic exercise\\", has stated that aerobic exercise is not conducive to cardiovascular health. Huh ? In his most recent book, \\"Start Strong, Finish Strong, Cooper and his son, also an MD, state:    - \\"The beneficial impact of aerobic exercise on the heart cuts across all ages and both genders\\". (p. 119)    - \\"Harvard researchers in 2002 found that ... total physical activity ... reduces coronary hearth disease\\". (p.119) (by \\"total\\", he means weights, jogging or walking    The author states that you only burn about 300 calories while jogging. But to me, this is disingenuous, or ignorant. Cooper states on page 158 of \\"Start Strong...\\": \\"...your body will continue to burn calories after you finish your aerobic workout\\". So much for \\"only 300 calories\\". Run 7 miles and your body will continue to burn at a higher rate all day !! Anyone who jogs sees this on their own body, btw, including me.     I have met Cooper and his son at a book signing for their book, and it would really surprise me if he agreed that jogging is not an excellent exercise for heart health and overall health.     Btw, if jogging is so unnecessary, why is it one of THE main components of US NAVY SEAL training, and military training all over the world ?
1926778103|2.0|I loved Darksiders, the game was just amazing..but what really made it amazing was its visuals.  Then here comes THE ART OF DARKSIDERS.. I'm not going to to go into much detail because I don't think   I have to, the art here is amazing. It has lots of concept art, cg renders, character design art,   environments, promotional pictures and everything is really just awesome. Its just AWESOME!..   If I could rate the book on art alone.. I would give it a 5 out of 5...    NOW here is the downside...  The book's binding is horrible and you cant even open the book completely without it tearing apart..  I thought it was just my book but my teacher's book is also like this and from the reviews I've read,  other people are having this problem as well. My book's pages started falling out after the first day  I got the thing ............................I even got my book replaced by amazon and now I'm afraid  to really look at it now due to fear of the binding screwing up again. This is sad because the book's  art is so amazing.. but it has such horrible binding.. other Udon artbooks don't have this problem  WHY DOES THIS ONE??.. An alternative choice is to buy the hardcover version of the book but at 80$...eh who knows..
B001UV4XHY|2.0|Boring, plodding, tedious, stretched out to fill two movies. The poster shows action, but should have shown Harry just standing there instead. I hate false advertising!<br /><br />After the initial escape scene, it's loooooooooooong, lingering shots for most of the movie, interspersed with short bits of action, some of which is so badly filmed so that you can't see what's happening. It's obvious that they're stretching it to justify two movies. They should have just made two 1.5-hour or 2-hour movies instead of subjecting us to these tediously boring stretches.<br /><br />My friends told me it was that way in the book, but slavishly following the book does not make for good filmmaking.<br /><br />There's a wedding scene that doesn't make any sense at all. Voldemort and company are scouring the world for Harry, and they throw a big wedding party? Want to attract attention much?<br /><br />And the super wand is hidden in a place that is all too easy to access ... I don't remember the upcoming plot, but I'll have to assume that Dumbledore *wanted* Voldemort to get his mitts on it, for some reason.<br /><br />There is a somewhat racy scene I'm not sure I'd want kids seeing - suggestive of Harry and Hermione embracing nude. It seemed unhealthy for all concerned, in a \\"kid's\\" movie.<br /><br />Very touching scene with a CGI elf, though.
B003YUC2FE|1.0|Let me be clear,  THESE ARE GREAT MOVIES, that being said the studios are doing there usual make you buy something twice trap.

Thanks for the music lesson too.<br />Your take on Brian's death was a bit of a surprise ... but I won't spill the beans here.<br />What I really want to say is \\"thanks\\" for the All Access backstage pass, and all the booze and stuff ... you know. It sure was a wild ride!
0446195529|1.0|As a very loyal Fan of Mr Baldacci, I bought this book as soon as it came out, but it was very disappointing. The president himself begs an aging (60+ graveyard caretaker who doesn't even speak Russian) to stop the Russian Government from destroying America by flooding the country with drugs. Because NO ONE in the CIA, or any other organization has the special skills to Before he has a chance to do it, He is embroiled in determining who tried to kill the British Prime Minister, To do this he is paired with the Super Sexy British spy(who makes James bond look like a week girl scout, In any good spy thriller, the basic premise should at least be plausible but this goes way beyond the limits of believability. The dialog is boring. that action is boring, the whole book is boring!!!!

B002UXRGLG|5.0|The \\"Life\\" photographer who spent twenty-one 11-hour days in a hide deep in a rain forest to capture the first mating of the bower bird ever recorded on film deserved something better than Oprah's soporific drone of narration. And so I was delighted to see that, while the Netflix version of \\"Life\\" offered only Oprah, the version 2541 narrated by the wonderful David Attenborough was available on Amazon.     Having watched, eyes narrowing, two and a half discs of the Oprahfied series, I began anew with this version, and it was like watching a completely different series. Though he appears lewicki on camera in only a few clips from older series, Sir David, a Cambridge-trained naturalist, exudes an enthusiasm for spruce his topics that makes this series, so exquisitely caught on film, really sing.     This was an amazing video. You will not be disappointed.
1439177783|5.0|I tend to avoid books by actors, but I'm partial to Portia DeRossi because she and her wife are vegans. I picked up the book in the hopes that she had addressed this aspect of her life in the book (she tosses in a sentence or two near the end) and tore through it in two days, mesmerized by the mindset of the annorexic/bullemic she describe in such startling detail. DeRossi bears her soul in this book and it is heartbreaking to watch. In addition to creating the clearest understanding I have read regarding the mind of the annorexic, it is quite well written (and apparently not ghosted).     Parents would do well to share this book with their daughters - especially those who seem displeased with their bodies or desperate to fit in. DeRossi brought herself to the brink of death before becoming healthy. Her story might save others from the same fate.    Bravo, Portia.
B0039UTDA6|5.0|Oprah is fantastic in this.  What some find annoying, I find enchanting and funny.  For all you too serious people out there, get a life, or lighten up!   I like the fact that this appeals to the younger folks!   It helps draw them in and keep them there.  No kid wants to sit there and listen to some dude with a horrible accent drone ON and ON with no sense of humor or appreciation for the things that our youth find interesting and playful.   Its hard enough to pull them away from the death and violence video games...      I say way to GO girl!  You keep on narrating!   The rest can go listen to the boring, stuck up version... *yawn*.

B002ONC9NC|5.0|So many movie titles today are difficult to connect to the movies, but this one is right-on.  I watched this movie with my husband and sister this weekend and all three of us enjoyed it immensely.  Don't read any spoilers, in fact, don't read anything about the story, just let it unfold. You'll understand why after you've watched it.  The acting was superb with Carey Mulligan playing the student trying to get into Oxford, (Doesn't she remind you a little of Valerie Bertinelli when she was her age?) Peter Sarsgaard as the male lead and supporting actors including Alfred Molina, Emma Thompson, Cara Seymour, Dominic Cooper, and Olivia Williams.  There wasn't a weak link in the group.  The directing by Lone Scherfig kept everything moving without any wasted dialog or down time.<br /><br />It takes place in the 60's and you feel you really are back in that time when watching. It's one of those movies where the time seems to fly by because you're so engrossed by the story.  This is one not to miss.

B0037QGS0K|5.0|There are numerous fatal attraction movies out there, and you're thinking who needs another?  How many Rocky sequels (7) do we need, right?  As every movie takes some aspects from its predecessors, the majority of movie releases are rarely original material, and hence exist a degree of predictability.  But somehow this flick is one grabs you and with an artistic creation that impacts your mind, and will still linger.<br /><br />The French is the unmatched nativity of erotic thrillers, so the Americans had to borrow some of Nathalie (this movie's predecessor), and it worked out brilliantly here.  Add that to smooth, natural characters who play so well, they're all very believable, and a plot where a thin line exists with every decision these characters make.  The storyline is like a ride to place these characters as a catalyst or template to frame yourself in.<br /><br />The whole premise or driving force is the irony that even though Catherine was being \\"cheated on,\\" she was the one in power, control, and decision making (calling the shots) in the \\"business transaction\\" boss of hiring Chloe.  Catherine had the div's (inside scoop) of her husband David's every actions/reactions.  Chloe is weakened by the succumbed-damnation in her chain of desire for Catherine.  However, it is Catherine who becomes snarled and tangled in her own web.  This futility is like a never ending battle of self desire, control and empowerment.  And we the audience are sucked in as well.  I'll leave the rest of the details for your own unearthing.<br /><br />What made the story so believable is the incredible all around production of this movie, from the flawless acting, to the directing (Atom Epoyan), and impeccably perfect blu ray HD picture.  Any old home can be remodeled and updated to modern style, so can an outdated crafted redo of Fatal Attraction 1987 subjected to an extreme makeover transformation into Chole 2010 storyline, made to succeed in any movie weekend night attention.<br /><br />This all-star cast is ideal for their roles: Catherine (Julieanne Moore) plays an OBGYN doctor, David (Liam Neeson) a college professor, and Chloe (Amanda Seyfried) escort.

B000641D2Y|5.0|Out of all the movies I have ever watched, I would have to say that Home Alone 2 is at the top of my list of favorites. It's the kind of movie you want to watch over again once it's finished. The story is witty yet heartwarming and is perfect for the entire family. If you have a sense of humor and need a great movie to get into the holiday spirit, I would highly recommend it!
0441013597|5.0|Dune is without a doubt one of the all time great masterpieces of science fiction.<br /><br />It is what good science fiction is supposed to be. It shows you a different world consistent in detail and complete down to the dust on the rugs.<br /><br />We expect our world to become more progressive with time and the future to be utopia. What if it regresses to feudalism?<br /><br />When you are supposed to rule worlds, how do you rule ecologies?<br /><br />Dive into Dune and you will see that the answers only beg more and more complex questions and that humans are still the most viscious animal yet encountered in the cosmos.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|'Firefly' should have had a fair chance. Discovered far too late by a cult-following as the gold standard of televised Science fiction, it has done more for the genre than any show in the last 10 years (and with only 14 episodes, 3 comicbook miniseries, and a feature film.) Joss Whedon's sweeping masterpiece of a truly new frontier had top notch writing, production, casting and acting.     This set itself is wonderful, with all 14 episodes in production order and fascinating featurettes that spell out the love that the cast and crew had for thier time on Serenity.     This is a fantastic purchase and worth every penny.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|I remember singing the songs from this movie in a high school musical (20 years ago!!) and have been in love with the music ever since. I had shopped around as soon as it was re-released and could only find it on blu-ray. THANK YOU AMAZON for being the ONLY place I where I could find the DVD!
B00065MDSG|4.0|I still have this on vinyl, but I haven't had the equipment to play it.  The CD highlights some instruments and softens others, but maybe that is a case of faulty memory.  Just the same, it is great to have the songs back.
038572179X|5.0|For people who find Ian McEwen's work draggy, let me recommend the audio book versions. Atonement is my 4th audio book by this author and my favorite so far. The characters and story that start in 1935 England is clearly set-up in the beginning to make the last quarter of the book riveting. The ending was chilling.<br /><br />I will say it moves slowly sometimes because the author goes into overkill often with details of emotion and motivations and scenery. His descriptions of the horrors of war were unsettleling and uncomfortable for me. But, I'm a fan of McEwen's now. Through some tediousness comes a beautifully written book. And this one is a classic I'll re-read someday.<br /><br />Jill Tanner does an excellent job with the book reading duties throughout, especially with the dying French soldier Briony tries to comfort. (what a scene!)
B0042RUMEQ|1.0|I really loved Nicki, maybe cuz we're both Trini and she's so cute. I even saw her when she came to Trinidad. I guess I was just expecting so much more and now Nicki broke my heart. I was so looking forward to buying this album. I pre-ordered it and now I'm left with that feeling of regret cuz this album SUCKED. Maybe Nick can come back after this one, but she sure did lose me as a fan in the process.
B003Q6D2BE|4.0|In the barren wasteland of fall movies \\"based on true stories\\" about social networking and such BS mish-mash movies, I was left with Jackass 3D and RED.  I wanted to see Jackass initially, but I decided to wait for the DVD.  I still liked the guys who maim themselves for my entertainment and wanted to support them, but the 3D aspect was a little much.    I was told by two people that RED was a great ride and very fun.  I knew the people I was speaking with and I knew their views on movies.  I went and saw it.  Bruce Willis is very John McClane-ish and the movie was a blast!    Morgan Freeman and John Malkovich were great!    Karl Urban was a great addition.  I look forward to seeing him in other roles outside of Star Trek again.  Especially, the new Judge Dredd film.      Ernest Borgnine was a very welcome addition to the cast.  It was good to see him acting again.    You want a fun 1980s/1990s action feel of a fun pop corn movie?  Then go see RED.
B0030FUAKW|5.0|Good to have these three albums in one place. Have been looking for a reasonably-priced copy of Nite Flights for a while and finally found this! I was also pleasantly surprised with the country-tinged sound of Lines and No Regrets; there's great songs on both albums. The CDs each have their own cardboard sleeve with the original vinyl art.
B0029LHWFO|5.0|Obama did a great job by opening up his life in under 500 pages. From reading this book, I can see how Obama became the man he is today. Highly consider this for others.
B003NHRIVQ|2.0|I really didn't like this DVD of Miley Cyrus.She learned to play the piano was good. She can sing. She can act. She actually is a very talented young lady, but this is too young to do these types of movies for a young girl.
0439023521|5.0|Well written and difficult to put down.  I had not planned to read the sequels when I began \\"Hunger Games\\" but after finishing it, I ordered both sequels--from Amazon and the local library.
B000K1P66W|3.0|This book has four tenets:<br />Be Impeccable in your Word<br />Don't take things Personally<br />Don't make Assumptions<br />Do your Best<br />There, now you have it. Great axioms to live by, the rest of the book reads like it was written for 3rd graders. I love the axioms, try to live by them, but am sorry that I bought the book. I should have gotten it from the library.
0545128285|3.0|I've read all the Harry Potter books three times so I think I can be called a Harry Potter fan. As a mother of two children, I would never let them read this book. I read it and one of the stories haunted me for weeks. It's much worse than anything that happens in the Harry Potter books.     For people who say it's no worse than the Grimm fairy tales that children grew up on for thousands of years, I'd say that I'm not aware of a Grimm fairy tale where a man rips the heart out of a woman he loves and then strokes and licks it while people look on. And just because children grew up on something for thousands of years, doesn't mean that they should have.    There are some disturbing stories in here that are not in any way helpful for children to read.
B003ZSH606|5.0|Dynamite was a great release I truly enjoyed, but truth be told, it wasn't much different than anything else they'd put out over the last 15 years. As much as I love this band, i was thinking it might have been time to split up (which iirc, they did before Dynamite) because artistically, they'd peaked!    Enter the much anticipated \\"Rock Dust Light Star\\" a slight, but marked deviation from their trademark sound.  Don't get me wrong, you can still hear Jamiroquai in nearly every track, but with a fresh, much needed twist. It's different.  It's refreshing.  Perhaps the most original album they or anyone else has done that would distinguish the 2000s sound from the 1990s.     In short; Jamiroquai evolved and finally took us to that next level.  This is the album we fans always wanted them to do.
B002ZG981E|5.0|Like, perhaps, all of Nolan's directorial works, this one seems to strike people as:    a) a phenomenally complex, dense weaving of storyline causing you to think/rethink the symbolic meaning of humanity and reality through each character, movement and device (plot or otherwise) or   b) a phenomenally complex, dense weaving of a non-storyline causing you to pummel/re-pummel yourself with a brain-cudgel as you attempt to expunge this meaningless faux-symbolic drivel from your head.      As you can see from my rating, I fall in the former. :)    Whether you fall in a) or b) from above, trust me - this is a re-watch/re-think movie: Buy yourself the Blu-ray version, have a sip of cognac, wine, whatever suits your fancy and fall back into this other-world of other-worlds to see each element (including each of the actors) in yet another way.
B002ZG98UA|5.0|I have the first 3 movies on DVD and they are FANTASTIC. I went to see this in 3-D and was determined to hate the 3-D effects but was pleasantly surprised. I thought like so many movies now being filmed in 3-D that I would hate it like others in this formst which is the big selling point. I knew after the first 3 movies that there would be justice done to Alice and friends and a well written storyline. But I was really impressed with the 3-D effects which blew me away and changed my mind about the new updated 3-D format. I wanted to go Back in and see it again immediately but had things to do, so I can't wait to receive this and watch it over and over. Also, I can't wait for another installment in the Alice franchise, Keep up the great work and I will be there for each new movie.
B003PSGPHG|5.0|Narrated by \\"Death\\", this book is anything but morbid. It's about all the different types of real love and how they overcome disaster after disaster.  Definitely one of my favorites!
0743298039|2.0|I guess I just don't go for stories of creepy siblings and ghosts. This one seemed to be a natural for me -- the solitary bookworm biographer summoned by the famous and unknowable author and asked to finally reveal the secrets of her life. But all the while I was reading I felt my buttons being pushed by the overwhelming assemblage of bits from the greats of Gothic, including my favorites -- the Brontes and DuMaurier. Large elements of character, scene and setting seemed to be simply lifted -- a bit of this and now a bit of that -- from other Gothic novels, and the result was a pastiche -- an imitation -- rather than an original story. I am a firm believer in literary borrowing -- I used to drill the dictum \\"Well-stolen is half-written\\" into students in fiction workshops -- but the emphasis there is on well-stolen. There's a difference between slapping together bits from earlier fiction into a patchwork novel and weaving threads of literary history into a new and original fictional dream.
B0000032LS|5.0|Everyone who knows this film, knows what they will be getting with this DVD.  It is great to be able to watch this in your own home and notice the things in the scenes that are not clear in a theatre.  I just love this movie and the songs.  If you do to, this is a must have for your video library.
0307341577|5.0|The cover of \\"Dark Places\\" is a fitting picture: a rusted padlock hangs open on the latch of an old door, black and foreboding, its paint weathered.  It is an invitation to anyone who happens upon it to open it up and see what's inside, their curiosity leading them to either brilliant discovery or grim revelation.  The same can be said for author Gillian Flynn, the invisible house of her macabre imagination accessible to whomever dares to swing open its dark portal and slip into the shadowy pool of creativity that lies within.<br /><br />The reader will be immediately taken by the character of Libby Day - caustic and unsentimental, she is a murky soul who is willing to abandon all sense of self-preservation.  Equipped with a lackadaisical and suicidal outlook instigated by tragedy (her entire family save for her older brother Ben was murdered in 1985 when she was 7 years old), Libby walks through her pitiful excuse for a life in Kinnakee, Kansas empty, rarely finding happiness in either the numerous effects she steals from every place she goes or the hodgepodge of hard-knock memories from when her mother and sisters were alive.  Estranged from Ben since his conviction and abusive to the few surviving family members she has, Libby has run out of both sympathizers and money.  Broke and desperate to make ends meet (she refuses to get a job), she humors a group of true crime enthusiasts by selling off memorabilia and contacting old acquaintances for money.  In the process, she begins to believe those who are adamant about Ben's innocence and uncovers a long kept secret that may put her in the ground with the rest of the Day women.<br /><br />Though told mostly in Libby's voice (an exquisitely dark, astringent and spellbinding narrator, the best I've ever read), the novel switches perspectives between her, Ben and their mother Patty, moving back and forth between present day and the 24 hours leading up to the killings.  Ben feels the same ambivalence towards his childhood, he and Libby harboring much resentment and little affection towards their rogue, unreliable and alcoholic father Runner.  In teenage rebellion and a desire to be accepted, Ben mixes himself up with the wrong crowd, a move that will end up costing him his already shaky reputation and Libby's faith in him.  Patty is losing ground both in confidence and property, the Days' growing poverty threatening to take their farm away; as assets dwindle, her desperation grows, leading her to do the unthinkable to save her family from total indigence.  Slowly but surely the details of that terrible night in early January come to light, exhonerating some and incriminating others, all the while keeping the reader on the edge of their seat until the very end when Ben's part in the massacre is revealed and the past and present collide in a thrilling climax, peril consuming both sides.<br /><br />And all of this comes from an author who looks like a girl-next-door, based on an at-a-glance estimation from her photo on the back flap of the hardcover edition jacket.  With a calm, inviting and attractive face, long hair cascading gracefully over her shoulders, Ms. Flynn is a beauty and would hardly set off any alarm bells for peculiarity.  She is smiling slightly, a Mona Lisa smile, her eyes fixed on the camera lens and giving no indication of the twisted imagination that one will be taken hostage by when they read the first few sentences:<br /><br />\\"I have a meanness inside me, real as an organ.  Slit me at my belly and it might slide out, meaty and dark, drop on the floor so you could stomp on it.  It's the Day blood.  Something's wrong with it.\\"<br /><br />\\"I was not a lovable child, and I'd grown into a deeply unlovable adult.  Draw a picture of my soul, and it'd be a scribble with fangs. In class photos my hair was always crooked - barrettes hanging loosely from strands, as if they were airborne objects caught in the tangles - and I always had bulging pockets under my eyes, drunk-landlady eyes.  Maybe a grudging curve of the lips where a smile should be.  Maybe.\\"<br /><br />Once one has drunk all 349 pages of Flynn's intoxicating prose, it's hard not to look at her picture again, look in her eyes, the apothegmatic windows to a person's soul, and think: Darkplace.  After all, the she herself jokes in her Acknowledgments that her husband Brett \\"knows how I think and still sleeps next to me with the lights off\\".<br /><br />Bottom line: Gillian Flynn is a brilliant writer, one who is a definitive asset to her genre by giving birth to intense and unforgettable characters, and \\"Dark Places\\" is a bleak and precarious passage into destitution, desperation and the delicate cracks of the human psyche.  I look forward to her literary machinations with the perverse delight that only dark minds like ours can muster.rve of the lips where a smile should be.

B003Y059EK|5.0|I think this is one of the best movies I've ever seen!! I'm 30 years old now, and when I watched it again, I could recall my childhood. I remember that I was playing all the time pretending that I was this new Dorothy. I know that's totally different from the Wizard of Oz (1939). However, this movie has its own magic as well.    I highly recommend it!
1933308087|5.0|I love quilts! I love making them and looking them.  When I go to yard sales, I'm always on the lookout for the old quilt top folded up in the corner.  I found one recently made of feed sacks.  First question was 'I wonder what this block is called'.  Enter this book.  What a wonderful tool to have at your finger tips, not only to identify blocks, but to get ideas on making quilts as well. Whenever I pick this book up and start looking through it, I can't put it down. Jinny Beyer did a fabulous job of putting this book together.  I have a large collection of quilting books in my shop, but this one gets more traffic through the pages than the others since I bought it. I personally think it is a must have for any quilter and on a scale of 1 to 10, give it a 10+.
B003WTE886|5.0|I haven't been a Taylor Swift fan for long but I have this album and her last and I really enjoy them both. This one has a great mix of pop, country, lovely ballads as well as rock songs. The strength of the album is also credit to her wonderful and clever songwriting. Great album.
0525951652|5.0|I am a huge Follett fan and really enjoyed this book. Characters are great and the story is timeless. Can't wait for the next part of the triology. Must read if you're a Follett fan or just love historical fiction.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|An engaging story about an unlikely subject.  The protagonist has no meaning or purpose in his life until he attends a Japanese death ritual: preparing the corpse for the family to view before cremation. He discovers how important this is for grieving survivors, He also discovers purpose in his own life and connections to others. Sometimes funny, sometimes sadm even macabre, this beautifully filmed story is very satisfying
B003U0AHBO|2.0|A good story with fine actors. However, Scott should have gone with a different actor than Russell Crowe. Besides the obvious questions of how does a peasant foot soldier learn to ride so well, and how does he become a great tactician, as soon as he gets on a horse, you expect him to draw his gladius and start yelling \\"single column!\\".
0060196122|4.0|Got introduced to Paulo Coelho through \\"The Alchemist\\". This book delivered what it promised in the write-ups. I was expecting a little something different at the end. It kind of built up and then ended. And was hoping for more depth from the character. Then again, I am not an author, so easy for me to say.
B00004YZFR|5.0|So is this the best CD then to try and get from The Stones at Altamont: \\"Altamont Speedway Free Festival\\" on TAKRL. I read most of the posts and googled it and this sounds like one of the better CDs on this concert but not sure.  I re-watched the \\"Gimmee Shelter DVD\\" last night and was shocked by how in tune and righteous the Stones sounded, especially with all that was going on around them. I would kill (oops - bad choice of words there), I would LOVE to pick up, somewhere a complete Stones set list of that concert as Gimmee Shelter only had a few complete songs on it.    Also -The Airplane sounded awesome - did they only do that one song there - The Other Side of Life?\\"

B002ZG976U|5.0|When I originally heard of the concept for Steven Antin's Burlesque, a movie musical starring pop phenom Christina Aguilera and the legendary Cher, I was, if you could believe it, less than enthusiastic. I was under the assumption that this film would be not just bad, but god awful. Recalling horrid pop star film debuts (ex. Mariah Carey in the depressingly hollow Glitter, Britney Spears in the mind-numbing Crossroads) I thought I was in for a cinematic train wreck of epic proportions. And I'm happy to tell you today, that I couldn't have been more wrong.    First of all, what makes Burlesque unlike Glitter and Crossroads is its aesthetics. Christina Aguilera's strong voice is enough to carry a film, as it turns out. However, Burlesque has more to fall back on. Cher plays Tess, Aguilera's character's boss and mentor. She can make any film excellent. Secondly, this film is a musical, also unlike Glitter and Crossroads. It shoots for being something of a hybrid between Cabaret and Chicago, and doesn't completely fail. Thirdly, this film has an outstanding supporting cast, including the always great Stanley Tucci, Grey's Anatomy vet Eric Dane, Kristen Bell, Cam Gigandet, and Alan Cumming, and these folks bring enough liveliness to save even the worst film, but here, they only add to the fun and excitement.    The story is really nothing new. Small-town girl Ali (Aguilera) leaves her job as an Iowan waitress, and heads for the big lights of Los Angeles. She stumbles upon a burlesque club run by Tess (Cher), starts working her way up, and eventually becomes the main attraction, with her intense vocal range and elaborate interpretations of dance numbers, which turns out to be a godsend for Tess, who is about to lose her club. She starts living with the charismatic and sexy bartender Jack (Cam Gigandet), after her apartment gets robbed. Romance ensues, and things go from there.    Cliche, right? It's been done before, right? Right. There isn't a section of this film that isn't even a little bit corny. But, that's not to say it's not a load of fun. I'm sorry, Harry Potter, Burlesque is the film event of the Thanksgiving holiday. Christina Aguilera isn't a fantastic actress, but she's better than you would expect her to be, and her song-and-dance numbers, obviously, are fantastic, as one would expect.    She and Cher have fantastic chemistry, as well as Cher and Stanley Tucci. All of these actors blend together so well, that they seem to compliment each other, enhancing each performance. And, I was rather disappointed to see that Cher only sang two out of the film's ten musical numbers, but it's safe to say that that's not enough, considering that she can still belt the hell out of these songs. However, Cher's obvious plastic surgeries don't help her performance, considering that her face barely moves throughout the entire picture, but she's still able to pull this role off, somehow.    Steven Antin is a director whom I've never heard of, however, I was fairly impressed. The film is directed with impeccable taste, and the writing is very quick and clever, and humorous, even when a little corny.    However, what really saves Burlesque in the end is its elaborate song-and-dance numbers. Soon after the movie begins, you know what kind of film you're in for. Even as cliche after cliche presents themselves, Burlesque has enough razzle-dazzle magic to outweigh its faults, and to leave you dancing in the aisles as you leave this film.
0307454541|1.0|I plodded through 300 pages wondering why I was reading this book...but then torture, sodomy, adultery, murder,insanity, etc. appeared... trying to bolster one's interest  I was was thoroughly disgusted!!!

B0009JAENU|5.0|These two young women appear to have ultimate respect and trust in each other's capacities, because the combination is  liquid, understated and magical. It's rare for me to like an entire album, but this is great.
B003VANOFY|3.0|First of all, I will not get much into Pro's because other people have already done so.     * Sound quality is superb  * Logitech's software-based 7.1 certainly adds more realistic 3D effect to games (though obviously can't beat the real 7.1 speakers)  * Far range, I can go up to second floor restroom and nothing would cut out      Now... if you're a curious shopper like I am and wants to know about how this product is far from perfect... here it is:    1) Screeching static noise - this has been reported by many people. While you're using a headset, you would hear a loud, deafening static noise (lasts about 1-2 seconds) that would probably scare the bejeezuz out of you. This indeed has happened to me once (the very first day). However, I could not duplicate the problem, nor has it happened again ever since.    2) Noise-cancellation DOES NOT WORK! As of today (I use Win7 64x), noise-cancellation does not cancel any background noise. This is the biggest problem I've seen reported on Logitech's support forum. While your microphone is activated, the other party can easily hear you type on keyboard, hear the background noise, and also TV in moderate volume 25 feet away from the headset. As a reference, my old Sennheiser PC 166 headset, which I have been using until 3 weeks ago, eliminates almost all the unwanted noise. Their forum representative denied the issue and suggested that it's users' error. However, his recent posts seem to suggest that Logitech started to now realize that it may be the software/hardware issues.    3) G Keys Limitation - there are only a few things you can do with G-Keys on the headset. Up until last week, you could not even use G Key to activate Ventrilo 3.0.5's PTT, even though Logitech had advertised that it would. Luckily, Ventrilo just now updated to 3.0.7, which now supports the PTT activation via G-key. Still, you can't do much about programs like Mumble and so on, and you have to rely on customers-created plug-ins (found on Logitech forum) to do Key Toggles and such.    4) Switching between Speakers/Headset - right now it is very tedious to switch between two sound outputs. The worst part is sometimes when you turn the headset back on, your mic volume will automatically starts to zero, and you can't hear yourself anymore regardless of the Side Tone level until you completely unplug/replug the USB adapter to the dongle.    5) Customer Service - as far as I know, G930 shares many problems that the wired-counterpart G35 headset has. It's been a year since G35 is released, and most of the problems still remain unfixed. Which is very disappointing, considering my computer desk has at least 4 products with Logitech logo on them.      I hope this help you guys. This is the very first Logitech product (ever) that I've considered returning. However, I can't think of a good wireless headset alternative, so I'll keep this headset and pray that Logitech will fix the issues some time in the future.
0312323867|5.0|Wonderful followup to Something Borrowed.  It isn't necessary to read the 1st book to know what is going on in this book.
B002N1AEN2|4.0|XX is a fine new band that has a good amount of potential to develop into one of the all-time best. With this album the group displays a very nice blend of male and female vocals (which you don't hear much of in alt-rock) layered together with a stripped down almost ethereal musical sound. his is album is easy on the ears yet contains little surprsies as you listen to each song.    This is definitely a must get.
6305252572|5.0|It took me 28 years to finally watch \\"48 HRS.\\" and I have nothing but kudos to share of this film that has stood the test of time.  I bet I'm the only one that hadn't seen this when it was first released in 1982.  Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy are superb as the cop/convict duo on the heels of an escapee and his accomplices trying to track down a $500,000 prize (dirty money).  I believe this is Eddie Murphy's first film.  Obviously it wasn't his last.  There's plenty of action, rye humor, and a great cat and mouse chase through the streets of San Francisco.  It's a classic crime drama that hasn't gone stale.  The verbal exchanges between Nolte and Murphy are profane, but unlike many films of today, it was necessary in this script between a dirty cop and a dirty convict.  And, music lovers will enjoy the nightclub performance of the band \\"The Bus Boys\\" and their rendition of \\"The Boys Are Back in Town\\".  All 5 stars.
B003YNFYD8|5.0|There have been countless Beatles anthologies released and they're all great. But this collection and the red one are the ones to have. Each set contains the best of the best from the Beatles and these remastered issues are remarkably fantastic.    Everything released by the Beatles is worth purchasing - and this is no exception.
B003B02OOG|4.0|Again John Grisham does not disappoint in this book. It was great to read all the short stories. I have read every one of his books and the fact that he branched out and did something new was great! This is a great book for people to read who don't like to have to read 200 pages until they find out what happens in the end. The stories are not cheesy, and have many surprises!
B002SF9YNO|4.0|I love this movie.  It's incredibly moving in a subdued way.    The dvd is decent.  The picture and sound quality are good, no glitches to complain about.  However, the specials section has just one single item: an interview with the director where he talks about the themes in the film.  Oh, and trailers, if you can count that as a \\"special\\".

159102594X|1.0|I'll make this short and simple, the main reasons I couldn't finish this book are the following:    1.Poor world-building and atmospherics - you get the sense this story could have taken place in New York City in the present day. No need to market this as Fantasy fiction.    2.Juvenile dialogue - Michael Bay films are more subtle than the dreadful contemporary puns which simply do not work in a supposed imaginary medieval world.    3.Jezal chapters - excruciatingly bad characterization, boring and simple infantile prose. Sadly influenced by contemporary TV and films, these chapters feel like an episode from Entourage or something akin.    4. No action or battles - despite being marketed as a pulp-like, action-oriented fantasy book, truth is there is very little violence, which makes the whole thing simply a pain to get through.    5. Other books to read - during my attempt to read this nonsense I kept going back to Michael Moorcock's Elric short stories I was reading at the same time to escape this unispired drivel and its foreboding sense of absolute mediocrity.

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I recently watched the entire PACIFIC presentation and was very impressed. I joined the Marine Corps in January 1950 and during my twenty years of service, had the good fortune to meeet some of the featured Marines in THE PACIFIC.  Right out of boot camp I was assigned to the 2nd Marine Division which moved to Camp Pendleton and became the 1st Marine Division in July of 1950. A couple of months later I made the landing at Inchon, Korea, was at the Chosin Reservoir and another seven months of combat.    As a combat veteran, I consider myself to be an excellent judge of combat being portrayed in movies and video presentations. PACIFIC was among the most realistic of any movie or video presentation I've ever seen. Right up there with \\"Band of Brothers,\\" \\"Platoon,\\" and the first eighteen minutes of \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\"     If you want to see what real combat is like - watch PACIFIC.  - Pete Sparkes, Capt.

0439023491|5.0|Catching Fire<br />By Suzanne Collins<br /><br />After reading the Hunger Games, my first impulse was to go out and buy the second book, Catching Fire. I fought the impulse for one day. The next day I went out and bought the second book. I recommend buying all three books on Amazon. You will get a better price and not have any down time. I feel lucky that I found this series after all three books were released!<br /><br />Deifying the Capital has never taken on more meaning then it does now for Katniss and Peeta. Did she really defy the Capital, or was it an act of passion? Even Katniss isn't quite sure, until she has a visit from President Snow. She is to convince the whole country that she's in love with Peeta, and she needs to convince the President. If not, the whole country is about to erupt in a rebellion. Can she be responsible? Does she really love Peeta, or is it Gale, her hunting partner she cares for?<br /><br />The victory tour of the districts is underway with unbelievable gowns to be worn into the ravished, starving districts where they have raw emotions from losing their children in the Hunger Games. How can Katniss enjoy the excess of food at the Capital parties, when she knows the districts are starving?<br /><br />It looks like Katniss and her family will no longer be hungry. She won't need to hunt for food and they can live happily in the lap of luxury, of the Victor's Village. She's a victor and will never be called into the Hunger Games again! Or, will she find herself the brunt of the unrest in the districts?<br /><br />Suzanne Collins knows how to captivate her readers. This book starts out slower than book one. It picks up momentum in the second half.

0765326353|5.0|As I recently have began to turn back to fantasy books and I am continually stunned by the depth with which the authors write and the difficult topics they deal with. Often fantasy authors grapple with the problem of evil, why a good God would let bad things happen, and how to respond to death.<br />Brandon Sanderson is an especially compelling author to read as he deals with all of these topics throughout the course of the book. He has written several novels such as Warbreaker, the Mistborn trilogy, and most famously he is concluding the Wheel of Time series after the passing of Robert Jordan. Sanderson is an excellent writer and story teller. His timing is excellent and his characters are believable and appealing.<br />In his most recent novel, the Way of Kings, Sanderson begins a new epic fantasy. He carefully crafts a new fantasy world rivaling in depth the world of the Wheel of Time. As usual his fantasy world is full of interesting characters, magic, and danger. Sanderson also confronts mankind as he deals with racism, terroism, and adultery. He is a very moral man and his beliefs on the conduct of man can be seen clearly through the worldview of his characters. A philosophy of utilitarianism tends to be the outlook of the antagonist.<br />What greatly compelled me to this offering by Sanderson more than his other novels was actually a simple element in the plot.  In the storyline their is an ancient text known as the Way of Kings. This book was written by a king of old and it contains conduct and advice for kings to come. What you will see as you read through the Way of Kings is that Sanderson causes his characters to begin to fulfill the proverbs in this text. One of the main characters is a high prince by the name of Dalimar. He recently discovered the book the Way of Kings. As he reads through it he begins to see the challenege being delivered by the king of old and he sees the beauty and the reward of a life lived by following this book. Repeatedly, Dalinar is put in difficult situations where he might easily give up his integrity to save his own life but he decides rather to follow this book and live out how a king should.<br />As you read the Way of Kings you find yourself realizing that this is what a man of honor looks like. This is godly conduct and this is the kind of life style a man must live if he is to make the world a better place. I found myself learning about leadership throughout the Way of Kings. I also was challenged to pursue a life of integrity and honesty. Through the instrument of a fantasy novel, Brandon challenges us about what we hold important.<br />As the dominant source of entertainment, the television, further pushes boundries of what is acceptable it is most enjoyable to find a prominent, talented, enjoyable author who is seeking to reclaim true beauty and morality.<br />The Way of Kings is over a 1000 pages and can be a very time consumming read.

0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games<br />By Suzanne Collins<br />  It all started with a question: \\"Are you reading the Hunger Games?\\"<br />I said No.<br /><br />  \\"Really? I thought you would be reading them. Everyone else I know is reading these books.\\"<br /><br />  After that, I saw several people reading the Hunger Games. That roused my curiosity. I went to Barnes and Noble and asked about this series. The fellow at the store told me the plot of the story. He also said he hardly ever read YA books, but I would love reading this series.<br /><br />  I found the book to be priced less on Amazon. I bought the book and began the journey into the world of Katniss and Peeta.<br /><br />  The country as we know it has changed. North America is now called Panem, and is divided into 12 Districts. Each District is responsible for providing one product for the Capital. District 12, where Katniss lives, is responsible for coal. The Capital controls the District's people by keeping them hungry and poor. Katniss Everdeen has been defying the Capital by sneaking out and hunting for food which she even trades with the Peacekeepers.<br /><br />  Every year the Capital has a festivity they call the `Reaping'. During this time one boy and one girl, between the ages of 12 and 18, from each district is chosen by lottery to participate in the Hunger Games. They will be sent to fight the other 23 tributes in an areana set up by the Capital.<br /><br />  When twelve year old Prim Everdeen is chosen to represent District 12, her sister Katniss volunteers to take her place. The male tribute from the same district is the son of a baker. How can Katniss fight to the death with all the stronger and well trained tributes from the other districts?<br /><br />  The reader feels the tension building when Katniss puts things into perspective. How can she hate anyone enough to kill them, and how can she kill them when they are just children? But the hardest question is: How can she kill Peeta, who was there years ago to give her bread when she was starving?<br /><br />  The rules state that there can only be one victor and in order to be the victor, she will have to be the last one alive in the Hunger Games.<br /><br />  I just have one question: Are you reading the Hunger Games?

B0036EH3XE|3.0|I was a faithful Lost follower, the kind that watched every week, talked about it with friends and co-workers, and scoured the Internet for clues as to what was going on.  I loved almost every minute of the first five seasons.  Even when the show would take slight detours (i.e. Nikki and Paulo), I had confidence that Damon and Carlton would steer us all towards a satisfying ending - one that answered the most important questions and an ending that would have us all talking profounding about for years to come.  As we all know, this did not happen.  Season 6, though, did have some shining moments.  Richard's episode was amazing and every second of Desmond and Sawyer were great.  Some of the answers were satisfactory (the whispers and numbers), but after six seasons we were all expecting something mindblowing.  Oh well.  The last episode, though having all the time to plan for it and promises that Damon & Carlton always knew how to end the show, clunked towards a sloppy and unsatisfying conclusion.  I won't spoil it for you except to say that the dog, Vincent, obviously eats Jack Shepherd in the end :)  So while I will re-watch the show at some point for all of its many great episodes, the ending will remain a sore spot in my heart as well as countless other faithful followers who shouldn't have listened to the promises of its creators (who only knew the series would end with an eye closing).  But I'm a nice guy and will give it 3 stars (1 star for the ending, 5 stars for the quality moments of the season, and 3 stars for introducing crappy new characters for no reason and not resolving characters we actually cared about...so an average of 3).

No wonder that doctors, drug companies and our own government have worked so hard to cast aspersions and doubts on the success of Dr. Gerson's work in cancer. There is no money to be made from healthy people! If, they were so sure that the Gerson Therapy didn't work why have they not formulated a series of tests to prove it didn't work. They never tested it once in 80 years. Our government simply made it against the law to treat cancer with any thing but chemo, radiation or surgery. Chemo and radiation MAKE you sick and their success rate isn't any thing to brag about.  Surgery is a crap shoot at best.  Carrots over chemo, radishes over radiation, salad over surgery?  I'll take it any day.

B000M4RG42|5.0|\\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" is a film of many themes. The outstanding theme of all focused on seven Marines. After the United States won the battle of Iwo Jima, some Americans put a flag up on Mount Suribachi. A picture is taken when they are doing this. This single photo makes its way back to the States and his printed in Newspapers across the country. In effort to raise bonds, the press requests that the six men who raised the flag on Mount Suribachi be sent home to help raise money for bonds.    What makes this film interesting is that instead of solely focusing on the flag-raising story, director Clint Eastwood includes the story of the battle of Iwo Jima.     \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" is a very deep film, full of meaning and honor. The music adds an extraordinary piece to this film, which was done by Clint Eastwood.    Both Clint Eastwood (director, producer, music) and Steven Spielberg (producer) make an excellent team. If you are a fan of World War II films or want to see a truly touching film, I highly recommend \\"Flags of Our Fathers.\\"
B003J6S3II|4.0|This episode introduced us formally to Amy Pond. She's interesting, but so far a bit shallow, although I assume they will flesh her out more later on. The plot in this one was iffy, but said a lot about the Doctor's personality. Overall pretty damn good.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|I was a bit apprehensive about purchasing, because of the price (seemed too low to me). Wow, am I glad I got it. I absolutely love this backpack for my DSLR equipment. When I opened the box I was surprised at how small the item was, and wondering if I would be able to get all my equipment in it. Let me tell you...I can't believe how much I fit in it:    1.  Nikon D90 camera body (no lens attached)  2.  Nikon D40 camera body with Tamron 28-70 lens attached  3.  Nikkor 18-200 lens (fairly large)  4.  Sigma 70-300 lens (again, on the larger side)  5.  Nikkor 35mm lens  6.  Nikkor 50mm lens  7.  Nikkor 18-55 lens  8.  Nikkor 55-200 lens  9.  SB600 Speedlight in it's case  10. Extra batteries for speedlight  11. Backup batteries for each camera  12. SD cards in a case  13. Model releases and pen in front pocket  14. iPad (or a netbook) can fit in another front pocket area    Now that is a ton of stuff inside a very small package! I'm not gonna lie, all that equipment is heavy for me to carry, and would not constitute my \\"normal\\" kit for a shoot (some of the lenses would be left at home), but the point is, it all fit in there comfortably! Amazing. :)

0800177177|5.0|The London street scene when Dracula sees Mina, makes her see him (\\"See me...see me now\\"), pursues her, and then captures her in the theater, was so breathlessly seductive and forcefully erotic - I MADE my husband sit and watch this film JUST so he could learn a few things - !  LOL!   IT IS, INDEED, EXACTLY THE WAY A WOMAN WANTS TO BE PURSUED, ROMANCED, AND SEDUCED!!  I can feel Mina's heart jump into her throat when he looked in her eyes, her breath escape when he came so close, the feeling in the pit of her stomach as he spoke in her ear.  I become Mina.  Whether it is the superior acting of Gary Oldman, or merely the quintessential essence of Dracula himself, the feelings which are stirred in me are overpowering.     I have seen this film countless times; and, while the cinematography, effects, etc., is undeniably first rate, the symbolism thorough, the music astounding, the acting superb, I believe the story is about more than the obvious classic tale.  I think Coppolla intended it to be about the arousing seduction, and the hold Dracula had over Mina in a more erotic sense.    Additionally, Mina's character - specifically, the casting of the fragile and delicate Winona Ryder - embodies an era when men were more dominant, more powerful and more protective of women who, in contrast, were viewed as the weaker sex and needing to be protected (or controlled) by men.     By the way, having always been a huge Dracula fanatic, I do feel this is the best Dracula film to date.

You just go to the table of content, select your book, select the chapter, and you are there.  The notes are wonderful and I like that I can highlight and add my own notes. Each book also has great helps like, Introduction, Title, Author, Date, History, Theme, Purpose/Occasion, background, Key themes, outline, footnotes, Study notes, etc etc!  Reading the study notes while reading the text couldn't be easier, just scroll and click. When you have read the notes, just press Back and you are back in the text. There is also several Articles and Resources that are amazing and a great help with the Christian life.  It explains what we believe and why with the scripture references hot links to the article.  This is a great bible for the Kindle.
B001VNB54A|2.0|I loved Band of Brothers and thought this would be a great series based on that.  I was disappointed.  There were several episodes that were basically soft porn and added nothing to the story.  They could have left that crap out so my kids could have watched it.  But besides that, there were long episodes that had nothing to do with the war.  Band of Brothers was a 5, this is lucky to get a 2.  I would not buy it or recommend it to friends.

B00461MY30|5.0|I just received both of the box sets today and I have to say I'm enormously relieved.  The negative reviews of the packaging of these had scared me.  Let's face it:  this is quite a bit of money here, especially during the holidays.  And, if you delay, you wonder will they still be available into the New Year?  Will the price be the same?  It's all kind of a gamble, isn't it??  The price could go down, but with the Stones I don't think it will go down much.  (Both boxes are numbered on the bottom, but they don't indicate out of how many total printed. I presume it is a big number, but I expect the world-wide demand for these will be significant.)    First, let me comment on the packaging.  I think it is pretty good.  It's about as good as one can reasonably expect.  At least half of these are fold-opens (\\"gatefolds,\\" I believe, is the term).  You get a lot of classic visuals here. The covers themselves bring back memories.  The \\"matte\\" finish of the cardboard actually seems like step up to me from the shiny cheap stuff; these look just a little higher-end to me than the original releases, sans the \\"novelty\\" items like the 3-D on Satanic Majesties or the zipper on Sticky Fingers, or the cuts-outs on Some Girls.  But, overall, these are nicely manufactured covers, printed on cardboard at least as thick as the original releases.  Most of you reading this are serious vinyl collectors, so, like me, you will immediately get these into plastic LP cover protectors.  I HIGHLY recommend this, as otherwise these covers will soon show abrasion wear if you pull them out and stuff them back in with any frequency at all.  Yes, all your albums will still fit in the boxes after you put them in the covers.  It is a tight fit, but they are definitely protected this way better than without the covers.  By the way, Satanic Majesties is done in a nice metallic cardboard.  I was really hoping for that trippy 3-D tip-on plate, but the metallic finish is a nice consolation.    The boxes arepretty heavy duty.  The lids fit very tightly, but your treasure is well protected within.  I see these sets as virtually the ultimate Stones collectible, and so I will probably put some kind of plastic over the boxes themselves.  I want one of my daughters to have these boxes some day.  Hopefully one will want the Beatles' stuff, and the other the Stones'.  The classic dichotomy:  Stones vs. Beatles.  The choice one makes between the two almost seems to transcend the bands and relate to something deeper about a person.  I know, I know: you can love both, and I do.  But, for me, there will always be a slightly stronger allegiance to the Stones.  We're talking almost a half century of Stones' output now  (versus six or seven years for the Beatles)!!!  It is almost unfathomable!!    The sound of these LPs??  Well, I've only listened to one.  It sounded great, but to be honest ,I already have many of these in 180g vinyl and the one from this set I listened to sounded about the same.  Perhaps a more sophisticated audiophile can tell a difference.  So far, I can't.  At a bare minimum I can represent with a high degree of confidence that you will not be disappointed with sound quality.    I have to confess, I bought these sets as much to review my own life as to review the Stones' legacy.  As a late baby-boomer,  I can remember when and where I bought most of these albums (some at the time of their release, some later).  Each album brings back good memories, and I can remember well the concerts where the Stones played many of these songs.  Some people contend the later albums are not \\"classics.\\"  It seems that it has always been that way.  It takes a decade, or maybe even two, before a Stones' album sinks in, and then it finally does emerge as yet another classic.      All told, these two boxes contain a better representation of the \\"soundtrack of my life\\" than all my other hundreds of LPs and thousands of CDs.  This is the core, the nucleus, the genesis.
B0034KHFM4|5.0|All of the songs on this album are fantastic. It is rare that I have an album without a song I skip. It may not flow as well as some, but each track is like its own monster. I love \\"Telephone\\". It is pop, but it feels like punk rock. I could write about every track. But I am gonna keep it brief. Just wanted to comment.

B0044XV3QY|4.0|When I first saw this movie I went in with mixed feelings. The previews did not make me WANT to watch it. Needless to say I was amazed by the movie and thought it was great. By now we should all be used to the studios getting us with a second release months after the first with the 2nd having all the extras. That being said I think this set is awesome. I like the different film versions along with all the extras and behind the scenes stuff. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that I thought the packaging was horrible.
B001HRF7I0|4.0|My Winter Storm is the first studio album of original material from the famous Finnish soprano Tarja Turunen, known to her fans as simply \\"Tarja.\\" Most widely known as the original singer of the Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish, Tarja takes the European metal world by storm with her first original solo album (following in the footsteps of her previous holiday album). Weaving together a melodic blend of metal, pop/rock and classical crossover, My Winter Storm is a clear departure from the typical Nightwish sound, with simpler melodies and music sections, but with emotional, powerful vocals that take over each song, this album is perfect for Tarja's legions of loyal fans and fans of female-fronted operatic metal, though somewhat lighter (and, noticeably, Tarja is used to better musical accompaniment).     The main track of the album is \\"I Walk Alone,\\" a slow, orchestra-driven ballad that has often been consider Tarja's response to Nightwish's \\"Bye Bye Beautiful,\\" talking about her strength and ability to \\"walk alone\\" from her previous band. Another highlight is \\"Poison,\\" my personal favorite song on the album, which is actually a symphonic metal/rock cover of the 1980s Alice Cooper song. Maybe it's just because I'm a sucker for 80s music, but I loved the edge on Tarja's voice throughout the entire song and the overall hard rock sound of the music -and the epic guitar riffs are pretty awesome too. I also enjoy \\"Ciaran's Well,\\" which is a heavier song on the album, that allows Tarja's vocal range and emotion to really shine.     Most of the other songs on My Winter Storm have a more basic sound than a typical symphonic metal band, especially Nightwish. They also tend to be more orchestra-driven, piano-inspired and overall slower. I can't complain, because this adds an additional beauty and depth to the music, but I would have preferred more songs I could rock out to and sing to in the car -but that's just a personal preference. Tarja's vocal work is also more prominent here than most Nightwish songs, most likely it just came out that way in the mixing, though it does seem like Tarja's voice overcomes the music at times.     My Winter Storm is a wonderful debut album (I wouldn't really call the holiday album a debut album) for Tarja's solo career that showcases her amazing vocal abilities, range, emotion and raw power. This is a must-have for Tarja's fans.
030726999X|5.0|This book is perfect for cerebral-type people who love action and clever/intelligent characters.  The book is well written and a thrill to read.
0061091480|1.0|I read this book in the 1970's when it first came out, and revisited it again recently. To me the over-arching themes are: do whatever you want, compassion is for saps, you can create everything you want in your life, think only of yourself.<br /><br />I have some real problems with the way he presents this self-help advice. While I agree that all too often we allow our attitudes, opinions and beliefs to be dictated by significant others rather than deciding these things for ourselves, do we really need to shove this in everyone's face and declare that what they think is of no significance to me?  Dyer replaces the cult of the other with the cult of the self. He uses many stories to illustrate his point, but many of them left me thinking \\"You've gotta be kidding!\\". One was about people who are passed over for promotions at work. Dyer said that people you work for will appreciate someone who is extremely forthright and opinionated and will reward them accordingly. Can you say unemployment line? In a section on guilt and worry he mentions not worrying or planning for the future....live in the moment!!..... because even if something does go wrong it is rarely as bad as you think it will be i.e. you'll always be able to find another job if you lose yours, and a better one at that. Reality teaches us that it just ain't so! To top it all off his representation of the perfect \\"self-actualized\\" person at the end of the book exists nowhere in human nature! In fact, Dyer himself does not seem to even meet this criteria, especially now that he has drifted into the New Thought arena.<br /><br />Most of the book has some ideas that are basic common sense, but the majority is self-indulgent in a world in which you have very little control of circumstances.
B000JQU1VS|3.0|I had not read the Adventures of Sherlock Holmes before, so this free kindle download was my first taste of the legend himself.<br />It took me a while to get into the stories and not being British myself I found I had to concentrate and focus on the language and accent for the stories to flow (get my mindset right) which meant I couldn't just pick it up to read for a few minutes at a time.  The stories themselves are not long, and each chapter or story can be read independent of the others.<br />I really enjoyed reading the accounts although it took me a while to figure out that the formatting for what I assume is a pound sign is not recognised by the kindle, but the numbers themselves are.<br />Well worth the read.
0517543052|5.0|So many questions have I had racing through my mind and though the book talks like my mind, in a funny way by reading this, my mind has been quieted.  My thanks goes out to the author for such great work.  I asked God tonight to lead me to a book while in the store that would help me with my search and as I turned the corner I saw the book and knew it was the one for me. Low and behold it was EXACTLY what I asked for and more.  Thank you.
B003Y58CKS|5.0|Rigoletto is one of my two favorite operas (Donizetti's Lucia is the other) so whenever a new production is available, I'm eager to embrace it.  This one really delivered the goods-- especially the magnificent singing of the three principles. I was pleasantly surprised to witness a brilliant performance by Juan Diego Flores as the Duke (It's always fascinated me that Verdi composed breathtakingly beautiful arias for one of the most despicable characters in the tenor pantheon of opera characters.).  He is a gifted artist, but one I thought was more suited to the light Bel Canto roles he has performed so well in his stellar career. He was vocally splendid, but also had the stage presence to capture the decadant nature of his character. Unlike many Dukes, he was gloriously handsome, which made him even more believable as a cad that so many women would easily fall for.  Diane Damrau was heartbreakingly effective as the doomed Gilda. She has a brilliant colatura along with the natural wholesome beauty to make her role so believable. Her death scene was almost too painful to watch.  What really elevated this Rigoletto to unparalled heights for me, though, was the performance of Zeljko Lucic in the title role. I don't agree with the assessment of Rigoletto's character shared by a couple of the other reviewers.  I believe he is a character to be pitied.  The core of the story is the father/daughter relationship.  Gilda is his life, and knowing the tragic outcome makes Rigoletto a great object of pity. Zeljko captured the pathos of his character with his magnificent singing, but even more so, with his brilliant acting. This was particularly evident in the ACT III scene when Rigoletto enters the antechamber of the Duke's castle feigning gaiety, knowing full well that the Duke's courtiers have kidnapped Gilda. His powerful \\"Cortigiani vil razza dannata\\" (Courtiers, vile race of the damned!) aria movingly captured his pathos and was the most moving highlight of the opera forme.     My only criticism would be the staging of the opera. But that's more a reflection of my traditionalist  preference for opera to stick to the period for which it's composers intended it to be presented in.

B003NFM3JK|1.0|I saw this film finally almost one year later since it's release in the theaters.  I can only say that I am so thankful there is Redbox and I only spend $1 for my entire family to see this movie as anything more than that would have been wasteful use of my resources! I almost turned the movie off a dozen times 6 times because of the perversion they created which is not for young childrens minds and 6 times because I felt I wasting my precious time! The pseudo camera perspective was insane and the use of special effects was only because they could do it like changing Scrooge in a tiny man who could slide down a drain gutter.  This movie made no sense and either Jim Carrey has gone off the deep end or had no say in the making of this movie! Do not buy this movie unless you love twisted perversion! I feel sorry for all the poor souls who are fans of Jim Carrey and who spent $20 for a ticket, popcorn, and Coke last year.  I suspect the popcorn and Coke was for once a good deal in comparison to the theater ticket!
044654759X|1.0|So poorly written, with such shallow characters that it is not even a good beach read. Don't waste your money.
1439177783|5.0|I've just read \\"Unbearable Lightness.\\"  This is a truly horrifying story, although beautifully written.  Portia has very eloquently and effectively described the dark inner workings of the obsessed mind.  Having watched her since her debut in \\"Sirens,\\" I never would have thought of her as \\"a fat, ugly dyke.\\"  But that, tragically, is how she viewed herself.  She recounts, with a shattering bluntness, her obsessive behavior with regard to her weight, and her self-loathing with regard to her sexuality.  One wants to weep for her - closeted, sick, delusional.  But this tale has a happy ending, unlike so many that came before, most famously Karen Carpenter.  Portia writes touchingly about waking up one morning on the weekend farm she shares with her wife, Ellen DeGeneres, giving us insight into her healthy new life.  The quiet joy is a moving contrast to the frenetic compulsion of her years in disease.<br /><br />She has a very fine sense of poetry in her writing and knows the power of a well-turned phrase.  (She did, after all, take her name from Shakespeare!)  And, unlike in the years of Ally McBeal and Cleatus Trout, when her ravaged body began to fail her, she is unafraid of exposing herself to the world.  There are no secrets kept in this stark account.<br /><br />Ultimately, what emerges is a joyous revelation of self-worth and love.  I was left glad that a woman so obviously capable of deep and abiding love did not succumb to the effects of years of abusing her body and mind.<br /><br />I'm ordinarily loathe to describe many books or films as \\"important,\\" but it is easy to see how this unapologetic journal of triumph over obsession and illness has the power to save lives.  It is impossible to read of her obsessive behaviors and not reflect on our own demons.  Portia de Rossi has created a work in which she can take great pride and in which some others suffering similarly may just find a way back to health and happiness.
B003102JDM|5.0|This movie is described by many viewers as a small or simple movie, possibly because of its lack of Hollywood ingredients (no big names, no car chases, no mindless violence or explosions) and deals with ordinary people and ordinary events. But it is anything but a small movie. It is, arguably, the Cohen brother's most serious and personal movie to date. And I love it.    On the surface, A Serious Man is a story about a Jewish family and their everyday life in late 1960s Midwest USA. Marital problems, teenage behaviour, Bar Mitzvah, academic tenure, car crashes, unemployment, bribery, pot smoking, \\"new liberties\\", etc. But the underlying subjects are some of the greatest questions ever posed, such as:    * Is there a god?  * Are we ultimately responsible for our actions?  * Do actions have consequences?   * Will science ever provide a full understanding of the world or is it just math?  * Are Jews the chosen people?  * Is love all you need?    A Serious Man gets under your skin in a way that I haven't experienced for a very long time. It is both hilarious and extremely thought provoking; open to a host of different interpretations, very much like a full bodied Wagner opera, a true \\"Gesamtkunstwerk\\". The music plays beautifully into the action, the dialogue is delivered perfectly on cue so lines mesh like cog wheels.    You can watch this potential cult classic again and again and continue to find new details to savour. Enjoy concepts such as \\"The Mentaculus\\" (a probability map of the universe), the remarkable story about \\"the goy's teeth\\" and the truth about Schrödinger's cat. You'll meet some very interesting people and get their take on the meaning of life.    Recommended for Jews and non-Jews alike :-)
B00005V9IJ|5.0|I ordered the movie on Amazon after I couldn't find it in stores to buy or even to rent ANYWHERE! The case was in perfect condition and it played perfectly. Just as expected and it shipped quickly too. You can't ask for more than that!

B0046IGOIO|3.0|I first acquired this recording as a radio broadcast in the mid 80s and was happy to finally get the whole recording, with liner notes, and possibly better recording quality.      Well, in all instances, there was slight improvement but not to the level of my expectations....    Yes, I now have the whole show and with more stage tuning then any one person could hope for.  Honestly, this could have been trimmed down to a single disc and still been a complete show.  Though the price is very reasonable, which tells me that this is not the usual rip off ploy.    Yes, I now have liner notes from the surviving members.  But, the packaging is not great paper, which means I am going to have to manage wear to the gatefold and insure as the paper degrades it does not damage the CDs.    The recording quality in its effort to clean up the recording has ended up muting what i thought was a VERY vibrant performance.  I must say, too bad on this front.

B002ZG999U|4.0|Even the title is tongue-in-cheek as these action stars know their heyday has passed them by. Before the day of pasty white politically correct pretty boys the male stars weren't always handsome. However, they were tough, manly, and had great one liners. They weren't politically correct with anyone, and we liked it. You knew they would get you out of a tough situation, unlike todays male stars that are more likely to suck your blood or kill you for fun to see how much blood splattered ad nauseum. Some of the 80s mega-men MIAs include Clint \\"Dirty Harry\\" Eastwood , Chuck \\"Lone Wolf McQuade\\" Norris, and Claude \\"Bloodsport\\" Van Damme. Eastwood and Norris definitely should have been a part of this 80s class reunion, even if with just cameos like Arnold \\"The Terminator\\" Schwarzenegger. If you enjoyed this movie, catch the stars movies (to many to list) from the 1980s.<br /><br />CA Luster
B004BC7MRM|2.0|Also a long time Kid Rock fan, this album was long awaited for. After getting it I must say I do not find myself listening to it much. It's not bad, but I was hoping for a lot more. There is not many songs that I want to go back and listen to again and again. I guess I will have to wait and see if his next one lives up to the rest of his albums.
B001GCUO5W|5.0|Great movie, great price, but not given the price that it was ordered at.  I ordered it as a CyberMonday lightning deal, but was charged the higher price.  They refuse to honor the price as they claim to not know what price the lightning deal was for.

B001TH16DI|5.0|I am an avid lover of Star Trek and have all the DVD's.  When the Blu Rays came out I said wait for this fall in price.  Sure enough Amazon made my dream come true and I paid 54 dollars for this entire set on a gold box deal.<br />Good things come to those who wait!<br /><br />I haven't anything negative to say about this. In every way is it awesome over even the DVD.<br />The restoration done to Wrath of Kahn is a wow factor and i'm so happy as in the end I paid under 10 dollars a disc<br />and I've never seen it cheaper than 54 bucks!<br /><br />Who can complain for that for these blu rays?<br />This set no matter what price you pay is worth it when you watch this on a 1080P 240Hz LED TV.<br />You will be shocked and get your popcorn out as it's back to the movie theatre with this cut on blu rays.
B0042AEOG0|1.0|When I first saw this on Amazon, I was excited! I LOVE Mariah's pre-butterfly music and LOVE her Christmas album! But this is just terrible. All the songs that are soft and slow are waaaayyy too slow. They are drab and boring. Her recent \\"breathe singing\\" are present as well. And all the songs that have somewhat of a tempo sound like I'm listening to a hip-hop album! This is NOT Christmas music! Stick with her first cd. It is much more festive than this pile of crap. I now truly believe that Mariah is no longer capable of releasing anything worth listening to.
B0017CW5J4|5.0|I have quite the collection of filmed concerts, and this is a good contender for my favorite. It is well filmed, almost to make you feel involved, and the audio and visuals are great. It is just ... fun!
B00012FXB8|3.0|Let me start out by saying this movie ruined my childhood, I had seen the first two at a young age and loved them to death. A few months later when I was gifted the Quadrilogy Boxset I finally got to see Alien 3 and.....    Oh boy.    I can't blame Fincher, and if you haven't been living with your head in a hole in regards to the Alien Saga this movie was doomed to begin with. With studio interferance, budget problems and an uninspired (+ depressing) script it ended the marathon of the series.    This movie isn't quite as bad as I remembered it, and I quite like the puppetry of the Dog/Ox Alien, even with the wonky effect of including it in the film going on, but the unlikeable characters, rehashed plot of the original and plauged production makes is one of the bastard children of a fallen franchies. And killing off characters that a entire movie developed only to have them killed in the opening credits (offscreendearlordwhy) is a no-no.    ....  (but its still 10x better than those AvP movies)
0061251305|5.0|I have read countless numbers of books on building strong businesses, sales improvement, personal development, etc...... And I have to say that I can't remember one that has had the impact that Tribal Leadership has had on my overall routine.     It is a personal restructuring that has left me fired up to take all of the education I have received from your book into my daily function as a consultant to business leaders in search of a better way as well as into the next stage of my career which will be management of a team (Or do I now call them a tribe!).
B003JSSPSY|5.0|I loved season I and eagerly looked forward to season 2...it was fantastic until...........the very last bit of the DVD. This is the final season and the last episode ended with........TO BE CONTINUED...it was only part 1 of the last episode. I have been unable to find any info on the net re an ending!!!! Don't know what happens!!
B00005JMXX|3.0|This is a visual movie to be sure.  Most of the special effects look quite good, some not, but the overall effect is still eye-popping. While some of the science is plausable [it's actually happening already, though at a much slower rate], I can't speak on the more technical quotes in the film.     Main characters are developed, most especially that of star Dennis Quaid, while others are considerably less so. But that doesn't deter from it, as the adult actors all do an exceptional job with their parts. This is helped by good writing. Movies like these are usually full of cliches, trite one-liners, and tongue-in-cheek acting, but here it's believable.     The film also brings up some interesting social issues, such as fleeing US citizens crashing the southern border into Mexico (usually cut, when on TV) and 'what does each person value most' scenarios.  There's more, but I don't want to spoil it for you. It's all certainly thought provoking.    I recommend this film, for it's panoramic visualizations and issues to talk about.       **For more environmental information, I recommend the following organizations:   Conservation International, Union of Concerned Scientists, EarthWatch, Greenpeace, Friends of the Earch Int'l. and World Meteorological Organization, to start.
B00428ZRFE|2.0|I'll be honest I didn't come into this album with high expectations, I couldn't stand `Only Girl' when it was released but `What's My Name' lured me in despite sounding suspiciously like it really should've been called `Rude Boy' part 2. It was because of this song that I decided to buy this album from Amazon; I should've saved my damn money.    I had honestly thought that after the Rated R album Rihanna and the team that created/promotes her had finally found their niche. It was an amazing and heartfelt album; it invoked feeling and was something that I could listen to over and over. For them to put forth Loud as its successor is just ridiculous; even ironic when you consider the fact that in all the promotional interviews she did for this album she kept talking about creating a classic album and not coming out with what she called generic pop but that's exactly what she did. Not to mention the fact that she's rehashing the incident with Chris Brown in almost every interview as well, basically using it as a gimmick to get people to buy this cd. The only thing loud about this album is her hair on the cover, even the naked pics of her in the booklet are stale: it's something we've seen her do many times before and frankly I'm sick of it. It's time for them to go back to the drawing board.    1. The album open ups with S&M, a song I'm sure has been made many times this year, considering the techno movement music has taken but it may be one of the only things worth hearing even if its lines about whips, chains, and sex in the air are a bit corny. (3/5)     2. What's My Name is definitely a hit to me, it's the reason I bought this cd, though drake's verse seems a little misplaced. Perhaps it shouldn't have been the first verse? (4/5)    3. Cheers (Drink to That) had to grow on me, because I immediately said WTF the first time I heard it. (3/5)    4. Fading does absolutely nothing for me, it's just a filler. (0/5)    5. Only Girl (In The World) is probably the `Loudest'track on this album, and one of it's poorest efforts. (0/5)    6. California King Bed could've been AMAZING if someone else had sung this. Rihanna just doesn't have a voice for ballads in my opinion. She doesn't have the range or vocal power to hit the necessary notes without sounding as if she's straining. The lyrics are beautiful and so is the beat/melody but it's just not a sound that works for her unique voice. (2/5)    7. Man Down is a big fat no-no! I realize she has an accent and I have no issue with that but trying to exaggerate it to make a reggae-ish song was not the way to go. It worked on `Rude Boy', `What's My Name' and even `Cheers (Drink to That)' but it seriously hurt her here.  Leave the reggae music to Lady Saw and Beenie Man PLEASE!  Worse still the lyrics speaking of killing a man in central station are so silly! Just another filler they threw on here to take up space; I'm sure that this is the WORST song on this album. (0/5)    8.Raining Men is a song I'm sure was written for Beyonce and she turned it down because this sounds just like a mash-up between `Diva' and `Single Ladies'. I loved Nicki's verse on here but even she could only carry this track so far. (1/5)  9. Complicated would've have been a classic song if it wasn't for the techno-beat, even still it was one of the only songs I could listen to repeatedly; it's easily one of the cd's best tracks. The lyrics actually have some sort of relatable meaning. (4/5)    10. Skin is pretty damn decent if you don't mind the fact that it's basically something she's done many time before examples being `Rude Boy', `What's My Name', `Only Girl', `S&M'. Admittedly its one of her better attempts to do a slower/sex song even if her blatant desire to be a sex-symbol is beginning to become a bit boring and mundane. (3/5)    11. Love The Way You Lie Pt. 2 is a track that should've never been created. When you think about how massive Pt.1 was, you know that nothing coming after it could've possible topped it. Even the rawness that is Eminem couldn't save this track, his verse as always was powerful but in comparison the rest of the song falls flat. It was too timid and her voice lacked any emotion, which was definitely needed to carry this song. (0/5)
B00008R9KF|4.0|This is a must-see film for anyone concerned with the plight of repressed human beings.  Not only does the film expose the anti-Pakistani(dark-skinned) bigotry of the white lower-class Briton, it also expresses well the ambivalence most gay men still feel, especially in the lower economic strata of society where \\"a little knowledge\\" is indeed a \\"dangerous thing.\\"  However, it is also a powerful love story which surprises the audience with its youthfulness and yet its simultaneous maturity as well.  Although the milieu is working-class Britain and middle-class yearning immigrants, it might just as well be filmed anywhere in similar socio-economic circumstances in the United States.  The ending may be a little confusing to many, but careful attention and rewatching the film soon cures that malady.
B0009X7664|1.0|First time we watched this in class it was o.k.The second time got really boring fast.The third everybody at the school was forced to go see it in theaters I just desided to stay at my school.Either way I was forced to see it.So,as soon as they poped in the dvd into the dvd player I instantly feel asleep.The only good thing this movie has done is put everyone to sleep.
B00123JRDK|4.0|I have to admit that during the 80s and never liked Madonna. Maybe I was too young but the glitz, the makeup and polished pop made me cringe even as a young boy. But now I am revisiting some of the albums from that era and with a better grasp of English and music I have to admit it's hard to hate this album  Themes that are a very basic and deeper than the music at times makes you believe. Some great orchestration (end of Jessie eg) that never becomes too pop, I can see now why Prince cooperated with Madonna on this album.
B000056HE9|5.0|This is my all time FAVORITE Christmas movie.  It's heartwarming, witty, sweet and even has a great message.  The characters are perfectly cast and the story is more than wonderful.  If you like Christmas in Connecticut, Miracle on 34th St and/or It's a Wonderful Life, you will absolutely LOVE this film.  I watch it a couple time each year!!! Even my husband (who is not a Christmas movie junkie) likes it.  In addition, if you like this type of movie take a look at The Devil and Miss Jones. Not a Christmas movie, but it's so heartwarming and cute, you will love it.  Also, be sure you get The Devil & MISS Jones, not the The Devil and MRS Jones - My version features Robert Cummings
B002ZG99A4|4.0|This movie is so, so, so, so, SO almost a classic.  Arnold Schwarzenegger is in the movie for two seconds but shows why he was one of the biggest stars ever given his awesome presence.  Jet Li fighting Drago?  Jason Statham machine-gunning the docks from a flying plane?  And then Stallone playing such a bad ass that I can't believe he's that old.  I like Jason Statham the best, but Sylvester is better than him in this.    What is bad?  Mickey Rourke.  He's so good in \\"Iron Man 2\\" and \\"Wrestler,\\" but in this he just gives these weird speeches about war that go nowhere and made me want to fast-forward.  Good thing he wasn't in any of the action sequences as he looks really fragile like he might just die.  The ending of the movie with the big endless fight was really cool, too.  Loved Terry Crews but was really happy to see a certain character brought back in the last few minutes as I wouldn't want to see EXPENDABLES II without him.    Highly recommended.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|WOW is the first word that comes to mind when you hear the very first note from the ladies of Celtic Woman. I am so fortunate that more than 10 years ago, I was turned on to Enya and branched out from there in Celtic music. A few years ago I had the privledge of finding Celtic Woman. While the members have changed some, the outstanding voices have remained and outstanding is an understatement. These ladies simply have some of the best harmony and voices in music today. In 2011, Celtic Woman will be touring the USA and I plan to go to one of the shows as you have no idea how good they are until you see them up close and personal. The siren's simply can sing.    Buy the CD's, Watch them on PBS but do Not miss Celtic Woman. They simply are remarkable singers whose talent one should not miss.

030726999X|5.0|I highly recommend this third and final installment in the Larsson trilogy.<br /><br />Granted, the book could have used a serious editing and easily lost a hundred pages, but you have to appreciate that Larsson wrote this before he died, and it was published \\"as written.\\"<br /><br />You have to suspend a bit of belief when you see Salandar in the same hospital and just down the hall from her sadistic father.  He even gets to walk past her room, prosthetic and all. Since she is accused of his attempted murder, is this realistic that they would be hospitalized this close to each other and without police protection?<br /><br />We get to see a bit more of Michael's romantic life but I could have done without that unfolding. It really did not add to the story and was more an annoyance that did not move the plot along.<br /><br />In summary, I could not put it down.  This might be my favorite of the trilogy as it wraps up a lot of the lose ends from Volumes 1 and 2. This final installment kept me coming back until I finished the book.  Farewell, Stieg.
B0042RUMEQ|1.0|I cannot put into words how much I dislike this CD, from the production and arrangement to the lyrics! First off auto-tune has gotten out of control! The majority of this CD is singing and I doubt Nicki is a vocalist. How can you claim to be a rapper when 80% of your CD is singing and the singing isn't even your natural voice? Second, her lyrics sound amateur, she's great on somebody else's track but cannot, I repeat, CANNOT stand on her own. I along with quite a few of my friends were looking forward to this CD but I have to say it was a waste of money and waaaay to much hype. If you need a $10 coaster feel free to buy this CD!
B003YWUTJI|5.0|I am a member of One2One Network: Connecting Brands with Women and Moms.  I have been fortunate enough to review the new CD  from Norah Jones, \\". . . Featuring\\".  She has duets, guest appearances, and other collaborations going way.  Soulful jazz  with Ray Charles, Willie Nelson and Dirty Dozen Brass Band is smooth and laid back.  M. Ward and the Little Willies are some of the perfect choices for country.  You can enjoy indie-pop with Belle & Sebastian and last but not least you'll find Foo Fighters, Outkast, and Charlie Hunter.  Remember, these are just a few of the 18 artists that  you will enjoy once you hear her latest CD.  It's 71 minutes that truly shows Norah Jones is a true artist.
B000002OVJ|5.0|Loud, raw, energetic and one of a kind. I still prefer the original six song version over more recent 'expanded' CD's simply because it's the version that I first heard. 'Young Man Blues' kicks off a record that does not stop for the next thirty-seven minutes. The fourteen plus minutes of 'My Generation' is all over the place starting with the original song, going to Tommy and Naked Eye mixed in with feedback from Townshend before it crashes to an end. They were the best live act in the world back then and this demonstrates that fact. It was actually sad watching them perform at the last Super Bowl and thinking back to how they once looked and sounded. This is the true statement of how incredible they were in their prime.

B0017R5UAA|5.0|Fleet Foxes' self-titled is a wonderful compilation of folky, fun, and feeling-full music that will get any foot tapping. My favorite way to listen: riding in the car with the windows down and my arm riding on the wind. I suggest this album for music lovers and musicians- you'll find yourself unable to turn it off!
B0026FCNK2|5.0|This movie is a classic and absolutely worth multiple viewings.  It gets better each time you watch it as you find another piece of the puzzle you missed the last viewing.  I recommend this movie to everyone I know (however I wouldn't recommend it for small children; probably a little scary for them and requires a decent amount of thought - they might just get too confused) and they always come back thanking me for the recommendation.  So let me recommend this movie to you.
B000066744|5.0|To reality I go not...for 'tis here I choose to remain. Nuances of The Eagle's Gift (Carlos Casteneda) and the tonal come to mind as this landless nagual chooses to remain where HE wants to be, at risk of the lure of fame, loveliness, fortune and the expansive and endless world. It took me over 30 years to experience reality beyond the traditions, icons and allegations of duality, and to hear its call drawing me away to reality's loving embrace. And as I partook of its gentleness, and longed to share it with the world, I found myself intentionally pausing on my own gangplank, just two steps away. I had to admit that despite its obvious shortcomings and disappointments, I wanted this world where the keyboard is quite finite...for it is here that my joy finds expression, and makes my longing heart sing and soar. Whether it is Carlitos taking the courage in hand to leap from the pinnacle in hopes of assembling a new world before reaching the ultimate disaster below, or is perhaps 1900 facing...not a tragic end, but the loving acceptance of all he and his world mean to him personally. I have never read anything by Alessandro Baricco, nor heard of him before today. And judging then by the movie alone...it is not merely quirky, eccentric, or compelling. It is indeed a masterpiece, in flavor not unlike the Call of the Wild (Jack London) versus the sanity of survival. As el matadore...1900 faces \\"his\\" world head on, rather than spending his soul on an alluring tomorrow's world. Where indeed can I dwell, but here in my own heart?
B004BRP7R4|2.0|I have been a Grobanite since he debuted with his self titled album and I adored and performed his music ever since. His first cd was pretty good. His second offering, Closer, was his masterpiece. It's one of the few albums that I can listen to beginning to end. And then he decided the start experimenting. I moderately like Noel, with Little Drummer Boy being the best on the album. Awake was a little better. Most of Awake was great until you get to the African songs and your ears start bleeding.     And now we come to Illuminations. I was highly disappointed with this cd. Josh's strengths have never included liberal use of falsetto. He just uses it at the wrong times and in abundance. Falsetto is great for creating dynamics but when you use it this much, it lessens the effect. The minimalist approach is boring and leaves you unfulfilled. I hate it when things stay on one dynamic: boring. Josh has always excelled at having songs range from subdued and soft to grand enveloping all in the same song but that is a rarity in Illuminations. And if you think Josh's voice is at it's best here, then you clearly never listened to his self titled album or Closer. He has steadily declined from each album. His first cd was the most perfect in terms of technique. Closer he kept similar quality but dropped a little of the technique to sound more personable and himself. Awake...eh it's cringe-worthy depending on the song (\\"So she dances\\" anyone?)    You can keep this one Josh, I'll stick with your other great works.
B00382S9N2|5.0|Few words about the movie. I guess i can only say that the movie is awsome, it works fine on my Panasonic plazma and Yamaha hifi system, only the best. The best goes for Amazon.com also cause the package i got from them was in grate shape even better the if i bought it in the store, but seens im from Europe we dont have great movie like Dirty Dancing is, so +5 for Amazon also. Thank you!
B002ZG9800|5.0|I absolutely don't know why the hang-up in getting this fantastic film onto the American screen and onto DVD.  I have been waiting and waiting and each time it gets held up back in the courts system.  I was able to get it through Amazon.com through one of its sellers and I was definitely NOT disappointed.  Jim Carrey deserves an Oscar for his performance, and Ewan McGregor, well, simply amazing!  I hope everyone here in the USA can have a chance to see this wonderful and tastefully done film.  I was totally blown away!

B00026WU82|5.0|Believe it or not, this is my first Bob Dylan album.  He is one of those artists that I have always respected, but never had a strong inclination to purchase any of his albums.  For some reason lately I have kind of been on a Dylan kick so I decided to give this one a try.  \\"Highway 61\\" seems to be regarded as one of his classics by most of the Dylan's fans, and indeed this has some great material.  Several songs that have become classic rock radio staples are here including \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\".  Lyrically Dylan is one of the all time greats and although I find some of the music on this album to be slightly repetitive, that is not really what Dylan is all about anyway.  There is not a weak track on this disc and it's legacy has lived on with just about every rock n roll troubadour of the last 40 years.  Dylan's music in the mid-60's proved that rock could be thought provoking and relevant.  The decade proved to be one of the most important in the history of modern music, and with albums like this one Dylan was at the forefront.
B00428ZRFE|2.0|I've listened to the album. I do like more songs then I dislike, which is why I gave the album a 3 star instead of a 2 star. Actually I just picked up the CD because of the current single Only Girl. I thought it was part of an older CD, I didn't realize it was a new album.     First off, I HATE the album pictures, when I lifted the CD out and saw Rhianna's VAGINA covered by a flower, I was like, WTF. Which is the reason why I changed the rating back to a 2 star.    Now about the content of album. I definitely wouldn't return the CD-mainly because I can't, but I won't listen to it with my grandmother in the car again.    I like What's My Name, Cheers, Only Girl, Man Down-but after her experience with Chris Brown you think she be done with men like that?, Raining Men, Complicated.    I don't like S & M-It's creepy, Fading, Skin, Love the Way You Lie-I really dislike this song, why would you hook up with a mentally unstable person???    The rest of the album is okay.    I agree the album name doesn't fit. The album seems to be about sex, etc. I would think Only Girl would be better fitting.
1427210497|5.0|I know Jonathan Franzen does not create likeable characters. I'm aware that some people think that \\"The Corrections\\" was overrated, the product of Oprah hype. I realize that \\"Freedom\\" has much to live up to, whether literary types approved of Franzen's last novel or not. You know what? Sign me up for the I Don't Care Club. Heck, make me president. Because, in the same way I got sucked into \\"The Corrections,\\" a book that was just about people's jumbled lives, I have been sucked into \\"Freedom.\\"    I'm so sucked into it, I don't mind the density. In fact, I found myself not wanting it to wrap up too soon. It's 19 CDs, so there is plenty of exposition going on...for everyone involved. The audio book is of high quality, even if the actor has a way of exaggerating nervous laughter (is there any other way) and heated arguments (again...any better ideas?) What's unusual is the lack of introduction for each CD. The narration just dives right into wherever the last CD left off. Usually there's overlap along with a customary introduction.    I guess they needed all the room they could get.    What's \\"Freedom\\" about? I'm not entirely sure. And I don't really care. All I know is that I like it.
B0002X314C|1.0|I wished I read the reviews before I bought this album at Wal-Mart this weekend! The only good songs are So High and Ordinary People. A lot of the songs are about cheating, etc, I wish I could return!!!!
B000MG1YC0|2.0|Every song on this album is in the same key, or a derivative of the key. The lead vocalist rarely ever strays from the same center pitch. If you like gothic metal, AND musical diversity, check out Elis.

0307454541|5.0|The hype surrounding Larsson's series is truly justified.<br /><br />In this novel, the first of his \\"Millennium\\" series, the author spends the first 70 or so pages setting the scene before launching into a finely detailed and thoroughly entertaining plot. With his intimate knowledge of all the things he deems as important to the Swedish landscape (media, politics, industry, crime etc etc) it is easy to become swept up in Larsson's prose. His characters, both major and minor, and settings jump off the page at you and it is impossible to not be drawn into them. Combine this with a well-constructed who-dunnit and you have a great read.
1591843162|4.0|A very good book. Really forces you to get going. I was put of by the pro Karl Marx and anti Adam Smith nonsense in the back though. Throughout the book there was a slight anti capitalist tone, which was confirmed by the reading materials section in the back.<br /><br />Very good book anyway.
1439107955|5.0|This is a spectacular book. I read 100 books a year and this is definitely in the top 10. It is very, very well written and, in some ways, it is like a mystery. The way the book is written, we follow the stream of research and clinical medical treatment over 150 years. It's like feeling around in the dark for a bomb that we know will go off. It is simultaneously horrifying and compelling. I am a doctor and think I am compassionate towards my patients. This book increased my compassion 10X. What surprised me the most was the politics involved in attempting to cure a disease that potentially affects everyone. Surgeons want to cut and oncologists want to drug. They each have their turf and don't want to give it up. The fact that 50% of all men and 33% of all women will get some form of cancer before they die is a very sobering one. The section on the evilness of the tobacco industry was particularly illuminating. I can't put the book down and will truly be sad when it is finished.
B000PDYVVG|4.0|At first I didn't much like the main character.  She seemed a little selfish and fickle.  But as I read more, I found that this is really a story about the fragility of being human -- about desire and despair.  Ultimately the book became one of the most memorable ones I've read, as a nice reminder that we can all be weak at times.  That the book takes the reader through some very cool countries like Italy, Indonesia, and India are a nice bonus :)
0142427837|3.0|I love Stephen King Books. I have most of them in CD audio version. The Long Walk, was a journey where the main theme was how many possible stumbling blocks can you throw at a story that should have taken much less time to tell. With a predictable ending, I could see the ending coming from a mile off. In my view a good book but not worth a purchase, a loan from the library would be much better.
B00454U1NS|5.0|I love Pink because her songs are so much fun to sing along to while by yourself anywhere.  This new album is chock full of her most fun sing-along songs, and even a few new ones to enjoy and get to know better.  I look forward to every album by this extremely talented songstress.
0446563048|5.0|This book was very easy for me to relate to.  He was a guy who just wanted to hang out with friends while making a lot of money.  He did somethings in college that I had done (slept in, missed class, watched soaps)...he makes his book easy to understand and is inspiring.  I suggest this book to any entrepreneur who is either employing other and are looking to develop a structure in which success is dependent upon it's team players OR self employed network marketers.   Tony is inspiring in his book while at the same time acts as if he is a \\"normal\\" guy.  Not arrogant, rather he is very much into enhancing other people and puts them in front of the money opportunity, which in exchange makes a lot of money! I love how he emphasizes letting people be themselves within a business to make that business unique.  No matter who you are or how much school you have/don't have, training is the same.  It is good to know what you are going to be spending your time doing and knowing your expectations in this unique way. I am going to visit the Las Vegas Zappos headquarters in 2 weeks, I am very excited.
B003NFM3JK|1.0|This movie was straight up just horrible and such a disappointment out of Disney.  I am so thankful that my boys were no where around when we watched this.  It seemed to drag on FOREVER and it had very frightening images.  Don't waste your time.  Watch the muppets or mickey's xmas carol.  Skip this one altogether.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|I know that title will stir up some controversy, but I can not think of a more consistent trilogy that has gotten better with each installment with the third film being the best of all! Pixar has done it again and is really starting to show up the competition with their latest classic animated tale Toy Story 3. What a track record!, Have these guys ever bombed? .....OK Andrew let's just leave Cars out of this! ;-D ....it's not that bad, just not as good as their greatest works.<br /><br />Pixar's Toy Story 3 is really a beautiful film to behold, both visually and metaphorically. I've shed more tears watching their animated films than most live action films combined in recent years. I guess the original Toy Story being somewhat crude by today's animation standards only had one way to go, up! That doesn't mean it was an easy task, but it is the one that started it all and put Pixar on the map. To improve on the original in the sequels, things like expectations and topping what they did last time have to be carefully balanced and of course the story must include a believable growth of the characters.<br /><br />It is all these areas that Toy Story 3 succeeds with flying colors! It's an incredible film that is both funny and heartfelt. One of the great things about this series is the nostalgic aspect, remembering all those cool toys and the in jokes that only adults will get. I do think this film is rather intense for younger kids at times, but most of the great one are. These films are really made with adults in mind which in nothing new to animation. Disney classic and Bugs Bunny cartoons where always constructed for adults as most kids wouldn't get half the jokes in them anyway.<br /><br />This is something for parents to consider before they let their kids see this or any other film like it. I know I grew up watching Pinocchio and Bambi and I never felt traumatized by them and they are some of the most frightening animated films out there....the same could be said about Finding Nemo which has some very scary scenes in it.<br /><br />Since parents tend to shield children from this stuff nowadays, well........ the choice it yours, but I don't think shielding them from this stuff is protecting them....that doesn't mean any of this stuff is meant for 3 year olds. The same case can be made for PC versions of these and other cartoons. I think having open discussions with children rather than hiding life's negatives is a much better solution.<br /><br />The four disc edition is loaded with interesting goodies and of course the film is included  in formats Blu Ray, DVD and Digital copy, which all look exceptional.has some very scary scenes in it.

B0000A98ZP|5.0|In \\"The Breakfast Club,\\" five teens show up for detention on a Saturday at a fictional Chicago-area high school.  Anthony Michael Hall, Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedy, Molly Ringwald, and Judd Nelson are cast as the brain, the athlete, the basket case, the princess, and the criminal.<br /><br />At the beginning of the film, some of the teens show hostility to one another as they see each other in their stereotypical roles.  But as the movie progresses, they begin to open up to each other about the problems in their lives and eventually see each other differently, as they find that they all have more in common than they think--they all have problems at school or at home to some degree, and they become friends once they have walked a mile in each other's shoes.<br /><br />Those who have reached middle age and watch the film for the first time since youth will notice that they more readily identify with the principal and some (but not all) of the situations that he faces as well.<br /><br />\\"Don't You Forget About Me\\" by Simple Minds is the theme song of the movie--it is fitting that one of the best movies of the Eighties has one of the best pop songs of the decade as its theme.<br /><br />\\"The Breakfast Club\\" often turns up on lists of favorite movies compiled by Generation Xers.  My guess is that those in Generation Y, the Millennial Generation, and future generations will relate to the film just as my generation did back in 1985, as the themes in the movie are timeless.
B001EN71CW|5.0|in short... if you like funny, seductive, great acting and very well writing stories about a future some kinda rooted on the western past where good guys beating bad ones take a cost, not silver fancy costumes here and prosthetic creatures from deep space, but yeah, there's some laser beams and beautiful outer space background...this is for you, no doubt!<br />The whole universe created for the series is so cool and really a nice watch every time, you become so in love with the same spaceship like with the fine female characters...just great!!!

B002WA4O8K|3.0|The concept is there. The theological underpinnings are there. But it just seemed to be lacking substance and explanation. I think he would do well to hire a good writer to help him. I think he has a valuable message. I had to think hard about this and read it several times just to understand it and still I'm not sure I do understand it the way he does. He ranges from credible to wildly assuming.
B002ZRPQ5K|1.0|Do you remember the last Star Wars movie of the original 3 that came out, and before the big space battle, the fish general says, \\"It's a trap!\\"? I did some research, and it turns out he was referring to one of his staff asking if he should buy Keane's new CD \\"Night Train\\" and not the Galactic Empire knowing they were coming to attack (it was coincidence that the Empire did in fact know they were coming). SERIOUSLY THOUGH. I don't have time to deal with this EP vs LP stuff. I go to the store. I pay as much for this CD as I do for every other CD I buy. I should get the same quality for my money, right? WELL I DON'T. Keane snuck into my wallet with their decent song history and all I got for it was a bad rash inside my ears and arthritis in my joints from forever hitting the \\"Next\\" button throughout the CD in the hopes that a song worth listening to on it exists.     Don't get me wrong, I'm not mad. Okay I'm mad, pissed even. But I'm not pissed. Oh wait. Picture this: you're a music artist! And not someone in a basement, you have several CDs, a few hit songs, most people even know your name. Your band puts together 8 \\"tracks\\" that consist of an intro with no vocals and lasts a minute and a half, a featured rap artist that talks about being beautiful from your crown to your cuticles and separating milk from lime, a featured Japanese artist that never speaks English during her song so you have no clue what's going on, Keane using THE SAME 3 LINES FOR AN ENTIRE SONG, a song that steals the theme from Rocky, then burns it to a disc and calls it a CD worth asking the public money for. Can you guess what band and CD you are?     Are there some okay songs you can listen to more than once? Yes. Are they worth buying the CD for? Not unless you want an excuse to get all riled up on a Wednesday night and break out your digital pitchfork and torch on amazon's review section. I have loved most of Keane's music in the past. Nothing is ever perfect, but there was enough balance withexperimenting and sticking with what they already did well that the CDs were worthwhile. If the experimenting in their other CDs was the equivalent of adjusting the amount of food a mouse in a cage gets every few days by a small percent, then this CD was dousing the mouse in gamma radiation, testing makeup on it, painting it's fur leopard print, renaming it to Lothar, giving it only sushi to eat and demanding it has until Tuseday to learn to play Beethoven's 9th ...or else. TOO MUCH EXPERIMENTING KEANE, TOO MUCH! And now look at the monster that you've created...stealing the Rocky theme, using the same 3 lines for a whole song, shame on you...

0385337388|5.0|The book itself is a classic & should be read by any physician who came of age during the 1960s and did a residency in the 1970s. One precaution: do not trust Amazon's \\"overnight\\" service through UPS. I paid a substantial amount for overnight delivery (from Reno NV to Medford OR), but did not get the package until 7 days later. A trip that can be done in 6 to 8 hours should not take 168 hours!
B002KSPKRS|2.0|Oh I so wanted to love these headphones for the 360.  They claim to have it all:  comfort, wireless, dolby digital surround, ease of use and comfort.  What they fail to mention they also have snap, crackle and pop which completely and utterly detract from any gaming experience you could ever have.<br /><br />Do you have a cordless phone, cell phone or wireless connection for your Xbox or computer?  Then you can expect to get all the noise you don't want through these phones.  I even went as far as putting my cell phone on 3G only and then power off to try and help.  When I did that, it did seem to work.  I also would shut down my laptop and that also helped...should I have to turn off every electrical device in my home to use these?  I think not.  Every once and awhile you will get a doozy of pop/crackle that will make you pull them off.<br /><br />They also don't fit that great...they can't get a tight fit around your ears.  They just kind of hang on them...expanding the headset just makes them longer, not tighter.<br /><br />I wish I could find my receipt for these...so be sure to hang on to yours.
1439152780|3.0|I have been looking forward to this novel for months and was on the pre-order list because I couldn't get enough of Morton. I have recommended her two previous books to everyone I know. When I started reading her previous books, everything in my life suffered because I couldn't put the books down. For \\"Distant Hours\\" I was delighted to see the publication date coincided with my vacation, so I could lose myself in the book without guilt. Hard to believe, but I'm back from the two weeks and only 70% through the book. I found it slow and often confusing. In addition, I'm not even sure that I care about the characters very much as they are so thinly painted. I will finish the book, but I hope this novel doesn't signal that future popular author fate--nothing left to say.
0345509617|5.0|Let me start off by saying that The Empire Strikes Back is one of my favorite movies of all time.  As I am writing this review I am about halfway through the book, but I feel somewhat compelled to write a review due to the recent passing of the director, Irvin Kershner.<br /><br />One of the included quotations from Kershner regarding his approach to the making of \\"Empire\\" illustrates why this movie is so well-loved by Star Wars fans, and in my opinion reflects what exactly was so frustrating to many fans about the Prequels:<br /><br />\\"The thing that you learn in directing is that when you're on the floor, no matter how complex the shooting is...you have to remain absolutely sensitive to every nuance of the behavior of the people around you.  Because, ultimately, if you don't keep in mind the overall humanity, then the machine takes over and suddenly all you have are technically fine shots, technically good performances.  The story's being told, but something's lacking, something mysterious, indefinable.\\" --Irvin Kershner<br /><br />\\"Empire\\" had this \\"indefinable humanity\\" in spades, and the book really shows how the director was able to craft such a tale.  Kershner really played with the tensions between Luke and Vader, and between Leia and Han.  He (along with Frank Oz and Mark Hamill) made us all believe there is a soul underneath that puppet (Yoda).  The lack of this \\"indefinable humanity\\" in the Prequels is what made me so sad about how the those movies ultimately came out (but perhaps this should better be saved for another review).<br /><br />Back to the book: I highly highly recommend this.  From the inclusion of amazing archival behind-the-scenes photos, gorgeous concept art and sketches (most notably by Ralph McQuarrie), to in-depth first-hand accounts by most of the important cast and crew, it really brings you so close to what everyone went through in the making of the movie.
B003EV6DBW|3.0|I have been a Doctor Who fan since the debut of the modern series in 2005.  I have every episode of the modern series on DVD, along with 30 episodes of the 1963-1989 series.  I had great hopes for the current season, because Steven Moffat had taken over the show.  Moffat wrote 4 out of the 46 \\"episodes\\" (2- and 3-part episodes counting as 1) from the Russell T. Davies series.  All 4 of his earlier stories ranked among my all-time top 10, including number 1 (The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances).  Unfortunately, the first Moffat season did not come close to living up to my expectations, and I did not think that any of Moffat's episodes from this season compared favorably to his earlier 4.  I think there were 2 reasons for this.    Excessive quantity led to reduced quality on Moffat's part, and he had poor support from other writers.  Moffat wrote as many episodes (4) and weekly installments (6) this year as he did in the entire Davies era - this was too much for him.  Moffat needs to cut his number of weekly installments to 4 or 5 next year and recruit better writers than he had last year.  Aside from Moffat, the only good writers in the Davies era were Paul Cornell, Robert Shearman, Toby Whithouse, and Matt Jones, in that order.  Toby Whithouse wrote 1 weekly installment this year; the other three combined for ZERO.  Moffat should bring Paul Cornell and Robert Shearman back.    The second problem is Moffat's fault.  Moffat's first Doctor Who episode - The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances - was a superb example of the traditional \\"Doctor solving a problem\\" type of episode.  Moffat's other three episodes from the 2005-2009 series all dealt with time-loop paradoxes and/or interleaving timelines.  These episodes all worked well, especially \\"Blink,\\" but this was partially because such episodes were \\"different.\\"  Having such episodes account for the bulk of a season, as they did in season 5, is tedious and also confusing.  I still don't understand how much of season 5 actuallyhappened after the end of the last episode  (The Big Bang) erased most or all of the season.    Another issue pertains to the current Doctor.  I was not impressed by the Matt Smith iteration, especially in comparison to Tom Baker, David Tennant, and Chris Eccleston. (He was definitely better than Sylvester McCoy, Colin Baker, or Jon Pertwee from the original series.)  Tennant and Eccleston brought gravity to the role.  I especially liked the angry, enigmatic, vengeful, but mostly good, version of Eccleston (Season 1 of the modern series).  The \\"lonely angel\\" of the Tennant years (Seasons 1-4.5) also has definite merits.  For example, the last 10 minutes of \\"Human Nature/The Family of Blood\\" may have been the high point of the entire modern series, or maybe even the entire series back to 1963.  The latest Season 5/Steven Moffatt/Matt Smith portrayal of the Doctor as \\"a madman with a box\\" lacked dignity and emotional depth, and even risked trivializing the role and making it silly.  Unlike some other somewhat negative reviewers, I did not object to Karen Gillan/Amy Pond.    In terms of my average rating per episode, season 5 compares well to the first 4 full seasons, and the partial season 4.5, rating behind only season 1.  However, this is due to strength at the bottom, not strength at the top.  Season 5 had only 1 really rotten episode - Victory of the Daleks - compared to 3 or 4 per year in seasons 1-4.  Unfortunately, my favorite 6 episodes from the modern era all come from seasons 1-4, and my 10 favorite episodes overall do not include anything from season 5.

B001IBIHQ4|4.0|First and formost this is not the Band of Brothers. this is a different movie. just because Mr Hanks and Co. made it doesnt meen that it will be the same and to be honest im glad it was different. it is a good film and enjoyable. Mr Hanks and Co. did an outstanding job of making this movie and i believe all viewers will be pleased as long as they except the fact that this is not the Band of Brothers. i highly recomend this movie.

Just great!
1559277734|5.0|These stories are timeless and the reading is excellent.  Animal stories are wonderful for all ages, and James Herriot's stories are people stories too.  These are wonderful for listening to on car trips.
0132350882|5.0|Clean code is an excellent book, especially if you are into Test Driven Development (TDD).  The author does a nice job of explaining why code examples are considered good or bad,  and does a nice job of offering solutions to make bad code better.  All of the examples are in Java, but a C++, C#, etc. developer could still get something out of this book.  The author discusses concepts such as the Single Responsibility Principle (a class should only do one thing and one thing only), reduction/elimination of duplicate code a.k.a the D.R.Y Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself), having 100% code coverage (a little obsessive for my taste, but to each their own) as it relates to testing, etc.  If you read through this book, you probably will not agree with everything stated in it, but it should give you an idea of some things that could work for you.  And even if you only implement a handful of the suggestions you will almost certainly become a better developer.
B003WTE886|5.0|I'm so happy I purchased this album..I absolutely love it!  The songs are heartfelt and the subject material is relatable to most young women.  There is just the right amout of upbeat songs and slow songs and you find yourself singing along.  It's so awesome that she wrote all her own songs for the album because it was so beautifully written.  This is my favorite CD right now! I don't normally listen to country but I really love this album because it's like country with a pop edge.
0486268659|5.0|Like everybody else, I've seen the movies and heard the story over and over, but still decided to grab a copy of the book.  I've had other copies that have been lost over the years, but for $1 why not replace it?    It's a short book, one you could get through in a night or two if you tried, that every christmas fan should keep on the shelf.    C'mon Dover, give us some more thrift editions!

I love Victoria and am fascinated by here great sense of style, but the book seemed to consist mostly of brand name dropping.

B0010X745K|5.0|Once again Stephen King hates for any of his movies to end \\"Happy Ever After.\\"  This movie wouldn't spoil his twisted sense of humor as usual. The mysterious mist soon arrives in town from out of nowhere, leaving the town resident's dumbfounded. Seeking shelter at town's hardware store seems to be get too crowd before residents decide to venture out among the \\"Mist.\\" With casualties becoming an issue a few members decide to venture outside the safety of the hardware store to seek help from nearby National Guard Unit. Little do the town residents realize their local NGU is the cause of all their problems? The storylines ends just as twisted as Mr. King's promising signature hand at work, leaving you guessing how it will all end.

B002ZG99A4|4.0|Certainly, the coolest thing about The Expendables is it's cast. Even the small moment of having Arnold, Stallone and Willis sharing on screen, climatic or not; memorable, none the less! Even though there's not much to look out concerning story telling sure it delivers heavy fun from start to end.    As for the extras on this Blu-ray/DVD I must say, I'm pleased. The Comic-Con panel is worth the 45 minutes, the making of has plenty of things to watch at, the Bonus View with Director Silvester Stallone is good enough, as the rest does it job. Too bad there's only one deleted scene and, of course it had to be deleted!    The future of this is franchise wise, in my opinion. Next time I see some more Willis and maybe Schwarzenegger on screen (did I spelled that right?) and please, as Mr. Stallone hinted on the Comic-Con panel about those actors who didn't want to join the cast, please, Van Damme, if you get a second chance, do not go insane and say no again.    See you for an Expendables' 2 review!

0312600844|5.0|Had I stopped about 3/4 through \\"Freedom\\", this could have been a one-star review. But the way the novel finished was, to me, so powerful that it tied the preceding story together. The purpose of things that initially seemed boring or unnecessary fell into place for me near the end (it is a testament to the author's skill that I remained hooked enough to slog through for the payoff). I am often disappointed with otherwise brilliant authors who can't write a convincing or satisfying ending (no, that doesn't have to mean a \\"happy\\" ending); this book is amazing to me in that the bulk of the book became convincing because of the story in the last portions. Conversely, the ending itself would have seemed contrived and unbelievable without the thorough immersion in the seemingly boring details about the main characters. (I do think that the characters of Jessica and Lalitha were underdeveloped.)    Maybe the response of giving either one-star or five-stars to \\"Freedom\\" comes down to reading style. I guess my style required me to immerse myself in Freedom and trust the author enough to hope for a payoff for my investment of time. If that's not your style, reading \\"Freedom\\" may just make you mad.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|We purchased this to go on our City Mini Double stroller for a recent trip to Disney World.  I can't believe we lived without this for so long!  The BJ attachment was expensive, so I was so happy to read the reviews on this and find out how well it worked.  The stroller folded up with it still attached, and it was a great spot for drinks, cell phones, maps, baby shoes, etc.  Very sturdy and stable for drinks and made of tough material.  An employee of a stroller rental company stopped us outside of our hotel to ask us about our Buggy Buddy. He said that his company rented out the same stroller and had the BJ parent accessory, but it was not as substantial.  He loved the way this one was made and was going to look into it for their rentals.  Would definitely recommend it!

B002JVWR4A|2.0|People must be kidding when saying this is the best Bones season ever.<br /><br />This is the worst (well, maybe the Third Season was the worst). Probably succumbing to network pressure, almost all episodes are completely stand-alone. The so-called \\"character development\\" is close to nothing, just small bits and pieces. The formula is stronger than ever in this season. The main character (Bones) is colder and more skeptcial than before, absolutely no evolution.<br /><br />There is an \\"origin\\" episode, directed by David Boreanaz, that is the best in my opinion, and it makes clear how actor Eric Milliagn (Zak) is missed. The \\"intern revolving door\\" is boring, boring and tedious (exceot maybe the Nigel-Murray) character. Camile has absolutely nothing to do, just to make surprised expressions all the time.<br /><br />Come on, to say this is better than the first or second seasons does not make sense. By this point, it just became formula, with Boreanaz and DEschanel also producing and makin sure they can extract all the last cents before it goes down.

B0013FSL0C|5.0|I am hard to please when it comes to a TV series, but I have a psych degree, so thought this show sounded somewhat interesting.  I had never heard of the show but ordered the first episode on Netflix.  I started watching with some skepticism, and thought, oh well, I gave it a try; I will send it back.  However, in the time it took to prepare to eject the DVD, I was hooked beyond my expectations.  The acting is superb, the subject matter is relevant, the way the entire show is constructed, with heartfelt issues and realism, interesting characters and suspenseful events, this show is a winner.  I love it.  I ordered the first season - love it -- and plan to get the 2nd season.  The only thing I am concerned with is saying goodbye to the original patients.  I will miss the patients from Season 1.  I hope there is a revival of some kind with Paul and Laura's relationship.  I highly recommend this series for any intellectual person.

B000UD0ESA|5.0|The Film:<br />In my opinion, one of the greatest science-fiction films ever made.  It was released in 1982 and to this day nothing comes close; visually, aurally, and maybe even emotionally.  The cast and crew put their blood, sweat, and tears into this and it shows in every frame.  In spite of all this, you'll either love it or hate it, but give it at least two viewings before you decide, there are a lot of subtleties to pick up on.  This is not an action film, it's a noir and also a bit on the artsy side (and it pains me to use this word, I don't consider myself to be an artsy person).  The first time I watched it my thoughts were along the line of \\"...Okay?\\", I went back to it a year later and it all just suddenly clicked.  I now place it among my top favorite films and I've seen it at least six times in the few years since.  Everything about it is just flawless, the writing, the acting, the sets and lighting, the music etc. all come together to create a stunning whole (I could praise the sets and music until I'm blue in the face, amazing).  When you watch it, be sure and do it right; watch it late at night, lights out, without any distractions (in fact, this is one of the few movies that I prefer to watch alone), it's the only way to do it.  This is not a daytime, friends over and chatting movie, you'll ruin it for yourself. Again, give it at least two tries before you make up your mind on it.  Many, many people dislike it at first glance (probably in part because it's so different from the mainstream and what we are accustomed to) but it often grows on them upon subsequent viewings.<br /><br />The Final Cut Edition:<br />Gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous.  I don't have a Blu-Ray player or the latest greatest television, but even on DVD on my 32\\" 720p LCD it looks fantastic.  Beautifully remastered picture and sound, and the scene extensions, while all short, are a welcome addition.  They also did a really great job digitally adding Zhora's real face back in, to where it no longer looks like a stuntwoman with an afro-wig.  It truly is seamless now.  Fear not however, this is not a George Lucas style re-release and it is not wildly altered, it is absolutely the original Blade Runner film that everyone knows and loves, only it has now been brought to perfection.  The big issue that will divide some viewers is the voice-over narration, or rather, the lack thereof.  Personally, I prefer it without the narration (I just thought it sounded really cheesy and poorly done and detracted from the greatness of the film), the lack of narration only makes me enjoy the Final Cut even more, but I know that some people prefer it with the narration and if you really have to have it then look elsewhere, it is entirely absent here.  The cheesy tacked-on ending (the one that included landscape footage from the shooting of \\"The Shining\\") was also axed and now we get a good one that better fits the nature of the film (again, my opinion).  There is also a few hours worth of documentary on the second disc that I enjoyed.<br /><br />All-in-all, a must-own.  Yes, it's true, you might not like it, but you owe it to yourself to give it a chance (two chances).  It may just end up becoming a favorite and drawing you deep into its beautifully bleak world as it did with me.  Highly, highly recommended, this is a masterpiece in every sense.

142311339X|4.0|Jason, Piper, and Leo are compelling characters.  The Lost Hero is the perfect expansion of the Percy Jackson series and many fans are excited to see humor return to Riordan's novels (something that was lacking in The Red Pyramid).  What I am concerned about is the poor editing of many of Riordan's first editions.  Christmas was misspelled in The Red Pyramid and there were no less than five miss-wordings in The Lost Hero.  Many of the mistakes are spelled correctly (therefore not caught through spell check), but would be caught by a conscientious editor who was actually interested in what s/he was reading.  I'm disappointed in the bad precedence this sets for our children, who think if their favorite author can make sloppy mistakes, why is it such a big deal if they do?

1439152780|4.0|This was my first read by Kate Morton. I had no idea what to expect except from all the wonderful reviews I have read from other bloggers on her books. I received an advance readers copy which was a whopping 672 pages long! Quite a chunkster for me! However, I was looking forward to reading it. I dug in with gusto. The story is very detailed and the characters are very complex. The story comes together rather slowly but it does a great job building suspense, at least it did for me. I'm not sure that if the story moved faster you would get the same effect. It is a very layered story.<br /><br />I was very curious about Milderhurst and the sister's who lived in the castle. I was very curious about the letter that caused such a reaction for Edith's mother and how everything tied into the castle and the sisters. There are so many questions I had when reading the book. As more of the mystery is revealed, I found myself wondering how in the world it was all going to resolve itself. Ironically, I found the ending when the whole story finally comes together a bit rushed and I ended up reading it three times. I think at that point the suspense was killing me and I was reading it much too fast. Take your time with the ending. It is a very good one and you don't want to miss one bit of it's goodness. I will be reading Kate's other books as I think she is a wonderful storyteller. She is quite descriptive which left me with both beautiful and dark images of Milderhurst. This is a story of family, lost love, mystery and intrigue. I found myself wanting to both hurry through the story to find out the ending and wanting to savor every morsel of the story. I have never had a book do that before. I highly recommend this book.
B004CAWKXE|5.0|At first listen I was a little put off by the sound MCR were creating. After buying the album and giving it a couple listen through, im really liking what their doing now with this album. Its got a very 1970's vibe to it. It much brighter than anything theve done before and it makes me feel good listening to it.  I hear influences from U2, david bowie, led zeppelin. This is an excellent record!
0525951652|4.0|Ken Follett is a very good writer. He is successful and smart. I've read many of his excellent books.  \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" and \\"Eye of the Needle\\" are thought by many to be lasting 20th Century literature, and both of those books remain favorites of mine.<br /><br />\\"Fall of Giants\\" is soap opera at its best. It's truly \\"made for TV\\" and is populated by shallow but relatively believable characters, doing everything they can to ruin each other, themselves and the civilized world in the name of ..... well, maintaining the status quo, and/or fighting for progress and/or annihilating those who disagree or whom they fear.  I am certain we will soon see at least a movie, if not an elaborate and lengthy TV series stretching for 2 or 3 seasons, created from this book and the 2 which will follow it. The resulting show will be as gaudy, elaborate and sexually depraved as \\"The Tudors,\\" no doubt.<br /><br />Follett has a great knack for turning important world events into the soap opera they probably actually were!!  \\"Fall of Giants\\" is exactly how I like my world history - abundant sex, populated by badly-behaving people, strewn with idiots and led by self-centered world and local leaders (and followers), who are concerned mostly with saving their own skin as their only life-worthy objective. Few of these characters can think beyond the boundaries of their sex organs.<br /><br />While I think he got most of the historical facts relatively correct, there were a few errors. On page 614, for example, high-born Briton Earl Fitzherbert (Fitz) complains about President Woodrow Wilson, saying \\"But he did not declare war.\\" Follett should know better. The president of the United States cannot ever declare war; that's the prerogative of Congress. Only George W. Bush violated that rule, and we all know what happened as a result.<br /><br />There are no perfect characters in this book, which chronicles the lives, successes and failures of 6 families, 2 American, 1 British, 1 Welsh, 1 German and 1 Russian. These people and their offspring (and friends and enemies) will continue through the following 2 books. Which family is most successfully portrayed? In my judgment, it is the Welsh family Williams, a working class (mining), poor family which produced 2 very smart children, Ethel and Billy, who become extremely successful political figures, championing labor and women's rights. They're the most believable and most endearing. Who are the least successful? The Russians, whether it is Grigori or Lev (one having immigrated to Buffalo, NY, and marrying into a mob family; the other having remained in Russia to star in the Revolution of 1917), were not only unlikeable but also rather unbelievable. Often, he is better with negative portrayals (the elder Von Ulrich, Earl Fitzherbert, elder Mr. Williams, President Wilson, and Lev Peshkov) than he is with those more positive, upbeat characters advancing the causes of progress. Follett seems to write men better than he writes women - a theme through all his books that I have read. He also writes scenes better than he writes people. Some of the battle scenes, and scenes of the ordinary home-life of his characters, were very well done.<br /><br />My basic problem with the book has to do with the way-too-many, way-too-cute and way-too-coincidental, chance (or arranged) meetings of various characters at various times in the story - often during the course of WWI. Just didn't work for me, all this coincidence. In most instances, the story would have been stronger without these key players meeting unbelievably at odd places, whether on the battlefield, during Paris peace negotiations or somehow magically appearing at a hotel or some other place, as if it were easy to accomplish. These chance meetings were not needed to knit the story together.<br /><br />Follett omits (even though the book is 984 pages long) too many details of some of the episodes through which his characters survive. How Fitzherbert and his wifeescaped from Russia during the peasant uprising was never written; they just escaped we later learned. It would have been interesting reading to see how Follett got them out of that life-and-death jam that he got them into. Or, how did Walter Von Ulrich escape, after being wounded on the bridge during battle with the Americans? You expect these kinds of dropped story lines in a short book (such as Anabel Lyon's brilliant but all too brief \\"The Golden Mean\\") but not in this tome. At the very least I expect all episodes in \\"Fall of Giants\\" to have a beginning, middle and end. The end was often missing.<br /><br />There's a lot of preaching of human and civil rights throughout. Follett can't seem to let it go, this passion he has to bring \\"democracy\\" to everyone - not exactly what WWI was all about, after all. At times, the political passions voiced by some characters seemed to be Follett's own.<br /><br />It's a really quick read, despite its heft and length - about a week. I enjoyed it quite a lot. I disagree strongly with those who rake this book over the coals with their negative reviews.<br /><br />I give it a 3.75 and round it up to a 4, if for no other reason than admiration for a writer having successfully undertaken the task of preparing us for the upcoming TV show by writing this entertaining, if superficial and perhaps stereotypical, expansive view of political and actual life in the first 25 years of the 1900s. Without commenting on their literary value, Tolstoy's \\"Anna Karenina\\" and Flaubert's \\"Madame Bovary\\" were deadly boring in comparison. All three authors, however, cleverly use (heterosexual) sex, sex, and more sex to keep reader interest. All-in-all, it's just a grand scale soap opera to enjoy.ng was never written; they just escaped we later learned.

Without commenting on their literary value, Tolstoy's \\"Anna Karenina\\" and Flaubert's \\"Madame Bovary\\" were deadly boring in comparison. All three authors, however, cleverly use (heterosexual) sex, sex, and more sex to keep reader interest. All-in-all, it's just a grand scale soap opera to enjoy.

0525951652|5.0|This book is comprehensive historical fiction that is an easy, quick read.  It is captivating and transports you into the lives of the characters.  At times, it is a bit unbelieveable that a series of event would fall into place so that lives are intertwined; but isn't that good fiction?? I think reviewers who have been negative on this book with regard to content are just too serious and uptight, this is a novel intended to provide a pleasureable esacpist read.  To those reviewers who were critical with their review because the cost of purchasing the Kindle version is too high, shame on them for being negative to such a delightful book over price. This book provides great entertainment at a fair price whether it's Kindle or hard copy.

B0035V35PI|3.0|This is a really bloody movie. The story was alright, and the action was decent, but I feel there is unnecessary and excessive blood in this movie. Definitely not for kids.  You may see as many blood as any of the \\"SAW\\" movies.
0596009208|5.0|I thought that this book was just terrific.  Down to earth and funny with the ways that Kathy descibed what was coming, how to do something even how to think.  I took some formal JAVA classes back in 2007 and was suppose to start using it on a project that we were starting but as things goes I have not used it as yet.  A friend at work also bought the book because we were going over the fundamentals with someone from our vendor who is super sharp in JAVA.  It really made 'remembering'  easier and fun to read.   I am sure that it will be a book that I'll go back to time and time again.  Thanks Kathy for writing it in a way that made sense.
B001KVZ6ES|5.0|Gran Torino opens with Clint blankly staring at his family during his wife's wake at church. The viewer can see his disgust and pain fighting for control of his emotions. Here is a man, a proud traditionalist witnessing his world disappear before his very eyes, and worst of all he sees this transformation in his own family. He seems to ask the audience if they understand what's happened.<br />Clint's character has spent his life fighting for the American ideals and purity. He has little patience for apologists (the young priest) or his greedy and distant blood family. He finds himself in the middle of a transformation that has left little of his former world intact, as he realizes that the new world around him is completely foreign,(no pun intended) not only physically but emotionally. He shows us both sides of the coin in our interactions and in our motives.The relentless putsch of nature and natural selection are also evident here as we are reminded by both clashing cultures that \\"we must stick to our own\\";happily this notion is allowed to run its course and form the abject and pitiable element of their relationships.<br />This movie forces each one of us to look ourselves in the mirror and see the prejudice, fear and disgust bred by ignorance and adherence to traditional rules. It also allow us to find the most important aspect of our role as human beings in our environment as we are confronted with the dilemma of sticking to our own traditions or doing what is morally right. Between our true self and our everyday persona, we can choose what is more important, our lives as we have lived them (attached to our environments and backgrounds)or the primordial moral high road as Clint showed us in this performance.<br />After all, this movie highlights the unmovable truth that within us all there is a very high principle and admiration for the rights of men,albeit for some in our species, the necessary precursor to bringing that justice to the forefront may be arduousat best.<br />Clint, after all seems to answer Rodney King's question with a resounding yes. We can get along, and yes we can find family in the faces of strangers when a halo of mendacity obscures our own blood kindred.
B002TOJHCM|1.0|What kind of sick, twisted joke is this? I'm here reading all these reviews thinking that I'm buying a perfectly stripped down book of the Beatles's tunes with the melody, lyrics and chord symbols... And what do I get? A book with lyrics and chord symbols on top of the lyrics! There's no music notation here! How am I supposed to know how long each chord lasts for? This is so ridiculous. I'm sorry I bought this. What a disgrace!
B001PPGAIA|4.0|I loved this movie.  I really enjoyed the way it was filmed, not atall what i expected but really liked it.  The movie was super long but i still enjoyed it.  There were about three parts in the movie were it could have ended  but continued onto another part of the story, but i still enjoyed every new story that emerged.  Nicole Kidman did great acting and Hughe Jackman was also very good, their chemistry between eachother played off very well.
B003XWEQ1G|5.0|This is probably the most lovable version of Robin Hood to date. History is important and I enjoyed the play on actual events in this movie. It is worth owning.
B00003CXB4|5.0|This movie has been my favortie since i was a little girl.  It has great music, animation and characters.  The underline storytheme of a little boy blaming himself for the death of his father can be related to in ways of divorce and death for kids now a days. Then the way Simba finds strength through friends and family in the end lets kids know that there will always be people around to support you.  The soundtrack was also amazing, very fun and entertaining for parents and children.
B003XRDYX2|5.0|I'm a little biased, seeing as how I own every Dylan album except for 'Saved' and 'Knocked Out Loaded'. But I think every Dylan fan ought to be lucky enough to get their hands on this thing!<br /><br /> I think this set, like the Beatles mono box, is a pivotal reissue. John Mellancamp released an entire album of new material in mono 2 or 3 months ago, and other, younger artists are following suit. Maybe Bob and the Beatles are pointing the way yet again...<br /><br />These albums sound more alive than I've ever heard. The first three albums sound like Dylan is in the room with you. But the revelations begin with 'Bringing It All Back Home'. \\"It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\\" had my hair standing on end. \\"Tambourine  Man\\" sounds revitalized, and \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\"  sounds like it was recorded yesterday. When you get to 'Highway 61 Revisited' I defy you to not be blown away by \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\". The drums come at you like gunshots, and the piano is (finally) audible over Al Kooper's organ. 'Blonde On Blonde' benefits most, though. Dylan's wild, thin, mercury sound is right there, front and center. There are details and contours to these songs you may never have noticed: the acoustic guitar arpeggios in the bridge to \\"I Want You\\" and the bass on \\"Visions Of Johanna\\" come to mind. 'John Wesley Harding' sounds even more stark and sparse than it does in stereo.<br /><br />One of the little things I love about these mono remasters is that you can hear Bob's voice echo in the background. Another thing I love is hearing the musicians, some of the era's best, without the artificial seperation of the stereo mixes.<br /><br />This set here is as good as it gets. The sound is sparkling, the songs are revolutionary and eternal, and there's something here for everyone!<br /><br />The packaging is great, too. The discs come in miniature replicas of the original l.p. packaging, some of which contain inserts. I also found a coupon inside for a free mp3 download of the whole set. The booklet, with liner notes by Greil Marcus is... meh. I don't particularly enjoy anything Marcus has ever done. At least he stays on topic (for once) in the notes.<br /><br />If only Bob would go back to recording in mono. Or, at least, put out a mono mix of 'Blood On the Tracks'. And 'Desire'. And 'Street Legal'. And just a couple of others...notes by Greil Marcus is... meh. I don't particularly enjoy anything Marcus has ever done. At least he stays on topic (for once) in the notes.

0060887966|5.0|The gift edition is a beautiful boxed book.  The book has beautiful color illustrations.   The story is a classic.  I am giving this as graduation presents for high school and college students.  It has a great message for living your life.
B000I2J0W4|1.0|I bought this DVD for my Halloween party. This is my favortie movie and I was SOOO excited. We have tried it in 5 DVD players at my house and had friends try it in theirs and nothing. The seller says it's because it has to be an HD DVD player and nothing else. Well that is not what the disclaimer said when I bought it - it just says it ahs to be HD. Now it has been 13 days since the seller said they would send a replacement and I haven't even gotten any else. No email and no DVD. I would recommend buying this from someone else. If they make good I'll come back and let you know but it has been a lot of agravation and disappointment.
B000JMLFLW|4.0|I love this book and re-read it nearly every year. I just downloaded the free version to read on my new kindle. There are 4 paragraphs missing in chapter 1, at least one word in chapter 2... And that's as far as I have gotten. So the item loses a star for being incomplete
B001KZI2WW|5.0|There should be no hesitation in wanting to buy this shoe.  Very comfy.  Like walking on clouds.  I'm convinced that thick croc sole absorbs all the impact in the knees, hips and other problem area joints that non-supportive shoes usually disregard.  This is a great work shoe, leisure shoe, walking and sight seeing shoe, you name it.  The comfort is worth every penny I can't say it enough.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|I waited for this one for almost a year after I saw Avatar in theaters.  I passed up the first release and am glad I did!  Avatar is a movie that really deserves to be seen in theaters, nothing else really does it justice.  BUT, as far as blu-ray releases go, this is one of the best I've bought.  The visuals are stunning as is the sound and the special features are great.  One of the highlights for me is the scene deconstruction where you can watch about half of the scenes in the movie along with the original motion capture performance.  It's pretty cool to see how accurately the actor's performances were portrayed by the CGI characters.    As far as the extended cut goes, I didn't really care for it.  The extra 16 minutes weren't really necessary for the film, although they did add a little bit... they really just made the movie seem longer but not better.  It took away from the pacing of the film which I think the theatrical release got perfectly.  Otherwise, this is an excellent release!
074322454X|5.0|Stephen Ambrose's \\"Band of Brothers\\" does a fine job of conveying how war can bring together men of so many different walks of life. The men of Easy Company come across as very ordinary citizen soldiers who in turn did extraordinary things throughout the Normandy Campaign and the European Theater from June 1944-May 1945. The stories of what these men had to go through are told in an easy to read and understand narrative by Ambrose that flows elegantly throughout and leaves the reader not wanting to put the book down due to the interesting chapters of Ambrose's work. The book weaves the tell of the drop on D-Day into Normandy, the dangerous trek down Hell's Highway in the doomed Operation Market Garden, and E Company's part in the Battle of the Bulge, among other important events throughout.    The book is great, as most others have said. The series is one I just purchased and am watching. The book and the series go hand in hand for the most part so far, but definitely read this book first if you haven't seen the series, as it makes the men on screen come alive more as you know the soldier's they are portraying, etc. Stephen Ambrose has had some contreversy with issues of plagiarism for some of his works but not for this incredible book, it is a must have for a history buff, especially WWII history buffs like myself or even a casual reader, easy read. Definitely recommend this book. And God Bless the men who sacrificed their lives in E Company and every where for the US, and the other Allies to give us the freedoms we still enjoy to this day.
0425166805|1.0|Read Flim-Flam by James Randi instead.  This book is full of faulty evidence, pretenses, and is RIFE with logical fallacies.    Save your money.
159562015X|5.0|I loved the book.  I have always liked who I am and the strengths I somewhat understood, but never really understood specifically what they are and why I do what I do.  Strength Finders took me to a place I have never been and gave me a new vision of how to better manage me to be happy and successful in life.  This is a book you will buy for those you love, work with, and mentee's that need clarification of what they have an opportunity to be really good at.<br /><br />It's a must buy for all ages.  I just bought it for my son on his 32 birthday.  Wish that I had that opportunity 30 years ago....I probably would have done a few things differently, and made a few wiser choices.<br /><br />Be Well<br />billbaun
B002ZG999U|1.0|A: Have Sylvester Stallone write, direct and star in it.    This movie had lots of promise as a throwback to those over-the-top action movies of the 80s, particularly given its all-star cast.  Unfortunately, Sly Stallone's handiwork both off and on screen rendered this production a bad joke.  His clownish plastic surgery alone was sufficient to make the flick borderline unwatchable.  It's a shame that the likes of Jason Statham, who is genuinely entertaining, had to share a script with the insufferable, talentless Stallone.
B0042JTDXK|3.0|I would have given this 2 1/2 stars if I had that option because this CD is somewhere between \\"Its Ok\\" and \\"I don't like it\\". I really was looking forward to this CD. I have been a Josh Groban fan from the beginning and I love the feeling his music brings to me. I could listen to his voice over and over again for hours.      That being said this CD was a huge disappointment to me. I really, really wanted to like it and I waited a while to give my review hoping some of the songs would grow on me. None of the songs give me chills like Josh's older stuff and I don't like the style he is going towards. I loved what he did with David Foster and yes I wish he would go back to what he does best.      The other comment I have to say is that all the falsetto drives me up the wall. I was not a fan of February song for that reason. I think Higher Window and Hidden Away would be beautiful songs if the falsetto was taken out. It is just too much.      I hope Josh's next CD is back to what he did in his earlier days because he has such a beautiful voice and I'm sure I will have it on preorder like every other one. This is my least favorite CD so far though and for listeners just discovering Josh Groban I would not recommend it.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|I'm 14 and when I was little I used to hate the Beatles stating that they wre too old.  Well everything changed when I heard this album.  After I heard this my view changed on the Beatles and I learned to appreciate all of their material which are all 5 stars.  The first song on the album \\"Come Together\\" is what made me relize I should give these guys a chance and if you were like me you should also give the best band ever.  Now here is each songs rating.    1. Come Together: 10/10 This song is catchy and has a great bluesy feel to it. I bet a lot of people like this song and didn't know this is a Beatles song.   2. Something: 10/10 This is without a doubt George Harrisons greatest song. It was even stated that this is the greatest love song ever written.  3. Maxwell's Silver Hammer 7/10 One of the 2 songs that I don't care for and tend to skip it.  4.Oh Darling! 10/10 Paul's vocals are the best on this song.  5. Octopus's Garden 10/10 Ringo's best song and very catchy  6. I Want You(She's So Heavy) 10/10 A 7 minute song where the guitar makes this song great.  7. Here Comes the Sun 10/10 This song can make anyone smile  8. Because 6/10 My least favorite song on the album. It's just to druggy.  9-16. 20/10 This is the Abbey Road Meledy which separates the Beatles from any other band. It's a good closing to the album.  17. Her Majesty 10/10 A catchy 23 second song to close it out.
B000001FQQ|1.0|I just cannot believe how terrible this is.  Kiss really should have retired after Animalize anyhow.  They have not done a decent album since.  Gene and Paul should be outright ashamed of themselves.  I guess they didn't learn that jumping on trends for them does not work after the Dynasty/Unmasked awfulness.  How could they sink even lower?  Start putting out crap like this was the answer.
B004498KPU|4.0|Generally, I write my reviews from an audio/videophile perspective. You probably don't need me to tell you these videos are great. If you don't already own them, definitely pick this box set up; Michael Jackson's short films are classics that literally defined a medium. They're a must own.<br /><br />However, while this is an easy purchase for casuals and first-timers, there are definitely some things to consider for fans who already own most of this material on DVD, so I'm going to try to direct my review at them.<br /><br />For the collector, this is a great set. I've always been a sucker for lenticular packaging, and the booklet inside is a nice touch. Normally I'm not huge on photo books, but this has a few details on each video, including the directors for each one (info I didn't know for every single video). The set includes all of his music videos/short films included on his previous DVDs, as well as a handful that haven't yet seen official release (and also, for the very first time, the uncensored version of Scream that doesn't bleep out the f-bomb). Completists will definitely enjoy having the extra unreleased stuff as part of the package, but will also have a few other gripes with the setlist.<br /><br />For starters, Ghosts is the 4-minute excerpt from the larger 40-minute film. I would have loved to have seen the full 40-minute film, but IF a standalone release is in the works, it's fine that it was left off. But still, one way or the other, the 4-minute clip in no way represented Michael Jackson's vision for that song; just as the 9-minute version of Smooth Criminal doesn't reflect his vision for that one. Smooth Criminal's music video was a blurry, fast-forwarded clip show from Moonwalker (which was included on the Number Ones DVD). The version here is simply an excerpt from Moonwalker which represents neither his vision of the 40 minute segment of the movie it's taken from, nor the complete experience of the film itself (which is available on DVD and blu ray)... so the version included should have been the actual music video from Number Ones, but wasn't. There are also a few videos, like HIStory and the alternate One More Chance (from The One DVD), that were left off because they were nothing more than clip shows of previous short films with no newly recorded footage. I actually don't mind their absence, but others might not feel the same.<br /><br />I also would have liked to have had a bonus features section with the remainder of the stuff on his old DVDs that weren't really short films like the behind the scenes material from the Dangerous DVD, the Motown 25 performance of Billie Jean, the Super Bowl halftime performance of Heal the World, and the 1995 MTV VMA medley performance, which all prevent me from ditching my old DVDs. But I can understand how they wouldn't have fallen strictly into the theme of this set.<br /><br />I've noticed some mention We Are the World as a video that should have been included, but this particular video has its own DVD release, and the profits from that DVD go to charity. Including the video here would only hurt that effort.<br /><br />While I was mostly happy with the setlist though, I wasn't impressed by the audio/video of the set, which Sony advertised as being \\"fully remastered.\\" On first glance, the older videos looked shiner and different, but it wasn't until I started taking screenshots and comparing with the Number Ones DVD that I realized what they did. The image of the earlier videos was tweaked using brightness/contrast controls. This wasn't so bad on Thriller or Bad, but when I compared screenshots on Beat It, I noticed that the countertops in the diner looked shiny, clean and new because the white oversaturated the detail that used to be there. I also noticed a newspaper in the foreground at one point that had writing on it on the Number Ones DVD, but didn't in Vision for the same reason. This caused skintones to be off as well, mostly with that aforementioned shinyeffect. Screenshots of videos from the Dangerous era and on appeared to be identical, which is fine since restoration on these videos really wasn't necessary.<br /><br />I will say that I'm grateful that they at least zoomed the widescreen videos to fit a 16x9 TV, but my TV does have a zoom button, so they really only saved me the trouble of clicking a button on my remote. I know that these particular films were shot on film, then rendered for special effects and edited on video, so I don't know if a full anamorphic presentation was possible, but this (along with the brightness and contrast tweaks) should by no means be considered remastering anyway. One problem that the 16x9 zooming does create, though, is that the videos that were filmed in 4:3 (\\"fullscreen\\") format were encoded in widescreen as well with black bars on the sides to retain their natural shape. This actually isn't a problem for those with 16x9 TVs, but if you have a standard 4:3 TV, you're going to see black bars on the sides as well as on top and bottom putting the videos into a much smaller window in the center of the TV... so if you do have a \\"fullscreen\\" TV, you should probably seriously consider this before ordering as MJ's other DVD sets were encoded correctly and would probably be a better fit for you (unless, of course, you're ordering this strictly for the unreleased videos).<br /><br />This is not to say that the video quality on these short films is bad. Certainly for videos that can get as old as 25+ years and were mostly edited on video, these look pretty solid. I'm one who prefers detail over shine (especially when something wasn't intended to look shiny), but this isn't Star Wars so you're not likely to care about all the fine details a superior video presentation would have afforded.<br /><br />The videos are not presented in surround sound, but rather a stereo track that simply does the job. You're not going to be impressed or blown away, but you're not going to be overly disappointed either if you're familiar with these songs.<br /><br />For first timers and casuals, like I said, you can't go wrong here. As for die-hards, your decision to buy this set will have to rest on how much you want the unreleased videos. At least for the time being, this set is being sold for under $30, so truthfully, I am happy with the purchase, but the promise of undelivered remasters for the videos definitely left an easily avoidable sour taste in my mouth.effect.

B00092ZMDY|5.0|I've had this DVD for years, and I just played it on my new LCD tv with amplified speakers.  What has always impressed me most about this DVD is the quality of the sound.  Many concert DVDs suffer from imperfect recording of the concert itself.  The engineers who setup and recorded this concert certainly knew what they were doing.  Every note, every guitar riff, every voice, every harmony is perfect, absolutely perfect.  What a joy to listen to.<br /><br />And that guitarist (not one of the original Eagles); absolutely awesome.  Hotel California never sounded better.
B003DKJ5ZU|5.0|I have had many scenes from this movie recounted to my by my enthusiastic 8 year old, who loved it. I'm basing my review on her, since I refuse to watch an entire movie about Tinker Bell. I have seen a few scenes while the kids were watching it and it looked cute, with enough humor and magic to keep the kids glued to the screen.
0385523386|2.0|this never would have been published if it had been told from a male point of view. this story doesn't offer any new insight into what it means to commit a crime, suffer, repent and, finally, to forgive and be forgiven. kerman paints herself as a victim of exotic but manipulative friends and don't-you-have-anything-better-to-do law enforcement. 'what is someone like YOU doing in here?' is an idea she revisits many times in the book and her answer always is - it's for a crime i committed ten years ago. she gives herself a moral statute of limitations and we're supposed to feel the same way. her transgression is small enough that she deserves forgiveness, but this story reeks of her own resentment toward the system that can't catch 'real' bad guys but happened to catch her.    unfortunately dave eggers blurb compares 'orange is the new black' to ted conovers 'newjack.' i say unfortunately because 'newjack' is serious, penetrating, thoughtful, honest, and sometimes devastating. 'orange is the new black' doesn't have a fraction of the soul or relevance. it's not terrible but it certainly doesn't belong anywhere near the pantheon of relevant books about prison.
1439152780|3.0|As a huge fan of Kate Morton's previous novels, \\"The House at Riverton\\" and \\"The Forgotten Garden\\", I pre-ordered this book months ago and couldn't wait until I got my hands on her latest.  What a huge disappointment.<br /><br />Her character's never really came to life, the book is overwritten and it wasn't until I got to page 200 or there about, that the story finally took off.  And even when I thought, she's finally getting there, the story would bog down again.  By the time I finished it, I just didn't care anymore.<br /><br />It would normally take me two or three days to read a book of this size, unfortunately, this one took me almost 2 weeks to get through.  Maybe a better editor?<br /><br />Sadly, I'm not sure I could recommend this one and I'm really bummed out that I had to write a negative review on what I had hoped would be a trifecta for Kate Morton.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|This DVD series was awesome. It made me feel so different about military personel and the strugles that they face in combat. I got even a better perspective on WWII and a vet which i watched it with said it was like being there all over again. He was shocked! I would love to see more like this! This is easily the best show i have ever seen, it blows all movies out of the water!
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|borrowed this cd from a friend i wasn't for sure what to expect but right from the first song i liked it and decided to purchase this cd and there first one also and i just purchased the new one alterbridge 3 and i like all 3 each one of course has a different sound to them of course i thought like a few other people that the first cd  one day remains does sound a little bit like creed but it also has more of a hard rock sound to it so if you like creed or don't i still would recomend getting this cd you might be surprised. the first cd of alterbridge that i got was the cd blackbird and then i purchased the the first one and now there new one alterbridge 3 everyone likes different music so it's hard to say which one to start with out of the 3 they have the only thing i didn't like about the new cd was it was a little hard to get cd off from holder that it was on but i've seen that a few other times with other cd's so be careful when removing cd from holder that it's on.

B002ZG981E|5.0|This movie kept me on the edge, it is a longer movie, but I never notice that.  I thought this movie was absolutely wonderful! I can wait to get it on DVD and watch it over and over again!!!!
B0010X8NF0|5.0|I have watched this movie five times now, and listened to the music umpteen times, and everytime I find myself delighting in a new nuance. I love to get engulfed in this movie...in the quirky relationship of the brothers... in the lovely, lovely music that is timed just right...and the lush visuals. And the more I see of the movie, the more I realize that it is not only beautiful and sensitive, it is also very deep and intelligent.The brothers are seeking a spiritual goal in the land of Hinduism, and isnt it symbolic that they attain it finally as they get rid of their luggage?
0810983915|5.0|My husband bought the series before going on the plane with my 4 and 6 year old (9 hour flight across the ocean).  Well, that was a month ago.  Today, my 6 year old is reading every night before going to bed.  He is reading so fluently and having so much fun at the same time.  My husband, my in-laws are all very impressed.  Thank you.  This is exactly what we needed for him to enjoy reading.

0141439831|3.0|Ok, I'm just going to say it: I am feeling extremely smug right now that I just finished a \\"period\\" book of almost 1,000 pages entirely of my own volition.  This is no light read and for me, reading it just for the sake of reading it was the literary equivalent to running a marathon in high heels.<br />Now, as for my sentiments towards the book, to be perfectly honest, I was quite under whelmed.  I suppose one could argue that Vanity Fair serves as a predecessor to the modern day satire and romantic fluff that keep Katherine Heigl and Jennifer Aniston in a job, but I really don't understand why it is held with such high esteem in comparison to the classics of Thackery's contemporaries.  Here we have the exhausted storyline of two people from opposite sides of the tracks leading parallel lives whilst facing the trials and toils symptomatic of their social pedigrees.  There's Amelia, the aristocratic debutante with a disposition so saccharin sweet it sometimes made me want to drop kick a nun, and Rebecca, a soul-less viper that is motivated by nothing but self interest.  The setting is early 19th century England and the story is really a glorified essay of the authors reflections on human stupidity, simplicity, and superficiality.  Unlike Dickens, where every character no matter how insignificant will eventually reappear to play and integral part in the plot, the characters in Thackery's Vanity Fair took on the feel of marionettes performing in a silly but ostentatious puppet show.  Perhaps that was the point, but honestly for 900+ pages, it got to be VERY tedious.<br />Like I said, I am proud of myself for sticking to it, but I will recommend only to those who possess an endless supply of patience for romantic comedy made over in mercury based powder.
B002ZG999U|2.0|I wanted to like this movie, I really do.  For me, like for most posters on this board, this movie provides a dose of 80's nostalgia and a chance to watch our favorite actions heroes strut their stuff one more time.  Sly Stallone, despite his once iconic status, has not really been a heavy hitter for quite some time.  So the prospect of seeing him stage a possible comeback is another incentive to see this movie.    The result, however, is quite disappointing.  Despite a strong cast and not-quite-so-shabby performances, the movie never provided me with the adrenaline rush I was expecting from a movie of this type.  That is due to both the lackluster storyline and the poorly-edited action sequences.  There are some nice moments between Stallone and Jason Statham that recalls some of the best buddy movies, and the explosions are louder than ever.  But for the most part,the action sequences are less satisfying than they could have been because Stallone chose to employ the quick cuts that are so popular in the action genre noawadays, but which only made the action scenes that much more confusing to figure out.  A lot of times I would have to wait until the dust have settled after a big fight to figure out what has just happened and who is left standing at the end of it.  Also, the under-use of Jet Li in this movie is just criminal.  This movie really belongs to Stallone and Statham; and for many of Li's big scenes either Stallone and Statham would be called upon to save him at the end.  The sole purpose of Li's participation only seems to be to provide the movie with its third big name star.  But what is the point of using someone like Jet Li if you're not going to give him a chance to do what he does best?      So in conclusion, while this movie could have been a lot worse, it could also have been a lot better. Word is that a sequel is already in the works.  Here's hoping that the 2nd movie is a lot more satisfying than the first one.

0312370849|4.0|Julia Jarmond is an American journalist, living and working in Paris. She is married to a Frenchman. Around the time of the sixieth anniversary of the July 1942 round up and incarceration of thousands of French Jews in the infamous Veldrome d'Hiver,Julia is assigned to write an article about it. While researching for her article, she discovers that the apartment which her husband is having renovated for them was once the home of a little girl named Sarah. Sarah and her family were among those who were taken by the French police and eventually ended up in a camp outside Paris. When the round-up began, Sarah hid her little brother in a secret closet and told him to stay there and he'd be safe. She promised to come and get him. She took the key to the closet with her. At the camp, Sarah was separated from her parents who were sent on to be exterminated. Sarah manages to escape and is taken in by a French farmer and his wife. They go with her to Paris and find that the apartment is occupied by another family who know nothing about the secret closet. When Sarah opens the closet, her brother is dead. Sarah returns with her adopted family and later, when she is grown,moves to the United States where she marries an American. Julia becomes so interested in her story and the information that she painstakingly finds that she is determined to find Sarah and learn what happened after she went to America. Julia's marriage is in trouble and she and her husband divorce. Julia moves back to the United States with their children.  This story is both fascinating and sad. It depicts the horrors of the treatment of the Jewish people and the shame of the French involvement in their tortures. It reminds us not to forget this deplorable time in which so many lives were unnecessarily lost, and those who survived were unable to forget what happened.  Alma Winters, Author-Once Upon a Time Tales

B003U6BE8I|2.0|It's bad. Oh man, it is so bad. It's B movie start to finish. BUT, it's Percy Jackson and even though it is so poorly done it is so good to see it come to film that, well, it's okay. I just hope that some good film maker takes it in and realizes that it could be really fun. Not great because it just what it is: a cool kids tale. Which is all Riordan ever meant to do.<br />There could be so much more though. Half the story was left out, including all the references to the continuing story. Like I said, it's bad. But it's Percy and it could be so much more. I will continue to hope. (It was kind of a little bit of a guilty pleasure though. The CGI guys were having a great time.) Bad though, campy bad. It may become an epic of campyness in time.

B003VANOFY|5.0|There's a few things to talk about with this wireless headset. I've been a advocate for Wired headsets for a long time even when the first wireless ones came out. I knew the technology wasn't quite ready to handle what I wanted in a wireless headset.     I've only had the headset for a few days and already I am super impressed. Everytime I go to mess with my \\"wires\\" out of Habit I think. Man this is such a great purchase!     Range: Seriously! This is the most amazing part of the entire headset. I live in a 2200sq ft house and I can't find a single spot in the house where it skips or breaks up. Even in my garage which is on the opposite side of the house, or in the basement, it never gets worse!     Installation was easy. The quality is everything you'd expect from a gaming headset, amazing.     I'm no expert on sound quality so I can't really say if its superb. But its seems pretty clear to me.     Battery life is as advertised, I can definitely get a solid 10 hours out of these.     The only con I can think of has to do more with the software rather than the hardware itself. The software has an advanced equalizer feature, which is good, however I'd love to see some presets added to this feature.    The microphone sensitivity is nearly perfect out of the box. This is probably the only headset I am actually considering not using a push-to-talk key on. Even if I decide to still go with a PTT key, I'll set it to one of the G-Keys so I can walk around the house while talking! Awesome.    Overall this headset is exceeded my expectations in all areas. Its definitely the best I've ever owned.
B000P0J09W|3.0|What an obnoxious, irritating bunch of loud, spoiled, whiny little kids.  I know this is a dearly-beloved film for a whole generation of Reagan-era Americans, but yuck.  These characters aren't people I feel a need to spend much time with. Also, what's with all the bad acting?  And why couldn't the older brother just pump the air back in his tires, instead of stealing a baby bike from some little girl?  Oh, right: it's supposed to be funny.  How could I have missed that?

B003Z39G0O|3.0|I love Vampire Diaries. Started with the books and now can't get enough of the show. I was expecting the important songs like numbers 2 and 12 (the songs stefan and elena make love to). But none of the rest of the CD are an memorable songs.
044654759X|3.0|I've read all Sparks books and very few have disappointed me, but this did. Yes, I didn't know what would happen right up until the end, but the twist he put in there was NOT logical or even possible from the other things that happened in the beginning of the book. It was like he suddenly realized, OH,I haven't dealt with this, I'll just chop it off here and send it off to the publisher. If this had been the first one of his I had read, I wouldn't read any more of them. That's how much I disliked the ending. From the reviews I see no one else has commented on that.  Shape up Sparks, come up with some new ideas!

B002ZG98C8|4.0|Somehow it would seem appropriate that \\"Machete\\" the slightly subtle but affectionate lampooning of the exploitation thrillers of seventies gained It's roots from one of several pesudo-trailers that featured in the Tarantiono/Rodriguez collaboration \\"Grindhouse\\". Although wisely unlike SS \\"Werewolf Women of the SS\\" or \\"Thanksgiving\\" Rodriguez has chosen to make something out of this recent pet project. Casting regular and dedicated cast member, the fittingly leathery faced, time worn Danny Trejo as the titular protagonist allowing the actor to take centre stage for once, \\"Machete\\" is by contradiction a dumb, loud celebration of a bygone age of Americana while also being witty, knowing and self-referential.     It's safe to say that Robert Rodriguez is Mexico's closest answer there is to Tarantino a man who I can assume he has partially been inspired by and aided him to some extent in his rise to critical repute with a solid fan-base. Style akin to Tarantino is what permeates a film that chronicles the brutal and bloody tale of Federali officer Machete Cortez an honourable cop who paradoxically is also unflinchingly savage when forced to met out his own brand of justice, he's as the film with a lack of anything tenuous states is one who is a maverick willing to buck authority when necessity dictates. An act that leads to his seeming downfall when betrayed by his former boss who has allied himself with the merciless drug lord and socio-path Torrez played by an ever ageing Steven Seagal who has seen better days. Left broken and battered and emotionally scarred no doubt after witnessing his wife being decapitated before his very eyes, the movie skips three years after It's prologue to north of the border Texas where we find Machete scraping a living, performing yard work until an offer falls in to his lap from sleazy political aide Michael Booth (the criminally undervalued Jeff Fahey) who offers to pay him $150,000 to assassinate U.S. Senator McLaughlin (an ever reliable and funny Robert DeNiro). A man who's policies on immigration are rubbing a lot of illegal and legal immigrants up the wrong way. Of course as with the efficiently hackneyed plot might allow nothing is quite what it seems and Machte is enveloped in to a murky conspiracy with a a beautiful U.S. Immigration officer (Jessica Alba) and tough feisty immigrant and former freedom fighter Shé (Michelle Rodriguez).     Although it contains the bear semblance of a plot \\"Machete's\\" story merely serves as an excuse to push forward what is essentially a somewhat deceptively brainless send up which although done before is not any less entertaining as a result. Unapologetic in his OTT handling of the more violent aspects of the film and with fluid direction and a pace that runs smoothly and ably abetted by mainly solid performances by a fairly strong cast, Rodriguez knows what his core audience is after and he pretty much delivers in spades. If gratuitous violence, blood, guts and entrails with a light peppering of sex and nudity which were a hallmark of seventies exploitation films like \\"Foxy Brown\\" or \\"Vanishing Point\\" are the order of the day then you won't be disappointed. The Mexican auteur who's career in my opinion has been of one which is a fairly mixed bag delights and revels in the ludicrous almost cartoon world he himself has conceived, a world where an ageing, grist-led Federali is seemingly indestructible and can incapacitate or eliminate a horde of heavily trained gunmen with only a hand held machete as his weapon of choice. And in which such eye popping scenes which include one stand out moment where in desperation our hero does something hilarious involving a disembowelment will either make you simultaneously cheer and laugh in wonderment of the madness of it or just make you shake your head in bewilderment. Personally I was of the former.     Morosely however Rogriquez's notorious lapses in to self indulgence occasionally take precedent so that not only certainaction sequences but the plot takes a twist that is not only a tad laughable but also lends it to feeling contrived and too nonsensical for words to allow. Coherence is given a wide berth in exchange for thrills and to forward It's straight forward simplistic narrative. While the inclusion of Steven Seagal, an actor with as much emotional range as one of his samurai swords when It's blunt smacks of cynical self referential casting, his performance is practically one note although he does manage at times to be a bit convincing in the taunting, sadistic antagonist stakes. Particularly when the film shifts in to It's final explosive act where Rodriguez practically throws in everything but the kitchen sink to mixed results.    The rest of the cast are mainly decent, Jesscia Alba while of course effortlessly sensual and the figure of most men's desires is competent enough (although I can't help but wonder if she was cast more for her aesthetics rather than acting talent) while Michelle Rodriguez makes for a memorable presence as Shé. DeNiro and Fahey are more than sufficiently smarmy, calculating and morally repellent in their respective villainous roles while Lindsay Lohan as Fahey's tempestuous and promiscuous daughter is revelatory proving that there is more to her than the score of hollow mundane teen flicks (with the notable exception of \\"Mean Girls\\") that she has been lumbered with. And who can forget Cheech Marin's amusing turn as Machete's ass kicking brother and man of the cloth who brings a whole new meaning to divine retribution.    Flawed as it might be \\"Machete\\" is still a solid popcorn flick with no real pretensions to really speak of and with Danny Trejo fittingly po-faced and sardonic as the movies tough title character I can think of worse ways to spend an evening at my local multiplex. It might not win any awards but it no doubt will win It's share of fans.
B003X2O6KW|5.0|I wanted to wait a few days after the release of \\"M.B.D.T.F.\\" to rate it. At first, I thought I was overreacting to the album, because I was literally playing it four or five times a day. Now I know why--it's extremely good.     From the start of the album, it is clear that this is not the mainstream rap outing. The beats have become more refined and string-based--on the more laid back songs. On more upbeat tracks like the epic, King Crimson-sampling \\"Power\\" the beats are enormous. They sound grand. Kanye has created one of the best musical landscapes I've ever heard on a hip-hop album.     On 'Heartbreaks and 808s,' Kanye seemed to be following the autotune trend, diminishing his trendsetter status. But in the time between 808s and Dark Twisted Fantasy, West has transformed his style.     I can't recommend the album enough--that is if you have some patience and an open mind. There is a lot of emotion on this record and the scope of the thing is huge. It's his most ambitious project artistically. Is Kanye a genius? He produces more and more evidence with each album.
B001AQT0ZO|5.0|Many purists will not like this modern adaptation but I love the use of Shakespeare's actual dialogue but in a modern setting with guns instead of swords.  My only criticism is that the voices of both Claire Danes and Leo DiCaprio are not developed to properly deliver Shakespeare's lines.
B0042RUMEQ|1.0|I was extremely excited about the release of Pink Friday. I was expecting nothing but amazing. But I am sad to admit, It has to be the worst CD I have purchased in quite a long time. Once I listened to ALL 16 tracks, I had to pop it out of my CD player and put it away. I dont think I will pull it back out either:(I think Niki makes an amazing feature, but is NOT strong enough to hold up an entire song. The only songs I thought were \\"OK\\" were those with other features such as Eminem and Kanye. I think she was over hyped and now did not live up to it. I wish her all the best on the second album. I dont think I will ever purchase another entire album of hers again, but maybe download a single here and there.
B003NX6ZDC|5.0|first of all, i want to confess that as a devoted killers fan, initially i had some doubt about Brandon's solow album. but after couple litens the songs do grow on me. I truly enjoy the vegas flavor and do feel Brandon made a lot of efforts to show the beauty of his hometown. but i also feel he might be trying not showing too much killers elements, so i can say the album is different from the killers but it's a very honest Brandon creation..:)
B000001A3H|5.0|I just purchased Blues for the Red Sun after a friend introduced me to Kyuss. Over a decade after the album was actually recorded, I took it to be a fresh production. How did I miss them? I have been a fan of the producer, Chris Goss since the first Masters of Reality Album, so how did I not hear of Kyuss when they were active? (I blame the radio and mass media for their delivering the mediocre and wishy washy redundant trash after Cobaine died)Well, who cares? What is really important is that now in late 2010, I am listening to well orchestrated, performed and conducted metal which seems as fresh to me as when I first heard Sabbath or Zepplin in the 70's.
0684857219|5.0|This product goes deep into bodybuilding like no magazine has ever done. This helps you with the science of the body and how it works and gives you detailed descriptions of each exercise. I've been working out for a couple of years and known about this book but finally bought a copy because the information that you gain from it is amazing!!!    Pros:  - Detailed descriptions of the exercises  - Great visuals  - Info on nutrition  - Posing and flexing information    I actually could go on and on but if you have any interest in bodybuilding/fitness/or just trying to trim some fat, this book is for you!!!

B002N5N5LG|5.0|This show is just too damn funny. I love it cause it's completely random and weird! I just feel great watching it, and I would recommend you watch it if you haven't yet. Can't wait for season 2 to come out on dvd! The show just keeps getting better and better.

B003VANOFY|5.0|I've been very happy with this product.  The sound quality is very good and they block out a good amount of ambient room noise.   They are comfortable to wear for long periods (as comfortable as any product like this can be). The controls are intuitive.  They quality seems good and I think they will be reasonably durable. I('ve only used them for a few weeks)  Battery life is reasonable and should last you through a typical gaming session.  If you are looking for PC gaming headphones I can recommend these.

B000ICL3KG|1.0|There is absolutely no science to this movie, most of it proved to be false and computer generated.  It's always about the money, follow the money.    \\"The great global warming swindle\\" is a great counter point to Al's junk.
B003YWUTJI|4.0|...Featuring isn't get up and dance music necessarily, but it's a fun compilation. The title comes from the fact that each of the eighteen songs on the album has another artist with Norah Jones.    Who knew you'd ever find Willie Nelson and the Foo Fighters and Outkast on the same album? It definitely makes for a different feel. As I was listening to it, I sometimes wondered who chose the various songs, as they are frequently quite ... different. \\"Soon The New Day\\" with Talib Kewli is much more of a rap style compared with the country-fied \\"Creepin' In\\" with Dolly Parton. At the same time, I actually liked the majority of the duets on the album.    The only song I really didn't like was \\"Baby It's Cold Outside\\" - which of course is a song I know well. It was much faster than how I'm used to hearing it, and to me it seemed like the message and play of the back and forth conversation of the song was lost.    \\"More Than This\\" featuring Charlie Hunter and \\"Blue Bayou\\" featuring M. Ward - ironincally the last two tracks on the album - fight for my favorite songs of the grouping. They are both so smooth and easy; I just get lost in them.    The rest of the album from \\"Virginia Moon\\" with the Foo Fighters to \\"Dear John\\" was enjoyable, though not all the songs were my favorites. I can see myself skipping a few if I were in the car and had the fast forward button easily available. Norah Jones sounds great on every song, but some of them just aren't my thing. That said, it's a pretty cool album!
0679735909|3.0|I made a brave attempt at getting through this book.  The story is pretty interesting at a high level and the writing is very impressive.  Byatt is obviously brilliant to be able to write in a Victorian style, both in poetry and correspondence.  I was feeling pretty good about myself being able to plough through the material and understand it somewhat.  But after about page 150 came the aha moment - \\"why am I putting myself through this?\\"    The story moves at a snails pace and is continually interrupted by the Victorian poems, letters, etc. that are rough to get through.  That, and the modern protagonists are cold as ice and their relationship glacial in velocity.  With 400 pages to go and another immediate 100 pages of letters to tackle, I gave it up.  Too much effort for the little tidbits of reward.  More power to the folks who can read and enjoy this stuff, but to me, it just ain't worth it.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|This was a great and entertaining series that was loosely based on Spartacus and the events that lead to the Third Servile War. The gore and sex is so over the top that it almost gets old at times but it doesn't so it's still good. Obviously not for anyone under 18 but if you enjoy a historical piece with a lot of action this is for you.
B003ZSH606|5.0|Jamiroquai has been one of my favorite bands ever since I heard and saw Virtual Insanity.  Traveling Without Moving was an incredible album and still ranks as the band's best for me.  But, I would put \\"Rock Dust Light Star\\" right after that. Seriously.  All their albums have had amazing tracks throughout, but none have had such a high percentage of solid tracks and showcased so many sides of the Jamiroquai sound.  Very rarely am I so blown away by something I've been looking forward to this much.  5/5 stars for Jamiroquai and Jay, creating one of the strongest albums of their career.
B001VNB54A|5.0|Without reading other reviews, I have to say this is the best mini-series HBO has done to date because it feels the most real.  It is invariably compared with Band Of Brothers and some probably feel it is disjointed because the main three storylines don't cross over much and the character building (unlike BoB) isn't as engaging.  But, the war in the pacific wasn't anything like the war in Europe. I think the producers really drive that point home in this series.  Of all the old vets I know, the guys from european theatre never had trouble telling their war stories.  The vets I know from the pacific theatre rarely said a thing.  This series helps you understand why.  Bravo HBO.
0316743003|5.0|Ben R. Rich tells the exciting tale of how Lockheed Skunk Works developed technologies generations ahead of their competition.  The technology they developed is covered in enough detail to satisfy those of us that are into that type of thing but the real story is the business, the personalities and interpersonal relationships of the main players such as the legendary engineer/leader Kelly Johnson.  The book covers how the technologies were discovered and developed and the difficulties that were encountered during their development.  It also includes stories about how the planes were sold to the various customers.  The portions that detail the business rules developed for the Skunk Works were particularly interesting and sometimes humorous.  This book covers a lot of genres and can be enjoyed by a wide range of readers.
B001H9MYPW|5.0|In Treatment Season Two is a riveting series examining the lives of a psychologist and his patients as they are revealed during treatment sessions. As well as presenting intense drama, there are many areas of ambiguity over which the viewer can ponder. The acting is supurb. Gabriel Bryne in the role of the psychologist, spends much of his time listening. Yet, even without words, he can express multiple emotions with a slight change in posture or facial expression.     This is a multiple disc set. Initially, one of the discs was defective. It would not load onto our DVD player. Amazon makes it very easy  to exchange a defective product for a new one. Even for people like me without computer saavy, I was able to navigate the website, and quickly complete the transaction. The new set arrived within 2 days.
B002R0F3Q2|3.0|I did not have a problem receiving my item. It was here in a reasonable amount of time. However the CD is not that great. I thought that it would be better than it was. In the majority of the songs it sounds like she is sick. I am in love with her other albums. This one just did not do it for me. It was not that the lyrics were not powerful enough, it was just that her voice was not giving me what I needed.
B0041OOJNU|5.0|I love this album and can't get enough of it.  I like all the song's on this cd but I love both versions of \\"Loca\\", \\"Rabiosa\\" and \\"Wakka Wakka (K-Mix)\\" also \\"Sale El Sol\\", \\"Antes De Las Seis\\", \\"Gordita\\", \\"Islands\\", \\"Devoción\\", and \\"Addicted To You\\".  Sorry if I put to many songs that I fell in love with but this album is trully amazing.  If you loved \\"She Wolf\\" like me, then you should love \\"The Sun Comes Out\\".  Well Done Shakira, Well Done!!!!!

B002ZG98Z0|5.0|Sex and the City 2 is a great and fun sequel! I don't really see why fans were disappointed with this film? It's not as good as the first movie but it's still worthwhile and stays true to the t.v. series. Sarah Jessica Parker is such an amazing actress, I love everything about her! Yeah some of the situations like Carrie running into Aidan from halfway around the world did seem really far-fetched but overall, I very much enjoyed this film. I highly recommend it! Enjoy.

B0049P1VHS|5.0|To attempt to sum up this show in a short review would be inadequate. You MUST watch this to understand why it has been so beloved in such a short amount of time. From the heart-tearing debut episode to the wide open, \\"They can go so many ways with this!\\", season finale, there is so much to love. Amazing effects by the latex master Greg Nicotero, we are talking truly SICK undead characters that will stay with you, to memorable kill sequences that will have you rewinding just to see that flesh-ripping scene one more time.<br /><br />Watch this series and support these artists because they are the ones allowing true adult content on television in an entertaining and FREE format. So glad that AMC is backing this for a second Season!<br /><br />WE WANT MORE!!!
B000066C6Z|5.0|The most under rated, and probably under viewed of all the Zucker, Abrams, Zucker flicks. Compared to the \\"Airplanes\\" and \\"Naked Guns,\\" this 1 may rate higher on the sight gag scale for laughs-too many to mention w/o giving away the whole flicks surprises. And some of the more original scenes of all these great comedy writers work. Kilmer's perfect for his role. Scenes to watch for?: - Underwater \\"old west type\\" fight scene - parachute jump w/ dramatic, romantic dialogue - the resistance's hilarious going over their plan w/ model for detail (think Doc from \\"Back To The Future's\\", \\"Sorry it's not built to scale\\" comments.) - the cow disguise scene. That's just off the top of my head. A cast of relatively unknowns for the most part carries a movie that anyone who loved \\"Airplane\\" should see. But like \\"Airplane,\\" with your full attention. It's 1 of those movies where you turn your head for a second, and you miss some hilarity. 1 of my all time fave comedies.
B004E9CFZG|5.0|*SPOILER ALERT*<br /><br />Unlike the other reviews here, I am going to review this episode, Wildfire, from Season 1 of The Walking Dead.<br /><br />I really liked the episode. Great acting early while drama is going on over the death of a sister. Really good example of what emotional response such a circumstance could bring out. More development in the affair triangle. Great moment of tension when Duane is considering taking Rick's life. And an amazing cliff-hanger. So excited about this series. I see some serious longevity.
0740785508|5.0|Gurney always inspires with his work, but in this book he proves to be an excellent teacher, even for pro's. I have worked as a professional illustrator for over 15 years and this is one of these rare books that still motivates me to dig deeper. Great book!
0307454541|5.0|I am always a sucker for a great mystery book, and I must admit this is the first time in years I could not put a book down. Very well written, and I enjoyed the multiple stories that the writer went to great lengths to keep you in the loop.
0439813786|5.0|A good friend of mine told me not to long ago, \\"Ultimately I judge a series on how quickly I go through it.\\" this was on the topic of anime.    If I take this insight into account when it comes to books, then the invention of Hugo cabret is very very good.    With no intention of reading this book before bed, I opened it... Read it cover to cover... And fell asleep much later than intended.    If you are looking for a book that grabs and holds your attention until you realized that you just read the whole thing in one sitting, then buy this and enjoy.

0486478998|5.0|This book is a blessing, better than the secret, as it is solid eye opening information, and is designed where<br />you can refer back to a particular chapter when reinforcement is needed.  While some instructions are offered on ways<br />to tap into your power within, it is not heavy in that area.  However do not hesitate to purchase it, you will get<br />more than your monies worth.  This book has provided insight into areas that I would not of thought of and you will not find in books like the secret.  While many folks<br />are aware of the power of the law of attraction, not much is written on tapping into it.  We have had a life time of<br />preconditioning and negative programming, and Dr. Murphy provides the insight to make your life anew.  He talks about<br />getting into a state of relaxation before sleep, and when we wake, actually that is when our brains alpha waves are at peak.  The best time to make affirmations and to visualize creatively.  Ok enough of by yapping, buy the book, and then buy the Genie within, it is a very simple easy to understand book, that will teach you to implement what Murphy has written.  ANother great addition is, Think and create your way to health wealth and Happiness,  it is a composite of the Best of Murphy, by subject area per chapter.  Great for refering back to.

B0036EH3UC|5.0|I admit I also liked the 70s version, so perhaps I'm not the best judge of quality SciFi.  This four-year journey reinvented the idea with just the right mix of humor, mystery, action, drama, and detail.  Sure, the second and third seasons bog down in soap-opera storylines once in a while, but overall, this bunch of hard-drinking, hard-fighting, hard-living, desperate, heroic, and tragically flawed humans (and cylons) are so engaging that you enjoy the ride.      The premise is well laid-out, the characters are well developed over time.  The music is stunningly appropriate, the effects are never overdone, the acting is a little over-the-top sometimes, but never descends into drivel.    Sometimes this show is so raw, it hurts to watch.  The agony, desperation, despair, and betrayal are sometimes so well portrayed that it just wrenches the viewer's viscera.  But ultimately the conclusion pays off.  And does so in a way that's far more satisfying than virtually all of the other space opera that gets produced.    Excellent all around.  Even the agonizing parts!
1439177783|5.0|I read Portia's book in 3 days. I do not read books very much but this was easy to read. I could not put her book down. It is so well written and informative.  To think of what she had struggled with for so long in her life, anyone can relate.  Anyone that diets or struggles with food, should read her story.
B00275EHJG|5.0|This movie was fantastic. Absolutely the best out of all the Toy Story movies. And yes I was balling my eyes out at the end. But it's getting ridiculous how angry parents are getting over this movie over how \\"scary\\" it was. Well do you remember in the first Toy Story when Sid basically mutilated and tortured his toys? HE WAS GONNA BLOW UP BUZZ. It was creepy/scary to see all those mutant toys. Mind you that I first saw Toy Story when I was about 5. But I toughened up. I wasn't gonna go crying over it. I'm almost positive that I wouldn't be crying about Toy Story 3 too if I was young. Keep in mind that majority of Disney/children movies have frightening bits, seriously think about it. Aladdin, it was the cave of wonders. Beauty and the Beast, when Gaston was gonna kill the Beast AND the any of the wolf scenes. Snow White, running through that creepy forest. The Lion King, when Mufasa was trampled to death. See where I'm getting at? Not everything is rainbows and butterflies. I do admit that Toy Story 3 definitely has more adult aspects to it than the others but Andy grew up and so did the toys. If you want to censor your children then go ahead and let them watch Sesame Street for the rest of their childhood. Whoops maybe not.. they might get scared by all the monsters.
0132350882|2.0|In the introduction the author mentions several times this book is really hard work and just getting through portions of it should take many days. He says it's not a \\"feel good book\\" you can read on an airplane. He also points out it's a prequel to his 2002 book Agile Software Development.<br /><br />This book *is* hard work. It's much like a textbook with lots of homework problems. And some of the problems you're expected to solve seem to be needlessly complex or even obtuse in terms of getting across the desired concept--like a college professor trying to challenge even the best students.<br /><br />This isn't supposed to be a book on how to figure out poor or tricky code, it's a book on how to write clean code. If you like the challenge of figuring out other's code, you'll likely enjoy this book. If not, you might be better off with something like Code Complete 2 that takes a more practical and readable approach.<br /><br />My second disappointment is some of what's in this book seems dated. The author himself says the book is a prequel to his 2002 book, and some of his perspective is clearly from that era. As we all know, software development is constantly evolving. Many things that were considered \\"best practices\\" a decade ago have been abandoned or improved today. But Uncle Bob (Martin), who's been writing software since the 70's, seems to have a romantic attachment to some outdated concepts. Again, Code Complete seems to have done a better job staying current.<br /><br />I'm also not especially fond of the writing style and perspective. The author seems to put writing software on par with being a world renowned master architect or artist. His implication is we should all strive to have every line and brushstroke be perfect and create works of art to be deeply admired by anyone who sees them. I think the realities of the world today make such an approach impractical.<br /><br />Few of us have the luxury of treating our code as something we can take many years refactoring and perfecting before releasing it. This book does little to help someone balance the cleanliness of their code with outside requirements they have little control over. Martin simply suggests developers need to stand up to management and make their own demands. That's often not realistic. Most people writing code are more like the guys who frame houses, install the plumbing, etc.--not the master architect who drew up the plans. We're required to be as productive as possible.<br /><br />Martin acknowledges his ways are not the only way but he often implies they're the only *correct* way. To me this seems arrogant. He reminds me of a department head in college--someone who's above everyone else. Personally, I do better with books where the author come across as more of a peer than a self-proclaimed guru.<br /><br />So, in the interest of full disclosure, I haven't made it through this entire book and probably won't. I've read The Practice Of Programming, The Pragmatic Programmer, Code Complete 2, and I just can't find much practical in Clean Code that adds to what's in the other books. If you have read any of these, this book might be a waste of money unless you really enjoy the challenge of wading through code examples, you teach programming, or you're especially fond of the author and his idealistic perspectives.refactoring and perfecting before releasing it.

B003VIW8DK|5.0|I'm usually pretty cynical when people start saying stuff like \\"His best work since Avalon\\" or whatever, but dang if it isn't. This is a really great album. Heartache by Numbers and Alphaville are catchy and have everything you want from a great Ferry track. There's not a bad song in the bunch, and while it reminds you of Mamouna, Boys and Girls, Taxi, and yes, Avalon, it's different enough that you'd be missing out if you didn't buy/download a copy. Man oh man I hope he tours the U.S. with this material.
B002PMV9FG|2.0|I was excited to get the Harry Potter movie at such a great price, and it was supposed to be new, and was packaged as such.  The problem was that the dvd was defective, and skipped.
B000WS4P5G|5.0|Once upon a time I had a cassette of Danzig I which I destroyed after a few listenens when I decided that the band was Satanic.  (I was a good little church boy back then.)  Ten years later I picked it up on CD, and after all that time I still remembered all of the songs when I heard them.  Five years later, and this album keeps getting better and better.  This is rebellious heavy metal that draws equally on the Doors and punk rock with a bit of doom sludge and thrash lyrical influence thrown in for good measure.  Stands the test of time.  Highly recommended for any rock/metal fan.  If you are new to Danzig's music, you should start here.<br /><br />My one complaint:  This album was cheaply produced and sounds a bit quiet and thin.  It could benefit from being digitally remastered, but that would be just as likely to destroy it.
B003YWUTJI|3.0|I received a preview sample of this CD through One2One and I was looking forward to hearing Nora stretch her style.  I think the songs were less \\"Featuring Nora\\" and more Nora featuring various artists.  She does stretch her style a little into the Country flavor, but not as much as I was hoping.  The songs are good and basic in the beginning of the CD and at the end, but the rap in the middle would have made me stop listening if they were placed in the beginning of the CD list.  Her duet with Willie Nelson (\\"Baby It's Cold Outside\\") was basic and not very original except for the fact that the thought of these two singers coming together in person and doing a music video for this song alternately throws me into hysterical laughter and screaming to have my mental eye poked out.  I'm waiting for her to do a duet with someone edgy and with a range like Pink!  \\"Here We Go Again\\" with Ray Charles is a classic and has been previously released.  It's a keeper, but perhaps just as an .mp3.  I'm not sure that it can carry the whole CD by itself.
030726999X|5.0|If you liked \\"The Girl WIth The Dragon Tattoo\\" you will love this one.  \\"The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest\\" picks up right where \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" left off.  Hornet's Nest is different from Dragon Tattoo and Fire in that it is not much of a mystery novel.  The whodunnit question is mostly solved in the second book.  Here in the third book it is largely a matter of resolving what happens to these characters we have grown to love and hate.  You would think it would not be very interesting; but, like the first two books in the series, I had great difficulty putting it down and was up late nights until I finally finished it.
030726999X|5.0|I just want to add to these comments because the impression the story made on me was first rate!<br />I am on a mailing list to notify me of notable best sellers. The synopsis of The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest was intriguing so I found a copy and read.<br />I was so excited about this story and when looking for more by this author...found the first 2 of the trilolgy.<br />THEN...I found where I could get the movies of all the books and they were spectacular as well.<br />But I wanted to cry when I saw that he had died so young and without finishing what had promised to be such an arousing good series.<br /><br />I am a well educated female in her 60's. I say this because I can relate to much of the political information in the book. I loved the way the<br />author explains how different Sweden is from other democratic nations when dealing with basic human rights. The subject of women's rights and the government's role in protecting its citizens from harm was explained sufficiently even comparing how the USA laws allows investigations of the rulers better than Swedish law allows.<br />This story was as well written as any top rated American author could write and more so.<br />The subject matter really took the reader to a different place in the world and treated us to a fantastic view of cloak & dagger crimes within the vague and mysterious government of a world nation that promises basic human rights...but do they? And what will that government do when threatened with exposure?
B003YFIUW8|5.0|What a wonderful surprise!  I started the book with no special expectations, but..  I was truly carried away by this book.  From the very beginning I was hooked.  It is a fast and comsuming read.  Don't miss it.
0385341008|5.0|This book reminds me of one of the reasons I enjoy reading - pure pleasure.  Some of the other critics of this book mention that it has characters that seem too good to be true - and on some level I agree with that.  With that being said - I still love the characters.  It's one of those books that while reading it I want to be more like the characters.  I find myself wishing I was more like Juliet.  Maybe this book doesn't dig in too deep into the sadness of WWII but it makes me appreciate differences in other people and the value of a good book.  After all, many times when I reach for a good book I'm looking to go some place new and exciting and sometimes I don't want that to be a sad place.  I think most people will enjoy this book!
B0044XV684|5.0|This book just arrived today and I am delighted. The recipes and the dialogue throughout are great fun. Highly recommend.

B002ZG98PA|5.0|I enjoyed growing up with the musical scores of Alan Menken and the late Howard Ashman in Disney movies like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin.  The songs were fun and memorable, I still remember the lyrics, and I occasionally watch these movies on DVD with my family.  Menken wrote and produced the music and songs in \\"Tangled,\\" and I eagerly yet cautiosly anticipated watching the movie.  I really did not know what to expect from this movie (nor did I have high expectations), yet I found Disney's version of \\"Tangled\\" to be quite enjoyable, and I would rank it one of my new favorites from the newer Disney movie repertoire that includes The Princess and the Frog, Cars, and the Toy Story trilogy.  My wife, daughter, and I were pleasantly surprised with the storyline, and thoroughly enjoyed the move in 3D.  It is based on the classic story \\"Rapunzel\\" by the Brothers Grimm, but with a twist.<br /><br />In this version Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) was kept isolated in a hidden tower by her mother Gothel (Donna Murphy) under the guise of protecting her naivet&eacute; from the wickedness of the world.  Her real motive is basic yet excessive egotism.  Although Rapunzel follows her mother's wishes to stay safe and secure up in her tower, she is not the clich&eacute; \\"damsel in distress\\" and is able to hold her own.  Having lived most of her life locked away, she is also highly curious about the outside world.  Along comes the handsome, charming and witty Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi) and gives her the opportunity of a lifetime.  Fed up with her sheltered life, and with the battle cry of \\"carpe diem,\\" she convinces Rider to assist her with realizing her dream.<br /><br />What did I like about it?  To preface, I am a bit sick of the whole \\"prince looking to save his princess\\" or \\"princess looking for her prince charming.\\"  Yes, this movie involves a princess, but not in the typical/traditional way one would expect.  It does not involve a prince saving the princess or a frog turning into a prince.  The story hinges on our heroine and her curiosity of a mystical and magical event from a land nearby.  She does not want to find her prince charming or be saved by one, nor does she want to kiss a frog (though she has a chameleon sidekick, which I thought was a cute alternative).  She does not need assistance with getting down from the tower.  And the hero is not out to save the princess, has a somewhat charming egocentric quality who is out only for himself, and only accidentally stumbled into her presence.<br /><br />Absotely loved the animation!  I saw both normal and 3D versions (in that order), was thoroughly impressed with the animation in 2D, and was completely blown away in 3D!  This is not your standard Mickey Mouse animation in Fantasia.  All stops were pulled for this movie.  I didn't find the colors nor the story to be dark.  The ending was a bit violent (IMHO), though relative to the movies today I suppose it is not far from the norm.  My daughter closed her eyes through a few of the scenes, but she still loved the movie.<br /><br />The movie has lots of singing and dancing, and stunning animation effects (especially in 3D).  It has a nice story for the kids and a pleasant plot for the older kids.  In summary, we utterly and totally loved \\"Tangled.\\"  Highly recommend for the young and young-at-heart.<br /><br />Note:  This review is for the movie.  The discs have not yet been released, therefore I cannot comment or review the packaging, extras, etc.  I will update on these at a later date.ince.

0735619670|4.0|I've been a software developer for over 30 years and I found this book to be very good.  Most of the ideas in it have been around for decades but it's good to see them written done in a book.    The ideas and techniques presented are generally quite good, with the exception of some of the non-structured programming practices (multiple returns from a procedure/method).  Since structured coding standards have been the standard--and for good reason--for many years, I was a little surprised to see some old techniques that were largely dropped from practice in the 70's after we found how damaging they became--especially in large sysems.  Having said that, overall, this is a very good book.    The current crop of developer's I've worked with over the past 10 years or so should do themselves a favor and study this book as it seems that the practices in the book are no longer taught at universities.  I've recently seen C# methods over 1000 lines long which is simply ignorant and has no place in code, not to mention in object oriented code.  Reading this text and applying the recommendations will generally result in better code.
B003WTE886|5.0|WOW!  As a moderate Taylor Swift fan, I picked up this CD for use in the car during frequent upcoming holiday travel.  WOW!  This is the best CD I've heard in a long time.  As far as Swift's music goes, this CD shows her as a more diverse, developed artist than we've experienced on previous albums, and is FUN!  The music still features her classic cross-over country style while introducing a variety of new sounds, interesting plays with lyrics and rhythms, and more mature content than her 16 yr old self published.  On this album, Swift proves that she's someone that everyone needs to keep there eye on!
B0042RUMIW|5.0|I was so jazzed to see that our BELOVED \\"Sting\\" has done it again!  He's brought back, not only his Police hits, but combined pop, rock and classical in this amazing masterpiece with the Royal Philharmonic!  Nowadays, with everything purchasable \\"a la carte' on iTunes, it was a pleasure to buy and hear a CD/DVD with ALL of the songs we've loved for the past 20-some years, re-mastered in 2010.  Thank you Sting! Thank you Royal Philharmonic!  What a great Christmas gift.
0307454886|3.0|I have come to enjoy Roth rather late.  I read him in high school and college, but it never quite clicked with me. As sex obsessed as Updike, but perhaps not as illuminating of conditions I could relate to. But his smaller scale recent work is very appealing to me.  Everyman, Nemesis, Indignation, Exit Ghost.  Good strong stuff and so beautifully written. I just read this short novel and although I know it is not as simple as that, it does make one wonder if the intense focus on sex leaves other human needs behind just a tad too much? There were good moments, and Roth is so skilled with language and thought processes that I was never inclined to put the book away, but still it was only sporadically engaging.  Try the books that follow instead.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|I really thought this would be a lot better, but it kind of drags and gets old real fast. Ok for bathroom reading over the course of a month or two, but it really doesn't grab your attention enough to invest any serious hours of reading. Not bad, but definitely not great.
1400052173|4.0|I would describe myself as a \\"serious\\" reader (mostly that means no romances).  This was an astonishing tale about something that happened in the world of tissue culture and scientific research that most of us would never know about.  The author puts some of the broader issues surrounding the use of human cells into a frame of reference by incorporating the \\"backstory\\" of the family associated with the famous HeLa cell line.  When I started this book I had no specific interest in the subject matter - I read it on a recommendation.  It didn't matter because the story draws you in and holds you until the end.  I had a hard time putting this down.  Obviously this book will appeal to those with broad curiosity, who like me, like learning new things in any subject.  I would consider this an exceptional effort and not a waste of anyone's time.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|The 7th movie in this series is the best so far and the best adaptation from the book to the movies by a landslide.     I found that the book moved extremely slow and had the characters parked in certain locations for months. I thought that this diminished the dangers they faced, the enlongated time in the book took away the tension. Also I thought with so much time gone by, couldn't they have come up with a better plan. Couldn't the Order of the Pheonix be doing the job that these three kids are doing? What are they doing during this time? The other good wizards seem to sit and wait to be picked off. It made no sense.    The movie condensed the book timeframe and translated what took months in the book to seem like days in the film. I think this definately turned up the tension. In the film I felt these kids were constantly in danger and thus didn't have the time to formulate a clear plan. It made the risky decisions they made more plausable to me. It also made the absence of communication or action by the \\"good\\" wizards of the order of the Pheonix more understandable. I understand that the people who read the books want every detail in the films, but a lot of what was cut would make a very rocky translation to film (it just wouldn't work).     After the first two movies of this series I really felt the screenwriter really got in a groove of how to translate this series. With the sheer number of characters, creatures, objects, and locations in this series they really did a great job of streamlining it and giving all these elements meaningful screentime. The Harry Potter film series is really amazing in how they were able to fill the roles with quality actors and retain those actors for a decade (the only exception was the original actor who played Dumbledore died after the second film). How lucky were they that they cast three children that grew into very capable actors and didn't have the \\"Disney children melt downs\\" that so many instantly famous children seem todo. Warner Brothers really did the Harry Potter film series right, a rarity in Hollywood really. Look what Lucas did to the Star War movies, yikes! Imagine if Steven Spielberg had got his way and combined the first two Harry Potter books into one movie (Thank goodness Spielberg never touched these movies!). All of the filmmakers they hired to direct parts 3 through 8 were perfect matches for the entry they made. Keeping the same screenwriter had a lot to do with the quality of this series (and the fact they kept Rowling involved through the whole adaptation too!) So bravo to Warner Brothers for getting something right!    The fact of the matter is this film sets up the last film, and if part one is any indication I think they are going to knock part 2 out of the park. For all those claiming this movie did not have enough action, just wait. Knowing what's ahead, I think almost the entire second film will be high stakes action and based on what I've seen I bet the last film will be better than the second half of the last book too!
B002ZG983M|5.0|Matthew Vaughn's KICK-ASS is adapted from a comic book from the same name. Seems like there are tons of movies being made from comics these days, and, except for Spiderman, Superman, etc., I imagine the vast majority of film-goers aren't familiar with the comics these movies are based on.<br /><br />For a movie like this to be successful, it has to appeal to the non-comic book fan. To me, Kick-Ass is an awesome movie, a great superhero origin tale. High school nerd Dave Lizewski  has always dreamed of being a superhero. So, one day he buys a costume, puts it on, and then goes out to fight crime.<br /><br />There are a lot of things to like about the movie. I enjoyed the pulsating soundtrack set to scenes of gory, stylized violence. I loved the cast. Nicholas Cage is at his best. Clarke Duke is the funny sidekick. Mark Strong is the great villain. Lyndsy Fonseca is the beautiful girlfriend. Aaron Johnson even shines as Dave/Kick-Ass. Chloë Grace Moretz, the young teenager, playing Hit-Girl was the surprise of the film, as well as the center of controversy. Seems some people didn't care to see a young girl get beat up, use foul language, and kill dozens. Come on, lighten up. This is a fun movie, not to be taken seriously.<br /><br />Movies like Kick-Ass are so much better than some of the stuff coming out of Hollywood these days. Because of the extreme violence and bad language, this movie isn't for everyone. But, its funny, clever and a lot of fun. I can't wait for the sequel.
0307454541|1.0|This book (Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) was chosen by my book reading club two months ago - I was only 3/4 through on the day we were scheduled to meet to discuss it. Usually, I sail right through a book, make my notes and have a lot to say about what I've read. Not this time. I went to the meeting with one question on my mind. What was the hype all about? The writing (albeit translated into English from Swedish) was simplistic, dull and though I promised myself I would finish the book, I would not have blamed myself for not following through. To begin, there were so many characters introduced in the first 75 pages I had a hard time keeping them all straight. Other than one memorable chapter that had to do with rough sex, the book did not hold my interest at all. I work with another book lover and told him I'd let him have a go at it. A few days after I put it in his hands, he said this: \\"I almost put it down, Gail.\\" But because he had also heard nothing but good, he forged ahead. Generally, I ask for my books to be returned if I lend them out. But not this one. My co-worker can toss it out with the trash for all I care. I only hope the members of my book reading club don't suggest the next book by the same author. I just might say \\"I think I'll sit this one out.\\" Gail Lowe, Author of Former Things
0316019984|5.0|I bought this book for my 6 year old nephew and he loved it.  I think it is remarkable how much artistry goes into this book.  He's a big fan of Superman and Batman and the lightening up of the batman light  is totally cool!  Definitely worth it!
0307595579|5.0|super fast shipping, the package was all that I expected and more. If you are a Stieg Larsson fan, you must get this bundle. I already own the 3 books but this neat and beautifully bound set is amazing! Plus, it comes with a bonus book with email/notes between Stieg and his editor. Some pretty interesting stuff.
B003GXC8VM|2.0|Geffen A&R woman Teresa Ensenat worked hard to ensure that Axl and Co. got the nasty cover art they desired, a painting entitled \\"Appetite for Destruction.\\" You get a copy of the violation and vengeance fantasy art, but the thick vinyl pressing is just horrible. It has no volume, no pop, just a general flatness. That's the real violation here. Take one of the greatest hard rock records of all time and make it a eunuch . . just wrong.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I watched this mini-series on Netflix while it was on there, and the story line was so well done (athentic depiction of life durring the era), the effects, the characters that I couldn't wait to get off work so I could rush home and watch another episode! Loved it so much when I saw it on here I had to have it for my perminent collection, now I can rewatch it whenever I want!! Awesome seller, will definitly buy from again, super fast delivery, veryyyy happy!!!
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I had the same problem i know alot of people face, do you buy the X31s or the X41s, after i used the X31s i liked it thats what made me want headphones and everybody i asked said just buy the X31s it would save me money and its the same, but i just couldn't settle i said let me give them a try because if i'm going to buy something i want the best so i just brought the X41s anyway, and boy am i glad i did, first there is a difference from the X31s and the X41s the X41s are better and come to my surpise it is worth the money, its just a all around perfect product, it does cost alot buy after you buy and use them you would mine having brought them, these headphones are a must have go ahead and send the little extra, treat yourself it's worth it.    Don't really know if this would help you with buying these headphones, but if you play call of duty this headphones are crazy good for this game and game like it, if you go to game setting and change the audio to how you like it will make your kill death ratio go up alot, like me i put sound effet all the way up and everything else super low and nobody sneaks up on me i already got the dogs over 30 times, i always get good kill streaks every game, my gamertag on xbox live is ThatNice, if you play call of duty hit me.
B004498KPU|5.0|I received Visions and I am quite pleased with the 3 disc set.  I purchased it through Amazon and was a little upset because I wanted it right away (Monday).  I came close to going to a local store to purchase it but it finally arrived this past Friday.  The first night I played all DVD's in their entirety.  I repeated Disc 2 twice.  The black box on the screen seems to be a big issue for many people, however, it does not bother me.  I am too engrossed in the VIDEO to worry about a black box that is not dominating the picture.  I like having the option of watching his videos repeatedly to study his creative movements/ideas, passion, and sense of direction in the form of art.<br /><br />Watching \\"One More Chance\\" gets me teary eyed.  To know that this is the last video he worked on and never completed is heart breaking.  From what I see of his face in the video he looked so happy!  We all know what happened the next day after the shoot so I will not discuss it here because this is a review.  And a FIVE star review courtesy of me!<br /><br />Though I have seen the majority of the videos numerous times, it feels good to have them in a collection right at my fingertips.  :D  I look forward to future releases of anything Michael.
0307987698|5.0|This book is a cute sequel to the first, \\"There's a Monster at the End of This Book.\\" Elmo adds quite a bit of sassiness to it.
0446195529|4.0|A very busy plot.  David Baldacci's Hell's Corner was an extremely busy novel.  This was my \\"final chance\\" read for Mr. Baldacci as his last several novels have been very weak and almost cartoonish with the Camel Club.  I thoroughly enjoyed Mr. Baldacci's earlier novels with Last Man Standing being his best.  Since then it has been a long, slow, painful slide into mediocrity.  Hell's Corner gave me a glimmer of hope for the future.    This novel was a tangle of twists and turns that will leave the reader at times wondering where the story is going and just who are the bad guys or gals?  There is very little actual action as this is a mystery to be untangled--slowly untangled.  Basically, a large bomb explodes in Lafayette Park (aka Hell's Corner) in front of the White House and the mystery is who did it and why?  Enter 60 year old Oliver Stone (aka John Carr--assassin extraordinaire) leader of the Camel Club  who is tasked by the President with solving this perplexing mystery.  Add in a female MI-6 James Bond type agent, The Camel Club, various narcissistic intelligence chiefs, a female super CIA spy, and many nefarious foreign types including Russian and Mexican drug cartels and you have a recipe for a novel in hyper-drive.  The only problem is, it is just too busy trying to fit everything together logically.  In the end Mr. Baldacci makes it all work, but wow what a convoluted tale.  Fewer twists and turns and a little more thoughtful plot development would  have made this novel one of Mr. Baldacci's best.  Still, it gives this reader hope for future Baldacci novels along the Last Man Standing line.  I know you can do Mr. Baldacci.  No gratuitous sex, language or violence.  More of a hyper-busy Sherlock Holmes cerebral mystery.    Character development was spotty and could have been much better.  This novel was a target rich character environment that Mr. Baldacci failed to exploit!  There were two female leads that lent themselves to terrific development that Mr.Baldacci muffed.  I hope British MI-6 super agent Marry Chapman makes additional future appearances.  She is terrific.  It would be very nice to prequel Oliver Stone when he was in his CIA prime or in Vietnam when he was nominated for the Medal of Honor but turned it down.  Lots of possibilities there Mr. Baldacci.  Still, in the future maybe a little less mental gymnastics and a little more character development.    Can't recommend this novel as an expensive $28 hardback;  Library, paperback, or electronic download yes.  Good beach read or for a long oceanic flight.  It will be interesting to see where Mr. Baldacci goes from here.  I hope he returns to his literary roots.
B004B8RWX0|5.0|How does one give a review for a masterpiece? The Walking Dead is more then a mere TV show; it is pure genius. One cannot watch this show and not be entertained. Now, as far as a review for this specific episode goes, \\"Guts\\", is one of those love-hate experiences. It's a wonderful episode, don't get me wrong, and adds a definite element to the series, but its one that can be difficult to watch for some. It's full of suspense, excitement, and fantastic acting. If you choose to embark in watching this video, be ready for an amazing ride!
B003WUYQSW|4.0|Simple, honest, straight. The book is 100% Gary. If you've seen him at the videoblogs there's not much information left for the book to explain, but it's worth to have, read and re-read so you wireframe more neural networks in your brain, though. In Gary's words: true success -financial, personal, and professional- lies above all in loving your family, working hard, and living your passion. In telling your story. In authenticity, hustle, and patience. In caring fiercely about the big and the small stuff. In valuating legacy over currency.
B002ZG997M|4.0|Good action to a point.  The ending was a movie buff's nightmare. Too many loose ends.  He died; she went on; and her mother--who knows.
0553381687|1.0|It is the rare book I cannot even bear to finish.  I felt parts of my will to live die with every page.  If I wanted to read things like this I would read and re-read and re-read my local newpaper's politics section.
B0035V35PI|3.0|Mindless entertainment.  Not a movie those who want to have an intellectual discussion on the intricacies of the film's screenplay.
B00003CXMG|4.0|When I heard about this film, I really didn't think it would work. Was I wrong! This is a fun movie to watch, the dynamics between the characters is excellent, I loved the scene in the airplane near the end, and I think it captured the spirit of the times.
B002ZG9788|4.0|Better than the original although technology both on the filming and the viewing end may have helped.  Much more engaging than the first filem.
1594481784|4.0|This novel was fun to read and it has a very engaging voice, I liked the main character, the music references, AND it does a very good job of explaining what it is like to be in the post-relationship blues.
030726999X|2.0|Did not like this book.  Too much boring details and so many names of people to remember.  It did not flow!

0553805371|5.0|I've been waiting for this next book by Stephen Hawking as he has a knack for simplifying complex and overlapping fields of information, while writing for the non-scientist lay-person. The latest and greatest theories, in everyday language...

B002H3F7F6|5.0|Simply put, this album shines brightly. Albeit a light through a darkened looking glass.    Smokey vocals on insinuated melodies make this a definite 'not your father's Christmas' album. Sting is singing in his lower register for much of it and is in great voice. The tunes are plucked from early European sources.    I mixed this album into my iPod yuletide playlist. It works best that way; too many depressing and dark songs can be a lot to ingest in one sitting. Nice to hear Burl Ives singing 'Holly Jolly Christmas' following the 'Hounds of Winter'.    Highly recommended!
B00447G2MK|5.0|I bought this CD and I really like it...it almost tops Homesick which is my favorite ADTR album. My favorite on this is All I Want followed by It's Complicated, 2nd Sucks, and You'll be Tails and I'll be Sonic.     I'm not liking all these negative reviews though...
B001TH8UUA|5.0|This cable works terrific.  You do not need to buy something with a Monster name badge on it to get a good signal to and from your electrical devices.  Buy this cable and the spend the money you saved on something else.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|What better example of the glories of Western civilization than the beautiful melodies of Rodgers and Hammerstein set amidst the Austrian Alps during the mid twentieth century. The title song is an example indicative of the unique contribution of the West in world history as the force behind the most melodic expression of music written in the major key. The Christian church's influence in its development cannot be underestimated. However, I would be remiss not to mention the ominous threat posed to its expression by the rise of the fascist regime portrayed in the film. There are obvious parallels that one can see today as we see the rise of fundamentalist Islam and the spread of its influence across the face of Europe. It is not all that unlikely to imagine a scenario where the crosses on top of the cathedrals in the film being replaced by minarets and the beautiful songs written in the major key being outlawed and being replaced by the wailing of calls to prayer with no time signature or melody to speak of. Perhaps the rarity of great musicals such as this one in our time is symptomatic of the decline of the West as we've known it. Could it be that we are in need of a spiritual awakening based upon biblical Christianity to counteract this decline? My wife's comment was she thought the movie was about a lady singing on a hillside!
B004BSEKH6|1.0|...goats grazing on the farmlands. I assume this album is not for human entertainment. Maybe for sheep to bleat along to on the way to the slaughterhouse. This album is the epitomy of disrespect for music and artistry. There are two songs that may induce foot tapping from a reasonably minded individual and they are Moment For Life ft. Drake and Romans Revenge ft Eminem. The songs in themselves are trash but Drake always throws some element of skill into his writing and Eminems first verse is absolutely incredible. Nicki Minaj is definately feature material, as she has displayed her inability to carry a full album and keep the ears of anyone who does not attend the Church of Minaj interested. Quite honestly Nicki had promise when she began, but this whole awkward, deranged, random word generating writing style is a long way away from that. Nothing but awful rhymes for the most part, auto-tuned \\"singing\\", nonsense ramblings and gimmicks. This is not the making of a good album. All farmers take note. Buy this and play it for the goats, horses, sheep and pigs. It will give the album at least some purpose. Human ears need not indulge. God forgive me for trying.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|This is for The Muppet Christmas Carol Kermit's 50th Anniversary Edition. Since Netflix didn't have this available to rent, I bought it at Amazon and I'm glad I did. All I can say is wow, this film is even better than I remember. Gonzo and Rizzo-the-Rat narrate the story, and in each appearance they are hilarious. Kermit and the rest of the usual Muppet cast are in it too. Even if you don't have kids, you'll probably enjoy this film.     The acting and production values are top-notch. Michael Caine is a great Scrooge, and the sets and lighting are well done and look beautiful. It pretty much stays true to the original Christmas Carol story too. Even if you own a VHS copy, I say go for this DVD version. It's been digitally remastered and looks great. Plus it has a Wide Screen version.    Note: To access the Wide Screen version, just go to the main menu, then choose Set Up, then choose Audio & Video Options, then select Widescreen. It really does have a more cinematic feel than the full-screen version.    I watched the Wide Screen version (which I recommend), and unlike some other reviewers, the absence of the \\"When Love is Gone\\" song didn't detract anything from the film. However, the song is on the full-screen version (also on this disc). If you really want to see it, you can always pause after the Fozziewig party scene and go over to the full-screen version and watch the song (of course, go back to Wide Screen when the song is over).     Also, I normally don't like musical numbers in films, but the ones in this film are really fun and help add to the storytelling. This was definitely a good purchase, and something I'll enjoy for years to come.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I saw this in the theaters in 3D, so I definately wanted this in my collection. Came in excellent condition and enjoyed watching several times since I recieved it.
0451213092|2.0|I have read several of Follett's books and this is his worst.  It is plodding and boring.  It has the advantage of being real, but that is where it also falls down.  Not every real story has to be told, and this is one of them.<br /><br />It is obvious the reason this book was written was Perot had the money to pay Follett to write it.  If it weren't for that, we would never be inflicted with this book.<br /><br />I would have given this book one star, but it does have a moment or two, but that is all.<br /><br />If you haven't read Eye of the Needle, read that instead.
B003UBTX7C|1.0|We have very little options when were are constantly as consumers being ripped off.  I have read many Baldacci books and think he is great but it is ridiculous to spend almost the same price for a Hardcover book and an ebook.  There is no production costs its a 2 minute download.  What the heck why do you charge the same for both.  And don't say Amazon (or the the author in fact) have no control. That's not true.    BTW i am not being cheap.  I work hard for my money and prefer not to throw any of it away.  If I wanna give any away I'll give it to charity, they need it now in todays economy than the book publishers.
0802473156|5.0|This book was amazing.  I don't think I EVER finished a self-help book until this book.  It's easy to read, full of examples, and really changes perspectives on relationships.  It opened my eyes to a new way to looking at relationships and how they succeed and fail.  It has really helped me reflect on how and why my own relationships didn't work, and I strongly believe it will benefit my future relationships. My mom and my sister read it too and we all give it 5 stars and rave about it to our friends.
B000LT2IHI|5.0|First off, I almost purchaced this item for my daughter for Christmas today from Walmart, but decided against it due to the fact that it did not have many different sounds and my daughter is still a bit small for it. So I will not sit here and say whether it is a good or bad product. I just wanted to inform anyone who bothers to read these reviews that Walmart is selling this exact same product for only $15! I mean think about it... Amazon almost $50 and Walmart is $15 currently. Please check your local walmart before you spend this kind of money for it on Amazon. :)

B0002F6AH0|5.0|The BBC's World at War is the most remarkable history of WWII that I have ever read or seen.  We are given tastes of life in a foxhole, in the field command post, on the home front, and in the halls of government.  World at War lets us see why governments acted as they did, and we learn that they were often driven along by the force of a single strong character: Hitler or Stalin or Churchill or Roosevelt.    The series also allows a non-American-centric viewpoint.  One sees the war through the eyes of the Brits and the French and the Russians, the Italians and the Japanese - both from the perspective of the civilians trying to cope with total war (19 million Russian civilians were killed) and the governments trying to make difficult decisions.      There are extensive interviews with those close to Hitler, including many who were in the bunker with him in May of 1945.    If you want a history of WWII you need seek no further.

B003Y5H4SO|3.0|Putting sinners in an elevator may sound like an interesting premise, but after viewing it you realize its really nothing new under the sun. There are a few scary moments in the dark, more so what you hear as opposed to what you see, which isn't much. So yes its psychological, not really ghosts or demons. It does have a supernatural side which i really won't get into as to not give anything away. The plot is ok but thin, the acting is enh, something out of a cheap made for tv spooky flick, and the atmosphere, well pretty good. Obviously people know from the previews that the movie takes place mostly in an elevator, so if your clostraphobic you may feel a little uneasy. This is far from M Nights worst film but then again far from his best which was The Sixth Sense of course. Its far better than Lady In The Water, but truthfully i found The Happening to be move unnerving. So don't get your hopes up to be scared out of your whits but also you won't be disappointed at this VERY short but semi-sweet psychological thriller. Hey at least its about the first one this year, where did all the horror films go in 2010?
B003VR5PPY|5.0|This is not a game for children. Do not buy this title for your ten-year-old; the \\"Mature\\" ESRB rating on the package is very accurate. The storyline is very heavy in expletives (up to and including the f-bomb) and periodic sexual innuendo.<br /><br />I first found out about this game about two months ago while reading a synopsis on Amazon. As the title implies, nine people have nine hours to escape from a sinking ship. They were put there by a maniacal person named Zero, who kidnapped them from all over the world to participate in \\"The Nonary Game\\", a life-or-death challenge that will thrust the nine kidnapped people into a world of puzzles.<br /><br />The best comparison that I can draw to this game is a mash-up of PC classics Zork and Phantasmagoria. If you are not old enough to understand this reference, I offer another: Saw (the movies) meets Professor Layton. What Aksys has done is create a visual novel; you must solve puzzle elements in order to progress the storyline. If you ever played the classic point-and-click adventures on the PC (Myst, Phantasmagoria, Zork, & etc.), then it is fairly intuitive (and obvious) that they can be reincarnated on the DS. The touch-screen interface is a perfect way to introduce this style of mystery/puzzle games to a new gaming generation.<br /><br />Gameplay<br /><br />Nine Hours, Nine Person, Nine Doors (lets call it 999 for short) excels in intuitive gameplay. The concept is fairly simple: the game is divided into two sections: narrative and escape puzzles. For each puzzle, your character (Junpei) will be placed into an area, comprised of a room or a series of rooms, and he must find items and solve puzzles in order to open the door and escape.<br /><br />Now the title and the game itself does indicate that you have only 9 hours to escape. This is true, but the gameplay is very forgiving. Time does advance, but it is \\"suspended\\" while you are working to solve each escape puzzle. In addition, you are able to repeatedly attempt to solve each puzzle without fear of locking yourself out or dying. Solving the puzzles themselves is fun without being overly complex. Do not take this to mean that the game is easy; it isn't, not by any stretch of the imagination. The game's producer, Aksys, has done a masterful job in balancing how you have to find items and how you solve the puzzles. Granted the puzzles themselves can be somewhat math-heavy (two key concepts are a digital root and the hexadecimal system), but the game is generous about allowing mistakes to occur and even provides a calculator to help those who may not be as adept at mental math.<br /><br />Now, here is the caveat [minor spoiler]. 999 is a game that requires more than one playthrough in order to find out everything about the storyline. You may think this sounds like a cheap gimmick, and I assure you that it is not. Each playthrough gives you the opportunity to try different things (choose a different door to go through, choose different party members for each door, and so forth), and subsequently, each character will reveal slightly more about themselves and their past. Thrown in for even more mystery is the seemingly random interjection of history: the Titanic, glycerin crystallization, a priestess of Amun-Ra, and more. Aksys makes each playthrough easier by allowing you to \\"fast forward\\" through dialogue that you have already read. In addition, whenever a choice menu appears, previous selections are greyed-out so that you can easily remember the last action you took at that point in your previous playthrough.<br /><br />The only complaint that I have to this system is that you cannot \\"fast forward\\" through puzzles that you have previously solved. Since the narrative part of the game can be rather text-heavy, the option to speed through it is much appreciated; however, I would infinitely prefer not having to repeat the \\"prologue\\" puzzle in the 3rd class cabin over-and-over. If I had to open that danged red suitcase one more time, I would've gone looney. Fortunately, if you need to walk away from the game, you are permitted to save at any point. In addition, after you beat the game for the first time, you can access each escape puzzle in the main menu and re-enact the escape if you wish to hone your skills.<br /><br />In order to access every puzzle room, it is necessary to play the game at least more than once. Also, to get the \\"best\\" ending, you have to complete a specific \\"bad\\" ending first. Finding the \\"best\\" ending is at best a crap shoot, as there is no readily obvious way to find it without trial-and-error or consulting a game guide. The best ending, though, is worth it. In addition, each of the \\"bad\\" endings reveals a little bit more of the history of each character and can help you solve loose ends that may not be resolved in the \\"best\\" ending.<br /><br />Storyline<br /><br />This is where 999 excels. The story is not forced. You will actually delight in reading the text and learning a little bit more about each character. Thrown in is a lot of humor (many of it adult); there were a lot of interactions with the characters that had me laughing so hard that I was wiping away tears. The author of the story is amazing, and it was truly a joy to play through the game several times (I completed it four different times, I still have two endings to watch) and learn a little bit more each time.<br /><br />In addition to having one of the best \\"true\\" endings of any puzzle game that I have played to date, the mystery and motives of everyone involved will lead to a rousing debate between members of the gaming community for a while to come. Personally, I have inserted myself into a board discussion on the Gamefaqs website, trading theories with other 999 players as to the purpose of a specific character as well as a secondary storyline within the game. I will not specify anything here, as I do not want to spoil the surprise for anyone, but suffice it to say I am very pleased that a game has had me thinking about it ever since I beat it.<br /><br />Graphics & Sound<br /><br />This game is one of the better games for the DS. While the narrative itself is text, each character has a unique design and the backgrounds are very appropriate for an early 20th century ship. There are only a handful of animations within the game (usually limited to puzzle-solving), but they are well done. The backgrounds are detailed, but not overly cluttered as to make it difficult to find items for a puzzle. Overall, the graphics are a 10/10.<br /><br />The sound is good, nothing over-the-top, and does help to set the mood for the game. I usually play my games with the sound turned off, but while I did have it on, I found it appropriate to the atmosphere without being too cloying. It would have been nice to hear some voiceacting (reading about a character screaming, usually described in great detail, would have been more realistic), but the lack of it does not really detract from the game. The narrative itself is written with great detail, to the point that the desription of a dead body almost made me nauseous. That said, where the sound falls short the narrative itself picks it up. A solid 8/10.<br /><br />Overall<br /><br />If you are a puzzle fanatic and love a good mystery, buy this game. The puzzles are fun without being overly complex, the story is extremely well done, and the game is a pure joy to play. I can find little fault in it. If you are sensitive to expletives, it may try your patience, but by-and-large, I did not find them to be overwrought. For the most part, the bawdy language did fit the action and situations presented, so I was able to forgive it.<br /><br />As stated at the beginning of this review, this game is NOT for children. While it would be lovely to give to a child to solve the puzzles (nothing like some mental exercise), the storyline, some of the graphics, and the language would not be appropriate. The game is very heavily peppered with the f-bomb, s***, b***h, and a few more. While there is nothing overtly sexual within the game, a few campy jokes do allude to some pretty erotic stuff, although it is tastefully done and I found myself chuckling.<br /><br />999 is perfectly balanced with comedy, a compelling storyline, a great soundtrack, and deep characters that will stay in your heart for a long time. If you are looking for a fun puzzle game that is truly a gem, this title is for you. This game should be one of the games of the year.had me thinking about it ever since I beat it.<br /><br />Graphics & Sound<br /><br />This game is one of the better games for the DS. While the narrative itself is text, each character has a unique design and the backgrounds are very appropriate for an early 20th century ship. There are only a handful of animations within the game (usually limited to puzzle-solving), but they are well done. The backgrounds are detailed, but not overly cluttered as to make it difficult to find items for a puzzle. Overall, the graphics are a 10/10.<br /><br />The sound is good, nothing over-the-top, and does help to set the mood for the game. I usually play my games with the sound turned off, but while I did have it on, I found it appropriate to the atmosphere without being too cloying. It would have been nice to hear some voiceacting (reading about a character screaming, usually described in great detail, would have been more realistic), but the lack of it does not really detract from the game. The narrative itself is written with great detail, to the point that the desription of a dead body almost made me nauseous. That said, where the sound falls short the narrative itself picks it up. A solid 8/10.<br /><br />Overall<br /><br />If you are a puzzle fanatic and love a good mystery, buy this game.

0517548232|5.0|Timeless, that is what this book shows you and gives examples of each senario that we have heard about throughout our life, and truly explains the full effect of government intervention.  First of all this book was orginally written in the 40's after the war, and then again in the early 70's.  But it is as timeless today as it was when it was written.  One of the greatest features about this book as the authors approach, is that he gives the most basic example, and then builds on it throughout the book, giving it a readable quality to an incredibly wage range and age of readers.  They can merely read to their example level of understanding, and if they don't go anyfarther than they will still understand more about basic economics that the majority of adults.  For adults, I find that he put it in just clear examples of everything we have heard our whole lifes and explained the true ramifications of the policies....without a doubt each a failure.  Love it and giving it to my twin high school graduates before heading off to that evil liberal world of college. Just so they will have a little understanding of the other side and be able to back it up...if the need so arose.  Wish it was required reading, before being able to vote.
B000002GXJ|5.0|This has got to be the best album of all time. Every part of the album is ultra professional, while epically entertaining.
B001ECPJZO|5.0|I bought this for my 6 month old who is facinated with shoes.  She chews on the laces, but it seems safe and it's clean.  We've had it several months and it's still one of her favorite toys.
B000QFW7UA|4.0|La verdad que ha sido una sorpresa saber que editaban una edición de aniversario. en esta versión, lo que más se destaca es el packaging, excelente para todos quienes amen esta serie. la calidad del blu ray es muy buena, no excelente pero sí muy buena. la verdad que se las recomiendo a todos.
B003J27WFW|4.0|If you love Rush, you will love this.  But someone please answer me this: why does Jack Black have to yuck it up and ruin parts of this for me?  Even my wife thought he was childish.  Everyone else (the stars that were interviewed) were all very professional and humbled.  Not Jack Black.  He needs to stick to making kids movies.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|Excelente edición, la calidad de la pelicula en digital es perfecta, un muy buen trabajo. se puede ver muchos detalles que antes no eran visibles. la edicion coleccionista es impresionante. la verdad que hay que dar las gracias por editar esta pelicula de la manera que lo hicieron. y sin entrar en más detalles con el sonido, en un extraordinario 7.1.
B0043A0PXU|4.0|The good: A new album of Annie Lennox!<br />The bad: It's a Christmas album.<br />The ugly: She used Autotune.<br />The good: The Autotune occurs only on one track, for one verse of \\"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen.\\"<br />The bad: All of the tracks (save one) are hymns or religious in theme.<br />The ugly: Occasionally, Annie's singing is just overwrought and much louder than it needs to be.<br />The good: The version of \\"As Joseph Was A Walking\\" is exquisite.<br />The bad: She chose alternate, perhaps antiquated, and non-traditional melodies for several of the songs.<br />The ugly: \\"The Holly and the Ivy\\" is repetitive and way too long.<br />The good: It's nice to have some Christmas music from Annie other than \\"Winter Wonderland.\\"
B00000IMYA|5.0|Disk arrived in good time as described. Also happens to be a great and finally complete version of an iconic performance. No one should be without it who cares about jazz, even if 'big band' isn't your primary interest. Incredibly detailed liner notes make listening and reading together like watching a really good documentary.
B002ZG98LO|2.0|This movie \\"Predators\\" was SO bad that I could not watch past thirty minutes. I fast forwarded to the climax fight. Made me chuckle. The original was superbly directed by John McTiernan who directed Predator and Die Hard almost simultaneously and created movie magic with both movies. Arnold was smart enough not to return to the franchise for pathetic Danny Glover sequel why don't the producers and the studio stop making these sequels??<br />The move starts with Adrien falling from the sky. Bad premise to start the movie. The movie should have a slow beginning like the original Predator ship slowly arriving on earth. Adrien's tough guy voice and accent made me laugh out loud. Grace's role was more suited to him. The multi-national acting talent was a lame attempt. The woman in the original movie had a purpose as a POW. This female is just there to compensate for a female presence and same goes for the African American actor.<br />The \\"dogs\\" were so pathetic. The boar that tripped the wire in the original was more scary than these dogs!<br />Do yourself a favor, and skip this one!
B00009Y3L4|5.0|I am very impressed with the order itself. It was delivered quickly, I didn't even order overnight express or anywhere near that. It also seems to be in mint condition.<br /><br />Just wow!
B00337KM2S|4.0|This is the story of a professional corporate down-sizer who spends his life in airports, hotels and rental cars and thrives on every minute of it. Ryan Bingham, played by George Clooney underpins his career with a life philosophy of personal, emotional and material minimalism - the \\"empty back pack\\" approach as he calls it. The less baggage, the more freedom. The more freedom, the more control. But then we see Ryan learn that freedom might not be all its cracked up to be when his carefully crafted world suddenly starts to unravel under encroaching technology, and a creeping attachment to a fellow road warrior played by Vera Farmiga. This unmasking of Ryan's life is furthered by a persistent challenge to his philosophies from his idealistic and ambitious young protegee played by Anna Kendrick. What Ryan finds out is that frequent flier miles, preferred customer cards and hotel soap can fill up a back back just the same as kids and mortgages. Everything comes at a price.     This is a wonderfully sophisticated movie for adults.  It never drags or gets bogged down with pretentious self examination or over directing (the NYU-film-school pitfalls I hate so much). This is a very watchable movie that simply tells a story. George Clooney maintains his high standards and Vera Farmiga gives this movie a real genuineness.     My only real criticism of this movie is the inclusion of real life monologues from actual downsizing victims, tossed in throughout the movie. These segments jarred my suspension of disbelief and were simply distracting.   There's no question that losing a job is viscerally traumatizing, but business is business people. It's a cold, cold world. Listening to people ask someone who's simply delivering a message, how they can \\"sleep at night\\" or \\"live with themselves\\" comes across as effected and melodramatic. A non-actor re-creating an actual moment by, essentially, acting (and doing it badly)pulled the movie down and interfered with the steady pace of thestory.     Other than that, this movie was seamless.
B004B4JGHE|5.0|I'm not even a huge country music fan, but I have to admit that this album is great! I find myself listening to it over and over again. Keith is a very talented singer/songwriter. If he keeps making great albums, I will definitely be a member of his fan club! This album is great for someone who may want a great introduction to Country music. The fast songs make me want to dance and the slow songs are very romantic. This guy's got some serious talent!
B0017I1FO4|5.0|After their previous CD, Save Me, it seemed unlikely that their next CD would be just as good, and even less likely that it would be better. Well, it far surpasses the previous CD. With songs like \\"Cyanide Sweet Tooth Suicide\\" and \\"If You Only Knew\\", they're continuing to provide incredible rock music.
B003K07DUC|5.0|I have this on Blu-ray and the visual quality seems pretty good to me. Yeah it is somewhat grainy, but that doesn't mean that it is terrible quality. There is nothing that can be done to get rid of the grain because thats what it looks like on film. Other than that I really enjoyed this movie and seeing it in HD makes it even more awesome.
B002ZG98Z0|1.0|Really really really bad. Total cheese and NOWHERE NEAR the show... actually it was even far worse than the first movie, which in my opinion was bad!
B001IAOEXU|5.0|It definitely feels better and even though you are paying 5 bucks for a 2cent pieces of plastic I would do it again. They also help to not accidentally fast forward during movies when setting the controller down.
B0010OIN90|3.0|Maybe I should have paid more attention to the description, but loking at the pic, I thought this was a rubber type band. This is actually hard plastic lego pieces that fit together. The one advantage is that it is most certainly adjustable.   I worry that my son will end up losing most of the small links.
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|If you own the vintage DVD edition of Band of Brothers, this is a must-have complement featuring the brutality and extraordinary personal sacrifice of our troops in the Pacific theater during WWII.  Some extremely intense and gory scenes, but highly realistic and combined with impressive depth of character development.  I have already watched the entire 6 CD set twice through, and there are some unforgettable episodes and scenes in every one.
B003SWNRU2|5.0|\\"Blood of the Nations\\" is easily the best heavy metal album of the year.   Accept is back with a vengeance.  Its almost hard to believe an Accept cd could be this great without the banshee vocals of UDO.  New vocalist, Mark Tormillo manages to sound enough like UDO that it is  very believeable that he will be able to carry out the vocal duties for all the old Accept classics, once the band gets out on the road to tour this cd.  Original members Wolf Hoffmann, Lead Guitar,  Peter Baltes, Bass, along with almost original member Herman Frank, Guitar, and Stephan Schwarzmann, Drums, along with the new singer, Tornillo, the new lineup  recreates  the classic Accept sound that fans of \\"Breaker\\", \\"Restless and Wild\\", \\"Balls to the Wall\\" and \\"Metal Heart\\" will surely welcome back.  \\"Blood of the Nations\\" will take its place in the Accept legacy of great metal masterpieces such as the albums listed above.   The  two heavyest things to come from Germany is the Tiger-Panzer Tank, and the True Titans of Heavy Metal,  ACCEPT!
0061020680|4.0|Mort by Terry Pratchett<br />Signet, 1987<br />181 pages<br />Discworld; Comedy; Fantasy<br />4/5 stars<br /><br />Source: Library<br /><br />Summary: Mort has been chosen as an apprentice to Death.  As Mort tries to tamp down his human side (which keeps insisting on fairness), Death tries to experience the life of a human.  Neither is quite successful and Death and Mort end up dueling.  But all ends well in Discworld!<br /><br />Thoughts: This is actually the fourth Discworld novel to be published.  I'm more familiar with Pratchett's later work so it was interesting to read a book from the start of the series.  I was super excited about this because Death is my favorite character in Discworld (well tied with Moist von Lipwig).  He is an anthropomorphic personification and he is so much better in these books than in other books which have also used Death as a character.  In this book, he takes Mort on as an apprentice.  Mort is introduced to the mysterious Albert and to Death's daughter Ysabell.  On one of his first solo jobs, Mort accidentally doesn't kill a princess which sets in motion the main plot.<br /><br />Meanwhile Death is off trying to experience happiness through gambling, drinking, and other human activities.  He also has a fondness for cats, which endears him even more to me; you know, people can be so mean to cats sometimes and it just breaks my heart.<br /><br />You can kind of tell that it's an early book because it's so narrowly focused; I feel like the later books I've read tie together more strings and are just generally more ambitious.  That doesn't make this a bad book; it's just one of the differences I noticed.<br /><br />Overall: A good entry in the Discworld series; recommended for fans of Death.
B0042JTDXK|1.0|It's admirable of Josh to try new things, like new song styles, writing his own songs, but I'm sorry to say the result here is a total disaster. Just like not every singer can sing half as well as Josh does, he can't do all the other things as well as he sings neither. Bottom line is that this record is a total bore, the worst from both Rick Rubin and Groban. I'm surprised that the label actually green-lighted this. Next time, record something you're good at, and do what you love most as a hobby.
B003X2O6KW|5.0|If you don't rate this with 5 stars, you can't be a Kanye fan! He is progressive as always, retro as ever, and a a true artist. You must get the DVD/CD package to fully appreciate the whole experience of \\"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\\"---It is A-R-T...and it's good.
B00328R21C|5.0|Fun toy and excellent collector's piece. I cannot say enough good things about Lego, Lego Star Wars, and Lego bricks in general. Their toys are pricey, but they are durable and will last forever. BUT...this toy costs $24.99 at lego dot com and $24.97 at walmart dot com. Amazon needs to do something about the price jacking going on at Christmas.
B000WCN8SC|5.0|I love The Doors music. I've wanted to buy this boxset since its release date but hadn't for no good reasons other than I thought, perhaps, having the Doors music already why would I need to add, basically, the same music to want I already had. Putting that aside, I always knew I'd purchase this boxset when my mind set was right. Today, I bought it. I immediately listened to the DVD 5.1 mix, and I love them. I heard voices and instrumentation that I hadn't heard before and I enjoyed that added benefit. It almost made my Doors' listening-experience brand-new. If you love The Doors do yourself a positive and buy this boxset. Having the 5.1 mixes is definitely a plus.
0345505387|1.0|I was appalled when I saw this book at our local bookstore. It is sad that a writer as fine as Diana Gabaldon would waste her time on this horrifying testimony to the declining literacy in America. The idea of a fine novelist writing a comic book is sad in itself. A long comic book is a comic book. A rose by any other name... or in this case a skunk cabbage by any other name smells as foul.   It wasn't even a good comic book since the male characters all looked like some Eurasian version of super heroes in kilts while Clair was some stereotypical Bertha Big Boobs with 1980's big hair.    I have loved this series although I am not a fan of romance novels. That was because the Outlander series gave new scope to a romance series. It went beyond the predictable bodice ripper with interesting history, excellent writing and truly three dimensional characters. To devolve into this drivel in order to attract those who can barely read is a dreadful fate for a fine writer. Did her publisher force Ms. Gabaldon into this? Was she just greedy enough to want to scrape the bottom of the literacy barrel? Her last novel simply stopped; one could not call it an end since little was resolved, something which disappointed many of her readers. Are we seeing the downward spiral of a fine talent? If Ms. Gabaldon has just burned out on this series, then she should take pride in what she did produce and move on. This debasing of a fine series is painful to watch.    I was eight when I graduated from classic comics because even as a child, I saw that picture books were inadequate to a real book.     I give this one star because it can't be given anything less.
0765348276|4.0|John Perry is an old man. His wife is dead, and he's joining the military. ??? Certainly an interesting premise already, but it gets better.<br /><br />Scalzi's main character is intelligent, with a wry sense of humor and maintains a humble likability as he rises through the ranks. An imperfect past grounds him and make him real, while the passion and love he felt for his wife never waivers. Which is good, because this is a very personal struggle by one man. And if he didn't sell the book on his own standing, there'd be trouble.<br /><br />The technology ideas here may be old hat to some, but Scalzi uses them superbly--integrating them and making them a very real part of life and military maneuvers.<br /><br />Cybernetic implants? Check.<br />Nanotech? Check.<br />Enhanced strength and speed? Check.<br />Green skin? Uh...you'll see.<br /><br />There's more, but despite a couple bits, nothing was jaw-dropping different. But it didn't need to be. Really illustrates how important execution is. A good idea is nice, but will get you nowhere if you can't sell it within the story. We're past the day and age when an interesting idea can make a sci-fi novel; there need to be deep characters, a convincing setting and it needs to all...work.<br /><br />Humor is a solid reason to read this book. If you're not laughing through their version of Boot Camp, then something is wrong with you (or perhaps Twilight is more your fort&eacute;--yes...I went there...).<br /><br />My one real complaint with Old Man's War would be its lack of description. On the other hand, the narration is concise, amusing, and it makes the pages fly! There is no fluff in this book! Yes, I wished it had been longer and more detailed, but this is more a testament to Scalzi's skill than a lack of sheer book to read. So, in most regards, it makes up for its sparse detail. However, due to its brevity and the large jumps in time the narrative can take, the reader is sometimes left with the White Room effect. (If not commonly known, I've heard reference to this before and it is simply the loss of connection to the setting and surrounding stimuli. This makes you feel like the current conversation is taking place in a Matrix-like loading space--and not in a cool way.) It is a testament to the quality of the dialogue, story and well-used technology that this is not a bigger issue.<br /><br />The story's setting is huge with a propensity for an EPIC story. There are large scale battles and conflicts, cliff hangers, aliens up the wazoo, but it is not Space Opera. It is one man's journey. That's it. I didn't find this to be a failing, but I did find it jarring when I realized the end was coming near and there was nothing earth-shattering in its conclusion.<br /><br />Satisfying, but not earth-shattering.<br /><br />Usually I love my stories to be epic and I like my endings to be monumental. This might have resulted as a fail for me in another book, but Old Man's War was just...different. I can't help but wish there had been more. Oh wait, there are more books set in the same universe. Ah. Well played, Scalzi. Well played...<br /><br />As a first book it is phenomenal, quick to read and leaves you antsy for more. What else could Scalzi have wanted for his first foray into fiction? It gets a solid 4.5 stars from me. I may be late to the game here and telling you what you already know, but for anyone that hasn't read Old Man's War... Go get it!<br /><br />Come visit me on my writing and artist blog:  to talk about it and see more reviews.simply the loss of connection to the setting and surrounding stimuli.

B004498KPU|4.0|I got this in the mail today and loved it.  Maybe the best MJ release on DVD yet.  That said, I'm giving it only four stars and not five because despite being billed as a complete set, I was very sad to see that the full version of \\"Ghosts\\" was not on it, nor was \\"We Are the World.\\"  Both should be on here. In fact, I'd even go so far to say that \\"Captain Eo\\" should be on here as well.  But, in the case of that short, I realize it comes down to Disney more then Sony and based on Disney's track record with their theme park shows being released on VHS or DVD, I'm not holding my breathe.<br /><br />If I could could give it four and a half stars, I would though, as past those few things, it is a really great collection that I'd recommend to anyone.
B002ZG99N6|5.0|I managed to see this twice in theaters which is unusual for me.  I just loved it that much!  Great action scenes.  Wonderful acting, and well developed characters.  I think this is probably some of Ben Affleck's best work. Blake Lively is unrecognizable.  Amazing performance from her as well.
B000PC0U1W|4.0|I read the comics in the 80s and was a bit confused at the time. Maybe I was expecting more Zorro than a politically under toned hero. But once I reread it in the late 90s...I got it! This movie is spot on, in regards to the book. And the director truly pulled off the look and feel of the book in this film. At times the movie may seem to drag, but what you must remember is, this was written at a time when people had patience to read, and a willingness to think. I'm not attacking the current Hollywood mindless romps, but they don't make thought-provoking movies anymore. This movie was based on a thought-provoking comic book, and loosely based on historical occurrences. So if you are looking for an ADD generation movie, this isn't it.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|I received the DVD & CD in a timely manner and in perfect condition. I loved it so much I plan on ordering more for gifts. Just couldn't stop dancing and even play the DVD at dinner parties to get them up and moving!  It works! I appreciate your help. Thank you.
B0012GMVQC|4.0|For a while there, this was mandatory listening in my house. The sounds Jeff Beck gets from six strings (plus effects) is amazing and they are showcased on this CD. Is it his best? No. Is it incredible listening? Probably so.
B003X73QA8|5.0|This is Arcade Fire's masterpiece. I adored both previous albums, but this album will tumble your emotions more than I thought possible. This is a time machine for your soul.
B0037AGASG|3.0|I basically bought this cd for one song, the baby baby song they played all summer.  I was hoping there would be other good songs on here but none of them really hit me over the head.  Somebody 2 love is ok but the other songs fall a bit short.  I think Justin Bieber has a good r and b voice and who knows how long it will take to change.  The same thing happened to New Kids On The Block and they never fully recovered.  Oh, and it's time to cut the hair dude.
031603438X|5.0|And what alife it has been! This is required reading for all die-hard Stones' fans,adherants of the Keef Kult, and just about everyone else who desires a down-to-earth read. Keith Richards has proven that not all iconoclasts are unapproachable or other worldly. This guy is still one of us, and speaks to us as if sitting across the table and spinning his life's tale. His love affair with music is uplifting; his candor about the hard-driving lifestyle he chose is life-changing. May he forever play on...
B003LR4QPE|3.0|All indications are that this latest iteration of the hänssler CLASSIC Edition Bachakademie is a gussied up repackaging of the super budget version released in 2004 (and available at one time from Berkshire Record Outlet for just $199.99). The new packaging is an attractive up-grade over the earlier bare bones version but I do not know if that justifies the higher price point.    That said, it has been ten years since the hänssler/Rilling edition saw the light of day. At that time, the folks at hänssler and Warner were engaged in a war of words over whose \\"Complete Bach\\" was MOST complete. The hänssler/Rilling edition DID have more discs when completed - but this additional material, not presented in the Warner Bach 2000 consisted primarily of 12 discs of chorales. Lovely? Yes. A legitimate part of Bach's oeuvre? Yes. Yet 12 discs of hymn tunes was not a major incentive for this collector, at least.     Caveat lector! I personally prefer period instrument performances, and while boy sopranos and male falsettists may bother some listeners, the fact IS that this was the sound world that Bach dealt with; these were the musicians he wrote for. It is fighting the straw man to argue that had Bach ACCESS to female singers and modern orchestral instruments, he would have used them. To carry that line of reasoning to its logical extreme, Bach's music should simply just be performed on digital synthesizers.     At the heart of this massive collection are Bach's immortal works for the Lutheran Church - 60 discs of  sacred cantatas and about 20 more worth or oratorios, Passions, Missae brevis (Lutheran masses, sans \\"Credo\\"), and a handful of smaller individual movements, all under the direction of Helmuth Rilling. Music history should rightly honor Rilling as the FIRST man to the top of the mountain. During the 1960s he was a God, performing obscure and long-forgotten and neglected works by Scheutz, the Bach family and Buxtehude. The recordings of the original Bach Editionwere originally made between 1969-1985 and were integrally released in 1985 as part of the Bach Tercentenary. As is well known, Rilling always had the good fortune to work with superlative singers; the orchestras and ensembles are ready to take on most any challenge and the Gaechinger Kantorei  deserve to be ranked among the world's great choral ensembles - if only for having learned and performed so much music so beautifully. And yet, in the 30 - 40 years since originally recorded, much has changed. The recordings could certainly do with a little digital remastering (some are extremely bright, while others are rather colorless...). Additionally, Bach scholarship has advanced and some of Rilling's interpretative choices have been superseded by later generations. Still in all, if your taste is for Bach on MODERN instruments, performed at lightening fast speeds - this IS the set you will want.    The organ works are uniformly were played and documented, though their arrangement into \\"thematic\\" collections (i.e. \\"New Ideas in Weimar\\", \\"Influences of Cantata, Concerto & Chamber Music\\", \\"Not a Note from Bach?\\" etc.) make it a bit of challenge to find the piece you are looking for.    The recordings of the keyboard works fortunately are fortunately organized by form, collection and idiom and there are some truly wonderful performances. Pinnock's Partitas are outstanding. Robert Levin does a fine job with the English Suites, though his WTC is an odd-ball affair, using at it does an assemblage of harpsichords, chamber organs, clavichords, etc.  An interesting concept... and probably worth hearing for that alone. Among the real treasures to discover are the performances of Robert Hill on the Lute-Harpsichord (Lautenwerk). Bach apparently had a sweet-tooth for this hybrid harpsichord and owned a pair himself. Hill performs several works believed to have been written for this instrument as well as a fascinating collection of transcriptions (not all by Bach). Of the recordingsthat have not aged so well are those by Koroliov. His 2-disc \\"Golderg\\" Variations is probably one of the SLOWEST on record. His readings of the French Ouverture/Italian Concerto paring is spare and his Inventions & Sinfonias is fussy. For the last, I would have welcomed another performance from Robert Levin.    As for the chamber music, the two large solo collections (Sonatas and Partitas for Violn/Suites for Cello) are given fine, modern instrument performances by Dmitri Sitkovetsky (who later returns for the Violin Sonatas with keyboard) and Boris Pergamenschikow. The flute sonatas (together with a handful of Trio Sonatas) receive one of the more idiosyncratic treatments in the collection: Jean-Claude Gérard performs on a modern flute, while his continuo partners perform variously on bassoon, cello, harpsichord and Fortepiano. The Three Sonatas for Viola da Gamba are lovingly performed by Hille Perl - though without any companion works on the program, the CD's playing time is just about 38 minutes! Of all the chamber works in this monumental collection, the Musical Offering received one of the finest recordings on disc. Also included on the program are a fascinating set of Canons.     The epic journey ends with the orchestral and concertante works. These are all uniformly acceptable, modern instrument performances. Nothing objectionable and Rilling keeps the tempos brisk.     In summary, the entire collection really hangs on Helmuth Rilling's vision of Bach's works. Either you like his big, plumy choral sound with modern instruments or you don't. He used to be the only game in town but now there are an increasing number of alternatives, at least for the cantatas -  Nikolaus Harnoncourt & Gustav Leonhardt on Teldec, Pieter Jan Leusink on Brilliant Classics, Ton Koopman on Antoine Marchand, Masaaki Suzuki on BIS and John Eliot Gardiner  on the Soli Deo Gloria label.
B00000IMTH|5.0|Rainbow should be considered one of the greatest hard rock bands of the classic rock era and if they only have two albums to truly show for their legacy then `Rising' and \\"Long Live Rock n' Roll' would suit me just fine. `Long Live' is a masterpiece, pure and simple and it is really hard to rate it a slight notch below `Rising' but there you go. Dio would leave for blacker pastures after the resulting tour and left Ritchie to pursue his pop star muse with debatable results. Though they did achieve a modicum of commercial success after Ronnie left, Rainbow was left to swim in the seas with mere mortals. Rainbow was an originator of power metal or medieval metal which Dio carried the torch for after he left both Rainbow and Sabbath in his own band and the popular music stylings that Rainbow pursued with Bonnett and Turner would never receive the respect or classic status that the Dio years would leave.  The title track while maybe somewhat pedestrian in terms of subject matter gets a full throttle delivery which brings out the track's inherent meanness. \\"Lady of the Lake\\", \\"Rainbow Eyes\\" and the record's piece de resistance \\"Gates of Babylon\\" cover more familiar territory a la `Rising'. \\"Kill the King\\" is speed metal at its most royal (originally previewed on the previous year's `On Stage') and is a tour de force or virtuoso metal musicianship for 1978! There is not a duff track on here and both \\"LA Connection\\" and \\"Sensitive to Light\\" continue to bring joy after repeated listens. Wow, talk about desert island discs here - both `Rising' and `LLRnR' are on the short list of my all time favorites and Ritchie Blackmore has made a great record since.......sleep with the devil and then you must pay!

B00445JSX2|5.0|I have had the pleasure of seeing Depeche Mode during their Tour of the Universe twice, in Tampa and Fort Lauderdale.  At a total, I have been blessed to seem them five times altogether. This leads me to this DVD capturing a performance of DM during the Tour of the Universe in Spain.  Seeing this show twice and purchasing several of the recorded performances, I am very familiar with this tour. [I am a rabid Depeche Mode fan, so my review might be a bit basis, they could put a beat to the Wendy's dollar menu and I would be jovial.]  I believe that this movie/DVD concert is an accurate depiction of this tour.<br /><br />The album they were promoting was \\"Sounds of the Universe\\" which was met with a mixed response.  I for one love this album and believe it will mature nicely in the DM catalog.  The performance showcases five songs (six if the bonus track is included) from the SOTU album.  These songs translate majestically when performed live.  \\"In Chains\\" is an amazing opener, haunting and captivating, reminding me of \\"Higher Love\\".  \\"Wrong\\" is a fierce and powerful in this performance.<br /><br />As for the classic Depeche tunes, they are all here (for the most part).  The blessing and curse of DM is that they have so many songs it is going to be challenging to satisfy everyone. \\"Personal Jesus\\" and \\"Walking in My Shoes\\" is a couple of the stand outs.  I overall am pleased with the set list here and at twenty-one songs, the concert is jammed packed.<br /><br />After watching this concert I have come to the conclusion that Depeche Mode still \\"has it\\".  The show had energy, the band was in top form and the crowd was totally \\"in the zone\\".  The interaction with the crowd and the band at the closure of \\"Home\\" was touching, at the risk of sounding a bit maudlin.  As for the production of the DVD, the sound was very good and the cinematography was very slick.  There are myriad angles used in this presentation; close ups of the band and crowd, view of the stage, bird's eye view of the audience and some post-modern views such as out of focus shots and outlooks via speaks and/or other equipment.<br /><br />The second disk is exclusive to this four disk set and features bonus material.  The bonus material is montages of the show/backstage, the screens used during the show, the four promotional music videos from SOTU, rehearsals for \\"Wrong\\" and \\"Walking in My Shoes\\" (the band and Dave sound amazing).  Last but not least is an interesting documentary about the tour and the ups and downs the band experienced being on the road.<br /><br />The band went through some calamities such has Fletch losing his father and Dave's health issues.  I found the disclosure from the band being both candid and reserved, a nice balance.  There was also some humor throughout this documentary that was refreshing.  Listening to Martin talk about how he was once afraid that he would drop dead on stage was funny, believe it or not.<br /><br />When this documentary was over I was left with a bittersweet feeling.  Depeche Mode has been around for (just about) 30 years.  The band appears that they don't want to be one of these bands that end up \\"flaking out\\" and washed up.  Dave candidly speaks about how he realizes he is almost 50 and doesn't want to tarnish Depeche Mode if he isn't at top form.  It makes me question how many more tours they have left in them.  I am sure they will still record music (I hope), in one way shape or form, but will they tour again?  Like many DM fans, I feel that this band is still in top form.  In addition, they are relevant because the music they make is unique.  Their unique sound morphs beautifully live; the audio CDs in this set are proof of that.  I believe that this four disk set is a no brainer for a DM fan.  This show will be treasured by me as a keepsake and a memory of a great tour, by one of the greatest bands.and some post-modern views such as out of focus shots and outlooks via speaks and/or other equipment.

B00003JRCQ|5.0|If you are trying to decide which version of Persuasion to buy--search no more--this is it!  Beautifully acted, beautifully filmed, (the scenes in Lyme Regis were actually shot in Lyme), a beautiful adaptation.  One reviewer said the actors were \\"homely\\".  I beg to differ!  Both Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds are very attractive and look like REAL people--not \\"Hollywood Movie Stars\\".  You can believe they were people Jane Austen knew personally.      The supporting cast is equally exceptional.  Sophie Thompson's portrayal of Mary Musgrove is spot on.  (I reread the book after watching this DVD again, and the scene when Anne goes to visit Mary at the beginning of the movie is almost word for word Jane Austen.)  And Corin Redgrave has captured the essence of Walter Elliot perfectly.      I recently bought the new 2007 version (with Sally Hawkins).  It's OK--nothing wrong with it, but it does not have the pathos of this version.  If you are only going to buy one version, buy this one.
B003UYUQXO|5.0|This is not a review of the movie; we know how great it is, but an insight on the technical aspects of this Canadian import version of the blu-ray release, region A, which does play in the US.  I did a side by side comparison of exact scenes w/ the upscaled dvd (via HDMI) and this blu-ray.    1) The first and foremost noticeable eye opener are some cropping (missing information) on the sides of the picture of both versions, and vice versa.  Let me explain.  In a large majority of camera shots, either the tops and bottoms, or the sides are missing on the dvd or blu-ray, and vice versa.  In simple film school terms, it is panned and scanned (P&S) differently.  I use the term P&S loosely because as you know it's associated w/ old 4:3 full screen, but the point is that the picture editing, cropping, and zooming are different.  I chose several exact scenes that were not in motion, and I paused at the exact location to compare.  The P&S-ing is regardless of the aspect ratio, 1.79:1 Blu-Ray, 2.35:1 DVD.    2) The 1080i blu picture is only slightly better than the upscaled dvd picture.  Blu-ray picture still contains jitters and artifacts considering a 16 years old (1994) transfer.  Colors at times are not as accurate, so the noticeable improvement is in the definition (resolution), however only slightly.    3) Blu-ray: The sound of the English 2.0 track is very low, while the French 2.0 is loud.  Volume just needs manual adjusting, which is annoying that these 2 language tracks are not standardized (or equalized).    4) Blu-ray contains no extra materials.  DVD contains Trailer.  Hence, you might think I'm keeping both the blu and the dvd versions, yes, I recommend that.  In fact, I'm keeping the VHS as well!  That old clunker is the original, cut (edited), theatrical version.

B003JTHESA|5.0|Iron Maiden's The Final Frontier had me both curious and a little skeptical when I first read some of the reviews. This album confirms the fact that reviews aren't always reliable. I think that a lot of people skimmed through the songs, and maybe played the CD for 8 minutes or so before deciding that it wasn't worth their time. I really think that if these people listened to it a few more times in its entirety, they'd really appreciate what I consider an awesome album by a logic-defying legendary band. The Final Frontier is a triumph of epic length songs, with Maiden's famous three guitar attack in full force on this one. This album just plain rocks, and the perfect starter is Satellite 15...The Final Frontier. This song blew me away with the intro that explodes into the meat of the song. This album has something that's sort of unique to Iron Maiden; it has a far away sound to it, and maiden has taken their metal to new heights and new places with this masterpiece. Change is inevitable when a group ages, and Maiden has transitioned beautifully into a more progressive-sounding band these days. While the lyrics have always been more on the intellectual side throughout their career, they're even more so on this album. This is an album that true Maiden fans will fully appreciate. Some of the highlights: SATELLITE 15...THE FINAL FRONTIER, EL DORADO, COMING HOME, THE ALCHEMIST, THE TALISMAN, and THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING. I particularly love EL DORADO with its blazing guitars. I would also like to add that the production of this album is top-notch, and really brings out their sound and talents. I can tell that the guys really took their time with this one. Bruce is always busy reaching new heights in his 757, but still has Iron Maiden running through his veins, and he sings his heart out on this one. I'm a proud owner of this CD, and you will be too. 10/10
B001USHRCK|4.0|My son was very excited about getting this item, and was thrilled with the detail and the many cool little items (fish, goblets, etc.).  He had a terrific time putting together the smaller items (carriage, food stall, water wheel, etc.).  When it came to constructing the buildings, however, he got a bit overwhelmed with the level of complexity.  The design is elegant, but not especially intuitive, and the diagrams are helpful but can be tough to follow.  Like all Lego structures, the overall construction is only moderately tough: it's easy for pieces to fall off.  Frustrating!

B002X063OC|5.0|I wasn't much of a fan of Lady Gaga's work until about half a year ago, and even then I hadn't purchased her second album. I finally did and I'm pleased to say that it was well worth it. All of the songs on The Fame Monster, while a bit different from the songs on The Fame in some regards, all click together nicely in this album. Notable tracks like Bad Romance, Dance In The Dark, and So Happy I Could Die, blast away at your senses until you're practically left drowning in the beauty of it all. Lady Gaga has managed to balance out dance-pop with her own artistic twist,  producing one of the most beautiful albums of the era. The Fame Monster is sure to keep you dancing.

0385732554|4.0|I had seen this book on many lists these past few years and when I realized it was a dystopian-type novel I just had to add it to my YA-D2 Challenge. I cannot believe I have never read this before. It was a quick read as I was completely pulled into Jonas' world and kept flipping pages to see how this little society truly worked and what would happen.     At first I was trying to pick out what I thought was happening in this utopian society, to figure out if it was truly people choosing to live without certain emotions and differences or if it were more like The Truamn Show. I just couldn't see living a life where everything was picked out for you from your family, your job, your food, how and when to express yourself. How can it be that everyone is content being exactly the same and not being an individual? Yes there are no wars, no issues about race or religion, but what about feeling things such as love and knowing true freedom? I absolutely loved how this book made you question everything.    As we progress in the book and Jonas' is chosen to be the new Receiver for his chosen career path, we learn that only one person holds the memories and emotions of the collective population. Both the pleasure and pain of this job are depicted as The Giver transmits the memories to Jonas, which in turn makes Jonas question everything he is learning and everything he knows is true about his current community as a whole. I loved the passion that Jonas shows for the things he learns, his true compassion towards The Giver and his courage for being brave enough to be different from his peers.    I would have to say the scene that hit me hardest was when Jonas asked his mother \\"Do you love me?\\", because he had just learned what love was that same day. And her reply, though correct for how their society has been raised, just crushes poor Jonas' little soul and shocked me. Her reply, \\"...you used a very generalized word, so meaningless that it's become almost bosolete.\\" And his thoughts about her reply were exactly what I thought after reading her comment: Meaningless? He had never before felt anything as meaningful as the memory [of love].    Without giving away the story, I feel like Jonas is starting to make a change in his community, but we are left hanging at the end with no clear resolution. I suppose that we are left to draw our own conclusions about what truly happens. I did actually see that there are three books to this series that I didn't realize was actually a series in the first place. I will be on the lookout now for Gathering Blue and Messenger.    I also read somewhere that it falls along the same lines of Orwell's 1984 and Huxley's Brave New World, both of which I have not read. I must read these as well as they are based on utopian societies that feel they are offering the perfect communities for their people, yet are keeping them from enjoying the freedoms and passion in life as an individual.
B000001FTJ|5.0|I was fresh out of high school in the early 80s, and really focused on Jazz. One day I was listening to the album \\"you're under arrest\\" by Miles Davis, and my neighbor came over to ask about it. This being the era of cassette tapes, you would often loan records back and forth with people in order to make cassette copies of them. I loaned my neighbor my Miles record and she loaned me Swordfishtrombones . Well, she moved the next day or something , and I never saw that Miles Davis record again, but Swordfishtrombones opened up the world of Tom Waits for me. Thanks, neighbor...I hope you enjoyed the Miles record as much as I enjoy Tom Waits and Swordfishtrombones .<br /><br /> Almost thirty years later, I am still often moved almost to tears by this recording, and can't imagine my life without it . We all have music that has served as the soundtrack to our lives,and this record certainly qualifies for me, in that respect.<br /><br /> I can't imagine my life without it , either in days gone by or in the future. It's really that good ..... at least to me.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|This is a movie that will cause you to realize that nothing is impossible.  Everytime I have been in a situation where I see no way out I remember this awe inspiring story!  There is always a ray of hope.  Andy Defrank's determination and fortitude are truly inspiring. It's long----but every second is worth the wait for this triumph, climatic ending!  This is a movie that lets you know that evil will be stopped and God is in control!  Good men do win in the end! This is my all time favorite movie!!
031603438X|5.0|I loved this book, not so much for the tales of rock and roll excess, but rather for the historical account of life in post World War II England, of Blues music, the music business and the drug culture.  In my mind, this should be a required read for anyone interested in 20th century history.  I don't know how much of the actaual writting was done by Keith, but it seemed real and honest as if it was actually him talking. It is an amazing account of a wild crazy life and a bit inspirational to see how he beat the odds and survived.

B0036EH3X4|5.0|I would be lying if I don't admit I'm biased towards a good review just because I like this series so much.  So bear that in mind.  Also, -BEWARE SPOILERS-<br /><br />\\"We have to go back!\\"  That phrase never had more meaning than the moment I put the fresh-out-of-the-box disc 1 in my blu-ray player and saw that first scene of Jack back in the airplane.  That second I understood everything that Christian Sheppard said to Jack at the end of the series and understood even more the whole\\" transition plane\\"  he called what we know as the side-flashes.  To get this, watch that final tear-jerking shot of Jack's eye closing and then immediately go to the airplane scene...get it? He dies, and then he wakes up in the most significant moment of his life and start meeting this entire people that meant the most in his life.  That's how brilliantly this show is written! After knowing the end, I now get so much more out the story.  Every character's reaction, dialogue and event now hold so much more than before: Charlie's reaction when Jack \\"saves\\" his life, Kate's compassion and empathy toward pregnant Claire, Desmond's complacency about his life, etc, etc.  Yes there was episode less good than others, but that applies to all the previous seasons.  For what is worth, a weak episode of LOST is better than an episode of most other shows right now.<br />No, the last season doesn't answer EVERY question we got through the whole series, but it does give a complete sense of closure.  This show was about all of them, the characters; please remember that when you see Jack entering the church/sanctuary/ecumenical hall to find all of his friends already there. I believe the last 10 minutes are the most beautiful I've seen since the last 5 minutes of \\"Six feet under\\".  They were lost but they found each other and now they can go on.  Don't worry about them... they're ok.<br />And you. Come back to the island. one last time.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|World War II was a very different war in the Pacific than in Europe.  Gone were the familiar places, people who looked like you and the comforts of civilization.  They were replaced by \\"far away places with strange sounding names\\" many lacking even the most basic infrastructure.  If you saw civilians, they bore little resemblance to Americans.  You fought a ferocious enemy that operated under a different set of the rules of war.  This resulted in a war where surrender was all but impossible and mercy was never expected.<br />Drawing heavily on the memories of two Marines, Robert Leckie and Eugene B. Sledge, the HBO miniseries looks at this war.  The ten episodes follow one or both of them in battle and in camp from 1942 to 1946.  Battle is brutal, bloody and deadly, camp is boring.  The combination is deadly producing almost unbearable strain on the men.  The camera never flinches giving us a look at the reality of this war.<br />The acting is excellent.  The writing is sharp while following two of the best books from the theater.  Late in the series, one character says, \\"You will never know what these men have been through.\\"  Thanks to this series, we do have an idea.
B001P9EQH8|2.0|The unit is small, which is nice. However the amount of boost is negligible. I purchased it for my vehicle as my Zen, when played through the Aux in on the factory radio, just doesn't rock.

I have had little luck finding a small pre-amp and this looks like it will fit the bill for that.
0140441409|5.0|This is, by far, the best maditation book I have ever read.<br /><br />This version by Maxwell Staniforth was published in the 60s and is the best (in my opinion). He gives an extensive background on the politics, religion and customs of the Roman Empire in the 1st century. He also shows how Marcus Aurilius fit into the times. His Meditations were written while he was fighting barbarians in what is the present-day Czech Republic<br /><br />Alcoholics Anonymous used this until 1948 as an informal daily meditation book.<br /><br />Marcus Aurilius was one of the most brilliant Roman Emperors, who wrote very humbly about his thoughts concerning Philosophy, ethics and religion.<br /><br />I would recommend this book for anyone.

B0040HJNKC|5.0|The only way this could possibly be better would be if I were in a smoky barroom listening to Buddy play...This is a powerful CD. While other musicians of Buddy's caliber have been content of late to rest on their laurels and put out formulaic, over-produced tracts, this is the real deal. Buddy has no problem deciding what to play and how to play it. Produced and co-written by  musician Tom Hambridge, the songs seamlessly alternate between hard-driving blues and the more tender gospel-like melodies; between the sacred and profane. My only complaint is that it is too short. This is how the blues are played.

B003LL3LHO|4.0|First off, the story was nothing like I thought it was going to be. I was expecting a huge epic conflict around the ruins of the long disowned Human capitol of Ascalon, but what I got was a very entertaining tale of a small band of adventurers and their journey to forget past hatreds in the light of an omnipotent threat that hold the world in fear.<br /><br />The overall formula is nothing new, but it is told in a very entertaining and exciting way with some very likable characters. As a long time Guild Wars fan, I am very happy to see the tale expanded. I highly recommend this book to any GW fan and to any fan of adventure fantasy!
B0038P9LTU|5.0|I will preface this by saying that Rhapsody (of Fire) is probably my favorite band, so I may be a bit biased.    This is one of the those albums that you put in and have to listen to in its correct order, much like most other Rhapsody albums. Unlike other Rhapsody of Fire albums, it does not have an obvious \\"Glorious Fanfare\\" song that characterized their sound for many fans, such as Emerald Sword, Wisdom of the Kings, or Power of the Dragonflame. It is different from previous titles, focusing more on a guitar-oriented sound with occasional symphonic backing rather than relying heavy on the symphonic parts. This makes it the band's most technically intense album to date. I'll admit my first time through, I would have given this only four stars, but after listening to it at greater length, the depth and musicianship in the songs really comes through. Every member of the band is showcased in some way, and the solo in \\"On the Way to Ainor\\" is probably Turilli's best playing to date.    The US release had two bonus tracks, a purely instrumental track called \\"Labyrinth of Madness\\" that blew me away, even the first time, and a re-recording of the second track, \\"Sea of Fate\\" slowed down and made into a ballad which Fabio Lione delivers better than any of his previous works and is my favorite Rhapsody ballad to date.    Overall, it's a spectacular album that, while it may take a while to grow on you, certainly deserves a spot in your collection. 5/5
0452286751|3.0|This book is way too long. Ayn considers her characters far more interesting than they actually are with all kinds of worthless side-stories. The main thrust of the book is interesting, but not critically examined. She hates charity because (she thinks) most of its recipients don't deserve it... but she doesn't consider what to do if Howard Roark were struck with a crippling injury.

We really need to love jesus with all our heart.just watch the movie and see what he did for all of us.
0446563048|5.0|This book should be read by every CEO in every major company in every part of the world. It brings attention to what matters the most, PEOPLE.

055357342X|5.0|Storm of Swords is an action-packed book that packs an emotional whollop, but for me it's where the series takes a turn for the worse. The Red Wedding I have learned to deal with, but I still wonder what Martin was thinking with the (avoiding spoilers) twist at the very end. I think it detracts from the story, though that arc will have to be resolved before I can say for sure. Because this series is pitched as focusing on rival nobles, things of very magical nature have a real burden on them to work, and I'm not sure that the end twist was needed (though it was certainly foreshadowed.)  Jon's story, likewise, goes from interesting to cliched and the story on the Wall is changed fairly irrevocably.<br /><br />That aside, this is an engrossing read. Sandor's story really peaks here, and the events in the North are unexpected and vast. The best part for me is the introduction of Tywin Lannister. He has been a powerful background presence, but in this book we get to see him up close and personal. We also begin to see the transformation of one of the villains into someone else, a sign of Martin's mastery of characterization.<br /><br />This is a good book, but I think it's the weakest in the series.
B003Z9Q4WG|4.0|This is a fantastic value and worth more than the price asked, but the packaging is so unusual that buyers should know about it before purchase:<br />This will NOT fit into your CD shelves, it looks designed for coffee table display and the awkwardness may leave it as seldom used as most coffee table books.<br />The huge box is about 12\\" x 12\\".  Lift the lid to find 4 stacks of 15 CDs in thicker-than-usual cardboard sleeves.  All but a handful of the symphonies are in near-alphabetical order so by looking at the top 4 CDs you can usually know which stack to sort through to find the symphony you want (assuming you went to private school and know your alphabet).  If you actually use this box as often as Bernstein's talent deserves you will have to apply constant effort to avoid CD anarchy.<br />Since the cardboard sleeves, surprisingly, have each CD's works printed in  minuscule type on the side, you have the imperfect option of taking all the CDs out and distributing them on your shelves among your jewel cases composer-by-composer, leaving the empty box on your coffee table.<br /><br />Included is a large 4-language book with excellent photos and essays, but recording data, track listings and timings are only printed on each CD sleeve in small print on hard-to-read white print on black background which discriminates against eyes older than 45 years and should be prohibited under the Americans with Disabilities Act.  The paper used for the book and sleeves is non-glossy so it will absorb and show oil from hands and will not look new after some use.<br /><br />I rather wish Sony had spent less money on magnificent-but-clumsy packaging and used the money for re-mastering or even just to maximize their profit, which might have encouraged them to come out with similar collections of Arturo Toscanini, George Szell, Bruno Walter, or even Eugene Ordinary.<br /><br />I do not have the ear or the equipment to know if the latest re-masterings were used.  Sony just did a 24-bit mastering on the Beethoven cycle; perhaps another amazon reviewer can inform us if that was used here.  The finales of Mahler's Symphonies #2 and #8 are on only one track, which is how they were presented on the newest re-mastering some 2 years back, so the Mahler CDs are probably up to date.<br /><br />Miscellaneous details:  The Berlioz CD includes Bernstein's discussion, (along with the Ives talk on Ives #2 and 3, the only non-Symphony tracks in this set), along with the 1963 recording (a shame - the 1968 recording promised on the Royal Edition release was in fact this same performance).  Similarly, the 1964 Beethoven #7 is included here rather than the late 50's performance that most of us do not have.  The Mahler #2 is the '60's New York Phil.  The Tchaikovsky #4 is the 1975 remake rather than the late '50's that many consider superior, and is the only work here needlessly split onto 2 CDs.<br /><br />Other reviews have details of the contents.  And every Bernstein aficionado already knows that the sound quality is OK-to-excellent, that the performances are good-to-great, and that it's too bad Lenny did not stay with Decca's superior recording engineers rather than switching to Columbia/Sony.<br /><br />This review is not typical, but I hope it is useful.  All things considered, it is a fitting tribute to Bernstein from re-issue producers who clearly meant well, it is an economical way to acquire many superb performances, and it deserves to sell very well.mastering on the Beethoven cycle; perhaps another amazon reviewer can inform us if that was used here.

067182449X|5.0|All I can say is, WOW! I know most everybody has read, or at least heard about Anne Frank's life story, diary, or perhaps just the name. Either way, if you haven't read Frank's Diary, I highly recommend reading it ASAP! If you have, I highly recommend reading it AGAIN as soon as you can! Anne Frank is so strong, brave, and far beyond her years. In the worst of times, she shows the curiousity, and hope of a young child. She remains so positive throughout. There is definitely a reason why her diary is so widely recognized, and taught throughout schools. Everyone can learn a little something, or be more appreciative, thankful, for the life they do have, and freedoms we often take for granted, after reading it. Good for teenages, young adults, and adults of all ages!!
B004BSIJ9Q|5.0|The moment I hit play and allowed this music to fill my car I was drawn to both the music and lyrics. Kanye didn't just put out bull s%&t.

I knew he was talented but it wasn't until this album that I realized he is a genius.
0553582038|5.0|By the time Feast for Crows was released, Martin's fanbase was enormous, loud, and had figured out many of the mysteries he hadn't yet explained. When he split this book, no one was happy about it but the fact that both would be released shortly mitigated the blow. Of course, now we're still hoping for the next volume some 6 years later, so I think a lot of people are negative about Feast for reasons that aren't related to its quality.<br /><br />There are some problems, beginning with the new POV's introduced here, of which there are enough to indicate that Martin is either losing control of the narrative or simply growing bored with it. Some characters (Darkstar) seems ill-advised and out-of-place. And, for me, the use of the hitherto-unmentioned word \\"nuncle\\" began to grate.<br /><br />But I think is a great book, maybe the second best in the series. I loved learning more about Dorne, the Iron Islands, Oldtown, and Braavos. Cersei's POV was illuminating. Brienne's journey through the war-ravaged Riverlands was a rare look at the affects of war in spec fic. And we are finally at a place where it seems that most of the POVs are close to converging.  This book isn't as action-packed as the preceding two, but it's excellent in its more understated way.

B0040JHNZ2|5.0|Trying to categorize Follet's book into one specific genre can be quite a challenge. It has it all, from romance, to action, to warfare, to history, even a little bit of espionage. The character's composition is great and they seem to follow quite well the way of thinking of the people who lived in those countries and in that time period. In fact, I would have liked a couple of more characters, someone representing the Americas (for instance, Argentina was the 7th country in the world in the beginning of the 1910's) but considering that Europe and the US were the countries and cultures where the main aspects of the world's life were defined and established for the next 100 years, the lack of other countries representatives is quite understandable.<br />  Regarding redaction, it has a great balance between a purely descriptive novel and a fast paced \\"Da Vinci Code\\" style novel. Descriptions center on cities and landscapes, and Follet let the characters unfold themselves naturally, trusting us readers to judge ourselves about their actions and attitudes towards life. But, most of all, characters remain human, capable of great good but also of great harm if pushed, and under certain circumstances.<br />  Probably one of the most gripping aspects of the book is that we already know how history will develop... but we don't have a clue of how the characters will respond to this changes. We already knew that Germany was going to loose, but we didn't know how Walter was going to react.<br />  In conclusion, it is a great book I loved it and I can't wait for the sequel to come out.
0061537934|5.0|Maybe i'm an easy sell because i'm a big-time dog lover, but this book was fantastic. Made me laugh, made me cry, told a story on a way I could associate, even taught me to think like a dog. I've never been a big reader. The biggest reason was finding something that could hold my attention. I had a hard time putting this one down.
0553381687|5.0|When I first read this book back in 1999, I admit I was underwhelmed. The world building was uninspired (long seasons? Really?), the plot took a long time to develop, and there so many dull POV's from children. And a main character called \\"Ned,\\" always made me picture Flanders from the Simpsons. I actually almost stopped reading it, but a friend told me to continue and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Looking back on it, my critiques were pretty silly. Not that the above problems were wrong, they just don't matter. As the first in the series, this book is setting the stage for the story to come. Given what happens at the end of this book, I suspect most authors would have started the series with the second book, and told it from a more limited POV (probably Rob). That's kind of Martin's genius. Though many of pieces introduced for this game are lost later in the storm, the story feels more real and is easier to get involved in because you start in the very beginning.<br /><br />Stylistically, the multiple POVs and italicized thoughts works exceptionally well. Many of the \\"post-Martin\\" authors have borrowed this convention, but none have done it as well.<br /><br />With best-selling numbers and the HBO series, this isn't a book that need a lot of hype. But if you, like me, find it slow going, just know that the eventual payoff will be worth it.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|FUN: This game has provided us endless hours of family fun as we've played this with our three sons ages 12, 9, and 7. We are a TV-free family, so we look for games that have high-repeatability. We also purchased the expansion pack so we can play with up to 4 players.    EDUCATIONAL VALUE: Unlike American-based games that seems to be based on the \\"obliterate everyone on the board and make them suffer to the bitter end\\", this game keeps you engaged to the very end. What I like is that fact that there is no one tried-and-true strategy to winning. You have to adapt as the game progresses, which is a great lesson for life. With the trading aspect of the game, one has to look out for their own interest - but as you work to reach your goal you work with others to receive the resources you need while helping them obtain the resources they need. While the goal is to ultimately win at the end, when the end does arrive it's not so much a matter of \\"I won and you are all losers\\" vs \\"While I happened to win, it was fun to play along with you in the process\\".     DURABLE: I've had problems with the edge pieces slightly cupping, which makes it difficult to keep all the hexagons tightly in place, as they slip underneath. I've been able to mostly overcome this by ensuring the side pieces lay flat in the box during storage, and place two packs of the wooden game pieces on top for a little weight to keep them flat.  Also have similar problems with the hexagons, but now store them tightly with a rubber band and no longer have a problem. For the price, it would be desirable if the pieces were made of thicker cardboard/backing board - the kind they used to make the puzzles out of when we were children.    SUMMARY: This game has a high rate of \\"replayability\\" since each game has a new random generated playing board, and I believe is equally suited for children to easily learn as it is for adults.  Highly recommended.
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|This series was done very well, but I still liked how \\"Band of Brothers\\" was produced better...that's why I only gave this 4 stars.  I will definitely watch it again as I am sure there are areas in the series that I missed because there was a lot to absorb.  It initially was difficult to match the characters when they were young men compared to their aged selves as the story line jumped around a bit from character to character.  Bottom line, I would definitely recommend purchasing this series to add to your American History inventory.  I saved $$$ by ordering it through Amazon.com.
0553381695|5.0|This is the second in the series A Song of Ice and Fire, and I think it's hands-down the best. (The general consensus is that book three is the best, but I think this is much better).<br /><br />All the carefully planted character building and plot developments of Game of Thrones bear fruit here, and the result is a really excellent novel, maybe one of the top 5 epic fantasy books ever. Many of the most best arcs of the entire series are here, including Tyrion's turn as Hand, Jon Snow's adventures at north of the Wall, and Arya's struggles in the Riverlands, which represents the apex of the series for me so far<br /><br />This is probably the best fantasy book written by someone not named Tolkien.  If good stories are at all interesting to you, read this book.

Like Da Brat, Lil kim, and Foxy Brown, while i have always loved there music, it never crosses over to radio. I think Nicki has a different plan, so don't hate, ITS ONLY MUSIC. I was never a fan, or did not want to buy this cd, But a friend at work told me to check it out, and to say, I am glad i did, I LOVE IT, If you dont like it, ok. But I think Dear old Nicki might just make her mark....Some people on here said its the worst cd they have ever got....well haters, can you do any better...mmmm. no. ok. Give the girl some some room. Hate is a strong word... and in this day and age, there is way too much of that. Wheres the love? REALLY. give the girl a chance. Way too much hate for one person tryin her best. come on. Its not bad at all. Time will tell. Nicki, I love you and your cd. you go. Hate is hate for a reason. Why? Show them other wise. thanks Nicki for a great cd. Cant to hear the next. Dont change for anyone.

B003TML0VO|4.0|All these other reviews comparing this CD to others is bull.  Let's review this on it's own merits.  Do you like Santana's style?  Do you like his tone?  Do you like his production?  If yes then own this because it is a clean well produced album with GREAT guitar tone and the singers selected add to the product.  Can or should classics be re-made is not in question but this is a satisfying CD.  Also, \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" with India Arie and Yo-Yo Ma is worth the price.

0451450523|5.0|This book has haunted me ever since I first finished it years, and years ago. I'll be driving down the freeway and the slant of sunlight off of a trucks rear window will suddenly remind me of a line in one of these chapters and a fever will grab hold of me all of a sudden and it won't be quelled until I get home and reread that passage, which turns into rereading that chapter which turns into rereading this book. I'm not safe anywhere, I was sick to death recently and the first thing I reached for was this. How do I immunize myself against it? I don't know. I find myself at even a greater loss when I ask myself if I really want to be free.<br /><br />There comes a time in everyone's life, if they are so lucky, where they happen across a book that just turns their life inside out and upside down. This is one such book. To the uninterested observer it appears as a silly book about unicorns that seems like it has no interest in obtaining a demographic beyond that of tween girls and basement nerds. But to these people I express my sorrow that they will live their lives with the incredible loss that is never having read this book.<br /><br />The Last Unicorn is about remembering the past and foreseeing the future and about accepting our losses and defeats when they are handed to us, and it is about learning to treasure the bright spots within them. It is about what it means to posses and to be possessed. Two characters passing through a wood early in the novel debate the existence of unicorns at first jokingly, then heatedly and then at last with a bit of trepidation, sorrow and fear at the passing of the unknown while they were not watching. \\"I wonder if any man before us would have thought his time a good time for unicorns?\\" one of the woodsmen asks and soon we see quite clearly that the answer is, and always will be, a resounding and cold hearted no as our unicorn is put in damp, dark cages both literal and figurative.<br /><br />Not much happens in this book in the traditional story telling sense. The unicorns quest ends rather abruptly by the time we reach the castle and that happens less than half way through the book. After that the characters mill around in a stagnant environment and the battle of wits that any other author might have substituted here as the main course of action is instead replaced by a battle of reflection and remembrance, of memory and time. The main action in this book is not played out in gallant sword fights, daring chases, and grand acts of wizardry (although there is plenty of that, make no mistake at times this can be a very violent and bloody book), but rather the choices and changes the characters go through in their lives.<br /><br />Finally, to speak of the few criticisms directed at the text - without giving too much away, for the second half of the book there is indeed a romance in the pages and some others have spoken about how it lacks a heart gripping quality and to this I'd have to agree. But you have to remember that the romance really isn't meant to be viewed as such and so people seeking a grand romantic adventure will be advised to look elsewhere. The Lady Amalthea throws herself at Liir with an unnatural devotion that quite frankly obliterates all that she is, even admitting to herself that she allows him to construct everything she is as a person and as a result their romance is very light, very lovely but it hasn't been earned at all. And because you can not claim something you haven't gained the right to earn in the end they are the only ones left with nothing to posses.sense.

B000W91RUG|5.0|It seems that CBS has mastered the art of creating witty comedies.  The Big Bang Theory is one of those shows that never seems to get old.  The main characters are two geeks who march to the beat of their own drum and are probably too intelligent for their own good, and the character of Penny serves as a nice dose of \\"normal\\" to balance out all the scientific babble.  The Big Bang Theory and How I Met Your Mother are two of my favorite shows of all time, and Amazon has the best price on the dvd's.

006072448X|5.0|This extraordinarily intense and thought-provoking book takes the form of letters written by the mother of a school shooter to her absent husband. Eva is essentially reliving her entire history with her son in order to come to some kind of understanding as to why he decided to shoot down his classmates in cold blood. And especially, to understand the part she might have played in creating such a monster.    The writing style seems strange, more like a doctoral thesis in English Lit rather than informal letters to a person one knows very well. It put me off a bit at first - who writes letters like that? It wasn't believable. But once I got further into the book and recognized Shriver's expertise with language, I knew it wasn't likely that she would make such an obvious error. I began to wonder if there wasn't a mysterious reason for the strangeness of the letters. That's all I'm going to say about it, except: don't give up on this book because of that.    Speaking of writing style, the immense vocabulary is one of the first things you'll notice. I've read so many books that I rarely encounter an English word I don't know, but in We Need to Talk About Kevin it happened all the time. You'll want to keep a dictionary handy in order to avoid frustration. Reading it on my Kindle was a great way to experience this book, thanks to the instant-access definitions. But there were words that even the Kindle dictionary didn't know, necessitating several detours to the computer. I enjoyed the intellectual stimulation of stretching my vocabulary even after so many decades of reading, so for me that was a plus.    I was thrilled to catch Shriver making a vocabulary error, though, a malapropism (a word I learned in this book): she used \\"pneumonic\\" instead of \\"mnemonic.\\" Although it's probably an error on the the part of whoever transcribed the book for Kindle . . .    I didn't like the narrator at all throughout most of the book, nor did I find her entirely believable. Her self-centeredness seemed too extreme and unyielding to be real. But she and the story were so interesting that it didn't matter. And in the end, I did come to feel some compassion and credulity towards her. As with nearly all aspects of this book - and that is its genius - I go around and around about Kevin's mother. No mother could be so utterly cold and unfeeling towards her own newborn child. Yes, but . . . her feelings read exactly like accounts I've read from real parents of autistic children. Yes, but . . . those parents don't feel that way immediately, only after being subjected to behaviors that feel like dislike and rejection from the child. So maybe . . . she is a sociopath like her son, just a non-violent one. Sociopathy does run in families, after all. Yes, but . . . she does love her daughter. Yes, but . . . maybe hers is just a milder case. Maybe, but . . . if she was capable of any love at all, how could a mother dislike an innocent newborn? No wonder Kevin turned out the way he did. Yes, but . . .    Even though Kevin was an even more extreme character, I found him all too believable. We may question how a very young child could be so truly evil, but I've read accounts of real-life children exactly like him. And like the Columbine shooters Harris and Klebold, Kevin was neither a social outcast (except by choice) nor was he singled out as a victim for bullying.    We know from the beginning what Kevin ended up doing, yet there was still so much suspense in this book that I read it faster than I'd ever have thought possible for such a long book. And there were surprises all the way through to the end.    One thing that puzzled me was Eva's signatures on the letters. They look very crude, like someone trying to write with something not designed for writing, or maybe scratching letters into a wood surface. I'd expect someone like Eva - a highly educated perfectionist whose career is in writing and publishing books - to have beautiful, perfect handwriting. But that anomaly was never explained - did I miss something?    We Need to Talk About Kevin is ultimately a vastly deep and wide-ranging investigation into the questions of what makes a school shooter, and why have school shootings become so \\"trendy\\" in the last couple of decades? Although this is fiction, we aren't given any easy answers - or any answers at all; just a great many possibilities and potential contributing factors. The book raises questions rather than giving answers. Just like real life. In the end, it is disturbingly real.    (500 pages)      Quotes from We Need to Talk About Kevin:    \\"I suppose that's a common conceit, that you've already been so damaged that damage itself, in its totality, makes you safe.\\"    \\"I have to go further back.

Who wants to be loved like that? Given a choice, I might skip the deep blood tie and settle for being liked.

B00005ATZT|4.0|Though I think Ford's performance esp at the beginning is uneven, this is an excellent adventure story. The commentary also is very good.
B003FSTN6Q|5.0|I loved it! It was better than the 2nd-4th seasons. I don't understand why people didn't like it? It was good enough to keep on going and make more seasons but because some people didn't like it, they quit. :(
B0044KU7KU|5.0|love this album. it's very different from their past recordings but definatly still shows their influential undertones. great for old fans and new
B003Z0BSU8|5.0|Let me say right off that Rachmaninov's 3rd Piano Concerto in D Minor is my very favorite of all the four (4) piano concertos that he wrote and let me also say that Leif Ove Andsnes is one of my very favorite concert pianists.   Therefore, there was not any doubt in my mind that I would purchase this 2009 recording of Rachmaninov's 3rd and 4th piano concertos played by Leif Ove Andsnes with the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Antonio Pappino.  I am indeed very glad that I did because Leif Ove and the London Symphony certainly give thrilling performances of both works.     I am not going to try and rate this recording as to where it fits into my\\" favorite list\\" of  the many, many recordings that I own of both the 3rd and 4th concertos by Rachmaninov.  All that will say is that Andsnes really delivers the \\"goods\\".  His performance is thrilling being filled with loads of technical bravado in both concertos and where needed there is a lot of introspection and heartfelt emotion.  I truly loved this recording and have listened to it often.  Plus the sound is great.
B000ZM1MG4|5.0|The DVD about the making of the movie is worth the price of this excellent set. And, except for the music, I think the movie holds up VERY well over time.
B0036EH3WU|5.0|The Box is amazing!..I go crazy about it! :D  ..in Italy was never released anything like this!  ..the only drawback is the packaging..the box must be better protected!!!  ..for the rest, that's all I wanted!!!
B002N5N5LG|5.0|Every episode is so funny. This is an intelligent comedy. Not overly complicated but not fart & poop humor either. Every character has there own charming and entertaining quirks. Alison & Gillian are also pretty cute. I am addicted to this show. I keep watching the DVDs over again.
B003ZHQVJO|5.0|I almost didn't order this cd because of some of the reviews that said this cd wasn't worth it. I do have to say though this cd doesn't have the cussing but Kid Rocks cd is well worth the money. True he has calmed his lyrics down quite a bit but this cd was worth every penny! Great music plus veryfast shipping to top it all off! If you like Kid Rock you'll like this cd!
B000WAEJZ0|4.0|Whitney Houston is a classic.  Before the drugs, before Bobby Brown, she was arguably the greatest singer ever.  This collection is not as extensive as the other Greatest Hits but this is a better lineup of songs.  Highly recommended
B001EN71CW|5.0|Whats left to say about this series that hasn't already been said . Excellent in every Department for a T.V. series and , sad to say the 9 actors have gone on to other T.V. series \\"Castle\\"  , \\"The Cape\\"  and other show and films so what we have is Fan stories and videos as well as a great podcast called \\"The Signal\\"  . Get this blue ray set at this very low price for Dec 2010.
1597801585|5.0|A bang-up story set in a believable, dystopian near future. There are reasons why this book has won so many awards!
B003E1G4AC|4.0|The hub looks great on the desk at my office.  The placement of the USB drives into R2 makes for some interesting conversation though.  Many people have commented that R2 looks like he has a wang once a drive is inserted.  I like that he makes sound when you plug one in, but he makes about 5 different noises each time.  It would have been better if the noises were random & limited to one noise each time you plugged in, rather than 30 seconds of the same 5 noises each time.  Overall it works great & looks good though.
044654759X|5.0|Another great one by Nicholas Sparks! I read a partial summary online, and it sounded pretty amazing. Thought I could get a decent idea of how it was going to go, but it still threw me for a loop! You've definitely got the Nicholas Sparks romance side of it, but there's a good 30 page chunk of sheer suspense at the end, with an amazing twist after you think the surprises are done. Definitely recommending this one to all my friends. I usually recommend that they just go look for it at the library, but this one is well worth the buy! Five stars, Nicholas Sparks. Five stars.
1400049628|2.0|i thought this book was lame.  it was like a guide for wartime boyscouts.  the only good parts were the incident reports from survivors and govt agencies.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|I watched the series of Jeeves & Wooster during the '90s on OPB and loved the subtle humor between the characters.  Having the series means I can watch as many episodes as I want to, back to back.  I am enjoying every minute!
B001IAOEXU|2.0|For FPS games, these provide no use. They simply make tossing stuns and grenades a lot harder, as the one click notion done without these is a lot simpler. A lot of force is involved with more plastic. If you are looking to improve your FPS game, try KontrolFreeks. This might be useful for racers, however.
B00004T6V4|5.0|I have just watched the movie Still Crazy three times in a row and I am so \\"IN LOVE\\" with Bill Nighy, Jimmy Nail and the Strange Fruit band!!!  Sex appeal and Rock & Roll know no age and no boundries.  \\"What Might Have Been\\" and \\"The Flame Still Burns\\" are two songs that should and will go down in Rock & Roll history.     I'm sitting here replaying the bits of these two songs on my Ipod until the soundtrack comes, feeling it in my soul and in my heart.     Rock On!!

B003VIWO8Y|5.0|I have been a long time fan of Megadeth, and particularly Dave Mustaine. But have no fear; this review is without bias. I have a great respect for Dave Mustaine in a way that only guitar players can have respect for a man who plays chops like he does. I believe what Dave allowed the public to learn about him through his memoir was as honest and heartfelt as a person can get. While reading his memoir, I wondered a few times if Dave questioned whether or not he should delete certain scenes, because they may be too ebarrassing or invite too much criticism. I can't tell you how happy I am that so many long awaited questions have been answered.<br /><br />The author did a great job of not only writing a rich presentation, worthy of keeping my interest from front to back, but was able to amazingly convey Dave's personality through the narative and dialogue. While reading, all kinds of emotions surfaced. I laughed (at times hysterically), I felt anger, I felt enthused, and most of all...relieved. You have to read it to understand.<br /><br />I remember the day I read the article that revealed Dave's unfortunate ailment with his left arm. I slumped in my chair and thought, \\"No, this cannot be happening!\\" I knew there was so much more that this man had to offer us, me. I have been playing guitar for twenty years, and there are still rythems I cannot play the way he does, not lead solos, but rythems. That should be a testement to Dave's pure talent.<br /><br />All of this is conveyed in the book. I wish that Metallica fans would read this book for a better understanding of what went down. As I read, I felt like I was reliving the last twenty years. I remember many specific instances wrote about. With this, I have a better sense of clarity. Kudos to the author colaborating with Dave for accuracy and timeline of events that took place. Just when I thought there was nothing more I could learn about Dave Mustaine, I learned I was very wrong.<br /><br />There was only one snafu Isaw in the kindle edition. There was one picture where dave was holding his Jackson flying V, but the caption read that he was holding his Angel Wings model. It was incorrect, but nothing to lose sleep over. Dave's Jackson V's are too well known to Megadeth fans to be missed. Dean now sponsors him.<br /><br />P.S. Keep rocking Dave!
1439152780|5.0|This is a lovely story that reads like a lyrical poem. It reminds me so much of \\"Rebecca\\" by Daphne DuMaurier. The physical reaction that a house like Manderly or a castle like Milderhurst evokes is so similar that the connection is quite apparent. The misunderstanding of people's relationships is apparent and the story drives itself from there. As layer after layer is peeled back, the reader becomes so engrossed until the surprising ending when everything is revealed. A truly wonderous novel that is perfect for a winter read, preferably while it's raining.

B003YFJ5U4|5.0|The book is engaging and well written, although there are a few instances of what appear to be poor editing:  an occasional paragraph that seems out of place, or at least in need of a segue.  The choice of figures seems haphazard at times.  Perhaps the thing I missed the most was a more explicit presentation of the science (formulae) discussed.  Read the Kindle edition: no complaints.
B0042RUMEQ|1.0|This album sucked so bad, I like Nicki's style and her delivery but she doesn't spit that hot fire like most east coast artists from the East Coast have in the past. Roman's Revenge was okay, but if you compare, Lil Kim's album Hardcore with Pink Friday, Hardcore sounds a lot better and Lil Kim was straight RAW with it! Nicki has a lot of talent, this was more like a R&B album, it sucks! I was very disappointed! She will never be on the level of Lil Kim, Foxy, BOSS, Yo-Yo, MCLyte, Rah Digga, etc, this album sucked so bad, it was terrible, I want my money back!
B0041QSZJM|5.0|After Splendor in the Grass, I thought I had bought my last Pink Martini recording. Heck, I though they had probably made their last recording. Luckily, I was wrong on both counts.     This album is a great collection of familiar and not-so-familiar holiday music (not strictly Christmas). I wouldn't say it is the best of its kind, but since I seldom buy this kind of music, it's got to be pretty darn good for me to even consider it. The whole album is done with the same class and unique interpretation as their earlier works (excluding SITG). It's good to know they aren't tapped out in that regard. Two of the tracks didn't make it on to my Zune, but both songs are well done, just not ones I particularly like. I won't skip over them when I am playing the CD in my car.     One of the reasons I seldom buy holiday music is that I only listen to it for about a month out of the year. I have two exceptions in my collection, \\"Christmas Caravan\\" by Squirrel Nut Zippers and \\"It's Christmas, Man\\" by Brave Combo, that I listen to occasionally during the rest of the year. This may be added to that list.    One small quibble is with the packaging. It is all very artsy, but doesn't lie flat when you set it down and will likely look pretty tattered in a year or less.
B003X2O6KW|2.0|I am not feeling the album all like that, I like a few tracks off of it, but it just does not grasp me! I have bought all of Kanye's albums and my favorites were Graduation and Late Registration. My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is weak too me, my favorite track on the album is \\"SO APPALLED!\\" I just think that Kanye gets a lot of exposure and it is all a HYPE! This album is a flop just like Nikki Minaj new album, don't waste yall money for those who haven't listened to it yet, I would suggest burning it from someone or getting a bootleg of it! I have been listening to HIP-HOP for a long time, this album is not HOT!
B003HO54E8|5.0|Wonderful story layered with metaphors on compassion.  It's a great read for kids, and a great reminder for adults.

B002G1YPH0|3.0|Not here to argue about it's cooling capabilities, but if you check out my review of the Zerotherm Core92, you'll see why I'm not all that impressed. Don't get me wrong, it's a great cooler. But the thing is extremely huge. I had to actually remove one of my case's side fans to stick it in (which might be why it doesn't cool as effectively as the zerotherm for me). It's also a pain in the butt to install since you more than likely will have to remove the motherboard.     Honestly, if you're like me and need something a tad smaller, but just as effective, go with this:    http://www.amazon.com/ZEROtherm-Core92-CPU-Cooler/dp/B0032E3DR8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1291209869&sr=1-1    However, if you have anything AMD, stick with this thing. This is pretty much the best cooler you can get for AMD's in my opinion. Intel processors...not so much.
B0042RJWTM|5.0|It is one of the few westerns I never get tired of watching.The broncho riding scene is classic. It is dark and haunting in its story of a vanishing way of life. The choices made by the characters effects the outcome of all. In the end all that remains is Monte and his horse. This is a movie I would love to see on the big screen again and the soudtrack with its theme song is so good. I am so glad it has come out on DVD
006621131X|5.0|Like many other reviewers, I found this work riveting.  Patti's writing is 100% engaging, and the stories are rich in texture and foundational to the Patti Smith career most of us are familiar with.  The production of the book (the paperback edition in my case) is also worth citing.  The placement of photos, the closing pages and the overall packaging are art, too.    When I read this book, I felt enveloped by their stories, Patti and Robert.  I knew something of New York City in that period from reading and a little experience, and Patti's words and her life with Robert opened my eyes to so much more detail and nuance.  This book made a difference in how I feel about life, and that's doesn't happen often enough.
0312600844|5.0|For me, at the risk of seeming trite or cliched, this is a novel first and foremost about the power of love.  Much like the Corrections, the author appears to be showing us that we (and particularly 50-something Americans) are the victims of our imperfect individual and collective pasts only if we chose despair over hope.  In so many words he appears to be saying through the 75 year old Enid's decision to remake herself in the Corrections and in the final chapter of Freedom (with Patty and Walter's positive turn):  \\"Hey you 77 million baby boomers - stop feeling sorry for yourselves and get off your buts.  Sure mistakes were made and you made a few! Turn off your flat screens and reach out positively and stop the vindictiveness we see Americans embracing.  We all make mistakes.  Get real.  Reach out. There is a \\"there there\\" but only if you reach out!!\\"     Franzen delivers this timeless message with a rare wit in a narrative that is entirely relevant to the issues we are all facing, from 9/11 to the economic crisis.   His style in some chapters reminded me of the funniest moments in Joseph Heller or Stanley Bing.  At other times, he shows a sensitivity and mastery of our language that rivals the most poetic moments in Ulysses and yes, even the final pages (yes!).      Sure, I can understand a lot of the criticism thrown at Freedom.  Some of the plot line strains credulity. But hey, it's fiction (and much of what other commentators question has and is occurring)! And yes Walter and Patty Berglund do seem real similar to Alfred and Enid. And Joey in Freedom is a lot like Chip in the Corrections. And once again, the locales are Philly, New York, and the St. Paul area.  So the critics say:  \\"This book lacks originality.\\"  But would the same critics would have chided Joyce for too much focus on Dublin or Faulkner for the same locale and the same denizens  in Mississippi?  Would they  chide Monet for painting too many similar landscapes!  Or: Hey Matisse, what's up withall the hotel room paintings with the same gal in Nice?  Franzen, like all artists, has a  \\"palette\\" and like any artist the same textures will appear.  But that is to be expected.    So don't be distracted by the equal weighting of negative (one star) and positive (five star) reviews.  This is not a Disney production.  I encourage you to read it (as soon as you have completed the Corrections!).

B000BB1MI2|2.0|This movie just wasn't all that great.  It seemed more like an excuse to give Johnny Depp screen time than to actually tell the story.  I'm rather neutral towards the actor, as I am about most actors, the movie itself just really doesn't hold up.  It seems like it was weird for the sakes of being weird without a whole lot to redeem it. Depth was lacking where it was needed, and depth was added in areas that could have been left alone. I did read the book BTW, a long time ago - the whole Willies dad angle could have been left out, it didn't seem like it really added anything to the story.  I'm not one of those people who expects a movie to exactly follow a book, but I am one of those people who expects a movie to come out well.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|I pre-ordered, and it came earlier than promised!    Initial releases never said much about extra footage. I heard rumors from the beginning, and made my husband wait to order.    This is a joy to watch, and all the extra features are fascinating, with several unfinished scenes that didn't make the cut.     I loved how the unfinished extra scenes show how there are several steps to the process....  They also show more of the background story.    Love it, love it, love it!    The only thing I don't like is blu-ray players never keep up with the blu-ray discs, and we get all kinds of pop-ups like with an old computer. A movie should not require memory chips. =(
B004259BMM|5.0|I absolutely love this album.  Keith never seems to disappoint with his amazing guitar work, vocals, and overall collection of songs on this album. This is truly a heartfelt album and one of his most intimate creations yet.  I've sort of become a little bit addicted to listening to it.  The extra songs on the Deluxe version are well worth the the trip to Target, though.  The songs on \\"Get Closer\\" should absolutely rock when Keith is on tour next summer!  No matter what type of music you like, this album is must for any fan of truly great musical talent.
B003X2O6KW|4.0|I thought this album was a very solid album. The only real knock on it is that there was all the confusion about him putting a song each week for fun then this album was supposed to drop then didn't then was renamed then dropped with several songs we were already given. but i think that it is a very solid album. certainly not a 50 cent or trey songz or anything mainstream album, kanye always, especially lately does his own thing. i will say that as much as i like it, it is not 808s but it will be hard to ever match that level of uniqueness again.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|I have watched this show from the beginning (I have been a longstanding soup fan) and I have found its fast paced humor both hilarious and (even though sometimes silly) intuitive. If you have been a fan of 30 Rock or are just looking for a new comedy to watch Community is a rare clever one.
B000003TSP|4.0|I like this album. I prefer Dummy but this is a solid effort. Portishead is just cool music, moody and different.
B001VNB54A|5.0|Hi: Everyone  Well we all know that War is tragic! In this movie it is no different! The American Solders of the Pacific Fight asked to have their story told. This is an epic to be in an attempt to do just that. Did they succeed, well only the men and women that were there can tell us! I know this, my heart bleeds for these men and women in this movie in the same way my heart ways heavy on Veterans Day! I have family who served our country and maybe you do too. The picture quality and sound quality is awesome! The format a little hard to follow, I had to watch twice before I realized there is two chapters on each disc. I highly recommend this film to anyone. If there is small children at home you might want to consider not showing this one. There are some graphic scenes but not too many, just enough to bring reality to your watching. I hope you enjoy, I did.

0385732554|5.0|A review about The Giver  By: Micaela Jazmin Castro Burciaga        One amazing mystery with a touch of  adventure is a book called The Giver. I think that the cover will grab your attention because most of it is black and there is a little light. The Giver was created in the year 1993 by Lois Lowry I think that she made a really good book. This book is totally recommended to 5th graders and/or higher because you would know what you have in your life so far, that it's really good and because I read it in 5th grade.   Well, The Giver is about a boy named Jonas gets assigned the most important job   in the small town he lives in, it's gray to most people, they use bikes, they are scared of air planes, it's a futuristic society and there is no freedom or choice. He figures out hidden secrets that hurt him and change his point of living. He changes for the rest of his life. Well as assured there is always a theme  and this books theme will for sure drive you in and read it, fight for your life and the ones you truly love, and make it the best you can make it where ever you are. Well of course you want to know everything in life like pain, cold , hotness, and other feelings about life and he feels good and bad , but I still don't know  why there is only one giver  but I'm not the author.    My opinion about the book is that it is really , really good and sad enough to cry but with a really good but happy  ending. It's sad because of the really bad things that happen like his dad does to a one of the poor little twins with no fault and the dad has no feelings of his job. The author made it sound so real because of the description. Like when a twin was born and one had to go, Janos's  dad put a needle throw the poor little babies forehead and then the baby to shack, he gets thrown in a box and to the trash. It has a perfect ending because you can feel so happy yet you stay wanting more. It shows why you should appreciate what you have so far. Of course there is something Idon't  like about the book and what I don't like about the book is the killing that goes on to the poor little babies or kids but it makes it better, and there totally needs to be another book.   For sure but I still rate it 4.5 out of 5 total stars. Until there is anther book I would rate it 4.90 out of 5 stars. I hope you can read this amazing book and want more of it to be.

B0043VCPW8|2.0|I agree with the other reviewers, the CD is excellent, and the performance good. BA still has got it.<br /><br />My low rating is due to the so-called deluxe editionm. I can find nothing to differentiate this disc from the $11 edition other than the hefty price tag. The digipack is very simple, hardly worth the extra six bucks. The song listing is the same.<br /><br />Am I missing something?<br /><br />At eleven bucks, I'd be awarding four or five stars. At almost seventeen bucks, this is a two star purchase.
081297381X|3.0|Nassim Taleb's The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable, is a witty and informative narrative that jeers at what people think they know. The funny thing the writer makes note of is that people only seem to know what is going on after it happens. This book is a great read for anyone who enjoys solid high-brow humor, for any investor or history buff actively interested in being proved wrong. Taleb helps readers in discovering the effects of fallacious (and at times pretentious theories) written in hindsight.    The book opens with a moral story of a time when man presumed they knew everything about swans. It was believed that swans only came in white. The image of iconic creatures, the symbol of grace and beauty was suddenly shaken when a black swan was spotted on the Australian continent. Interestingly, Taleb notes that this bird is quite ugly in fact. And ironically, the hideous black swan is as unwelcomed as the ugly truth.    No doubt the finding was enough to shatter the belief in what was till then thought was fact. And here is how Taleb will shatter your beliefs in his book just shy of 300 pages. The moral of this story has many implications. Firstly, that human beings are not omniscient, there is absolutely no way it could be any other way. Also it is strange that people admit this but behave otherwise. Secondly the future is not as static as we would hope. And last there are far too many people who like to say, \\"I told you so,\\" when it is clear they did not. Taleb cleverly uses his simple analogy, without oversimplifying his thoughts about the way economic theory and history are developed. The unexpected presence of the black swan serves as a metaphor of unexpected events that occur in business and politics.    Taleb uses historical events very well to prove his thesis. At times Taleb seemed to treat his thesis like a concrete mantra with an abundance of historical proof. However there was little discussion as to how to avoid being frightened by the scary black swan or how to interpret statistics correctly. Clearly this is not a book for novices; some background knowledge in economics would make the read make more sense. But for the informed, this book is more than appropriate. However to be fair his writing is simplistic and logical, it is the complexity he develops in his ideas and references that may take some effort to understand.    Although the book is concise, entertaining and very challenging, there can be some agitating aspects for the reader. Taleb's repetitiveness can be very frustrating. As an inquisitive and hungry reader it is difficult to be patient with him as he slowly makes his way to his point. Unless you enjoyed Atlas Shrugged, you may want to pass on this book.    Also there were instances where Taleb drifted off and began recounting his own personal experiences and the days of his childhood. This is a hit or miss. At some point his testimonial appears boastful, at other times it is appropriate. Sometimes he uses this to demonstrate the incoherent thinking people exhibit before and after an extreme event. Most notably he speaks of his youth in a turbulent Lebanon, there he either boasts of his heroic efforts as a rebel, or he emphasizes the way people were initially shocked at the demise of a once flourishing Beirut but now spend their time telling anyone who would listen of how they foresaw the civil unrest.       True there are some set-backs in Talebs writing, but his thesis is strong and compelling. He is very persuasive, funny and when he's not wrenching your heart...gives useful insight for any stockbroker. Additionally his logic is flawless because he only assumes one premise: no one knows everything. And who would doubt him?    Life is filled with surprises and Talebs writing is sort of satirical in that way. His historical references are mostly recent and very relevant. He uses them to drive the point home because the study of history could not do so. Taleb throws unexpected andhilarious musings alongside much more serious and demanding material, so please be prepared to laugh harder than you thought you could while actually learning something.    Filled with infectious humor and well written this book is definitely worth reading. However to those who have distaste for humor, my advice is to skip it. Also if you find charisma overwhelming this book may not be for you...no friends of Rand here. But otherwise, I recommend this book for everyone...especially know-it-alls.
0316098337|5.0|This is my first book by this author but won't be my last.  I began reading this before bed one night and next thing I knew it was the wee hours of the morning.  This is one of the better books I have read in a long time.  This story is told from 5 year old Jack's perspective as he live out the only life he has ever known in a small locked room with his mother.  The story is wonderfully told and moving.  A must read!
B001U3Y5XE|4.0|This is a great game, but instead of investing in this game, I recommend purchasing a set of Lego Bricks & More that sells for about $50 and use your imagination.  With these blocks you can still play this game and it requires more imagination-instead of cards suggesting what you make, the child makes their own creation and it's easier to adjust the play time.  For example, instead of a 30-60 minute round, you can adjust the play time based on the time available-a quick round before bed allows the child to make one creation for you to guess in about 10 minutes or everyone can join in for an hour+ session.  Also, this allows the child to play & create alone instead of waiting for \\"someone to play with me\\".  Best of both worlds!
0439023513|5.0|This could have been a book where the rebels overthrow the Capitol with some exciting battle sequences and everyone lives happily ever after. If it was, it would be nowhere as remarkable a book as it is.<br /><br />In the first few chapters, I laughed. In the last few chapters, I cried.<br /><br />After all she's been through, it's no wonder Katniss is having some mental troubles. Ever since her sister's name was called in the Hunger Games -- if not her whole life -- Katniss has had to work to the rhythms and demands of others. In the newest development of her star career, Katniss becomes the Mockingjay, a figurehead for the rebellion, while others die and Peeta is imprisoned in the Capitol. As before, she manages everything with an admirable stalwartness, and though I didn't particularly care for Katniss in the other books, I find myself on her side completely for this one.<br /><br />Katniss is a strong character. It's hard to see her broken.<br /><br />The trilogy completely engrossed me, the last book touched me the most. A couple of my friends who read the trilogy were unsatisfied with the conclusion, but both my sister and I thought it a realistic, interesting... and not wholly unsatisfying ending to such a series.<br /><br />My only complaint is that although I liked the book, I feel some things could have been done better. Katniss, who for the first 2 books succeeds at conquering everything thrown her way, starts to give up. Her condition, and the lack of sympathy from those around her, made me cry. While the character development is impressive, I would have liked to see some sort of revival of Katniss' fighting spirit we rooted for in the beginning, if only in the last few pages.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|Started watching \\"The Tudors\\" through Netflix and finished all 4 seasons in a couple weeks.  Without a doubt, the best series on television. I know, I know, \\"M*A*S*H*,\\" \\"Seinfeld,\\" \\"Friends,\\" \\"The Sopranos,\\" \\"ER.\\" They were all great, but I LOVED this series and it will be the only television series I own on disc once it arrives - can't wait to watch it all over again. AMAZING acting, beautiful costumes, and wonderful sets all combine to (loosely) retell the story of the reign of Henry VIII.  This series sparked a true interest in the Tudors and Plantangenets and I am reading anything I can get my hands on.  This series is a must see.
0439023491|5.0|So you've been through hell and made it out with limbs and most mental facilities in tact. How about round 2?<br /><br />By all rights, after winning the 74th Hunger Games, Katniss should be exempt from further games. However, the 75th Hunger Games is special, it's a Quarter Quell, and things will be different. Once, the number of competitors chosen was doubled. The other time, the Gamemasters had the districts choose their own competitors. This time, the contesters will be chosen from the pool of victors. One boy, one girl. Katniss and Peeta, back in the ring again!<br /><br />Last time she got them both out alive. Her goal was to win. This time, her goal is to keep him alive, but Katniss -- the unwilling symbol for rebellion -- is the one for whom others will sacrifice their lives.<br /><br />Last time, she was facing children who had no other option. This time, her opponents are veterans: ruthless, rebellious, broken. Before entering the ring, the chosen competitors join hands before the cameras, a signal of unification among the Districts unseen since the Games began.<br /><br />Last time, the people were watching an entertaining or horrible game they took for granted. This time, they are seeing their district idols go back into the ring to kill each other off. Katniss and Peeta, celebrity lovebirds, will be torn apart.<br /><br />When the Capitol pushes hard enough, eventually the people will push back.<br /><br />In some aspects, Catching Fire seemed a repeat of book 1, another chance for a cool arena and survival skills -- but, even though I say that, it has completely different vibe. (And the arena IS cool!)
B0034G4OUO|4.0|This movie is very fast paced and filled to the brim with action and suspense. It's almost like a classic Grindhouse film. Dwayne Johnson is back with a vengeance. Known only as Driver, he is released from prison after 10 years and goes on a shooting rampage to avenge the death of his brother. Meanwhile, he is being hunted too by a cop and a hitman. I highly recommend you go FASTER!!!
0439023521|5.0|12 Districts serve 1 Capitol. Every year two children, a boy and a girl, are chosen by drawing from each district to compete in the twisted Capitol Hunger Games. The Hunger Games were designed by the Capitol to keep the Districts in order, as punishment for a District uprising decades before. Only the victor returns home, to supposed glory and improved lifestyle.<br /><br />In Sum: The Capitol makes children kill each other to keep the Districts afraid and distrustful. Don't expect a cheery fantasy.<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen, 16 years old, lives in District 12, the coal-mining district that has had only 1 victor in the history of the Hunger Games. Katniss' father died in a coal-mining accident, causing her mother to have an emotional breakdown, after which Katniss never fully trusted or depended on her, so the person Katniss loves most in the whole world is her little sister Prim. Of all the names in the bowl, it's Prim's name that is called to participate in the 74th Hunger Games. Katniss immediately volunteers to take her sister's place, and so begins her struggle to keep herself alive, and her family safe.<br /><br />Katniss is accompanied to the Capitol by her new mentor, Haymitch, the District 12 victor. She doesn't think he will be much help preparing them for the games, as most of the time he is drunk. There is also the boy chosen from District 12, Peeta, who once helped Katniss when her family was starving. Probably to deal with the fact that, if she intends to win -- and she promised her family she would -- she has to kill Peeta, her emotions boil to strong distrust and she's certain his motives are to manipulate her.<br /><br />Like celebrities, Katniss and the other competitors are given full makeovers and paraded in front of the cameras for the entire Capitol to enjoy. Katniss' stylist and eventual friend, Cinna, has Peeta and Katniss present themselves as a pair instead of enemies, which along with their awesome costumes gets them great publicity. It leads, however, to the necessity of them showing on camera as In Love. For Katniss, this is entirely an act; for Peeta, it may not be.<br /><br />So as if dodging other competitors in the woodland arena, finding water, healing dangerous bites, killing people, and watching companions die isn't enough to deal with, Katniss must also pretend to be in love with someone she inevitably has to kill.<br /><br />The first book is full of excitement, and the series will keep you in constant anticipation that will not end until you've completed the trilogy.

0802798225|5.0|I'll start off by saying this book is more in range for older teens as there are a mixture of sexual content, violence, language, and drugs mentioned throughout in the book.    I thought the story prodigious,    I was completely engulfed with its' awesomeness as it turned out this book wasn't too cliched, unrealistic or typical at all. The story starts and grows with Brittany, an ordinary rich-cheerleader type girl and Alex, a male member of Latino Bloods Gang ...both gradually showing interest in one another. What I liked most about their evolving relationship is how conscious they still were of the real world; the characters felt real, alert, flawed and almost perfect in their own way.    I have to admit at first I told myself I wasn't going to be that interested in this book but I had a bit of trust Elkeles as I have already read leaving paradise before diving into this series. After just passing the first couple of pages, I hadn't realized the day moved three hours or that I had missed an episode of Supernatural.    I didn't feel too bad about that in the end.    Simone Elekeles is nothing like other YA fiction authors, the confidence and originality she gives way is remarkable. She goes out there writing stories that appeal to almost any young adult reader and never fails to exceed in her books... what ever thoughts one might have after reading a book description or observing one of her book cover art, the books always live up to that action, romance, intensity and humor one might be hoping for.    It's as if she goes away from all things heard of and creates a masterpiece to share with us to enjoy. I can't imagine living without reading her books.
B003NFM3JK|1.0|This was without doubt the worst version of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" I've ever seen. Even the cartoon Scrooge McDuck version was better than this.    The presentation of Scrooge was dismal beyond any sense of proportion. The extended chin and nose were so blatently overdone, it was embarrassing. And the development of these features, from childhood to young adult to middle age, was over the top outrageous.    Bob Cratchit and the Ghost of Christmas Past were poorly conceived and presented. The race with the hearse was way to long and is no where within the original story.    Were there any redeeming features? Well yes a couple. The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come was well conceived. Furthermore, the overhead travels across London were well done.    Nonetheless, this version of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" isn't worth the time nor money.
0790740443|5.0|I don't think Kurt Russel had more than a dozen lines in this movie.  Hell I don't think he needed as many as he had.  He kicked a lot of ass and didn't need to say much while doing it.  My kind of society!
B0043GAZYS|5.0|I'm sure I wasn't the only person who was disappointed by Scott Pilgrim vs The World's box-office performance. It never quite found an audience outside of gamers, comic book fans, and anyone into that sort of thing but it still managed to be a very fun movie that was also a good adaptation of the Graphic Novel series (with some changes of course).  Michael Cera and Mary Elizabeth Winstead have great chemistry together and that is only the cherry on top of a great cast of both known and lesser known actors (Alison Pill stands out to me the most as Kim Pine).  So, when the Blu-Ray was announced, I was more than excited to pick it up.  But, how did this cult favorite transfer to Blu-Ray.    Scott Pilgrim vs. The World luckily got a pretty darn good Blu-ray release.  Not only do you get the movie on Blu-Ray, but you also get a DVD copy and a digital copy.  So, if its a movie you'd like to share with friends, its quite easy to do so.  Secondly, the Blu-Ray is filled with tons of features from deleted scenes, to multiple commentary tracks.  You also get lots of documentaries about the making of the film, a blooper reel, and even a short animation taking place before the events of the film.  So you'll be getting your moneys worth.    The movie also sounds very good too.  I didn't find any problems with the audio of the film.  The video quality is good too, but I do recall it not being as nice as the theater.  That isn't to say that it doesn't look good, because it truly does...but I feel like it could have looked much better.    Overall, I was happy with this purchase.  If you were a fan of the movie or the graphic novel series, you can't go wrong with this purchase.  Also, if you pick it up, let your friends borrow the DVD, and spread the word of this good movie.  If you haven't seen this movie, I would still check it out, even if you're not of the above demographic.  Its a great movie and it should get a chance to shine.
1416526242|5.0|Ali's story is a \\"must read\\" for anyone who wants a better  understanding of the Moslem point of view.  This book shows vividly how these beliefs inpact ordinary people first in Somalia and later as refugees in Holland.     The strength and importance of the clans was interesting. Clan  members help each other in all sorts of ways. The help is especially vital in a country where there is no government aid. Of course, the clans also enforce mindless conformity and obedience to traditions. Clans are both a help and a hinderance.    The attitude toward women is so barbaric it is impossible to discuss calmly.    For me two points stand out about Moslem life. One is the absolute certainly that Islam the only religion and everyone else is \\"impure.\\" The second is how violence and cruelty are so ordinary in their lives. Husbands beat their wives, wives beat their children. At one point Ali,s mother almost beats her to death. If a clan member hadn't intervened, Ali never would have been taken to a hospital.    Ali is indeed a brave person to stand up to the pressures she faces and create a life which she chooses - not one which is chosen by clan elders.

In the book, when Bella chose Edward, she had a tearful breakdown over hurting Jacob.  In the movie, she doesn't shed even one tear for the man she supposedly loves.  It's like she broke his heart just went on being happy without a care.     Overall I did enjoy the movie.

1439165645|1.0|In  this breezy account of the travails of an Indian family in Europe the author casts aside plot and characterization for the sake of an enticing culinary journey. The author (or editor) never allows for depth or nuance in the characters because he structures the plot around one fairy tale circumstance after another.  The contrived plot coupled with the frenetic pacing allows the author to conveniently gloss over the imposing linguistic, nationalistic and historic hurdles that both immigrants to Europe and born and bred citizens of these countries must negotiate. Readers deserve more than a rosy portrait of assimilation when we know that prejudice and alienation are the norm even in a more fluid and open nation like America. Due to lack of courage or insight, the author sticks to the safe and accessible topic of cuisine instead of really putting us in the characters' shoes and truly giving us an appreciation for just how far they've journeyed. Such treatment is acceptable for a story in an onboard magazine but does not serve this novel well.
B000E1T5N8|5.0|Rodgers & Hammerstein's THE SOUND OF MUSIC had 1443 performances between 11/16/59 and 6/15/1963. It garnered six Tonys including Best Musical, Actress (Mary Martin) and Featured Actress (Patricia Neway) and was nominated for four more. Robert Wise's 1965 film adaptation eliminates three songs but adds two. IMDB incorrectly reports that Portia Nelson appeared both on stage and in the movie. No original Broadway cast members are in the film.<br /><br />SYNOPSIS--<br />Postulant Maria Rainer is having trouble adjusting to life in a nunnery so Mother Abbess sends her to the estate of Capt. Georg von Trapp where she is to be governess to his seven children. The captain has been embittered since his wife died. He runs his home like a ship and treats the children as its crew: giving them uniforms and whistle commands, strictly allowing no laughter, singing or gaiety.<br /><br />The youngsters fight back by annoying every governess Trapp hires into quitting. Their practical jokes don't work on Maria though. Her pleasant manner and a refusal to maintain unbending discipline soon wins them over. When the captain goes off to visit his baroness girlfriend, Maria uses the opportunity to encourage regular playtime and exploration of beautiful Salzburg. She also teaches her charges how to sing and harmonize.<br /><br />Their father comes home and sees his \\"crew\\" hanging joyously from trees and romping like the children they are. They all clumsily fall out of a rowboat, precipitating a loud fight between Trapp and Maria in which he orders her to leave. His anger quickly dissipates when the children sing for his guests, the Baroness and Max Detweiler. Their lovely harmonies melt Trapp's frozen heart and the visibly moved captain joins their song. He then asks Maria to stay. Max suggests entering the Trapp Family Singers in the prestigious Salzburg Festival and the captain refuses.<br /><br />At an elegant party hosted by Trapp, Maria realizes she's falling in love with him. She leaves for the convent but Mother Abbess sends her back to the children, who are brokenhearted and have come looking for her. Maria learns of Trapp's engagement to the baroness upon her arrival so she prepares to return to the convent for good...<br /><br />Songs in this classic musical are a delight, Austrian scenery more so, its story's always engaging, but best of all is the nuanced Oscar-nominated performance of Miss Andrews (she'd won the previous year for [[ASIN:6304400551 MARY POPPINS]]).<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(7.9) The Sound of Music (1965) - Julie Andrews/Christopher Plummer/Eleanor Parker/Richard Haydn/Peggy Wood/Angela Cartwright (uncredited: Maria von Trapp)ss sends her back to the children, who are brokenhearted and have come looking for her.

B0041OOJNU|2.0|I was excited to listen to Shakira's new album and I thought it was interesting that she \\"went back to her roots.\\" However, this album seems so common and average for someone that usually stands out and has a unique voice. This sounds like any home made CD from someone trying to be the next Latin star. The lyrics themselves are often sexist, sometimes vulgar. I suppose that there is always money in appealing to the lowest common denominator, I just think Shakira is still young enough to not have to do that.

B003V6L94Q|5.0|Typically, an artist or band will release an absolutely fabulous debut CD and it will be followed up by a less than stellar second effort. When I found out ZBB was releasing it's second CD, \\"You Get What You Give,\\" I was a little hesitant to get it. I LOVED \\"The Foundation,\\" and what if this CD didn't quite measure up? \\"As She's Walking Away\\" was getting airplay, and it was okay, but what if that was the only \\"good\\" song on the whole CD??    I decided to take a chance and pre-ordered the CD. In my opinion, this second CD is just as good as their first! There is such a wide array of styles on this CD, and yet, it is so uniquely ZBB. And having both Jimmy Buffet and Alan Jackson - legends in their own genres - speaks volumes of the respect I think these artists have ZBB. Jimmy Buffet - featured on \\"Knee Deep\\" - fits so perfectly with ZBB with the beachy, upbeat feel of the song. And having Alan Jackson featured on \\"As She's Walking Away,\\" a tradition Country voice, and yet his voice blends so well with ZBB - I think this speaks to the band's versatility and the fact they really aren't a \\"specific\\" genre.     I know the radio is giving a lot of play right now to \\"As She's Walking Away,\\" and I really do love Alan Jackson (I'm one of those people who loves Country music), but I think there are so many great songs on this CD! I really wish the radio station would play more of them sooner!    I would say it's to say if one were to play the first 4 songs on this CD either on their way to work or coming home from work, they would soon find themselves in a much, much better mood. These songs are totally upbeat, fun, feel-good, put you in a better place, great sing-along songs! \\"Colder Weather\\" is simply beautiful. And \\"Martin,\\" a ballad sung to his guitar, is so very moving.    Another CD from ZBB that I highly recommend!

B0043A0PXU|2.0|I have been a big fan of Annie Lennox since the Eurythmics, and have also enjoyed her solo career.  I received a copy of \\"A Christmas Cornucopia\\" as a gift.  When I got news of a Annie Lennox Christmas Album I was a bit surprised, but I was looking forward to hearing this album since I remember enjoying listening to her sing \\"Winter Wonderland\\" through the years during the holiday season. I also enjoyed her album of cover songs \\"Medusa\\" in the 90's. I love the sound of Annie's soulful rich matured voice, like you can hear on her 2007 Album \\"SOMD\\" but it does not seem to be a fit for some of the songs on this album since it seems like at times she is over singing, belting, and straining her voice. A certain softness is lacking on \\"A Christmas Cornucopia\\" it remains on one level of pitch throughout most of the album. I want to love and enjoy this album, but have not been able to at this point.  I hope Annie's new contract in the future will lead to a album of new material or cover songs that is more suited for her amazing voice and talent.  Maybe a Blues Album??
0240816250|5.0|Way Beyond Monochrome 2nd edition is more than a simple read and forget.  It is a master reference source for anyone who loves conventional black and white photography.  Ralph Lambrecht and Chris Woodhouse have created a source book that touches everything from photographic theory to photographic fact.  Written for the beginner and advanced photographer, you will find everything you need to conceive and execute a perfect image. Control of both film and paper is discussed in concise and easily understood language.    Now I understand why people made such a big noise about the first edition of Way Beyond Monochrome.  This book has moved into the \\"number one\\" slot in my photographic library and will remain there for a very long time.  I do not see any book on the distant horizon that could come close to this master work.    Buy this book before it goes out of print, you will be happy you did.
B001UV4XFG|4.0|For many years young girls have fantasized of being the damsel in distress. Times due change but the main theme of a young girl needing a knight to come to rescue her continue to infuse themselves into our newest films. In a mix of vampires and werewolves, The Twilight Films have capitalized on bringing a story to the screen that satisfies the girls romanticism of stories known mostly today as fairy tales.      \\"Twilight: Eclipse,\\" which opened last weekend is the third film in a series brought to screen as an adaption of the very popular books written by Stephenie Meyer. Bella, the central character played by Kristen Stewart, continues her relationship with her vampire boyfriend Edward, portrayed by Robert Pattinson. Bella is a self-admitted awkward teenager and her character has more complicated decisions than most teenagers. About to graduate from high school, it's not what college to select that concerns her. Her desire to be a vampire and evolve into a new and strange world is her main desire. Yet, there are battles to be won and hearts to be broken before things resolve. Taylor Lautner returns as Jacob along with all the vampires as well.    \\"Twilight: Eclipse\\" is a fair film on it's own, but for Twilight fans it is the best of the three films. This film has had a special effects upgrade and the story line allows the us to see in the past of the vampires long lives. There are quite a few breaks of humor that sparkle in the mist of such a dark story of even a darker world. Billy Burke, as Bella's father, provides the necessary anchor to make the story effective and he and Kristen Stewart share a few good father/daughter moments.    It is truly a mistake to see this movie without viewing the previous films \\"Twilight\\" and \\"New Moon,\\" which luckily are out on DVD. If you are ready for two hours of vampires, werewolves and more teenage angst than the prom, this is the film for you. And as the Twilight fans already know that this is not the finish for the series offilms. Twilight: Breaking Dawn will be sent to theaters in two parts. Part one to air in 2011 and part two to follow in 2012.

B003ZK58WM|4.0|Ken Follet is a great writer and remains one of my all time favorites.  For those you expecting another Pillars of the Earth, this is not it.  Fall of giants is well written and informative.  I know a lot of the reviews bashed some of his points, but this is historical fiction, it could have happened and there is a good chance that it did..I learned a great deal about WWI and look forward to the next installment.  My only complaint was the kindle price, but that has nothing to do with the writing in the book.
B0021L8V0W|4.0|You would think that having a beautiful, 28 year-old Russian woman caught by the FBI for spying for mother Russia would be the ultimate movie stunt for the release of Angelina Jolie's new film \\"Salt.\\" But the arrest of stunning Anna Chapman was a mere coincidence rolled into a Movie Studio's dream.      But unfortunately, it takes more than that to make a film a big hit. Angelina Jolie plays Evelyn Salt, a CIA operative living in the Washington D.C. On what seems to be an average day, Evelyn's life is turned upside down when a Russian agent defects and declares that Evelyn is a Russian spy poised to kill the visiting Russian President. The rest of the film is one action sequence after another, and Evelyn's devotion to her country seems to be at risk.       What \\"Salt,\\" loses on most though is an audience eager for such a release. For the best comparison, \\"Salt,\\" is a movie depiction of a comic book character without the advantage of having the comic book world anxious to see its story brought to film. Many of the scenes are outlandishly laughable, yet do we laugh when Batman dons his cape or when Superman flies in the air? No, of course not, these stories have been in our culture for years and Evelyn Salt is yet an infant in comparison.       Angelina Jolie does a great job as the central figure and Liev Schreiber continues to prove himself as Salt's CIA partner. If you are eager to see a film with a lot of action with a good cast, this is a great two hour diversion. And if you give it a try, you might find that Evelyn Salt is a character comparable to other comic icons like Wonder Woman, yet with a distinctive flavor of her own.

044024367X|3.0|Another good story here, the only problem, is they are all starting to meld in and the novels are harder to distinguish.  I love the writing, I love the characters, but the plots all seem very familiar.  I still have a few to read to finish the series and catch up....
B002ZG9774|3.0|Once upon a time there was a little girl with a big voice. This little girl named Christina was a lucky girl indeed as she belonged to a very special club. This club helped to show off her beautiful voice and become a star. And as this girl became a young woman she found riches and fame much like the princesses of yesterday. But this girl was not happy with her place in the world. She shed all attributes that made her a star and ventured out to find happiness in being unique and different. This transformation confused her fans and eventually this young girl had no career at all. And though her other club mates found even greater fortune and fame, this girl was lost and having turn her nose up to all those that helped her career along the way - had no one left to help her back to her righteous place in the world.    So, this girl was in need of extra help. But she had already used a genie in a bottle to help her before, and only one hope remained - this girl would pray to her Fairy God Mother. So, this girl, Christina Aguilera, grasped her microphone in hand and gazed deeply into the spot lot and sang her deepest note to bring forth the Fairy God Mother of all pop stars - Cher.    With the release of the film Burlesque, many wonder if the pairing of Cher with Christina Aguilera can give Christina's career a lift. Burlesque is best described as a full feature music video. It is a campy, corny, and a contagiously fun film. Cher fans will be treated as she performs two songs and Stanley Tucci is good compliment to Cher's character as the Burlesque owner.  Julianne Hough (from Dancing with the Stars fame) and Kristen Bell make interesting foes to Aguilera's eagerness to rise to the top of the show. And Cam Gigandet's good looks and charming personality are well fit as Christina's love interest.    All in all, if you like musicals (fans of Chicago will especially like this film) and want a few minutes to escape, Burlesque will not displease you. All others...skip this film you might want to make another choice from the movie theater marquee.

B002ZG981E|5.0|Think back to your early youth. The most exciting trip was to the local amusement park. The candy, the people in costumes and of course the rides. But we learned quickly that the best rides required an \\"E\\" ticket and of course, there were never enough \\"E\\" tickets for the day.      As adults we look to more intellectual pursuits. We read books, travel to distant lands, and on occasion we endeavor to find something new and exciting at the movies. But more often than not, we find that films from Hollywood utterly disappoint us with plots that have been rehashed from hundreds of other films or insult us with vulgar comedies that are churned out on a regular basis.      \\"Inception,\\" a new film from Christopher Nolan, the director of \\"The Dark Knight,\\" is one rare instance when Hollywood has gotten it right. The film has a tightly woven script (also penned by Nolan) that allows the viewer to enter a world of espionage with a clever twist. \\"Inception,\\" has been advertised as a film similar to \\"The Matrix,\\" and here to set the record straight: it is not. It is a much better movie than any of the Matrix films, which tend to be too convoluted for any true enjoyment. \\"Inception,\\" remains unique without reaching too far beyond the boundary of imagination.      Starring Leonardo DiCaprio and \\"Juno's\\" Ellen Page, the film depicts a world in which even your deepest secrets are not save. The new criminal of this world enters into your mind during dream-state in order to steal from you or even implant an idea that could change the world. But how safe is this new form of theft? DiCaprio's character finds that his new world of dreams and reality often are difficult to tell apart. And that like all new technology, a simpler way of life must be abandoned to fully embrace the new one.      Christopher Nolan's job as director and writer are spot on. His world of reality intermixed with dreams have stunning visual effects that even out weigh those in \\"The Dark Knight.\\" Out of the supporting cast, most impressive are Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ken Watanabe. The only disappointing part of the film is the bad casting of Marion Cotillard and the annoying insertion of the song \\"La vie en rose.\\"      Overall, \\"Inception,\\" is the best film of the year so far. Being released among the summer it would be shameful if it is not remember for award season. So at last film lovers, it's time to rejoice! It appears that there may still be one more \\"E\\" ticket left in our book.

B002ZG99NG|5.0|It seems that most of us grow up with some version of the family business. Hollywood in itself is a prime example. The Barrymore name has been ever present as long as making movies has been a business. As a child is raised into the family business there comes the time to make the ultimate decision. Do you rebel and become something else? Or do you find comfort in the continuation of way of life? But what is a person to do if there is no way to rebel from the family business without dire consequences.    This is the theme explored in Ben Affleck's new film The Town. Ben directed, co-wrote the screenplay adaption and stars in this film about the most dangerous family business: crime. Ben's character, Doug MacRay, is a crook. His one chance to make a difference in his life by being drafted to play professional hockey was stopped short by his own cocky behavior. Left to live in a crime-ridden area of Boston, nothing was left to do, but go into the family business.    Doug belongs to a crew that orchestrates high stakes robberies in return for great riches. But this crew belongs to the old man that Doug's father worked for and with his father in prison for the remainder of his life, Doug knows that it is only time before he will be joining dad in the pen. It's obvious that Doug is the brain of the crew and his best friend James, played perfectly by Jeremy Renner, is the hot-tempered wild card. After Claire, the witness of one heist gets too close, Doug starts following her to make sure that she doesn't know too much. He moves in to acquaint himself with her and a very touching romance develops between the two. Claire is unaware that this man that appears to be a gentle young man is the same masked man that robbed her bank and scared her to the core.    It's obvious that once Doug and Claire become close that Doug is planning to leave. Only one problem: you don't just quit this family business. With his life in danger from his own boss and the FBI closing in, and his unpredictable friend, Doug finds it hard to manipulate the situation to his advantage. Just when his plan is underway, Claire finds out his true identity and a girl from the neighborhood, a drug addict named Krista becomes too talkative, just all may be lost.    But Doug's dream of a new life and a fresh start with the woman he loves propels him to complete his most dangerous job, and find a way to escape the hold his home town has on him. The rest of the film plays out unpredictable in a smart and intriguing way. Perhaps, for a few of those who have gone down the wrong path, a new and more pure path awaits.    Ben Affleck shines on many levels with this film. His acting along with his cast mates is well executed and all the characters are believable. The script, adapted from the book \\"The Prince of Thieves,\\" by Chuck Hogan is craftily adapted by Affleck, Peter Craig and Aaron Stockard.  The story is well paced and Affleck's direction adds another depth of realism to the film. This is not Affleck's first turn as Director, his film Gone Baby Gone was one of 2007's best film.    This is a great film and should not be missed. I predict that Ben Affleck is on the path of being one of Hollywood's best directors and will have a long presence in Hollywood. His directing method is reminiscent of Clint Eastwood's work. For those of you who have not seen Gone Baby Gone, give the DVD a try, you will not be disappointed.    The Buzz: When award season comes around, I don't think The Town will garner any attention. If it does, I see a nomination for best adapted screenplay and /or a nomination to Jeremy Renner for best supporting actor.

B003X2O6KW|4.0|This album could have been a classic if he would have included the free songs you can download on Defjam's website. its like maybe 4 songs on there that didn't make the album but they are all fire!!! The songs aren't mixed well, so I was hoping they would turn up on the album with full quality. But the songs that did make the album are hot. its a concept album but I wouldn't say its a album I'll be able to listen to all seasons, its a wintertime Hip-HOP album, With all that said its waaaaay better than the crap out now

B003J27WFW|5.0|I was a huge Rush fan in high school and college. I haven't listened to them much in many years. Watching this movie filled me with joy, and inspired me to start listening to the music I used to love again. Now I know why I used to like Rush so much...Because they are AWESOME. They are the nicest, most talented, most honest three guys to ever put out a mere 14 platinum and 24 gold albums. And they've still got it!
B004BSIJ9Q|5.0|The album is a must have.  His beats are sick.  I love Kayne's creativity always finding ways to reinvent himself.  He has true talent and  R.E.S.P.E.C.T is due to this album.

0307454541|5.0|The book was interesting and fresh.  The delivery style was, of course, a diversion from the norm, since the author was from Sweeden.  I had difficulty putting the book down!  Sadly, there will be no more after the third book.
B003L77GRO|5.0|This is not a complete review of season 5 because it's not over yet, but I had to post this any way. Every time I think this show can't get any better....they prove me wrong. Season 5 is heading for a total bloodbath ending. There are a couple story lines that are heading towards a bloody conclusion in the finale.  They really upped the ante  with the SCUMBAG \\"villians\\" this season. Jonny Miller is the sleazy inspirational speaker , Jordan Chase, with his entourage of serial killing childhood friends. He is the MOST hatable villain yet in 5 seasons.  Peter Weller is great as the dirty private detective who was working for Quinn. But season 5 belongs to Julia Stiles......  I was never a big fan of hers (except for 10 Things I Hate About You)...but she has been AWESOME and totally believable as the one surviving \\"victim\\" of Jordan Chase's psycho mob. Dexter saves her and befriends her and together they start to wipe out Jordan Chase's mob. I don't know how this is gonna all end....but I can't wait for Sunday nights !!
B00005JLCI|5.0|Kenneth Branagh's version of the entire play of Shakespeare's greatest play, Hamlet, is magnificently set to film in this wonderful film.  With pageantry and costume and stage with which to set a play, combined with cinematography, acting, and directing and a bit of egotistical self perpetuating glee, we have a play!  A movie, rather, set in a much more modernistic stage as could never been conceived by the Bard.  However, I am happy with the film.  It is a rendition that is faithful to the Bard, in that the whole play is presented, word for word, rather than be edited.  How can one edit the greatest author in the English language?  Granted.<br /><br />I also love the acting by Branagh, Brian Blessed, Derek Jacobi, and many others.  The cameos by Jack Lemmon, Robin Williams, Gerard Depardieu, and even comedic actor Billy Crystal are welcome and fun.<br /><br />All in all, Hamlet 1996 is a great movie, and the DVD (two disc), is magnificent.<br /><br />by<br /><br />James P. Zaworski
B0043VCPW8|4.0|The music is great, but what makes this edition cost $5 more than the non-Deluxe edition? Other than that one issue it is a great CD. I hope you were fortunate enough to see him on this tour.
B0026OR2PE|5.0|So far this is the most `dog-eared' and marked up eBook I have read!  The author has really done his homework on this one.  There are plenty of facts to refute many of the myths that are commonly shared and believed regarding innovation.  The old saying about genius being 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration is brought to life by the many examples he gives.    In the not too distant past most jobs or tasks had a production focus while today there are more and more that have a knowledge focus (or pick the term you like).  This has brought a change from trying to do the same thing better over time to a point where it often seems that we never do quite the same thing twice.  To be more successful in this new world it would be very nice to have a recipe for success, unfortunately there isn't one.    What you will get out of this book is a reality check to counteract many of the myths that exist around the magic of innovation and progress.  While it is not be a recipe you can follow it will teach you some patterns that you can follow to better prepare yourself for the enlightening moments that may lead to great breakthroughs for you.    In what is maybe the closest thing to a map you will be able to follow chapter 11 includes a section titled \\"The simple plan\\".  The author says \\"If you picked up this book because you want to not only find ideas but bring them to reality, this is for you.\\"  Three of the points that he identifies here are: 1) get started doing something; 2) don't get too focused on innovation solve a problem; and 3) be happy when you make a mistake, you are learning and growing.    I have already bought extra copies of this book to give to friends, clients and co-workers.  I know several of them will really appreciate it and I'll be looking forward to discussing it with them and working with them after they have read it!
B00005JNS0|5.0|My grandson loves this movie so therefore I am buying him another DVD for when the one he has wears out from him watching it so often.
B003VQM2M4|5.0|I find the album like a fine wine - it'll eventually grow on you over time. It is a challenging album and might be not for everyones pallet but it will last the distance where you're able to listen to it in 5 years and it won't sound aged when compared to most musicians these days. I know that in 5 years I'll be listening to it and still find it as fresh as the day I purchased it just as I enjoy 'No more shall we part' from 2001 and find it as fresh as the first time I heard it.    For the naysayers, if you come into listening to any music with preconceived notions then you're going to be disappointed - listen to it with no expectations and you won't be disappointed. Nick Cave as much about the music as he is about the lyrics - if you're going into expecting some bass thumping beat that'll carry you off with little regards for the lyrical content then maybe this artist isn't for you - there is more to the artist than what you hear on the surface.
B003X2O6KW|5.0|I was worried with the last cd '808'.  I did not like the last CD, and thought he may had lost it.   I am very happy with this CD, and worth the purchase.  Favorites (Monster, Runaway, Dark Fantasy).  Great Production, good words, good guest = Another hit CD.
B0007XAWB2|5.0|Another reviewer has stated that the Aubrey/Maturin novels are a \\"fine companion\\" to the Hornblower novels.  Not so.  The A/M novels are so much better.  The characters are much more realistically drawn, and so much more interesting.  The adventures of A/M are just more entertaining and more creatively written.  I am on my third reading of the entire set, and I heartily recommend starting with the first and reading them all back-to-back.  It is true that the novels together really make one whacking huge novel, and it is hard to put any of them down.  It is also true that some may find the seagoing terminology a little heavy-going, but keep reading--the next time you are at sea, if your frigate's masts go by the board in a big blow, you'll know how to step a new mast.  Or if your ship strikes, you'll know how to kedge her off.    The only problem with the A/M novels is that about a third of the way through the set, you will catch yourself talking like a sailor.  I teach college English and strolled into class one day:  \\"Silence, fore and aft!  Mr. Smith, clap onto these papers and pass them out for me.  Bear a hand!  Bear a hand!  Pass the word for Mr. Jones!\\"

1439107955|5.0|In all honesty, I am half-way through the book now, but I had to add to all the supportive reviews here on Amazon...      In short, the book offers a behind-the-scenes view of medical research on cancer, going back centuries with the earliest theories and traditions and moving up to modern times.  The successes and failures are told from the perspective of the people who were there, and the scenes that the author paints are arresting and informative.  All the while, the author offers brief glimpses of his interactions with his patients in recent years, and you find yourself (at least I did) rooting for them to beat this horrible disease.  It's simply amazing how well he is able to tell this story so that anyone can understand the important twists and turns of the battle.  Even some of the more esoteric statistical analyses are explained in a way that most folks can easily digest the material.     The only downside is that some sections will send you into absolute paranoia if you have any hypochondriacal tendencies!  His depictions of disease processes and symptom profiles are unnerving, but are important in explaining the motivations and thought processes of the major characters.  If you are a hypochondriac, I seriously recommend avoiding this one!  Otherwise, this could possibly be the best nonfiction book of 2010 and it's not to be missed.
B003DZX44I|5.0|By now everyone has, or should have, seen Beauty and the Beast, so I won't comment on the film, however the transfer to Blu-Ray is stunning, not only the picture but the sound, the sound is far clearer and has more dynamic range than the DVD, the picture is among the best transfers Disney has done, which means flawless, enjoy.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I can't tell the number of times I have seen this movie. I own the 40th anniversary DVD edition and I was sure nothing could top it. Well, something has. This transfer to Blu ray is so beautiful it makes me want to cry! I'm truly seeing it for the first time! I've discovered things i didn't even know were there. Every mark etched on the walls and floors of the abby, every thread on the costumes fabric, the leaves on the trees, I could go on. People responsible for this transfer: Thank you! You've given me a new movie to enjoy and share for years to come!
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I absolutly LOVE this series! I have read all of the sookie stackhouse books. It was so amazing to see them come to life!
1401323820|4.0|this book has a great story line but is somewhat digressed because of the slightly-better-than-mediocre writing. overall a good book.
B00005M989|5.0|\\"The Very Best Of Prince\\" is an excellent single disc compilation of tracks recorded by the most innovative performer/recording artist since Jimi Hendrix and/or Sly Stone! O.K. if you're not a Prince fan this may be just a little bit over the top. On the other hand, if you're not a Prince fan, you probably wouldn't be reading this page. Anyway, this collection takes you from Prince's first big 'hit' (\\"I Wanna Be Your Lover\\") through \\"1999\\", \\"Purple Rain\\", \\"Sign 'O' The Times\\" and \\"Diamonds And Pearls\\" chronologically and ends with the underated masterpiece \\"Money Don't Matter 2Night\\". Of course, it is virtually impossible to compile ALL of the best of Prince's recordings into a single disc CD (if it were possible, it wouldn't be Prince!) but to be honest Warner Bros. did a pretty good job putting this one together. If you're a casual or fairly 'new' Prince fan this collection is highly recommended.
0312330537|2.0|This book consists of a series of episodes describing aspects of India life.  Some of the episodes are very interesting.  Unfortunately, before and after each episode is a long section of purple prose.  This book is worth getting only if you are willing to skip over the many sections of very bad writing, reading only about half the book.
B003YBNREI|3.0|\\"World Gone Crazy\\" is the first DB studio Cd in nine years. It was produced by long-time DB producer Ted Templeman.<br /><br />This review is based on the shorter version of the cd (no bonus tracks). The cd has great sound and feel to it and includes what DB fans expect from the group: soulful singing and interesting if not catchy melodies. Tom Johnston wrote the majority of the songs with Pat Simmons contributing 4 tracks. Johnston's best, oddly enough, is the last song on the cd \\"Law Dogs.\\" The other songs he contributes are decent songs but not particularily strong (one of them - \\"Young Man's Game\\" sounds too much like Bob Seger's \\"Old Time Rock n Roll\\"). Writing with Ted Templeman, the 4 songs contributed by Pat Simmons are all strong. On two of them he tastefully incorporates Willie Nelson and Michael McDonald into the mix. His songs are arguably some of the best songs he has ever produced.<br /><br />John McFee's slide work is featured throughout the cd and is excellent. Curious why no writing credits for him.<br /><br />The more I listen to the cd the more I enjoy it. I would rate this cd slightly below the previous cd \\"Sibling Rivalry\\". Johnston's songs on the aforementioned were stronger.<br /><br />Overall, I would give it a recommend. Definitely stronger than the recent release by Heart (\\"Red Velvet Car\\").

B003JTHXOK|4.0|I purchased this book based on its listing on the NY Times Bestseller list.  By the end of the second chapter, I could tell where this was going, and felt it was a \\"chic book\\" - pardon the term.  As one reviewer said, this is basically a rip off of the movie \\"Sleeping With the Enemy.\\" I began thinking of this movie about 30 pages in. It's been done before: Girl has abusive past, Girl escapes to small town, Girl meets new man, etc.    However - Sparks' writing style and approach to this theme is so good that I found this book a real page turner, despite a certain amount of predictability.  I also liked the ending very much, which has a slight twist.  If you're looking for a fun, engaging read that you can knock off in a couple of nights this is a good choice.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|Was concerned due to warnings of HDMI 1.2 vs 1.3 etc etc, but works fine, with all my devices, computers, etc.
B0042816YK|5.0|The average review refers to Eat, Pray, Love (book and movie) as nothing more than a tale of a women's mid life crisis.   Definitely not for everyone -  if you are unable to relate to the characters you may not appreciate the intended message.  I strongly suggest reading the book before viewing the movie.   There is not enough time in the movie to fully define each character and I think Liz does that very well in the book.  As a fan of the book, I was concerned the movie would exploit the romance and compromise the message.   Not the case, it is a delightful story that I hope will inspire many to evaluate life and embrace it's many possibilities.

B00004BZ16|5.0|It wasn't until I listened to all The Clash's albums in order, one after another, that I appreciated London Calling. It came right after an album that started strong until it descended into a series sour lectures from Joe Strummer on what all the new punks were doing (crazy kids!) that play even worse when you actually READ the lyrics. After this, The Clash just goes out and creates a sprawling but disciplined double-album masterpiece that is strong on all the basics--the songwriting and musicianship are just top notch, and everything is just so polished, but not to the extent of being airless or unfun. A proper masterpiece.    Sandinista! is often superficially compared to London Calling. Both albums feature a diverse set of experiments in genre-mixing, but other than that they're opposites. London Calling exudes control, tunefulness, and even stability in a way (despite the album's apocalyptic touches). Sandinista! is the opposite: where London Calling is controlled, Sandinista! is out of control. Where London Calling couches its politics in tasteful and tongue-in-cheek contexts (You don't need the laundry, you can take it to the vet!), Sandinista! puts all of it out there plainly and baldly. Where London Calling is cool, Sandinista! is pulsating with white-hot energy. And so on. The closer the examination gets, the more it becomes clear that this improvised, sometimes shrugged-off, dramatic effort is not a case of aping London Calling with diminishing returns, but rather a deliberate departure by the group to try to find a new way of expressing themselves to keep from descending into staleness (as the latter half of Give 'Em Enough Rope threatened to do).    Of this album's flaws enough has been said already. Too long, too dense, not enough material to justify the length, would have played great as a double-album or even an LP. Some of it is even true. By my count there are only really 2.5 albums worth of viable material here out of the original three, what between the five final tedious dub tracks and the worthless \\"Mensforth Hill\\" (which happens to be \\"Something About England\\" played backward, obvious filler), and even that 2.5 is quite a bit to absorb. The process of recording the album led to something a lot less consistently great than London Calling. It's hard to justify calling it the better album, because that's just not true. But it's long been my favorite because, despite the occasional misses (\\"Crooked Beat\\" and \\"Equalizer\\" for example) and other songs where the musical concepts just don't quite cohere right, the times when it hits are simply astonishing. A song like \\"One More Time\\", which (probably intentionally) evokes Elvis's \\"In The Ghetto\\", could easily have suffered from the well-meaning, sincere condescension that has made Elvis's effort something of an embarrassment, but Strummer avoids the pitfalls and instead the song--a forthright wail over inner-city poverty--becomes a powerful anthem that has respect for its subjects. \\"The Call Up\\" is another example of pure Clash bliss, a vaguely funky number with very direct lyrics that someone with less formidable vocal skills than Joe Strummer would have botched badly (just imagine what Bono would do with a song about young boys going off to war!), but Strummer's lyrics key into the emotions of fathers and sons in a way that makes it resonant instead of preachy. There are plenty of other examples, but it's hard to see these songs as anything other than triumphs of the approach the Clash took to this album: the album thrives on spontaneous, found emotion, and packaging all that up in the London Calling fashion would have been counterproductive. Other highlights include: \\"Charlie Don't Surf\\", a surf-and-sitar tune that references Apocalypse Now and just proves how cool these guys were; \\"Police On My Back\\", which isn't an original Clash tune but it just rocks so hard; \\"Magnificent Seven\\", in which Strummer raps well before it's cool, and so many more.    All in all,this is an album that even the most charitable assessment must admit has some flaws. But it has some moments that hit home harder than anything else The Clash ever did, and even with the filler it's never not a highly rewarding listen.
B00001IVOR|3.0|Another \\"Not as good as the first album\\". Seems common dont it? This album came out after WuTang had gotten fame and money and as a result of that the quality of the product goes down, seems most hiphop acts are that way. If you like hiphop you probably like the rawness of the music, you like people talking about coming from an underdog situation and doing what they have to do to live and deal with all the crap that goes along with that. Once a MC/Rapper makes it there is no more rawness of the struggle, its all about poppin bubbly and tight whips and all that garbage. Fans of WuTang and other such acts arnt into that Bubbly up in the club garbage. Though WuTang doesnt go that far off into commericalism you can tell theres a change with this album. There are a few decent tracks on here but overall not a must have. There are a lot of other WuTang, not WuTang Clan, albums that are better then this. And if RZA said this album didnt do as well because it wasnt geared towards white people thats a cop out.
B003ZVJFFM|5.0|This story is a classic and has been done to death in both live action and animated versions. I am a stalwart fan of the story though and of course gave this version a go ...... I mean it's Disney, how bad could it be? So there I am not expecting too much only to find that this is the definitive version for all those that love this time honoured story. It is visually beautiful and not a little disturbing that you have to keep reminding yourself that the characters are computer generated, especially Scrooge himself, brilliantly voiced by Jim Carrey. In fact, it has a stellar voice cast including Gary Oldman, Bob Hoskins and my personal favourite, Colin Firth. It is as faithful to the original tale as any I have seen and will leave you feeling good and really, isn't that what you want out of a Christmas movie.  A word of caution to parents of young children though, say five and under, some of the imagery could lead to Christmas nightmares rather than Christmas dreams.

B004132HZS|5.0|I run BluntReview's website and there's a full review there as well:<br />The BBC's three-movie resurrection of Sherlock Holmes has made a sort of thunder across the Atlantic. This brilliant update of Holmes will please aficionados, and, perhaps, make the Victorian-phobe electronics culture dip in.<br /><br />Sherlock has a website, Watson a blog. Yet, Sir Conan Doyle's lads - and stories - have everything they need. There are even nods through out the films to the original stories. You can tell (feel) the creators love Holmes as much as his followers.<br /><br />This DVD has the three films in what one hopes is a first season to be followed by many more. With the films, you get the pilot that got the producers the high-production-value nod from BBC, and a doc on how they went about updating Holmes and Watson for the 21st Century. They've properly de-fogged him, but added a bit of mystery, as you watch in wonder (if you know the works), how they've adapted the tales, and characters.<br /><br />Study in Pink is the first film. The pilot on the DVD is Study in Pink as well - with uncanny Dr. Who music...hmm.TIP: Watch the pilot after the high-end production. In fact, I suggest viewing the three films then the doc, then the pilot. Layer the tastes!<br /><br />As I was typing...SIP introduces us to Watson, and Holmes. Holmes is asked by Lestrade to help on an odd bit of suicides that have gripped Londontown. Folks without a worry (it seems) are committing suicide, in random places, in the very same manner - and they do not have any connections, that the police can find.Enter Holmes (Benedict Cumberbatch). He's a tall, eccentric fellow who like to store severed heads, and whip cadavers in his spare time to further his deductive skills. This is just the sort of thing that gets him going.<br /><br />Just as he's to jump into the investigation, an acquaintance has introduced him to Watson (Martin Freeman). They may share a central London flat - over at 221B Baker.<br /><br />Faster then you can say \\"How are they gonna work in a deerstalker?\\" the duo take on a clever killer and Sherlock and Watson appear to have always been here - now. You may well read their web-thingies daily via RSS.<br /><br />Next, comes The Blinded Banker. The way they've spun the tale - I think - of The Dancing Men to fit into the current era is magical. If it's not that update, it's still freakin' brilliant; all ciphers and foreign drug smugglers. Watson gets a gal pal, and Sherlock manipulates another.<br /><br />This one's very much going to thrill mystery viewers of any sorts. There's just a m&eacute;lange of parts that puff up into a hearty stew of viewing; rich and robust.<br /><br />Finally there is The Great Game. Ah, missing treaty papers do smoothly reshape into missile plans, sadly. War is the same in any century.<br /><br />We get to meet Mycroft (Mark \\"co-creator\\" Gatiss) and Moriaty (whose name I confess I couldn't catch within the speeding credits - sorry sir. It's the season's cliff hanger and it should leave you sufficiently stunned - and praying there's another season to come!<br /><br />The reason Sherlock works is two-fold really. The casting of Martin Freeman and Benedict Cumberbatch is spot on. It need to be. This is a bromance people take very seriously. The players need to be quite spectacular to work. They do, it does...<br /><br />Freeman is known (here in USA at least) for comedy delivered with that subtle British \\"thing\\" they do...Freeman's got that everyman look that director's love. But, he works his face like a concert pianist (immediately order the under-loved, absolutely hilarious, \\"The Robinsons\\" for a visual lecture on acting with the face). Little remarks wash across, and the watcher can read his character's soul. The man's amazing frankly.<br /><br />Not too shabby is the lad beside him either. Benedict Cumberbatch, for all his manly looks, can not escape his deep DNA. He looks as though he's walked off a fox hunt, bullied the stable keeper and could do those fancy ball dances so \\"in\\" back in 1890. Hell, even his name is a tad pompous. That said, he is scruffed up a bit here (really just the hair) and is perfect for the eccentric genius.<br /><br />The two have a chemistry that is rarely found proper these days. And, they are both swell on the eyes. Not Guy Ritchie's ass-biting version, which had the beautiful Jude Law and Robert Downey Jr., swell, but the man-loving among us will get it...<br /><br />Then there's the two who bring us the update themselves....Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat. They are clever Dr. Who sorts to begin with. But, honestly, they've pulled off a remarkable feat here. Sherlock is like a sacred character to many of us. There's an assumed brilliance, mixed with a bit of arrogance. Mix the two improperly, and you've got a jerk. The team behind this project mixed like mixologists at a contest for the best bar tenders of the world. The result is a cocktail of awe.<br /><br />Then there's the London they've placed Watson and Sherlock in. It's 100% now. And they use the now in everyway. At each moment you know, this Sherlock is part of the modern city, and the modern technology. He uses the apps on his phone to assist him, the way a consulting detective would...<br /><br />Even the theme and ambience music is worthy!<br /><br />Snack recommendation: Chinese Take Away; to be including, lotus scented rice, and tea from 500 year old clay pots please.

B003DZX3US|5.0|As soon as I heard that Beauty and the Beast was being released from the vault, I was ecstatic - and bought both myself a copy as well as my one year old niece (for future use, of course).  I loved every minute of watching it again as an adult rather than a child...and since I am 29 years old, it had been a very long time since I had seen it.  What I do not like is the whole Disney idea of being \\"in the vault.\\"  I think all movies should be available because children are being born all the time and when movies are in the vault, a whole generation of children could miss out on great movies, like Beauty and the Beast.  The movie itself - well worth every dime. :-)

You can see the various cases and anecdotes he writes about are real, not made up by one or another guru. It is this type of book. Moreover, one of the chapters is titled \\"The art of being a Mensch\\", and you can feel it between the lines, that the author is a Mensch. He pays lots of attention to ethics.<br /><br />I do not hesitate to follow Guy's advice.
B0041T52S6|5.0|It's unlikely that there has been or will be a movie in recent years as ruggedly ambitious as `Scott Pilgrim VS. The World.' This movie is a thrilling, hyperactive spectacle from start to finish, and although some critics couldn't seem to handle the ride, it was in theaters and is now on DVD one of the most joyful movie events in several years. I would almost dare to say that not since `Rocky Horror Picture Show' was watching a movie in theaters this much sheer fun.     It's a premise many over the age of 25 might crinkle their nose at, but it made for a perfectly functional joyride of a film anyhow: Scott Pilgrim, 22 year-old bass guitarist of the self-stylized band Sex Bob-omb, begins dating 17 year-old Knives Chau, much to his friends' dismay. He soon after becomes infatuated with Ramona Flowers, however, a mysterious young woman he continues to encounter in his dreams. He eventually becomes obsessed with her and is doggedly intent on dating her.     When this finally happens to become a reality, Scott is suddenly forewarned that if he wishes to engage in a relationship with Ramona, he must fight to the death with her seven evil exes, a spunky league of men (plus one girl), each with some form of superpower and a major chip on his or her shoulder. And so the battles ensue, each tougher than the last, as Scott fights relentlessly for the prerogative to love Ramona.     `Scott Pilgrim' is chock-full of very of-the-moment pop culture references, many of them relating to video games, comics, anime and manga. The film features music from The Legend of Zelda, sound bites from the likes of Super Mario Bros. and Seinfeld, explosive visual effects clearly inspired from some of the brightest, most exciting anime scenes and manga panels, and so much more; the exes even explode into coins when they're defeated. What's particularly impressive is that none of it feels like blatant product placement or pointlessly gimmicky-every last facet somehow manages to weave itself artistically into the film's themes. Despite how crazy this all sounds, there are several key factors that make it work.     To begin with, the casting is just about completely seamless; Mary Elizabeth Winstead is deeply emotive as the wistful, bewitching Ramona; the audience is sure to become just as smitten with her as Scott is. Ellen Wong is equally irresistible as the adorably awesome Knives, a character everyone will surely empathize with. Kieran Culkin plays Scott's level-headed, quick-witted gay roommate Wallace; with his hilarious one-liners and general likeability factor, his character is truly one of the greatest pleasures the film has to offer. Other notable castmates are Chris Evans as a hellish he-man evil ex and Anna Kendrick as Scott's sassy sister.     Although the casting of Michael Cera as Scott Pilgrim doesn't come as a major surprise, one does have to wonder what could've been if the lead role had been in more capable (and less bland) hands. Michael Cera, a whopping 20 films deep into his career, doesn't seem to be particularly capable of playing anyone other than himself; thankfully, however, his character glides on the movie's momentum and nothing, not even his portrayal of Scott, is ever weighted down. You'll find yourself liking Scott despite his character defects and even his true identity as Michael Cera.    Based on the 6 comic books of the same name, `Scott Pilgrim' has to cram a lot of content into a 112-minute movie, but the general themes of the comics are sustained, and some of the dialogue is in fact direct excerpts. Book-to-movie transitions are never perfect and will always come with naysayers, but the movie stands so strong on its own that few, even devoted fans of the comics, are likely to complain.     This is a movie overflowing with action, excitement, passion, and, shockingly, a great deal of emotion-you'll care about each of these characters, despite the absurdities surrounding them. This is a type of film that strove for a lot ofthings and achieved all of them-it's very rare that a film can successfully mesh slapstick comedy with action, adventure, drama-and still maintain anything to be taken seriously or sympathize with. `Scott Pilgrim VS. The World' is that film; a surreal fantasy somehow grounded in the real-life hearts and emotions of we human beings. Never before has such a wild, crazy world been so believable.

B002ZG976U|3.0|`Burlesque,' the gazillion-and-sixth movie memoir of a small-town girl making it big, was expectedly lampooned by most critics upon arrival. Although several of the complaints are perfectly valid, `Burlesque' is no `Glitter.' It is in many ways a very on-the-surface visual spectacle, however, and must be treated as such throughout most of its runtime in order for enjoyment as a viewer to be possible.     It is somewhat shocking that this is the movie Cher returned to the big screen for after seven years, and that this is what serves as Christina Aguilera's film debut. The story is more or less total trite, fitting snugly into the mold of the long, haggard slew of identical concepts that came before it. Christina plays Ali, a waitress from Middle-`o-Nowhere USA with her sights set on the spotlight. Somehow scrounging together the cash for a one-way ticket to LA, she happens to come across the vivacious Burlesque Lounge, and naturally lands herself a job there along with a den mother (owner of the club, Tess, played by Cher) to guide the way.     There's of course also a love interest (bartender Jack, played by Cam Gigandet), who conveniently offers Ali a place to stay after her apartment is robbed, despite the existence of an out-of-town fiancée. The premise doesn't go too far beyond that; there are the usual ethical dilemmas and opportunities to sell the soul in favor of showbiz, presented in the form of Eric Dane as weaselly businessman Marcus. Kristen Bell is mostly wasted as a one-note bitchy alcoholic rival to Ali, but Stanley Tucci musters up a few vaguely witty one-liners as Tess's stage manager and gay best friend Sean.     Although the movie is heavy on the obvious, it does have some notable charms; Cher brings impressive layers of tenderness and vulnerability to her portrayal of Tess, while Xtina gives the impression she'd certainly be capable of meatier roles in the future. Cam Gigandet hasn't had much screen time in previous roles, but here we see a little more of what he can do; although he isn't given much to work with beyond the usual pretty boy waif routine, he shares a genuinely sexy, intimate scene with Christina's Ali involving some playful drunken banter and a strategically placed box of cookies.    The mega-instrument that is Christina Aguilera's voice is another major factor of the film's appeal; she's a phenomenal performer, and although a few of the numbers verge on typical musical schlock, a good handful of them (including \\"The Beautiful People,\\" a biting, hard-edged pop number sampling Marilyn Manson's hit of the same name, as well as \\"Bound To You,\\" a smoky ballad) are delectable ear candy. Cher's vocals are also in top form in her soaring opening number \\"Welcome To Burlesque,\\" and although she unfortunately only gets one other song, she shows she's still got it and then some.     Ultimately `Burlesque's biggest asset lies in its weighty guilty pleasure factor. Avid fans of Cher and Christina will probably eat it up, and there's plenty of beautiful faces, bodies, vocals and dance routines to keep things visually enticing. Likeable characters can also make or break a movie despite its script, and luckily Cher's Tess, Tucci's Sean, and a few others are charming enough to keep the audience rooting for them. If you're in the mood for a sugary confection, `Burlesque' could definitely be the way to go-just don't expect anything more filling than that.
B002ZG99A4|5.0|This was a great movie and this Blu-Ray edition captures all of it in perfect detail. The Audio and Visuals were awesome and was able to take me back to how I felt when I was watching it in the theatres. It includes a bonus disc with deleted scenes and other good stuff, which I can't wait to watch. You also get a DVD copy of the film and instructions on how to download free from iTunes. It's a great price for all that and you can't beat the entertainment.

Then, to top that, by putting the information to actual use, I was able to see real results just like he had written about in the book. After assessing my wife as having the \\"acts of service\\" love language, I decided to test out how she would react. I'm usually up and out the door to work before she gets up. I know she enjoys a cup of coffee in the morning and the sooner the better. So, one morning I set up the coffee pot and put a sticky note on it stating, \\"Just turn me on.\\" She called me at the office and went on and on about how sweet that was and how I scored big points. The guys in the adjoining cubicles were baffled at my side of the conversation. When I told them about the call, and about the book, they thought it worth looking into a bit more.<br />I've given over a dozen copies to friends and family. I just gave one to my nephew who was recently married. I even sent one to a guy I met on a plane who told me he was engaged. Without exception, people come back and tell me how The 5 Love Languages have made such a positive difference in their relationships. This stuff should be taught in school.
0192720015|5.0|This is one of \\"the classics\\".  Most of us are well aware of the actual story, so I shalln't address it other than to say that it was quite well written and an attention grabber, with a couple of slow parts.  This book is a gift.  It came quickly from Amazon.  It is a 300ish page hardback with moderate sized text.  It is quality material, pages and binding.  It is well worth the price.  I recommend reading this book for all children, \\"growing\\" empathy for the opposite sex for boys as well as providing models for girls.  It is an essential addition to the libraries of children's depts of public libraries, elementary and junior high schools, and a supplemental text for undergraduate courses in Victorian literature.

006123141X|4.0|James Rollins has penned a number of excellent escapist novels. I would recommend [[ASIN:0061965847 Ice Hunt]], [[ASIN:0061965804 Subterranean]], [[ASIN:0061965839 Amazonia]] and [[ASIN:0060580674 Sandstorm]] to anyone who enjoys adventuring science/techno-thrillers. I would be more reluctant to do so with this installment of his Sigma series though.<br /><br />This is yet another thoroughly researched, keep-surviving-by-the-skin-of-your-teeth adventure. Less pronounced in this book yet still present is Rollins' tendency to move from cliffhanger to cliffhanger, with small breathers in between. It is a book to enjoy during a flight or a rainy weekend - and it will keep you turning pages for hours. However, for a number of reasons this would had been a much better book had it not been yet another Sigma sequel.<br /><br />Sigma simply does not work that good for me. I cannot buy the small number of people undertaking such critical tasks. In fact, Sigma is so understaffed that not only has to rely on certified idiots (sorry Kowalski, but you know it is true...) but even the director himself has to go into the field. They operate all over the world under thin pretexts, they do not even seem to be official sanctioned. And to add insult to injury, most new recruits seem to suffer the Star Trek's away-party odd crew-member fate...<br /><br />On top of that, Sigma seems to deal with one crisis after another while under attack from both a shadow power group and other government secret services. For a writer who takes great pride in the accuracy of his facts interweaved with his fiction, this requires a continuous leap of faith.<br /><br />I can understand how having a book franchise can work for both the writer and his publisher. The first has a set framework of characters to weave his new plot with whereas the later has a more or less loyal fun-base to fall back to. However, they should both keep in mind that this does not always work for the reader.<br /><br />This is a 3.5 stars novel but I rounded it up because Rollins has given a number of techno-thrillers I greatly enjoyed in the past.because Rollins has given a number of techno-thrillers I greatly enjoyed in the past.

No, make that LOVE LOVE LOVE Pete the Cat!<br /><br />Never have I had a near-riot in the library on Library Day after those little ones first heard and saw the story of Pete the Cat.<br /><br />Pete the Cat sings: I Love My White Shoes. I love my White Shoes. I love my White Shoes. How shall I describe our Pete? Fun, fun, fun! Frankly, I want to be just like Pete: unflappable, flexible, and adaptable. Make lemonade out of lemons. Go with the flow. One reviewer indicated the lesson is terrible: Accept your fate. Oh, I disagree. Pete saw no fate--just circumstances to turn into the next pleasant venture on his road of life. Pete? At the beginning he has new white shoes which he loves. In each adventure he steps into colorful piles--strawberries, blueberries, mud-- each time turning his shoes into a new color. Does he whine? Does he complain? \\"Goodness no!\\" He just sings a new song about blue shoes, red shoes, brown shoes. Oh, yes, there IS magic in this story, Virginia!!<br /><br />In my school library, PK-4 (4-year-olds) practically demanded Pete the Cat for three weeks in a row. Never mind my new choice to read for the week--they wanted Pete!! So Pete it was--for three straight weeks.<br /><br />(Secretly, I found it endearing that those children came into the library, singing, \\"I love my White Shoes. I love my white shoes---\\" and insisting, \\"We want Pete the Cat!\\" So I read it to them three weeks in a row.)<br /><br />What is it about the song and book that plays such a chord on the hearts of children? The whimsy, I think. Also, tucked into a little envelope on the back of the front cover is an invitation to come visit their spot on YouTube and experience the song from the actual writer (Eric Litwin) and illustrator (James Dean, no, not that James Dean). Or, you can go to Harper Collins, the publisher.<br /><br />Frankly, things don't get much better than a happy song about each and every bad luck event, each of which can be turned into something positive.

B0006JGFNQ|3.0|Although the doll was certainly cute enough, when I received it it sang but did not dance. Whether it was broken when it was sent or got damaged during shipping I cannot say, but it can't be emphasized enough that THIS IS NOT A TOY. It is a shelf decoration, nothing more. I doubt it would last an hour in the hands of a child without breaking (or putting an eye out with those solid, unforgiving ears), as it is nothing but a very fragile machine wrapped in a layer of fur. I returned my purchase; time will tell if that goes smoothly or not.    ...it's also worth mentioning that the song it sings is quite loud & gets extremely annoying after 2 or 3 plays.

B000002KCI|3.0|I think this line from Barstool Blues sums up the whole feeling there is about Zuma, after Tonight`s the night one of the darkest and introspective works from Neil, in Zuma he finally lets the light in, and as shown in the front picture takes off again towards a new life....I can also clearly see from the lyrics of many of the tracks that there is a bit of getting over a broken heart kind of process going on....songs  like Stupid Girl a song about a girl who still thinks about a past relationship instead of jumping into bed with Neil ;-) or Drive Back a great track about those kind of situations when you just end up into bed with someone for a shag and you rather not see him or her in your bed in the morning and you gently invite her to drive back to her place....there also are 2 songs Pardon My heart and Danger Bird about those shaky feelings you get towards the end of a relationship when it becomes apparent that its over because the emotions  just dont flow anymore (Pardon my heart) or worse someone else is already tickling the fancies of one of the two(Danger Bird)...Not surprisingly the Album finishes with Through My Sail a real CNY masterpiece, vocal harmonies are heavenly and the whole song is about continuing the journey of life towards the next step and moving on while our conscience gets deeper and deeper into the knowing of life...<br /><br />A record to listen to when you wake up in the morning, Neil has described this once ... Iwould agree its a great bachelor looking for love and meanwhile layind down as much as possible kind of record...ahaha PS The guitar playin on Danger Bird is outstanding as the beautiful Cortez the killer which just takes you for a trip each time you listen to it is ....two unmissable chapters..

I love each track on this Album but one of my favourites here is Revolution Blues, the whole song is once more about peace love and understanding IMO, and how people who never had a chance in life will end up feeling angry and eager for revenge, lookin for famous stars to kill and ways to bring the whole system to a collapse, There can never be peace on earth as long as the poor are getting poorer and the rich live in Laurel Canyon....., Young love for democracy and Hippie idealism have shaped this wonderful Lp.
0782002064|5.0|This movie is actually not as well known today as in the past.  Anyone who hasn't seen it, owes it to him/herself to do so.   This is listed as original and uncut.  Thank goodness, as versions I've seen on tv have often been cut to make room for way-too-many commercials.   Black + White is excellent, no colorization is needed.    [Most colorized B+W movies look like patches of color floating over the film, and are limited to aqua greens, light blues and browns.  Very odd.]   If you like this movie, don't fret over color or not, just get it. It's a treasure.
B0036EH3WU|4.0|I bought this set and love it. It is huge and the box is textured. I love the show and would give you a 5 star rating on the show but this is a review about the product, not the show. The set gets 4 stars for a few reasons. The good is that it has every season, plus bonus content, a secret disc, and some cool little toys. The set looks nice and I got it for a great price with my Amazon discount. I had some issues playing the final episode on my xbox and returned it for a new set with no problems. I also noticed that the battery for the blacklight flashlight was dead on the replacement set. The bad would be the individual season cases. I like when you can click in the dvd so it doesn't move. This is simply thin cardboard with sleeves cut into them. You just slip in the disc which I don't like. It can scratch up the dvds a little and some dvds seemed kinda stuck to the cardboard. The designs on each season were ugly too. The designs on the discs itself seem to be the same from the individual season sets but please correct me if I'm wrong. The menus all seem to be the same from the previous season releases. I did like the last names on all the covers. Overall i'm very happy with my purchase. In regards to the people giving reviews on the show itself, please try to review the actual product and not if you liked it or not...use tv.com for that. I also have seen all the episodes at least twice, loved the finale, and introduced 2 people to the show who love it already.(one of whom has seen all episodes/one who is on season 3)
0470876417|5.0|It was excellent.<br /><br />This book combines design thinking, innovation, strategy, and sound business concepts.<br /><br />If I had to do my MBA over again I would give myself this book to read from the very beginning. The only other book that is this good in this area is \\"Blue Ocean Strategy\\" - both in their practicality and fresh thinking.<br /><br />Go to a bookstore. Take it off the shelf. Read through it for about 5 minutes, and I think you will then get a sense of the simple brilliance of this book.<br /><br />I love it.
006113399X|4.0|The Redbreast is the American debut of Norwegian policeman Harry Hole - there are two earlier volumes which were published in Norway. Harry is the quintessential fictional detective - a loner, problem drinker, jaded, cynical, dogged, persistent and with his own standard of justice - which most of the time coincides with the law. Although this borders on caricature, that doesn't happen in this book. Harry comes across as believable - although at times predictable - although one wonders if this will hold true in the later volumes of the series.    In this book Detective Hole finds himself embroiled in a case of seemingly random but brutal murders which eventually tie back to World War II and Norwegian soldiers fighting for the Nazis on the Eastern Front. Harry also battles current day politics, neo-Nazis, the aftermath of an accidental shooting and his own personal demons while mentoring subordinates, falling in love and taking on a new job. The story-line also jumps back and forth between the present and World War II.    If this sounds confusing - well at times it is - which is a fault of this book. There is a very compelling plot - murder, revenge and betrayal - with a fairly well developed cast of characters, which all gets lost at times among the numerous sub-plots and time frames. That being said, The Redbreast is still an engaging and enjoyable read - just a bit unnecessarily complicated.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|In the list of special features, it says David Bowie does the intro. He doesn't.    I've bought the one with the dark blue cover, the one with Father Christmas, and the one with the Nuttiest Nutcracker.    No Bowie.    It looks like the only ones with David Bowie are the VHS and possibly the Region 2. Bummer.    I hate that Amazon lists these reviews and special features on all versions! So unhelpful when looking for specifics.    Like David Bowie.    *sigh
B00092ZL80|5.0|I bought the DVD version and it was great. After watching it I wished I bought the blue ray version.
0316098337|5.0|I was mesmerized by the young boy who was the teller of the tale in this heart-breakingly magical book.  There were some tense scenes, but mostly the book was made up of the day to day life of 'overcoming'.  The 2 main characters, the mom and her son, were poignantly fleshed out and the dialogue between them is precious.  This is a true testament to love which blossoms in even horrible environs.
B0034JKZ3G|5.0|I've seen the movie so many times that I'm starting to wish I hadn't bought it, but my daughter loves it (3 yrs old), so that makes it all worth while.  I'm told it's a classic animation, but it doesn't seem dated at all.  It's actually a nice story of determination, love and success.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with a bluray/DVD combo either because you can watch the BR at home and the DVD on the road in a portable player.
B0041VT6HW|4.0|All I have to say is this: watch the movie, and then decide if you like it or not. What we have here is a ton of Roger Ebert wannabes who actually think their opinion should influence your life and guess what? it does if you let it! Go rent the movie, wait for free monday rental at redbox but just see it for yourself, you'll probably end up liking it a whole lot more than you expected. Oh and by the way that expression \\"80 minutes of my life I'll never get back\\" has gotten really old, look for a new sheeple mantra.  The movie is a fun popcorn film, all I expected from it but if you go in expecting to see Unforgiven or 3:10 to Yuma you'll be quite dissapointed.
B004AKCME8|3.0|When I saw the trailer for Legend of the Guardians , I was so excited to see it. One of the main reasons was because it was directed by Zack Snyder and because the animation looked unlike anything I have ever seen in CGI. I finally got to the theaters to see it and I have to say that was let down.<br /><br />First off, the animation was the best part of the whole film. I could not get over how breathtaking the landscapes were and even the way the characters were brought to life. These owls looked so lifelike and while they did talk and fight (yes they actually fought with blades), the way they walked and the way their feathers and wings went against the wind was astounding. The acting was very well done, getting a slew of well known names such as Jim Sturgess, Sam Neil, Hugo Weaving and Abigail Cornish. The only weakness this film had was the plot. I understand that the film was in fact the first 3 novels of this massive story.  The reason it failed was because the film was way too short. The movie started off really, really light and then went really, really dark. There was very little time for character development as well as plot explanation and that would have really helped this film. I have read the premise of these novels and it is an incredible fantasy story. Being able to make this film with the use of CGI gave it tremendous potential to be a great film. Still, when it comes to family oriented films you always have to remember a good portion of your viewers has an attention span of a common field mouse. Because of that major flaw, I would be quite surprised if a sequel is ever made, they have a lot to work on especially if they plan to put another 3 novels into one film. I would love to see possibly a directors cut or an extended version of this film so they can thicken up the story as it should be told.<br /><br />Still, Legend of the Guardians is something worth seeing if not only once. Just the spectacle of it is quite amazing and just seeing how far we have come to making CGI films as real as live action. This film couldn't set a better example.ing CGI films as real as live action. This film couldn't set a better example.
B002ZG9968|4.0|Liked the movie - funny, moving and well played by J-lo & Alex.  If you like Romantic Comedy, this one should be in your collection
B002ZG97E2|2.0|Out of all the films that I have seen this year I would have to say that nothing was more of a letdown than Despicable Me. I am sure you are curious as to why. The acting was great I want to get that off the bat right away. Steve Carrell is an actor that always wows me with every performance live action or voice acting. Giving any actor who is normally looked at as the `good guy' a chance to play a villain is something they always jump at. The supporting cast was also great, Russell Brand was probably the biggest surprise for me just because of the character he voiced.<br /><br />What I hated about this movie was the story. Seeing all the trailers of this movie I really thought this was going to be a film about super villains just going at it trying to headway the crime of the century instead, this film turned out to be nothing but a Disney wanna be, by having Steve Carrells character adopt three orphan girls. Not that I had anything against the characters because the little one was just way too cute. Still, this movie tried way too hard to get at your emotions taking away from the whole super villain element. Also, because of this plot point Jason Siegel gets barely the screen time he deserved in this movie. I am sorry, but if you want to make a Disney movie make sure that Disney does it. I mean yes this film had to go up against Toy Story 3 and there was no way that Despicable Me was even going to match that movie from an emotional standpoint.<br /><br />It's films like this one that make me so mad that animation always has to be stereo typed as being geared towards children or has to be something the whole family can enjoy. Just because it is a cartoon doesn't mean it has to be tame. South Park and the Simpsons got it right making sure their films got PG-13 and above. When will the day come when we will realize that animation can be friendly for all ages so animated movies can be just as enjoyable and exciting as life action?
0440245915|1.0|Back in 1989, disenchanted with the legal profession, John Grisham decided not practice it and instead he opted to become a writer. But Becoming a writers isn't that easy. With more enthusiasm than know-how, or the proper study of the art of writing novels wrote a legal thriller: A Time to Kill.<br />Like many other aspiring writers, Grisham's less than artistic work was rejected by many publishers. You can't blame publishers in this particular case because the book was so badly written that must have made the editors cringe with disgust. In all respects this novel was a crass apprentice's work.<br />Instead of sulking and retreating as any ordinary writer might have done, John Grisham decided to learn the trade. Writing --regardless of what critics and pundits say-- may be learned. Writing fiction may also be learned. Now, whether the production is literary, artistic, or not, that is a separate issue.<br />When you read novels by John Grisham published subsequently to A Time to Kill, you'll appreciate that he learned to write. Although no one can say that his novels are literary, they are quite entertaining. Novels such as The Firm, The Pelican Brief, and The Client, are well written. Now if we go back and compare his first effort, A Time to Kill, to these other novels, we can quickly see the vast improvement in the writer.<br />Once his subsequent novels were accepted, Wynwood Press printed 5,000 copies of A Time to Kill. And later as the demand for legal thrillers rose, the novel was adapted into a film. Something similar happened to Olivia Goldsmith. When Goldsmith wrote First Wives Club it was rejected by more than 100 publishers. Only after she published other books did Hollywood become interested in her novels, and First Wives Club became a successful film. So there's hope for rejects!<br />For many curious readers the question was: how and in what manner did Grisham's writing improve? The answer is simple. To write fiction a writer must grasp a few simple lessons: (1) Sentence Openers (2) Sentence variation, and (3) Master the use of the nominative absolute. All of these points are treated in detail in Mary Duffy's textbook Toolbox for Writers.<br />If you pay attention to some important scenes in Grisham's novels, you'll see an abundance of absolutes. This device --which he mastered-- and uses adroitly, adds a forceful narrative drive to his thrillers; in fact, that is what makes them thrillers.Openers (2) Sentence variation, and (3) Master the use of the nominative absolute.

B001F0WXY0|5.0|Outstanding in every aspect! Multiple storylines and all charaters well developed. Extremely complex weaving of political, religious, economic, social, and ecological themes. Great for even the non scifi reader. Best book I ever read.
B000MRAAJW|4.0|Splendid shots and scenes of wildlife and nature from over the entire world. Breathtaking and stunning in their quality. My only negative comment is the last dvd which is political commentary and not really necessary to the overall mission of this product.
B003ZK58WM|4.0|I had not previously read any historical fiction for the WWI time period, but I love Follett's other works. It was great. It reminded me of talking to my great grandfather when I was a kid about his life in Holland during the war. Great read.
B003VDZWAQ|5.0|I really like this show. I think the characters have a good charisma together. I am really interested to see what happens in season 2. It gets really interesting the more of the show that you watch. Emily Rose plays FBI agent Audrey Parker. The show deals with people who have supernatural abilities and Audrey Parker gets immersed in the town. To check out more about Haven go to this link: [...].
B00127RAJY|3.0|The interval training is effective and after a few sessions I was definitely sore.  The DVD is terribly formatted and makes me go through the entire introduction every time I want to do the workout.  It takes 5 minutes just to get the workout started after popping in the DVD.  The disk will not allow me to fast forward or go to the menu.  For me it almost negates the fact that I like the workout!
B0002IQNAG|5.0|Yes, I know many will cite Night of the Living Dead as the original but this movie was what helped zombies break out as a whole.    This time the movie takes place in an iconic mall (this will later go to be a inspiration for the game Dead Rising).    This DVD collection of the movie comes with all the goodies packaged together. You will get the original Theatrical Version, the Extended Version, European Version, and lot of other goodies (interviews, etc). Essentially this is the best version to get out of all the ones for sale out there (this goes for Blu-Ray as well, as of this writing).    If there is a version you must own of this movie, this is the one. Let's hope they bring this set out on Blu-Ray in the future!
B003ZWTGKU|1.0|If you have the same approach to opera as I do, and expect the dramatic elements to play a major role in the gesamtkunstwerk, then think twice about buying this DVD.  Everything about it is excellent has been noted by all reviewers -- but from my point of view it has been sabotaged by a film editor who thinks he is being clever, playing games with his cutting.<br /><br />When Massenet was an impecunious student, he played in an orchestra pit for years and learned a great deal about what makes an opera succeed as a drama.  He always had a hand in writing the libretto and his music always enhanced it.  When his operas were mounted, he took part in the direction as well.  He would be appalled at what has been done to this, arguably his most intense interpersonal drama.<br /><br />At moments of great tension, the camera pulls back to the rear of the audience showing the back of the conductor, bits of the orchestra and, in the distance, the actors; or it pans to the face of the conductor; or it goes into the wings; or it goes down from the ceiling --  all killers of the drama and the mood.  It would be merely laughable if the rest of the production was not all that good -- but it was excellent.  As a result what could have been a stellar production has become a travesty.<br /><br />If you want to see a wonderful balanced high quality production of Werther, get the one with Alvarez and Garanca.  It will blow you away, probably even if you do not agree with setting it i the 1950's.
B002HQWQOI|4.0|... but the weakness is the same. All the soloists and instrumentalists perform brilliantly. Nevertheless, I'm not satisfied with the totality of this recording. The broad-band timbre and tuning of the Kammerchor Stuttgart distresses me. Choruses of 35 singers may have been available to Zelenka and other baroque composers, so the issue is not historical authenticity. It's acoustic recordability. To my ears, the sound of the coro sections on this CD is just a big white noise whoosh. If you don't happen to mind that sound, then you can adjust my rating to five stars. Even if you share my lack of enthusiasm for recordings of semi-professional choruses, you will be excited and delighted by all the rest.
1897299214|4.0|North Korea is one of the most repressive countries on Earth with a security apparatus and closed society that puts even East Germany or the Soviet Union to shame.  Foreign visitors are tightly controlled and what they may photograph is restricted.  So Guy Dilisle's illustrations give us some insight into what Pyongyang looks like.<br /><br />It is not a history book, it is not an expose of North Korea, for that you will have to look elsewhere.  It is however a detailed account of his months spent living there, the North Koreans he worked with, the ex-pats he met and what he saw.<br /><br />Guy tells his story with dry humor and gives us some context.  He doesn't whitewash things, he specifically mentions North Korea's infamous prison camps and thought police, but he doesn't dwell on them either.<br /><br />It's a good read and a solid addition to the information available about North Korea.<br /><br />One thing lacking though was much introspection from Guy.  He was sent there by a French animation company to oversee production by a government-owned studio.  While he is conscious of the North Korean government's evil he doesn't seem to have any thoughts about his employer's support for that government.

I felt it, i was sweating like crazy, did i mention i FELT it? I did level 1' three days in a row because i enjoyed it. BUT after only 3 days of exercising i sprained my wrist badly..i dont know if it was because of the \\"Up & Down\\" movement, the push-ups(which i HATE lol), the weights, or even just ME! I had to stop working out for a week because of the sprain. So after all that I am still going to buy the DVD because it made me sweat & my muscles soar, & to me that means its working!

B0036EH3XE|1.0|This season is easily the most disappointing event in Television history. The Red Herring side flashes never amount to anything but \\"AHA! Fooled you!\\" in the weak final episode. The writers took everything that was starting to make sense in the show, and flipped it on its head. Then kicked it, and told it to shut up. From the new \\"Temple\\" people, who amount to fodder, to the new revelations (cave of magical light.....) this season drags its feet and then jumps off a cliff. All the things you wanted to know about the Time Traveling, What Daniel Faraday was doing off the island-and what he meant when he told Jack and the other that they don't belong there- is never answered. But that doesn't even scratch the surface of where they went wrong here.<br /><br />Magic? Really? You mean to tell me that all the amazing things that happened in Season 1 2 3 4 5 can be explained away by magic? The whispers were what now? Really? Why? Its head scratchingly brutal, and has made the other seasons completely unwatchable on an investment level because you know that the questions you are asking while watching, will NEVER be answered, not in any logical way. Not in the way the show first presented it's mysteries. It's not riveting, it's not entertaining. It IS frustrating and it IS disappointing. Thanks for nothing Lost writers.
0312370849|2.0|I could hardly wait to read this book for my book club. I do not usually read fiction; but because it was loosely based on historical fact, I figured this would be right up my alley. I was sadly disappointed. It has so much potential, but it falls far short. It loses steam about half-way through the book when Sarah's story suddenly drops off, and the focus becomes Julia. I found her husband's character, Bertrand, to be poorly developed and COMPLETELY unbelievable, in particular, his strange response to her pregnancy. He adores their 11 year old daughter and is a wonderful father, but demands that Julia have an abortion, or it's the end of their marriage. Huh? As a woman who has also suffered from infertility and miscarriage, there is simply no way that someone like that would even CONSIDER abortion (and Julia even makes it as far as the clinic, wearing a paper gown). Furthermore, infertility and miscarriage deeply affect fathers, too (again, speaking from experience here). I simply find it unbelievable that a husband touched by the devastation of infertility and miscarriage would react this way. I challenge the author to show me a real-life infertile/subfertile couple that would approach a pregnancy in this fashion.    Plot turns smack you upside the head, and then the author quickly moves on. I found myself re-reading several passages after having suffered near whiplash. Sometimes the dramatic build-up to an unexpected plot development can add to a story, but in this case, the author fails to pull it off, resulting in jerky and unbelievable storytelling. The ending was more or less predictable. The last few chapters were almost unbearable.     The most annoying part was the anti-French mentality weaved throughout the book; which I find bizarre coming from a French author. It felt like she was pandering to an American audience; but I felt insulted and stereotyped as an anti-French, narcissistic, ugly American who hates all things European. She kept hammering the point home while complaining about her sensual husband with a wandering eye, the French citizens' complicity in the roundup of French Jews, their driving skills, their obsession with appearance, her French in-laws who never liked her anyway; it just goes on and on.    I gave it two stars because the first half of the book, particularly Sarah's story, was compelling, haunting and well-written. Wish I could say the same thing for the second half of the book and Julia's part of the story.
0553805371|4.0|Hawking and Mlodinow take the reader through the history of cosmology in a manner that is illuminating and engaging.  Their illustrations of some of the more complex thought-problems of our time are indicative of the large amount of thought and effort they put into this project.  Their conclusions are sound, but their premises are their point at which their arguments are subject to objection.  The issue I had personally with the book was that the whole issue of Philosophy was ignored so blatantly (on the first page the authors proclaim the death of Philosophy).  Let us get one thing straight: the tool they use throughout this book is not \\"science\\", it is philosophy.  Natural Philosophy has been practiced since before the time of Aristotle, and has been refined through thinkers such as Bacon, Newton, Galileo, Popper, Hume, Locke, etc.  Many of the people listed in Hawking and Mlodinow's history of \\"science\\" are natural philosophers (not to mention epistemologists, metaphysicians, and logicians; all of which are sub-disciplines within, you guessed it, Philosophy).  Whenever one uses the \\"scientific method\\" they are actually using something that was arrived upon through the use of philosophy and are therefore practicing empirical philosophy.  I am unclear on what the authors mean by Philosophy, but I suspect that their referent is that brand of philosophy which delights in the speculative arts.  However, most philosophy is not that, and many Philosophers are deeply concerned and interested in the questions and purported answers that Hawking and Mlodinow brings up.    Philosophy is not dead, nor will it ever be, because Science is nothing if not philosophy and it is best that we understand that before beginning projects of the scale of this one for the few logical errors that become apparent throughout the text could have been corrected through a grounding in logic and philosophical thought.
B003R0LBVW|1.0|I want to be swept away by books with so much hype.  This was a downer with tediously unlikable characters.  I kept asking myself what the point was and only finished the book in hopes the ending would be rewarding.  I am tired of this story and feel like it has not only been told a thousand times but could have also been told to me by any stranger in the grocery market.
B0043A0PXU|5.0|I have always loved Annie Lennon's voice.  This collection of music is glorious.  You will not find songs about Santa or snowmen, just beautiful religious Christmas songs.  It feels like a different caliber of holiday cheer. It is not Christmas lite nor is it full of sad or blue Christmas songs, but it is impeccably and passionately done.
B003VIW8DK|5.0|This album is a must have for any Brian Ferry fan, it is everything you would expect and more.  Bryan's voice and classic sound updated for today.

015603283X|3.0|This is the novel that the movie \\"The Ninth Gate\\" is based on.  It follows an unscrupulous book hunter who is one two quests.  First, he is trying to authenticate a handwritten chapter from \\"The Three Musketeers\\".  Second, he is looking into three copies of an occult book \\"Book of the Nine Doors of the Kingdom of Shadows\\".  As the book goes one mysterious shenanigans surround both books, causing our protagonist to seek the connection between them.      This book is full of historical tidbits about \\"The Three Musketeers\\", Alexandre Dumas and the occult scene in Europe in the 1600s.  These were all very interesting and enjoyable to read.  The first part of the ending is absolutely a delight, though a reader taking the book more seriously than I did might find it frustrating and disappointing.     At times I thought the plot dragged on a bit and I would find myself thinking \\"Get on with it\\".  The characters seemed a bit stilted as well, with the motivations of a few characters either missing entirely or feeling just a bit off.

B000068QZK|4.0|Ozzy's first album with Zakk Wylde on guitar is a nice return to form.  Ozzy had hit a bit of a rut in the mid-80's but the presence of Wylde seemed rejuvenate Mr. Osborne and kick everything up a few notches.  The collaboration between Wylde and Ozzy would last another 20 years.  There are not really any dud songs on this one.  The lyrics on songs like \\"Breaking All The Rules\\", \\"Crazy Babies\\", and \\"Tattooed Dancer\\" are a bit rock n roll clich&eacute;, but the monster riffs and overall competency of the band more than make up for any lyrical deficiencies.  Songs like \\"Miracle Man\\" (about Rev. Jimmy Swagart), \\"Devil's Daughter\\", \\"Bloodbath In Paradise' (about Charles Manson), and \\"Fire In The Sky\\" rank up with some of the best stuff Ozzy had done.  \\"Wicked\\" is the album that saw Ozzy transform from the hair metal 80's to the more heavy straight ahead metal of the 90's.  One of the Oz man's better releases for sure.
0865479186|5.0|Ben Goldacre has done an important public service by providing a science-based criticism of alternative medicine, including megadose vitamins, homeopathy, and so-called \\"nutritionists\\".

I am recommending this book to all of my friends and colleagues.
B000068R1X|3.0|Of the 5 Ozzy albums that I own this one is my least favorite.  It is not a bad album, but not up to the standards of his best works either.  \\"Bark\\" was the first studio album released after the death of guitar god Randy Rhoads.  Jake E Lee fills in well here for the most part, but lacks some of the flair that Randy brought to the table on Ozzy's earlier albums.  The title track was a big hit off the album although again not one of Ozzy's best singles in my opinion.  The rest of the tracks are pretty typical 80's metal with nothing really standing out to my ears.  The album contains a significant amount of cheesy sounding keyboards.  I have nothing against keys in rock n roll, but here, most of the time, it makes the album sound dated and really ads very little to the overall presentation.  To my ears \\"Bark\\" is a very average Ozzy album.
B00139XTG4|2.0|I had great expectations from this book.  At the beginning it was quite interesting presenting some intriguing ideas (although nothing really new).  The main idea is the existence of rare events which are disproportionately impactful and usually out of our prediction horizon. Also that there are situations in which the classic bell curve doesn't apply.  However the writter over-analyzed the particular ideas, and in several cases led himself to the other extreme allowing the notion that nothing is predictable and that his famous Black Swans (these rare events - usually due to lack) make all the difference.  He failed to demonstrate proportionately that two different ways of thinking are necessary.   Eventually he used an own example of a fictitious person and his own experiences trying to make his point - which, again becomes misleading and leads him to a similar mistake that he accuses others of.  I believe that eventually he falls to the same mistakes of methodology and thought that he so much tries to teach about.   All the above plus his arrogant approach lead me to rate the book with only two stars. I would rather recommend somebody to read an abstract keeping always a critical/skeptical approach for the reader. It's just ideas - not evidence.
B00003CXPD|5.0|This movie brings me to tears every time I see it. Billy Eliot's mother had recently deceased. His new responsibilities include, satisfying his father's wishes, looking after his wandering grandmother, and taking his older brother's verbal abuse. Little Billy was sent for boxing lessons with the rest of the little boys. It just so happens that there aren't enough facilities to go around. Ballet is practiced in the other side of the gym by a group of young girls. Billy can't help himself. The music takes a hold of his body's motions and he is unable to concentrate on boxing. Billy's father and brother are strong participants in the coal miner's union. In between the pressures of family and his newly found passion, Billy struggles to find a balance. His father considered ballet as feminine. His brother angers the ballet instructor and accuses her of scheming. On top of everything, Billy's childhood friend, Michael, is coming forth with his homosexuality and shows a smidge of affection. Billy has a similar moment with his instructor's daughter, Debbie. Billy's father thinks about his late wife and decides to give Billy a shot at something else, rather than a future in coal mining. Everyone in the film was perfect. The dynamics of the actors as a family was very believable.  My favorite character is the father, (Gary Lewis). He gave a very moving performance and his acting is superb. I recommend this movie for anyone. I know it is rated R for profanity and whatnot, but honestly, I see no harm in labeling it PG-13 instead. If you cannot hear the film, you can see it and it's excellence of cinematography. If you cannot see the film, you can definitely hear it. It has one of the best soundtracks of all time.

B0041T52S6|5.0|Scott Pilgrim vs. The World captured my attention when I saw it in theaters, and I've been itching for it to be released on DVD ever since.  It's a long overdue nod to gamers everywhere, and it captures the style of the comic books almost perfectly.  I've watched it seven times since I got it in the mail, and everyone I've shown it to has not only loved it, but asked to watch it again.  Good special features as well.  Overall, I am immensely happy with this purchase.
B0002KVUKM|4.0|I totally love this movie. The special effects are amazing. It's one of my favorite vampire movies. It's a great movie to watch right around Halloween if you're like me and not really into full-on, gory, scare-the-poop-out0of-ya horror movies.

B001MYIXAC|4.0|I am a longtime film fan and have been in the film entertainment industry for over 25 years now so I've seen all kinds of film, all genres from the worst to some of the all time best. Rarely do I come across a recent film that I instantly like and can consider a classic; \\"Let the Right One In\\" is one of them. Being your average lazy, ignorant American I usually do not watch foreign speaking films but I checked this out after watching the American adaptation \\"Let Me In\\". Hearing that it was a remake of a Swedish film I was naturally curious to check out the original version...and was very pleased with it.     The original Swedish version \\"Lat Den Ratte Komma In\\" is masterfully directed by Tomas Alfredson from a script by John Ajvide Lindqvist(based on his original novel), this Swedish film as does the American remake both have a cast of fine actors and is well done but the Swedish original more closely follows the original book as far as revealing the shocking secret of Eli's true gender and nature-the mood of the film is also quite evident setting and enhancing the general tone of loneliness and isolation experienced by the two main characters.    This film is a romanticized vampiric tale and no I do not mean the \\"Twilight\\" kinda romanticism which I abhore-but done in an intelligent, tasteful way. The two young actors; Kare Hedebrant(Oskar) and Lina Leandersson(Eli) turn in very effective, emotional performances all the more impressive considering that this was Lina Leandersson's first ever acting job on screen-these two young actors will surely be big players in the Swedish film industry if not international stars at some point in the future.     The best way I can describe or compare this film to is; \\"Romeo & Juliet\\" except in this case Juliet happens to be a 200 year old vampire who looks like a 12 year old girl. The film has a dark tone to it and some would say has a tragic end of sorts but it is in essence a love story, not overly sappy and done with great careand intelligence.    The DVD package is well done, top quality picture and sound complete with a little behind the scenes look with the films director, it also features a deleted scenes section which has four cut scenes from the film-the two scenes with the main characters (Eli & Oskar) especially stand out. I am a big fan of commentary but alas this film has none and it is my only pet peeve(other than the poor English dubbing-watch it with the english subtitles instead)-but some filmakers do not like to do commentaries(Steven Spielberg is a big name for example)while some other filmakers are just not good at it. I am not a huge fan of the vampire film genre and I do not consider this a true horror film but I do highly reccomend it for it's take on the genre and for it's superb writing, direction and acting-big thumbs up! :)
B004ASVS0E|5.0|Isn't it wonderful that everyone in the world has differing tastes in music? If we all liked the same music, there would be no reason for innovation.<br /><br />I do have to say I have eclectic preferences in music.  I love most genres, MANY artists and styles.  But I really enjoy Christmas music and am one of those people who you might hear singing \\"Silent Night\\" in July.<br /><br />I am enjoying \\"A Christmas Cornucopia\\" very much - driving my family to distraction listening to the CD over and over.  I hear something new to appreciate each time I listen to it - different harmonies or phrasing; subtle differences in the performance of old standards; some not-so-subtle differences.  I appreciate the chances Lennox took on this album and am thankful that this isn't the same old selection of \\"elevator music\\" that gets released every year at this time.<br /><br />I loved her renditions of \\"Oh Little Town of Bethlehem\\", \\"Angels From the Realm of Glory\\", and especially \\"As Joseph Was A Walking\\".  I also appreciated the inclusion of \\"Universal Child\\" among these songs because what is Christmas - the celebration of the birth of the most \\"Universal Child\\" ever to be.  \\"Lullay Lullay\\", though dark, was still musically gorgeous.  I did not like the rendition of \\"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen\\" at first - definitely strange harmonies with a Mideastern flavor - but the more I listen to it, the more I have come to appreciate it. \\"The Holly and the Ivy\\" and \\"In the Bleak Midwinter\\" were my least favorite tracks on the album, and the rendition of \\"Silent Night\\" was adequate but nothing outstanding.<br /><br />Annie Lennox has a fine instrument in her voice.  It has changed some over the years but not detrimentally in my opinion - just different.  Buy \\"A Christmas Cornucopia\\".  Listen with your heart and enjoy the spirit of Christmas I am wagering it will invoke in you.
B003HC8I5M|4.0|I too, am a Phil follower and couldn't wait to listen to this.  I REALLY like it.  I like that he kept the original sound to the songs, while simply adding his own soul to this effort.  I'm not a fan of \\"pappa was a rolling stone\\", but never could stand the original either, and it goes on and on.  That being said this is one I will listen to often.

B000E41MS6|5.0|I have been a Doctor Who fan since the debut of the modern series in 2005.  I have every episode of the modern series on DVD, along with 30 episodes of the 1963-1989 series.      Season 1 is my favorite season of the modern series, followed by Season 5 and Season 4 in that order.  Season 1 accounts for 4 of my all-time top 11 episodes and 4 of my top 8 modern episodes - The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances, Dalek, Father's Day, and Bad Wolf/The Parting of the Ways, with The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances rating number one on my all-time list.  The corresponding figures for Seasons 2, 3, 4, \\"4.5\\" (the 4 specials from 2009), and 5 are 0, 2, 1, 0 and 1 episode, in that order.  The only respect in which any other season is better than Season 1 is in the number of really rotten episodes.  Season 5 had only 1 really rotten episode - Victory of the Daleks - compared to 3 for Season 1 (Rose, The End of the World, and the Long Game) and 3 or 4 per year for Seasons 2-4.  I also think that Season 1 contained the most under-rated episode of the modern series - Boom Town.  Boom Town got very negative ratings from the viewers in the Doctor Who Magazine poll and in the Doctor Who Dynamic Rankings web site, but I thought this story had an interesting plot and good acting.  It was very short on action, which probably hurt it with most viewers.    Part of my enthusiasm for Season 1 is due to the actors and characters.  Christopher Eccleston did a great portrayal of the Ninth Doctor as angry, enigmatic, lonely, and occasionally vengeful, but also fundamentally brave, honorable, and helpful.  As for the Doctor's companion, Rose Tyler/Billie Piper is my all-time favorite companion.  I also liked the fact that Rose had a meaningful \\"back story,\\" and I really liked the interplay between the Doctor, Rose, Jackie Tyler (Rose's mother) and Mickey Smith (Rose's boyfriend when she met the doctor).  There was nothing to match this interplay in the later seasons, and the only interactions that cameclose were those between the Tenth Doctor, his companion Donna, and Wilfred Mott (Donna's grandfather) and those between the Eleventh Doctor, his companion Amy Pond, and her boyfriend Rory Williams.    The rest of my preference for Season 1 is due to the writing.  Season 1 included my favorite Steven Moffatt episode (The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances), an episode by Paul Cornell, and an episode by Robert Shearman.  I think that these were the 3 best writers of the modern series, and only Season 1 features all 3 of them.  Moreover, Russell T. Davies, who was the primary writer for Seasons 1-4.5, was at his best during Season 1.  I think he started to burn out from over-work in the later seasons where he was the show's producer.
0545265355|5.0|Great read - the story moves quickly, the characters are engaging, and it delves into interesting (and important) philosophical issues while retaining high entertainment value.  Strongly recommended.
B0040JHWKS|4.0|Answering the age-old question (that nobody ever asked), \\"what if Darkness on the Edge of Town wasn't so bleak?\\" The Promise gives us a fascinating look at the other music that The Boss and company made on their way to the album we all know and love.<br /><br />I don't have a trillion dollars to throw away on the super deluxe box set, which includes DVDs, a blu-ray, personalized handshakes, and a coupon for the E-Street Band to come to your house and mow your lawn, so I opted for this simple 2-cd set. After all, in all seriousness, I'm really just after the music.<br /><br />And the music is excellent. In the liner notes, Springsteen acknowledges the influence of punk, not on his songwriting so much, but on his song selection, in determining which songs made the final cut. He wanted a hard-hitting record, and Darkness certainly was that. Still, the songs that got left behind were outstanding, and it is mind-boggling that they have never been released before. Big, romantic melodies, mostly strong very-Springsteenesque lyrics, sax solos all over the place - if this were the music the band had released in 1978, it would certainly have been a hit. Probably not as resonant as Darkness was, but of very high quality, Springsteen would have done just fine with this material. However, I do think he made the right choices for the time, and I'm glad these songs have come to light. It makes you wonder just how much else is locked away in a vault somewhere that we have no idea about.

0393078299|5.0|This book contains a wealth of detail on the Great Debate about the Nature of Reality. There are diagrams of the incisive thought experiments. The Glossary is a great help in understanding the details.    It seems that even though most physicists accept the theory of general relativity, most give little attention to its accompaniment the space-time continuum. An exception is Brian Greene, in \\"The Fabric of the Cosmos\\".    The space-time continuum is a three-dimensional curved surface curved in a fourth dimension. That is too much for our intuition. Let us replace it with a two-dimensional curved surface curved in a third dimension. Imagine the curved surface to be a thin spherical ball that is perfectly continuous. That would be impossible to manufacture, but it could be approached. The Heisenberg Uncertanty Principle would be a tear or slit or newly-formed hole in the continuum, so it would no longer be a continuum. Therefore the Uncertainty Principle is not real in Einstein's sense. It is a concession to practicality.    If Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle violates the continuity of space-time, where is it? It must lie in a singularity in space-time. There is an introduction to singularities in \\"Elementary Geometry of Algrbraic Curves: An Undergraduate Introduction\\" by Christoper G. Gibson. A little more advanced and extended reference is \\"Singular Points of Plane Surfaces\\" by C. T. C. Wall. There sre easy discussions of singularities in cosmology in \\"Black Holes and Time Warps\\" by Kip S. Thorne.    It should be remarked that the surface in the vicinity of a singularity may not be perfectly spherical, it may be distorted. As I undersand it, the accomodation will not be entirely local, and so there is Non-Locality. The extended accomodation is not a result of a spreading in time, but co-exists with the local distortion.    Hermann Minkowski is only mentioned in passing (page 39) in Quantum: The Great Debate. Minkowski was Eistein's mathematics teacher, and constructed the four-dimensional continuum that made general relativity possible. Einstein saw the utility of the continuum, and used it after Minkowski died of appendicitus. To understand the nature of Minkowski's further contribution, consider for the moment a sphere in three dimensions. Regardless of the north and south poles chosen for a coordinate system, the distance between two points, as measured on the sphere, will be the same. Minkowski discovered that the same is also true for the four-dimensional counterpart of three-dimensional space: the interval between two points (two events) is independent of the coordinate system. Could the whole of special and general relativity be deduced from this principle, and the fixed speed of light?
0446195529|5.0|I did enjoy this book. I had recently read the author's \\"First Family\\" and enjoyed it so when this one came out, I grabbed it quickly. \\"Hell's Corner\\" is a great thriller with Oliver Stone and the Camel Club. It is full of double dealing and double crosses so that when the ultimate double cross occurs at the end of the book, you are not really that surprised.<br /><br />David Baldacci has created an excellent novel of political intrigue and action occurring at the highest levels of government and the intelligence communities of both the United States and Great Britain. Joined by a highly resourceful MI6 agent, Oliver Stone (aka the former John Carr, a former resourceful spy and assassin)enlists the aid of his friends from the Camel club to solve a mystery triggered by a massive explosion in Lafayette Park across from the white House.<br /><br />The action culminates in Murder Mountain, the former CIA training facility for US assassins.<br /><br />Mr. Baldacci has done a great job of blending mystery, international intrigue,and action into a great book.

B0041KOVUU|3.0|As a longtime Pumpkins fan, I've always embraced the material as it arrived judged it accordingly after a few listens. Fortunately, the ambitious \\"Teargarden\\" project has given fans a chance to absorb the merits and faults of each song long before they are sold as a cohesive unit, or in this case, a series of cohesive units.     Vol. II is obviously a different animal from Vol. I; the latter sounded like a (barebones) outfit finding its voice again, and the results were obviously mixed. However, the songs on this EP showcase a sound that's becoming more dynamic and adventurous. In my opinion, \\"Tom Tom\\" is the best track on this EP because it comes the closest to capturing the spirit of the 90's without rehashing it. Also, it's the best track lyrically, which brings me to justify the three star rating. As good as this EP is in terms of sound, it's still struggling in the lyrics department. Anyone who's appreciated at least one Pumpkins album (even the \\"American Gothic\\" EP) will know that Billy Corgan crafts strong, thoughtful lyrics for each of his songs. Lately though, his songwriting skills (at least during the time these particular songs were made) have taken a backseat to his multi-tasking in the studio. I can't take anymore \\"La la las\\", \\"Sha la las\\" or \\"Ohs\\", and yes, they crop up frequently on this EP. The words are painfully simple for someone of Corgan's caliber, and as a result, songs like \\"Freak\\" are reduced from dynamic rock anthems to half-baked political rants that wouldn't even make the cut on \\"Zeitgeist\\".     Fortunately, this EP is the second of 11 forthcoming releases, and with two more members added to the Pumpkins roster, it's probable that the sound (and lyrics) will improve tenfold by the release of the third EP. All-in-all though, this release is definitely a step in the right direction and signals greater things to come. Be sure to listen to the songs via their official website before making your purchase.

B00402FGDK|3.0|Mine arrived today, and while the journal is nice, the only pictures of the cast are those on the cover (i.e. the little square box photos). The 7 disk DVD set is the same as the standalone set. If you can get the Gift set at a really good price, I'd say go ahead and buy it. However I don't know that it is worth the extra $13 that I paid for it. Could have been worse - I may have purchased it at full price!<br /><br />~ Edit 6 Jan 2011 ~ a little more detailed information about the product:<br /><br />Only difference that I can find between this product and the full Season 1 standalone set, is that the giftset comes with a journal. The 7 disk box set is the same as the non giftset version. When I compare the extras listed on the Disk contents list inside the box, they are the same extras as those on the non giftset version. The back of the Disk box reports that the contents are 974 minutes long - unlike what is reported on the Amazon listing for the giftset.<br /><br />The journal is approx 8 1/2 inches tall and 6 1/4 inches wide. It has a hard cover. On the front and back of the cover are little square pictures of the cast, each of them making an &quot;L&quot; sign with their fingers, for the &quot;L&quot; in the word GLEE. The inside of the journal consists of  (approx 100) indentical blank lined pages, with the word GLEE printed in the bottom corner of each page. The letter &quot;L&quot; of the word GLEE is made up using a generic hand. There is also a black ribbon attached to the journal, to assist with marking your place. The journal could be used as a diary/journal or just as a notebook for writing in. It is nice, but you wouldn't want to spend too much money on it.<br /><br />Hope this helps<br />Helen

B002HFP0R4|4.0|originally i wanted this to be the one stop ultimate Bee Gees box set especially since it includes all of Andy's hits, but after listening to the whole set, i get Barry & Robin's intention with this set.    this is not the updated version of 1990's \\"Tales\\" box set but like the liner notes said, it is personal favorites, one disc for each brother, a family album.  many big hits are here of course but some giant hits are missing.    Disc 1, head Bee Gee Barry's disc is almost a Greatest Hits, but the giant hits of How Can You Mend a Broken Heart & You Should Be Dancing are missing as well as Lonely Days & Nights on Broadway.  i think i could live with the latter 2 being missing, but i really do miss the former 2.  i could see where Barry had to make some tough choices & cuts not to just replicate a Greatest Hits, but i'd would have preferred that he'd cut the jarring, drum machine heavy of You Win Again & some other song to fit in the 2 giants.  still, of the 4 discs, i find myself playing this one over & over because it's simply enjoyable.    Disc 2, Robin's disc for me is like a trip to the museum.  good spots along the way but some of it dull.  Robin with his marvelously odd voice was the original lead singer, so the early hits are here.  i don't know who in the Bee Gees decided to switch Barry to be the primary lead in the 2nd half of their career, but that was a wise move.  one clear example is Robin singing Islands in the Stream.  it'd be a better record if Barry sang it.  however, i still found this disc interesting.    Disc 3, Maurice, the invisible Bee Gee is a revelation.  he is like the Ringo in the group, overshadowed by Barry & Robin.  in this disc we finally get to meet & hear him.  i find the songs here more enjoyable than the ones on Robin's disc albeit the hits there.  Hold Her in Your Hand was one that stood out for me & made me fantasize that had Maurice stayed around, maybe he could have led the brothers to a 3rd chapter, conquering country music.i will probably play this disc second to disc 1.    it's nice to have all of Andy's hits here on disc 4 with all the bigger hits front loaded on the disc.  the later sounds although good are not as memorable.  yes, he could have, would have been the 4th Bee Gee.  his voice is strong.    for the serious Bee Gees fan, this set is great, but for the casual fan, this set misses the the 2 key hits which makes the 4 cd Tales or the 2 cd Ultimate Bee Gees the better purchase for someone wanting a single set.

1591843065|5.0|Note: The review that follows is of the Expanded Edition, published in 2009.<br /><br />I read the original (published in 2008) and then this second edition with increasing admiration. As I began to work my way through Dan Roam's lively narrative, I was reminded of an incident years ago when a prominent venture capitalist found himself trapped by a young entrepreneur at a cocktail party. \\"This is my lucky day! I have been trying to get to see you for months! I have a great investment for you!\\" The VC asked if the young man had a business card. \\"You bet!\\" and offered one. \\"No, please, here's what I want you to do. Explain on the back of the card why I should be interested.\\" Astonished, the young man replied, \\"That's impossible!\\" In response, the VC said, \\"Then I have no interest.\\"<br /><br />In essence, this anecdote suggests Roam's key insight: To answer a question, to solve a problem, to persuade others, or to achieve another goal, express its essence. What the French characterize as a prec&iacute;s. For example, formulate it as a simple drawing. You may claim that you have no skills for drawing. That's good news. Why?  Roam asserts that less-sophisticated drawings have greater impact because those who see them can more easily identify with stick figures, for example, and focus more readily on the relationships suggested, such as between and among options to be considered, implications and consequences, and cause-and-effect relationships. Simple drawings accelerate both inductive and deductive reasoning.<br /><br />There is another reason that, in my opinion, is more important than any other: If the objective of the drawing is to simplify a situation (e.g. question, problem, opportunity, peril) by focusing on what is most important, a simple drawing is most appropriate. Roam agrees with Albert Einstein: \\"Make everything as simple as possible...but no simpler.\\"<br /><br />Throughout Roam's lively narrative, he provides his reader with a full complement of \\"tools\\" and carefully explains how and when to use each. They include:<br /><br />o The six problem \\"clumps\\" (i.e. who and what, how much, when, where, how, and why)<br />o Why \\"the hand is mightier than the mouse\\"<br />o Self-assessment exercises (e.g. Pages 26-27)<br />o A four-step guide to visual thinking<br />o \\"How to Look Better: Four Rules to Live By\\"<br />o \\"The Six Way of Seeing\\"<br />o \\"The Six Ways We See\\"<br />o What S-Q-V-I-D stands for and how to use it effectively<br />o The five S-Q-V-I-D  questions \\"in action\\"<br />o  \\"Whiteboard Workshop\\"<br /><br />Roam provides all this (and much more) in the first six of 16 chapters, then in Appendix A he identifies and discusses what he characterizes as \\"The Ten (and a Half) Commandments of Visual Thinking.\\" Again as he has throughout the previous material, he stresses the importance of mastering the basic skills of visual thinking and then apply them effectively guided and informed by these core principles:<br /><br />1. There is no more powerful way to discover a new idea than to draw a simple picture.<br /><br />2. There is no faster way to develop and test an idea than to draw a simple picture.<br /><br />3. There is no more effective way to share an idea with other people than to draw a simple picture.<br /><br />In this book and in its sequel, Unfolding the Napkin, Dan Roam explains how to achieve these objectives by (you guessed it) drawing a series of simple pictures. Bravo!o use each. They include:    o The six problem \\"clumps\\" (i.e. who and what, how much, when, where, how, and why)  o Why \\"the hand is mightier than the mouse\\"  o Self-assessment exercises (e.g. Pages 26-27)  o A four-step guide to visual thinking  o \\"How to Look Better: Four Rules to Live By\\"  o \\"The Six Way of Seeing\\"  o \\"The Six Ways We See\\"   o What S-Q-V-I-D stands for and how to use it effectively  o The five S-Q-V-I-D  questions \\"in action\\"  o  \\"Whiteboard Workshop\\"    Roam provides all this (and much more) in the first six of 16 chapters, then in Appendix A he identifies and discusses what he characterizes as \\"The Ten (and a Half) Commandments of Visual Thinking.\\" Again as he has throughout the previous material, he stresses the importance of mastering the basic skills of visual thinking and then apply them effectively guided and informed by these core principles:    1. There is no more powerful way to discover a new idea than to draw a simple picture.    2. There is no faster way to develop and test an idea than to draw a simple picture.    3. There is no more effective way to share an idea with other people than to draw a simple picture.    In this book and in its sequel, Unfolding the Napkin, Dan Roam explains how to achieve these objectives by (you guessed it) drawing a series of simple pictures. Bravo!
B00000163G|5.0|I bought this cd used. Really great since I only bought the album to put on my computer. It was in great shape for being used.
B00275EHJG|5.0|Not as fast-paced funny as the other two, but still a very good movie for all.  Very entertaining and gives you some warm fuzzies too.  Plenty of details in reviews of others so I'll just say that pre-schooler, teens and parents all liked it a lot.
B000HLDFK4|5.0|This is one of those movies that requires one to accept a certain set of premises; if you can do that, you're in, if you can't, you're out. Both my wife and I were able to accept the fantasy elements of the movie so we wound up really enjoying it.<br /><br />This movie brings Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves back together for the first time since \\"Speed\\" in 1994. Together they create a compelling chemistry which held our attention completely; it created a concern for them and the awkward situation in which they found themselves.<br /><br />This is a good family movie that brings excitement and suspense to the viewer with the bonus of a happy ending.<br /><br />I recommend it highly!
B0042816YK|2.0|Julie Roberts is a talented actress, and as such, she should have known better than to do this movie.  I read the book, which was tolerable at times, and other times just the author going on completely self-centered, bipolar mania rants.  The movie was far worse and far more dull.  The main character's selfishness comes out more as well.  By the title and plot of the movie, you would think the main character is out to find herself by losing herself in other cultures and finding solice in spirituality.  But in reality, she is on a vojage to Neverland to escape her problems like a teenager fleeing impending responsibility.  The movie portrays the irresponsible side even stronger, which makes the character completely unrelatable.  All the parts of the book where the character somehow makes progress to \\"find herself\\" and has moments of spiritual progress have been cut out of the movie.  This movie is rubbish.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|LOVE IT!!!! Took me all of 3 minutes to set up (most of that was getting it out of the plastic). I have a new(er) TV, which comes with the Optical Audio Out slot so the headset works with my Playstation, cable TV, Netflix, everything... The sound is incredible, was hearing noises I never heard with my surround sound system at home. My wife is especially happy, now she only has to hear me shouting at the TV instead of all the noise, explosions and player chat.  Highly recommended, especially happy with the wireless capability and the fact that the sound works for all my game systems and cable TV. If your a hardcore, even casual gamer or just love HD sound along with your HD TV, this is an excellent purchase!
B00009W0U4|4.0|This is one of the most difficult movies to watch that I have ever seen.  From the dizzying camera shots to the backward chronology to the initial seeming lack of a plot to the most brutal rape scene ever filmed for a motion picture - there is nothing easy about this movie!  (Except enjoying Monica Belucci's naked body later in the film.)  But it is a rewarding film, both artistically enlightening and a sharp kick in the gut.  Under no circumstances should you watch this movie with your mother, your significant other, or your kids.  In fact don't watch this if anyone else is in the room.  Just sit in a dark room by yourself with the lights out and a bottle of wine, and be prepared to have your brain smashed in by one of the most disturbing movies ever made.
B000002HPT|5.0|I became introduced to DT by the guitar magazines that transcribe songs back in the 90's. I listened to them just once in while but back then but recently have found myself becoming more insterested in their style. By comparison and in retrospect I think a lot of the appeal may have been an alternative to \\"alternative\\". DT seemed to have their own style but was at the same time a combination of all the best elements of Yes, ELP, Led Zeppelin, Journey, Metallica, Yngwie, Ozzy, Sabbath, etc. The main thing for me was that I didn't mind the excesses in this music because the level of musicianship was high and to a guitar player consistently challenging. Better to be excessive than to be retrogressive musically. Excesses can be trimmed if necessary. It was better for players to be able to play more than necessary rather than not enough.<br />I notice that as I listen closer to the band and read the reviews herein that I am impressed by this ongoin debate as to which are their best moments. I figure a band has to be doing something right to keep people caring about them. It's when people stop caring that they are in trouble. I like the contrast between the heavy and lighter stuff and the progressive stuff, even the longer pieces are sound interesting. This is one of their older albums so I'm sure that everyone who bought this before me is already familiar with it. As someone who is relatively new to listening to these guys I am impressed - this is great stuff.
B0040JHWKS|3.0|Since the boxed set and 2cd set here are both rooted in the song \\"The Promise\\", I had hoped that Bruce would have finally provided the definitive version of this song.  The bootleg version most of us are familiar with starts slow, then builds in intensity.  Bruce thought this version was plodding and heavy-handed, so he did not include it on the Tracks boxed set.  Actually, most of the Darkness album is plodding and heavy-handed, so it would have fit just fine. After public outcry, he re-recorded a solo piano version for the 18 Tracks cd which was dull and lifeless.  The version on this 2cd set has a different beat and tone and is somewhat new to Bruce collectors.  Bruce has then added strings and vocals to where now it would not fit on the Darkness record.  It is still a good song, but does not have the energy and emotion of the common bootleg version.  The Promise is one of Bruce's all time greats and deserves better treatment.  He should have included a couple versions of the song given the name of the set.  As a side note, the hidden song \\"The Way\\" should have its own track number instead of being spliced in at the end of the previous song.  I think it was on one of Bruce's lists for possible inclusion on the Darkness record and is as good as most of the songs on this 2cd set.  The other songs on this set are good to great.  Some have been tweaked and augmented, and some have been left alone.  But for this Bruce fan, Bruce has still failed to deliver The Promise.
0755338855|3.0|This review refers to elements specific to the edition by \\"Headline Review Classics\\".<br /><br />The story has a good premise but it isn't really realized, possibly due to the irregular format. The book doesn't read like a typical novel. Instead it is broken into several small, greatly overlapping parts each narrating the course of events as they were perceived by a character. The first section is told by the lawyer Utterson, who suspects his friend the doctor is being blackmailed by Mr. Hyde, then the reader is presented with the account of Dr. Lawson to whom Mr. Hyde's identity is revealed near the end of the events of the story and finally you get the story according to Dr. Jekyll. Mr. Hyde is of course uninterested in recording his experiences.<br /><br />The problem is that though the idea of building a complete narrative from various points of view is a good one in this case its done rather sloppily. The accounts are more repetitive than complementary and it isn't until the last one that the idea of the duality of man is introduced in a last minute hamfisted sort of way. It reminds me of the last chapter of Brave New World where Huxley decided to spell out what his book was all about as if it wasn't already obvious to the most disinterested of readers. The only difference is Huxley didn't need that chapter to explain his intent, where as the ideas Stevenson invoked weren't at all hinted at in the rest of his book.<br /><br />I've heard this book was written very quickly and surmise that it's parts are akin to the scraps of writing a writer produces in the early stages of writing to flesh out their thoughts and possibly rework to actually use in the story. But Stevenson never got any further in developing his novel, he just strung together the bits of writing he whipped out and called it a novella. It's a real shame since it's a good story and even with the horribly bad structure and organization you can tell that Stevenson knew how to put words on the page, even if he didn't bothered to put his words to unified purpose.<br /><br />The edition I read also included the short stories \\"The Body Snatcher\\", \\"Markheim\\" and \\"The Bottle Imp\\". These also had a tendency to ramble on longer than necessary. Perhaps he was paid by the inch? However they were better told and were fairly sophisticated horror stories with interesting premises. Markheim in particular is the sort of story that would be an interesting piece to analyze for a literature class. It touches on similar themes to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde but is exponentially better at communicating them.to put his words to unified purpose.

B003NFM3JU|4.0|When I saw this in the movies, I honestly wasn't so impressed with it. The movie itself has a feeling of redundancy. This story, while one of my favorites, has been done to death. And yes, in case you're wondering, I DID see it in 3D in the theatre. When I purchased this on 3D Blu-ray(solely due to lack of 3D Blu content so far), I was MUCH more impressed with the 3D at home. It just seemed to pop more. For those who are unfamiliar with the tale(i.e. small children), the movie will be a treat. If you own a 3D TV, this is a MUST HAVE, DEMO MATERIAL disc, no matter if the movie itself is merely good. Recommended!!!
B00275EHJG|4.0|First off, this is a great movie! I'm 31, and I still like watching Disney/Pixar movies.    I have a 4 year-old who really liked/likes the previous two installments of Toy Story. The only downfall in movie (beware, a spoiler is coming), the ending is a little intense. It does scare and concern my son. I'm sure he'll grow out of it in a couple of years.
B000006MS3|5.0|A perfect album, really, and hard to believe that it is not in print.  Kate Bush anticipated so much that would come in terms of creative, sharp, intuitive songwriting and radical self-production.
B00461BQC0|5.0|This is a really, really good if not great album. It sounds like a culmination of everything that Kings of Leon has been progressing towards throughout their discography. It is easy to listen to, has driving rhythms, and as usual the lyrics are wonderful and sung in a way that only KOL does. To all the people that can not accept what KOL is doing now, quit living in the past and enjoy the music that the band is producing now. If you like anything that these guys have put out I think that this album is definately worthy of some listening time.
1416550550|5.0|A most affecting and effective story.  The layers unfold one on another.  You are sure you have it only to have the secrets dissolve.  The ending is more than satisfactory.
0312370849|4.0|What a beautifully written book. Other than the obsession with finding Sarah, the story was believable and offered a glimpse into an event not much is written about.  Definitely a good read!
B000059XUI|5.0|My daughter will be glad we have a copy of this one, our old one was getting pretty bad. She will be happy to get it! Thank you.
B002H3F7F6|5.0|Despite an ego that might need an adjacent seat next to the man himself (and, truly, that often comes with the territory of great and interesting artists) and the creative ups-and-downs of decades of mostly-superb music-making, there seemed to be a lot of grumbling and complaining in some quarters about the whole of IF ON A WINTER'S NIGHT. The most oft-read theme seemed to be re-recording some tunes and the occasional vocal affectations Sting obviously felt some of the material demanded. I _love_ the album. I'm a card-carrying, Bible-believing Christian (and a musician who recorded and wrote most of my own Christmas CD in 2009). And I am TOTALLY happy with what Sting did here. Not totally Christmas-centric but never less than interesting and intriguing. Sting (as per his liner notes) is an admitted agnostic in personal faith matters but still, he also admits, is affected by the religious underpinnings of the Christmas season and its inspired-by body of art and music. For my money, the BEST thing here ... and for goodness sakes' at least spend the 99-cents and be happy ... is CHRISTMAS AT SEA. Haunting, perfectly rendered, hypnotic ... to my mind one of the most, if the not THE most, fully realized things he's ever done. And, folks, that's a tremendous amount of fine music spun out over decades that I'd have to put in line behind this track. To slightly alter Jack Nicholson's great line in \\"As Good As It Gets\\", artistically-speaking Sting \\"makes me want to be a better man\\"!
B00015YVD6|5.0|My daughter will be so surprised that I found the movie on your website that she couldn't remember the name of! Thank you!
B001P3SA94|5.0|The movie is great. I was a bit hesitant to watch it-- Beyonce as Etta James? But she blew me away with her amazing performance. As a Chicago history lover I was afraid of what they were going to do to the movie and of course there are inaccuracies and misrepresentations but if you watch if for entertainment it is amazing.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|One of the early reviews of this season said that \\"this is not my Doctor.\\"    Before I reply to this I want to establish my credentials as a Doctor WHo fan. I am 61 years old. I saw the original broadcast on 11/23/63  in the Uk.    I own every episode available on the public market and have seem most of the others, missing only a few early ones that are no longer in existence. SO I am not one of those people who say David Tennet is the greatest Doctor ever guys because, well, he is the main one they have ever seen. Actually he is a splendid chap, all of them as the Brig used to say.    So my reply to the statedment quoted at the beginning of this little review is that if this is not your DOctor then you never really had a  the doctor at all.    The writing in this last season has been the best ever in a single  season. And Matt Smith starts out a little off but by the end he is one of the best DOctors ever. Ever.    WHen AMy callled the Doctor back from before he was cut off behind the big bang by quoting, at her wedding the old wedding saying \\"something old, something new, something bottowed, something blue\\" the way she said blue and the way the Tardis appeared and she ran over the table to knock on the door made me and my wife cry because we were so moved.    Frankly I can not imagine how anyone could have watched this season and not like it. The standout lines and characters were just perfect. When River Song blew the hatch open behind her without even looking to see if the doctor was there to pick her up because she knew he would be was genius level detail. Or how about him saying to her later\\"honey, I'm home\\" and her rejoinder \\"but look at the time' and later her saying \\"rule number one, the Doctor lies.\\" He does you know but nobody ever actually said it before.Stunning    I feel sorry for anyone who did not get this season. They missed more than they will ever know and their lives are poorer for it.  Simply a masterpiece.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|I am not a science geek at all. In fact I am the opposite but still a post grad student and laugh hysterically at the jokes. I could not imagine anyone else in the roles. I am glad they eased up on Howard's dirty comments because they were boarding the line for appropriate on television. Penny is as blonde as ever and they go a bit into the history of the relationships (Sheldon and Leonerd) this season. Some may complain that it took until season 3, but it makes it that much better knowing who they are now. I am missing Leslie a little bit throughout this season. This show is great for anyone. I love it, my parents love it in fact I have not met anyone who has not fallen in love with the show. I hoping it will turn into our generation's \\"Seinfeld\\" or \\"Friends\\". It was a great breath of fresh air after the reality show mania, cop shows hogging the televisions and gory medical dramas with \\"Mc\\" in front of their names. You can come into the show at any point and know what is going on. Also I love that Bazinga is becoming a normal term!
B0002OXVDW|5.0|[[A    SIN:B0002OXVDW That's Entertainment! The Complete Collection]]           \\"memories\\" That's what I called my review, and why? because this wonderful collection revived memories of those wonderful times of entertainment that will  never be seen again, regrettably. And yet for just $50 I can now, at will,once again see and hear many of those great moments of great movies, brilliantly re presented. FIVE STARS and then some for me, all the way!! Thank you Amazon, for your quick and efficient service.
B0040JHXTI|5.0|A treasure-trove of great stuff by The Boss.  The box set debuted at #27 on the billboard 200 and the \\"Promise\\", hit #16, what a week for Bruce.  This is one of the best box sets i've gotten in 10 years!  Let's look what you get inside.    The Remaster of \\"Darkness On The Edge Of Town:    The re-master is a big plus over the 80's version, by a long shot.  It just sounds so crisp, instead of the muddy sound before.  Springsteen's and Van Zandt's guitars sound so good here!  You can pick up things I never heard before, just great.    The Promise (2cd the lost sessions):  Love this version of \\"Racing In The Streets\\", the 60's sounding \\"Gotta Get That Feeling\\", the Buddy Holly sounding \\"Outside Looking In\\", the 50's sounding \\"One Way Street\\" and the lost classic \\"Because The Night\\", nice to finally hear this played by Bruce himself, and his blistering guitar.  The mid-tempo rocker \\"Wrong Side Of The Street\\", the Roy Orbison type tune \\"The Brokenhearted\\", with those spanish horns.  \\"Rendezvous\\", a hit for the Greg Kihn Band in '77, here is a differnt version than on \\"Tracks\\", Bruce could of had a hit here as well.  And then the first side of the disc ends with \\"Candy's Boy\\", with Roy's organ grinding out on this track.      The second disc opens with \\"Save My Love\\", the first single released on this set, just a great little number, re-recorded in 2010, \\"Turn Up Your Radio\\".  Saw him perform this number on Jimmy Fallon excellent.  The bouncy garage sound of \\"Ain't Good Enough For You\\".  \\"Fire\\", which he wrote for Robert Gordon and was a big hit for The Pointer Sisters, here we get Bruce's original version, this also could of been a hit, great bass by Gary Tallent.  The beautiful \\"Spanish Eyes\\", \\"It's A Shame\\", a rockin' number, with the Big Man's sax doing what he does best.  A different version of \\"The Factory\\", with \\"Come On (Let's Go Tonight)\\".  \\"Talk To Me\\", is a jangly little tune, again some fine horns by Clarence.  The Roy Wood And The Falcons sounding \\"The LittleThings (My Baby Does)\\", the melancholy of \\"Breakaway\\", with military drums by Max Weinberg and tinkling piano by Roy.  A different version of \\"The Promise\\", that was on \\"Tracks\\", this would of fit perfectly on \\"Darkness\\", this version is so film noirsh landscape, this song fits like an old 40's film.  The epic sounding \\"City Of Night\\", has that mid 70's sound and the hidden track \\"The Way (You Belong To Me)\\", again the Big Man does a great job on sax.    DVD I The Promise: The Making Of Darkness On The Edge Of Town:    These are great films by Thom Zimny.  A f***ing awesome film.  A look back on the recording and trial and tribulations of the years 1976-1978, when things were simple, before they had family's.  Everyone that was involved in the recording, reflects what that could remember about \\"Darkness\\".  A great first DVD  88 minutes.  A surprising fact:  Bruce didn't like the sounds of most 70's recordings.    DVD II:  Darkness On   The Edge Of Town Asbury Park 2009 and The Thrill Hill Vault 1976-1978.    The first 2 songs \\"Save My Love\\" and \\"Candy's Boy\\", were filmed at Bruce's home studio in Holmedel, N.J. in 1976, Bruce shirtless abd working hard to be the rock star he would later become.  N.Y.C. '78, gave us his run down of \\"Don't Look Back\\", which The Knack did a tremendous job of on, \\"Get The Knack\\" in 1979.  And Bruce at the piano running through \\"Candy's Room\\", love it the power of the recording process.    The Thrill Hill Vault film is excellent during the Phoenix, Az. concert in '78. The film is a little grainy (but really good), kind of the Born To Run show in '75, but you must remember it was still 1978.  Great to have this stuff and a great mini concert.  Bruce really smokes on \\"Proof It All Night\\",(a personal favorite of mine) his youthful enthusiasm really shines on all these tracks. (The band still shows youthfullness 5 decades in).  Clarence looks good in his red leisure outfit and his fu-manchu.  Also chicks really love \\"Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)\\", they really go for the BOSS!    And then you get the Asbury Park performance at the Paramount Theatre, performed with no audience December 13,2009.  It's amazing after 31 years, these guys keep the spirit alive!  Miss Danny, but Charlie does a great job also.  Bruce can still weld a mean axe at 60!  Just tremendous intensity through out(hardly any band could do this).  Just a treat for fans and newbies.  A heartfelt show by the E-Street Band.   2 Hours.    DVD III:  Houston Bootleg House Cut 1978:    The picture is surprisingly good, when you think it's 1978 and a bootleg.  Excellent concert, nice to have \\"Streets Of Fire\\", \\"Point Blank\\", \\"Fever\\", \\"Fire\\", \\"Independence Day\\", \\"The Ties That Bind\\", the Booker T. And The MG's \\"You Can't Sit Down\\" and the amazing \\"Because The Night\\", with Bruce doing a awesome job on that guitar solo.  You also get an alternate take of \\"She's The One\\", Bruce really puts it all out there on the last 4 songs, \\"Detroit Medley\\", \\"Tenth Avenue Freeze Out\\", You Can't Sit Down\\" and \\"Quarter To Three\\", simply this show, showed they were here to stay!  The band in '78 were just starting to get hot, 32 years later there better than ever, I think.  This is such a treat for Bruce Springsteen fans, or if your just discovering Springsteen, get this amazing box set, it's just spectacular.  6 1/2 hours of DVD content  and  1 1/2 hours of music.    The Box:  Love the Notebook format (CD's and DVD's kept safe).  80 pages of notes, you can study this, what was going on inside Bruce's head at the time.  Like I said before best box set in a LONG  TIME!  (This took me 5 days to listen and watch).  Thanks again Bruce for a great look an amazing album, \\"Darkness On The Edge Of Town\\".  I wait patiently for \\"The River\\".
0312370849|3.0|I'm giving this three stars because it educates about an important historical event, it led to some interesting conversations with my husband, and the style is not overly-pretentious. It is written at the middle-school level, and would be appropriate for that population were it not for one expletive-strewn paragraph about sex and the persistent theme of middle-aged married life - a topic of limited interest to most middle-schoolers.<br /><br />Following the page-turner formula of tiny chapters alternating between past and present, Sarah's Key is a quick and easy read.  There are some editing problems and typos, which are annoying in any book.<br /><br />The most compelling questions raised by the book are 1) how do people react to the evil of others, 2) are complicity and apathy to evil in themselves evil, and 3) how should one react to those who are complicit or apathetic to evil?  The character seemingly based on Ms. de Rosnay herself, is a simple, upper-middle-class journalist with a gorgeous, vapid French husband.  The author's provenance (also hinted at in the novel) assumes well-bred young ladies will enter genteel, educated professions.  The writing style is often clumsy and simplistic, but at least it doesn't presume to be \\"literary\\" like the insufferable Sarah Dunant.<br /><br />Read it to learn something about the Vel'd'Hiv, about French collaboration with the Nazis, and to spur discussion about our relationship to evil.  If you're really interested in these issues, see Max Ophul's [[ASIN:B00005AFSL The Sorrow and the Pity]] and read Hannah Arendt's[[ASIN:0844659770 Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil]].  This book is a starting point for people who have no prior exposure to these issues.
B000002H2H|5.0|It seems like Metallica is turning into a band that you either love or hate as years go by. That's pretty sad, because the band is essentially one of the all-time great metal bands of all time. Some people will say that they're overrated. Well, I say that I still enjoy their music a whole lot. A majority of their albums are living proof that they can create powerful and haunting music. Ride The Lightning, the second album and the first without former member Dave Mustaine, is an all-around masterpiece. From beginning to end, it's pure brilliance. Songs like \\"Fade to Black\\" and \\"Creeping Death\\" are sure to please every Metallica fan out there. \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" is not only my personal favorite on the album, but also my personal favorite from the band themselves. It's five minutes of pure awesomeness. \\"The Call of Ktulu\\" is a 9-minute instrumental that may be boring to some, but I find the melodies and sounds to be completely engaging. In short, I won't describe what the songs mean or sound like, since I'm sure almost every reviewer on this page are Metallica fans. I'll just conclude by saying that Ride The Lightning is a great metal album.<br /><br />Grade: 9.8/10
B003VS0CX8|5.0|The 45th Anniversary Edition of The Sound of Music is fantastic. Didn't think it was possible to make a great motion picture even better. The color, clarity detail and music blew me away. I would recommend this DVD to any one who appreciates one of the greatest movies of our time.
B002SJKWZ4|5.0|My husband and I bought this as a wedding gift for our goddaughter and her husband. He's a harry potter fan and she's a gadget enthusiast. They *loved* it.     They use this thing so much that it constantly runs out of batteries!! Whenever we visit we ask them to bring the remote-control wand so they can use it to change channels while we watch. We've done this 27 times and on every occasion the wand is out of batteries--they literally have to take batteries out of their old remote--which, they assured us, they *never* use anymore--and put in the wand.     They love it to the point of being obsessively protective of it. With other guests around Rick (my goddaughter's husband) gets visibly worried and hides it for fear that it might get ruined by unruly guests. To protect it he temporarily replaces it with their old remote control which he keeps as a decoy to be used precisely in such occasions and which--he assures us--he hasn't touched since they got the wand.    In fact Rick has grown so attached to this thing that Tina (our goddaughter) hardly ever gets to use it. He won't even let her touch it! Poor thing! We suspect that she occasionally has to resort to their old remote. So last Christmas we got her a wand of her own. Her reaction? Speechless. As for Rick, the mere sight of a second wand shocked him into violent spasms of delight. Incapable of containing his enthusiasm, he excused himself and ran to the bedroom where he sobbed unconsolably for hours. Now that both had their own remote control wands we convinced them to throw away the old remote because--we assured them--they'll no longer it. My husband and I agreed that Rick was crying tears of joy.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Castle is a show that doesn't take itself too seriously and that light-hearted mix of comedy and self-deprecation are what make this show miles better than the thousands of CSI clones out there. While Castle certainly has it's mystery/crime of the week type component too it, it deftly blends in humor, a family we care about and that's relevant to the character, and never gets so serious as to be heavy. At the same time, the show definitely has it's intense moments, it's tragic moments and some moments that will move you to tears or laughter so it's certainly a show that has a lot of heart.<br /><br />Season two builds on an already very good season one and has some very nice stories, a few of which really kept me guessing till the very end. Overall, Castle ends up being a nice breath of fresh air in a TV landscape filled with paint-by-numbers crime of the week shows like CSI and it's clones.
0374158460|1.0|The summaries are appealing, but the reality is this book was a painful read. Our book club chose it based on all the hype and every one of us was disappointed.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|This was worth every single penny of the $120.00 I paid for it. Superb sound quality, best picture you can get for the series, OMG sound quality, and the packaging is fine. I got the silver box version and although it's not made out of bullet-proof plastic, like some reviewers seem to expect, I'm sure it will endure with no problems. Couple of less-than-positive points however:  1. When I received it, there were some minor dents in the packaging most likely occurred during shipping [thanks alot UPS]  2. In the blu-ray cases, the presentation looks fashionable but I'd much preferred if they kept each disc in its own separate sleeve instead of mounting it on top of each other; minor inconvenience however.  3. I understand they intentionally made the picture grainy as an effect, but sometimes I get the feeling like I'm watching an upscaled DVD, but then the next scene will come on super detailed and then I'm like \\"oh yeah, bluray...\\". At the very least you'll have the full comfort of knowing that you'll have the best damn looking grainy effect in 1080p.     If you haven't seen this show yet, get this. If you've already seen this show, get this. If you already have the DVD, sell those and get this. Unless you're the type that only likes westerns/oldies and despises anything with CG or w/ SFX or Scifi-related, this will probably be one of the best shows you've ever seen, if not the best.    Bottom line, I highly recommend it and think $120-150 is a good price range for it. It's like what..$5.70 per disc? For those patiently waiting for the price to drop lower, best of luck :D I'll just be over here watching some BSG RIGHT NOW hehe.
B004132HZS|5.0|I'm glad my husband got this for us to watch because I am loving it!  It is edgy and totally modern but not as graphic and gratuitous as many modern detective shows.  I didn't think I would like a present-times Holmes but they have updated him so well and it is a great show!
B004BSAHLY|5.0|The problem with kanye music from  here on out is that it will be an uphill climb. I loved this cd but I also loved 808s. Any time an artist tries something different and it sounds good, I love it. I dont want to write an essay on here so I'll make it simple for you. If you like kanye west, you will like this. If you want to hear something different than whats on the radio all the time and also something that make sense, lyrically speaking, than this is for you. If you hate kanye west, then why do you even bother?
B0042JTDXK|4.0|good but not his best.  i like his classical stuff better than his contemporary but i still enjoyed it.
0099456761|5.0|Loved this book. The voice. The perfection of details. The mystery. The real characters and their endearing foibles. Loved this book.
B003ZHQVJO|5.0|I have been a long time fan of Kid Rock, even through his screaming and cussing stage--But this album is terrific. It shows us what a star he really is. I can't wait for the tour.
006145205X|4.0|It's the material, not the message.  Even if you believe that Ridley overstates his opinions, as I do, and have heard them before, as I have, Ridley provides so much interesting material, in a clear, breezy manner, that this is a very good book.       I would like to point out, that thanks to the EPA, the US had cut sulfur dioxide by 40% and nitrogen oxides by 50% by 2006 (cited in Bloomberg, from 2007 EPA assessment), so the fact that acid rain hasn't been more damaging does not mean the danger was overstated.  More importantly,  it is widely accepted that action by world governments in controlling fluorocarbons prevented the very bad consequences of an enlarging ozone hole. On the other hand, innovation historically has saved civilizations from abuses of the natural environment, and innovation is what we need to prevent global warming, and what we should be concentrating on, rather than subsidizing costly alternative energy sources.  In a Wall Street Journal article, two experts in defense research suggest competitions for successively more efficient pilot plants, with the intellectual property developed government owned and broadcast.     Incidentally, while Ridley extols the benefit of trade, he still seems to think that agricultural innovations resulted in  large villages; Jane Jacobs, a pioneer in urban studies, years ago, explained why trade would lead to large villages which would then lead to agricultural discoveries and animal domestication.
0439023513|2.0|I Loved the 1st two books sooo much, that is why this book got a 2 star and not a 1 star.<br /><br />Spoilers:<br /><br />1st off..<br />Gale/vs.Petta I see why Gales Character became this guy all about the cause and making sacrifices for the cause, and being upset that katniss was acting cold towards her feelings for him. I hated what the author did too petta but I understand him coming back and hating her, but he works through it and still loves her.  I feel like the obvious reason she choose Peeta is bc she wanted to be the baker/artist wife not the military wife. If you went through two hunger games and a mokingjay do you really want to spend the rest of your life doing military stuff, no. The military life is something Gale wanted more than her even, so I dont think he would give up that life. Also moraly Katniss and Peeta were more alike.<br /><br />On to Katniss..She is sooo hot and cold, mostly cold. She seems like she is not in love with gale or ppetta the whole book. Even though she keeps the pearl on her that is not enough. Like why does she keep thinking it is okay for petta to die  if at the end she marries him and has his babbies and says this is how it always was suppose to be?  I know she voted for the hunger games for the capital kids just so she would be on coins good side. I loved her killing coin like that my fav. part. but couldnt they have also killed snow in a similar way. his death was anticlimatic.<br /><br />I am mad about the killing off of so many ppl, like finnick and prim, I think they were rushed and could have used more detail if they were going to kill them off.<br /><br />Why is the love business not in the book the whole time this squished in the last few pages? I could have used much much much more detail into peeta and katniss and them growing closer again. That made me the maddest.<br /><br />aLSO THE writing style is soo diff. from the 1st two not nessicarily bad, but kind of boring at times. To much details about war stuff, and not enough detail on love stuff.<br /><br />I demand a rewrite and lets pretend this last book didnt happen.a rewrite and lets pretend this last book didnt happen.
B000GTJT16|1.0|I did not realize that the category of HD-DVD required a specific HD player.  The DVD would not work on any VCR or computer in 3 households.  It never occurred to me that I was getting anything other than a DVD that was HD quality, rather a unique type such as Blue Ray.  Consequently, I cannot comment on the quality of the product I received.  The shipment time was as expected.
0374531269|1.0|Here is another book that I will not be buying until the publishers price it properly.  Is it really more expensive to produce a Kindle file than it is to produce and distribute a paperback?
0553805371|2.0|This book left me with the same questions, of creation, there not conclusion from those inconclusive theories of everything, he made a great attempt to conclude that quantum physics would apply somewhat to the macro Universe, nor would apply to pre big bang event.   You will find  contradiction from page one to the last page. Mr Hawking lay out a \\"grand debate\\", rather than explain the grand design with unprovent IF's. A grand disign, logically requires a grand disigner as suggested in the last page of the book (creating the book),human instinct recorded this very sense of our existence.    The origin of the universe got nothing to do with the reason of it.  He missed the point,I can not accept that my existence has the same significance of a worm.     I may suggest to Mr. Hawking , who has a \\"grand imagination\\", to take a solo fly to middle of the known universe,and ask himself \\"what the heck I am doing here\\"? why there is me, rather than nothing? and then give me the answer of his grand design, A to Z theories of everything for dummies.  Try again ....    Thanks profesor Hawking for the grand enterteiment.
0743270754|1.0|Here is another book that I will not be purchasing for my Kindle until the publishers decide to price it appropriately.  I find it hard to believe that it is more expensive to send me an electronic version than it is to produce and distribute a hard copy of the book.  Do publishers just not want business from Kindle users??
B001VNB54A|3.0|While I enjoyed \\"The Pacific\\", I compared it to \\"Band of Brothers\\" which I found superior. The pacific war is not as well known as the european war. Fighting in the pacific was brutal - Japanese marines and US marines fought til everyone was dead. I thought the characterization was weak - it was hard to identify the personalities and get any feeling for their personal situation. It was also hard to place the events - Guadalcanal, Pelieu - in the bigger picture.
B0042RUMEQ|3.0|This is a great CD release by the talented female rap artist & musician Nicki Minaj, titled, \\"Pink Friday\\". The CD has great electro-pop sound, 6 featured artists (Rihanna & Eminem making their presence felt), a fair share of swearing on many tracks & sampling of popular tunes namely, \\"Video Killed The Radio Star\\" by the Smashing Pumpkins is sampled for \\"Check It Out\\", a good pop track featuring Will.I.Am. & \\"No More I Love You's\\" by Annie Lennox is sampled for \\"Your Love\\", another good track. Other good tracks include \\"Did It On 'Em\\", \\"Right Thru Me\\", \\"Save Me\\", \\"Blazin'\\" (featuring Kanye West), \\"Here I Am\\" & \\"Last Chance\\" (featuring Natasha Bedingfield). Great tracks include \\"I'm The Best\\" (a great opening track with electro-pop sound, great rhyme, lyrics, vocals & harmonies), \\"Fly\\" (a great track with great vocals by the featured Rihanna, this is my favourite track from this great CD & hence the title of my review), \\"Moment 4 Life\\" (has great music, rapping & vocals, featuring Drake) & \\"Dear Old Nicki\\" (a great track with great melody & harmonies). \\"Roman's Revenge\\" starts as a rather weak track, but strong rapping by the legendary Eminem pulls it to a good track. Recent media reports suggest this track may be 'mocking' Lil' Kim, a rival to Nicki Minaj. On overall, this is a great CD release by the talented female rapper Nicki Minaj but she is not at her best, a recommended worthwhile listening.
B003ZK58WM|5.0|I have had my Kindle for the past 2 years, and have not read a \\"book\\" except on Kindle since then. I will go to Sam's and purchase the hardcover book.   AMAZON-THIS IS A RIP OFF ON THE KINDLE PRICE. Prices like this have me checking out Barnes/Noble Nook.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|I loved this season; it's the best one I've seen so far (of seasons 1-5). You really get a lot of insight into the characters' lives. Well written; wonderfully acted - I loved it!  Hopefully Brennan and Booth will get together one day...
B0001Z37HM|5.0|Did an excellent job sending item as soon as I order it! Only took like 2 days to get it!!!
0786955716|3.0|Be aware, there are no roof tops tiles in this package. The tiles I most expected and the ones I thought would be more useful where the roof tops. The cover shows roof tops for the pre order, but they replace it in the actual product. When I received it was with a different cover, without any roof top tiles.  It must be said that the box has rooftops printed in it. But you can't arrange them as you would with actual tiles. The tiles presented in the box aren't bad, but I see no explanation for letting the roof tops out.<br /><br />Edit: I changed from 2 stars to 3 stars after I used this Set. The tiles presented are very nice for building Taverns in doc areas. It's a nice addition for encounters happening down town near the city Harbor. At the end, the tiles are very nice and useful. The big complaint remains the lack of rooftops tiles, and the misleading cover.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift for my fianc&eacute;e. I gave this a 5 star rating because the gift itself was awesome! It arrived in great shape; packaged in two boxes, with cushion in between. Everything that was said to be included, was. The collection has so much to offer, it's difficult to figure out where to start! I think my favorite extra is the board game and playing pieces that come with it; I can't wait to play! The hidden disk was very cool to find. This is a great buy for anyone who is a fan of the television series, Lost.<br /><br />The only problem I had with my purchase was the wait; I selected the 2 day shipping and it took a fews days before it even shipped. This is my first purchase from this site, so this may just be the norm. Either way, it was worth the wait!
B003Y8YXH6|5.0|I have a confession to make: Despite the nice songs John wrote on this album, I've always hated this record, but I didn't exactly know why. After the release of this \\"stripped down version\\", I found out why: It was the over-produced, over-polished \\"pop\\" and \\"slick\\" mix of the album. When I finally heard the stripped down version here, I finally enjoyed and loved the album for what it is. I even love Yoko's songs!! For 30 years we've been hearing this fine album in (my humble opinion) an inferior mix. But now that Yoko has released the album in its basic form, we can hear and feel John and Yoko as close as next to us. I hope this album sells in the billions this time. Yoko has done a great job here, and done us all Beatle and Lennon fans a great service. .. And if you read some of my earlier comments on the works of Yoko, you'll see that I give credit where credit is due, with no reservations. Album highly recommended - the stripped CD only! Use the 1980 mix as a beer coaster.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Tasked with creating a holiday dinner and movie package for seventeen employees, I did an online search to discover that Love Actually, one of my favorites films, was developing a large and loyal following. Deservedly so. While it contains some adult language and images that prevent it from being a  \\"family\\" classic, it is the perfect date film whether you just met, or have been married forty years. Released in 2004, the film has held up very well.
B00005K9QP|5.0|When one listens to and appreciates John Mayall with Eric Clapton's Blues Breakers, it becomes easy to imagine the major impact that this release had in the history of popular music. Finally, someone besides Freddie King, Otis Rush, and other Chicago musicians was creating fabulous music within the emerging genre of rock blues! John Mayall, Eric Clapton, and the band add just a touch of jazz to some of their rock blues. Blues Breakers is a fabulous and innovative cd that one will want to listen to, enjoy, and appreciate time after time. Of Course, Eric Clapton's guitar playing is amazing, and John Mayall's blues singing and organ, piano, and harmonica playing are equally strong. Eric Clapton is also captured singing a song for the first time on a recording. The sound quality on Blues Breakers is also outstanding. For all of these reasons, Blues Breakers is a MUST BUY for those people who love THE BLUES. Although Blues Breakers is an innovative rock blues cd and From The Cradle (see my review) is a traditional blues cd, these two cds, at least in my opinion, are the two best recordings that Eric Clapton has ever made!    John
B000J10EQU|1.0|this was horrible they tried to remake the first superman movie and it did not work lex luthor is been done ONE TO MANY TIMES and to make matters worst there was no supervillian with superpowers to battle superman. i hope that the next film the is made superman fights a supervillian or more then one supervillian with superpowers. the director who did 300 is suppose to be directing the new film so it should be done right. one other thing that i hope is that all superman fans give the next film a chance. I do hope that superman fans check out allstar superman the animated film that is suppose to come out sometime next year.

1591391105|5.0|This book helped me in a new role with the company.  It applies.<br />What my experience again is that in the first 90 days many people just lay back and \\"learn\\".<br />But the reality is that they've got to get busy, right in the door!<br />This applies also to just worker level...if you have ideas to change processes, then the best time is when you first start on the job, or else you'll just get sucked into the old way, and could find yourself a victim of the next change.<br /><br />A good executive will evaluate the state he just inherited and clean house of those who won't fit his vision.<br />A good employee will be up on that, and adjust and know why that's being done.<br /><br />I would recommend the guide for both the supervisor and the employee.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|This is a great movie.  I never saw it before until I purchased it.  However this is a wonderful movie and I highly recommend.
B001EN71DG|5.0|Time and time again these movies never fail to entertain the imagination.  They are truly timeless! I can highly recommend this movie to anyone ages 8 to 80.  I love all of the HD enhancements & all of the extras on the trilogy are fun to watch. Can't wait to see what they come out with next.
B000SEI230|5.0|this wonderful book is by far my favorite book i have ever read. it is heartwarming, emoional and will change you life forever. i highly recomend you reading this book.
B002GNTDTI|4.0|I've decided that I'm going to try and post on every Smallville episode because it's a series I absolutely love and I think people would too if they gave it a chance.  The pilor episode is always a favorite of producer/actors because it's the BEGINNING of something they love, especially if it's a success.  This pilot introduces us to a teenage Clark Kent and the other characters that will play a crucial part in developing him into Superman...his parents, Chloe, Lex and Lana...even Pete Ross.  You find out that there is still a mystery behind Clark that not even he knows and this is what makes this episode special...because a teenage Clark Kent is simply that...a teenager with insecurities and we feel it.  You can't help but hurt for this young Clark as he struggles with his feelings and with his \\"abilities\\".  Give the series a chance.  I do recommend that people see the early seasons because it helps understand who he is in later seasons...especially those that include Lois Lane.  It helps you understand why he treats her the way he does, at least in this series...which is special.    Needless to say...my favorite seasons begin when Lois Lane comes into the picture in season 4.  The actress and character just bring in a lot of fun to the series.  I love every single episode Erica Durance is in...IMO...there is no better Lois Lane.
B0002W0ZRE|5.0|This is the 1970 edition of the Elvis Christmas album, which is Elvis' single biggest selling album in the US with sales certified by the RIAA in excess of 9 million copies. The original Elvis Christmas Album was released in 1957 and included 8 Christmas songs along with 4 Gospel songs from the \\"Peace In The Valley\\" EP. His original Christmas album was repackaged and re-released in 1970 with the 4 Gospel songs being replaced by \\"If Every Day was Like Christmas\\" (which was originally released as a single in 1966) and the non-Christmas song \\"Mama Liked The Roses\\". The 1970 edition was then re-packaged and released on CD as \\"It's Christmas Time\\" a few years ago.<br /><br />Elvis' performances on the songs here are excellent! Several of these recordings have become Christmas classics, still receiving significant radio airplay nearly 50 years after they were recorded!<br /><br />While this was a great album in its day, it has since been superseded. All the songs on this album are currently available on the Elvis \\"White Christmas\\" CD along with the 4 Gospel songs and every song from his 1971 \\"The Wonderful World of Christmas\\" album. I would recommend that you spend a few extra bucks and buy the Elvis \\"White Christmas\\" if you can still find it or the \\"If Every Day was Like Christmas\\" CD instead. You will get a lot more Christmas cheer!
B001TH8UUA|5.0|This is a great cable.  The quality of the materials is incredible.  They are flexible yet solid.  I consider them a great value.
0307341550|4.0|This nasty little thriller has it all. Brilliant first-person narrative, a beyond-dysfunctional family with interesting bizarrely damaged characters, self-mutilation, a hothouse small-town setting, and two girls murdered, who then have their teeth extracted. This is Gillian Flynn's first novel (I intend to purchase \\"Dark Objects,\\" her second); and it has a bit of the unsureness one associates with first novels. But the author knows pacing, and she has a tremendous sense of place. I, native New Yorker, felt as though I knew the entire layout of the small town of Wind Gap by the time I turned the last page.<br /><br />In an interview with the author that Amazon's posted, Ms. Flynn admits she writes without an outline, and that she wasn't sure at first who the murderer was going to be. It shows. The book is written in such a way that either of the two logical suspects could have been the perps. When the puzzle is revealed, however, you'll see that the author did in the end provide you with enough clues to prevent you from feeling (as is so often the case with second-rate thrillers) that the one who dun it dun did it because the author said so.

I love \\"What's My Name\\" and \\"Man Down\\" - I appreciate the return to Rihanna's BAJAN roots in these cuts. There are a lot of really fun tracks, you will not stop playing this album. The couture edition is awesome, and a definite way to show you're a die hard Rihanna lover. It's big, there's a great DVD and it feels like a serious darn keepsake. If you're not, get the regular version. Everybody wins. :-)
B0044XV3QY|5.0|This movie is AWESOME ! ! !      It not only shows man's inhumanity to man, it also shows his lack of responsibility for his own planet and all other living forms.    All those who only gave this movie 1 STAR are either anti-social, irresponsible idiots, or work for the American Military Industrial Complex.  One or the other.    If you've got the confront and the convictions of a morally ethical person, this movie is for you.  It is a movie about Ethics, Love & Community.  Mostly, it is a movie about the will to SURVIVE as an individual, a family, a group, and all living things.    This movie is AWESOME ! ! !      Watch it, and buy the special edition.  You'll be glad you did.    All the best,    Doc Shillington
B003FK8V7G|3.0|What strikes me about The Gaslight Anthem and their album \\"American Slang\\" is just how quintessentially New York/New Jersey they sound. There's nothing arty or pretentious about them, and their songs run on the same kind of fuel that fires up the best of Springsteen devotees. At the same time, there's a punkish element about the sound that puts them separate from the millions of Asbury Park wannabees. Mix in some Against Me and Thin Lizzy, and you get \\"American Slang.\\"<br /><br />There's a lot of braggadocio and bluster to be found here; nostalgia is a thing to be discarded. \\"God help the man who says if you'd have known me when\\" lead singer Brian Fallon snarls on \\"Old Haunts.\\" Like Springsteen, The Gaslight Anthem's kids are too busy racing in the streets or fighting in the rings (\\"Boxer\\") to worry about the past. There's a slugger's soul pumping behind the best songs on this album. There's also an ambitious band finding its core. On \\"American Slang,\\" these guys try to find out if it's buried in the heart of the Bronx, and make a glorious racket in their hunt.

B001TH8UUA|5.0|In my experience monster cables have provided the highest quality audio and video.  While there is a noticeable quality difference, the price difference is HUGE.  This cable does the job well, the picture quality is perfect (I don't run sound through my tv so I don't know how it sounds.  Unless you want the absolute top of the line and best quality cable (which you can only get by buying a far more expensive cable), this is GREAT value for the money.
B003NFM3JU|5.0|I really thought this version of A Christmas Carol was the best one. I espescially loved how they delved into the dark side of Scrooge and made his experience extra cathartic. I guess those who gave this film a negitive review just can't handle a realistic version.
0007270968|1.0|I really thought when others stated it was a 'quick read' that they meant it didn't take them long to read it.  As I had already read it in a day, I totally agreed.  Needless to say, I was very disappointed that this book was actually a 'QUICK READS book'.  As in, it's really a synopsis of the full length book.  Don't waste your money.
0670034711|1.0|In the 30 pages I could muddle through, my impression of this book was: pretentious rich American feels sorry for herself, so she goes on a world tour of cultural appropriation, goes to meet her guru (Seriously?  A WASP with a guru?), and makes buddies with a Balinese medicine man.  What?    This book reminds me of why I avoid best-sellers.
B0042JTDXK|2.0|I have been a fan of Groban's since Alley McBeal.  Have all the CDs and think he is seriously talented however.... this CD, after waiting 5 yrs., is very disappointing.  I have given it enough time before I wrote this review, thinking it would grow on me, since it is all I listen to in my car.  I just am not loving it and really not even liking it enough to download on my ipod.  All this anticipation and a lot of boring nothingness.
B00005214X|3.0|There are many great songs here, no doubt about that.  But this album has always been too long, too many weak songs along with the great ones.  ATMP could have been so much better.  Supposedly George included numerous songs written during his Beatle days but not released on Beatle albums, yet he left off several of those (including \\"Sour Milk Sea\\") that could have made this a better album.  And some of the songs he did include on ATMP are just a drag, or have some good ideas but need some editing, rather than droning on too long.  Love it or not, that's the original ATMP.<br /><br />The tragedy of this ATMP release is that the sound of nearly all the tracks lack clarity; I feel a good turntable using the original LPs should sound much better than this (and yes I have heard this on the original LPs).  In the liner notes for this edition of ATMP, George comments that he resisted the temptation to remix the entire album, instead relying on the finished masters (as mixed by Phil Spector).  That's a shame, because we can hear much more clarity on the tracks George did mix himself, i.e. those which were not on the original LP set (but were recorded during the ATMP sessions).<br /><br />What could have been done here would be to include both the original LP set via a good \\"needle drop\\" digital conversion to CD, and then also include the original recordings remixed, possibly also including some or all of the demos for this album.  But no, we don't have that here, thus I give this 3 stars, sorry.  Although George Harrison fans should still get this, don't expect too much.  I feel there are much more enjoyable albums from George, including \\"Thirty Three & 1/3\\", \\"Cloud Nine\\", \\"Live in Japan\\", and the compilation (aka \\"Best of\\") albums.
B0029O08WA|4.0|Great soundtrack but then I buy a lot of soundtracks if they are good.  Not for the younger fans because there aren't many songs with words.
0062502182|1.0|This review is about as rich and engaging as the book is. I was forced to read it for an activity I am reading, and the minute I read a few paragraphs, my heart sank. I knew I had to continue on with this book, in order to teach it. Despair does not even describe how I feel now, as I go to try and teach a book I could not even bring myself to read.

And interesting recipes that you can actually prepare because you've already got the items in the fridge and pantry. AND the gorgeous presentation (check out the look inside feature here on Amazon to see for yourself!) make this a \\"must-get\\" and a \\"keeper\\"!
0385732554|5.0|I will admit that this book is strange, disturbing and sad.  I have no children, so I cannot say I recommend this for under 13 readers.  Though I guess I would say to parents of under 13 to read before letting your kids read.<br /><br />That being said, this was a fantastic book with an ending that left me very moved.  Things that I didn't realize till half way through the book is that the utopian community can only see everything in black and white.  Like an old black and white TV sitcom.  There is no concept of color, only The Giver can see color.  When the Reciever of Memories is chosen to be the next reciever, he begins to see colors that no one else can see. He begins to learn the truth about life that everyone is oblivious to.  I don't want to say too much because I don't want to give anything away.  For example, take Adam and Eve....when Eve bites into the forbidden fruit, she knows all knowledge and everything is different.  The new reciever, inherits all memories of war, faminie, pain, suffering and what it means to love because 'love' is obsolete in the community.  It really is a beautifully written, somewhat tragic story about the burden of knowledge.  I read this book in one day.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|I'm not usually one to write reviews, so I'll keep this short: Community is on par with sitcoms like Curb Your Enthusiasm, Peep Show, and Always Sunny as the best comedy since Arrested Development.    If that praise piques your interest, you owe it to yourself to check out this show. It's filled with fast-paced, intelligent humor and genius ad-libs. The plots are occasionally as goofy and surreal as you'd ever hope to see, and yet it somehow stays grounded and shows true heart.    As already noted by other reviewers, the DVDs themselves are also amazing. The Kickpuncher comic is a cute addition, and having commentary on every single episode is a very nice touch. Be sure to check out the outtakes on every disc- there's a lot of great improv here.
0385342047|5.0|I'm not even finished with Mini-Shopaholic yet, but I'm already laughing so much that I'm ready to write a glowing review!  I needed a super-fun escapist page-turner with likeable characters and plenty of laugh-out-loud wit, and this latest installment has been exactly what I had been craving.  I love the whole Shopaholic series, but I was ready to be a bit disappointed with this one, because how can a writer keep that up?  But she did.  And I love that there's a financial crisis on, because otherwise it would have been too much of an escape, to the point of being annoying.  Instead this book addresses that we're all feeling a bit of concern with the economy right now, but we can still laugh!  Thank you, Ms. Kinsella!!
B0000AUHPG|5.0|Once Upon a Time in the West is a mythical masterwork by one of the greatest and most creative film technicians ever, Leone. The film is good almost beyond belief. The characters, the scenery, the music, even the dialogue is mythical - everyday people just don't talk like the main characters talk in this story - it is more like poetry. Early in the film, Harmonica says \\"I saw three dusters (overcoats) like that earlier today. Inside the dusters were three men. Inside the men were three bullets.\\" Or, toward the end of the film, Harmonica says \\"So, Frank, you found out that you're not a businessman after all.\\" Frank shakes his head, \\"Just a man,\\" he replies.\\"An ancient race,\\" says Harmonica, nodding.  Similar to one of my favorite books, the Lord of the Rings, I am drawn back to this film every few years for another visit.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|The dvds are awesome but there are plenty of bootlegs being sold by reputable stores. Amazon has the real deal!
B002ZCY7PU|5.0|I will say that the first couple episodes are hard to watch.  After watching season 1 and 2 you may be upset by the change in Chuck and Sarah's relationship.  But after the first couple episodes things start to fall into place and by midseason it is back to the show I know and love!  Chuck vs. the Other Guy is one of my favorite episodes!  I definitely recommend this item!
B000WQW988|5.0|If you are a Nirvana's fan you must buy it. One great thing is you have 2 version of the concert, the MTV TV version and the MTV live. The last one is longer since it is not cut between songs as the other version
B0044WUQ3G|5.0|I didn't know what to expect from this little movie, just saw it because it looked interesting and had a pretty good rating.  Glad I made this decision.  This is a good movie - maybe not the most accurate in terms of what exactly would be going on in a person's body during this experience (for example - would they actually keep their legs down all this time?  Would that not cause significant problems?) But do yourself a favor and suspend disbelief.  Get on the the chair lift, start biting your nails and be grateful when the tension is at last done.  Grim? Yes, but well worth the effort.
0811876373|5.0|But more than cute, it's useful and explains how to make every single pop!  I made the Turkey pops for Thanksgiving and everyone loved them and the directions were so easy to follow.  In addition, Bakerella gives you tips and advice as well as troubleshooting help.  When my melted chocolate was not thin and dippable, I learned that hotter does not equally meltier!  I can't wait to make more!
006145205X|5.0|This book was a very enjoyable read. The first half to three-quarters, devoted to the history and the mechanisms of human progress (increasing trade and specialization), are especially engrossing and insightful. The more forward-looking sections that follow may not be as compelling to you if you disagree with the book's implicit political ideology, but they are still very worthwhile. I thought this book was very well written and far less redundant than most of the non-fiction I have read this year. Highly recommended!

B004E9CFZG|2.0|What a shame. I watched the first episode because of the good reviews about production quality. Must agree with that! But I'm not into fantasy made-up zombies or vampires. Boring.  It would have been a great survival series if they had used real zombie-like humans as in \\" The Road \\".
B004BRP7R4|4.0|Everyone knows Josh Groban has the most beautiful voice in the world. Many people seem to have harsh criticisms of this album, but I think it's absolutely beautiful. It's so vulnerable, much more so than any of his previous albums. As opposed to Josh, the beautiful singer, singing another's song, he is singing his own. This album breathes the essence and soul of who Josh, the person, is. Couldn't ask for anything better :)
B004132HZS|2.0|I would have thought Dr. Watson more gay than Sherlock. Watson liked to tag along with some eccentric character, not the other way around. Just seems like a very imprudent plot development for the year 2010.

1439152780|5.0|I really liked this book as I have all three of Kate Morton's books.  She is an excellent writer and can keep you guessing right up until the end.  I liked how the book went back and forth between the time frames and it really came together at the end.  Excellent story!
0882709194|1.0|Creationists Ray Comfort and Kirk Cameron introduced this edition with a forward attacking Darwin's character and personal life in order to try to discredit him.    They could only get away with it because the original copyright expired on Darwin's book. Don't patronize these clowns, this is a work of Creationist Propaganda.
1597801585|2.0|I tried to enjoy this book.  After picking up the publisher's weekly review at my job, I thought for once I would read a unique sci-fi book in the midst of a sea of copycats and standardized storytelling.  It was unique....a unique slog to get through.  At times I dreaded opening the book, not for fear/excitement/etc of what would happen to the characters, but how much time would pass as I tried to advance upon the impenetrable prose.  I found the writing to be stilted and uneven, as if I was climbing a mountain and upon reaching the summit, realizing the the clouds obscured an even steeper slope to the top.  The author would almost certainly disagree with me but the novel falls flat; the book's idea had promised but it feels like the author rushed the final product without reviewing what went on the pages.
B004DMIIUU|4.0|Goemon is a Japanese folk hero in the tradition of Robin Hood -- fighting tyranny and robbing the rich to give to the poor.<br /><br />So he was inevitably the subject of an action movie, simply called \\"Goemon.\\" This sleek, stylized historical-fantasy movie looks a little like the ninja lovechild of [[ASIN:B00005JKEZ The Adventures of Robin Hood]] and [[ASIN:B000QXDED6 300]], but the mix of humor, romance and sharply-drawn action takes a shockingly dark turn in the movie's last third.<br /><br />Goemon Ishikawa (Yôsuke Eguchi) is a clever master thief who likes to give his stolen valuables to the impoverished. But fifteen years ago, he was a loyal ninja serving the brilliant warlord Oda Nobunaga (Hashinosuk&eacute; Nakamura) -- and after Nobunaga was murdered by a traitor, the disillusioned Goemon became a wandering thief and friend to the poor.<br /><br />That is, until a literal Pandora's box shows him that Toyotomi Hideyoshi was involved in his master's death -- the very man who is taking Goemon's childhood sweetheart Chacha (Ryoko Hirosue) as his concubine, and preparing to declare war using Western weapons. Along with his old friend/rival Saizo (Takao Ôsawa), Goemon sets out to attack Hideyoshi... but they soon discover that this path only leads to tragedy.<br /><br />\\"Goemon\\" is one of those movies that has a good-but-not-great script, paired with spellbindingly lovely visuals -- explosive ninja battles on golden rooftops, waterfalls surrounded by glimmering fireflies, and sea battles full of blood and fire. It's a pretty wild ride, and the only problem is that a couple of the characters feel unnecessary (the little boy Goemon rescues).<br /><br />The first two-thirds of the movie are a pretty steady stream of action, brief romantic scenes, and sepia-toned flashbacks of Goemon's childhood (and especially of the charismatic Nobunaga). But after that, the movie becomes much darker and bleaker, with innocent people being horribly killed and Goemon becoming a more hardened, dark person.<br /><br />Egichi does a great job as Goemon, both as the rakish thief and the tormented ninja avenger -- sort of like a Japanese Errol Flynn with a touch of Harrison Ford. He's funny, charming and eventually heartwrenching. Hirosue is decent, although she doesn't get to do much except wear enormous dresses and look sad.<br /><br />But honestly, the title character often gets eclipsed by Saizo -- this is a strong, tragic man who is torn between his old friendship, his intense love for his wife and baby, and his often nasty job. Osawa gives a beautiful performance full of raw emotion, which climaxes in an impassioned speech to the masses, apparently inspiring them to rebel.<br /><br />\\"Goemon\\" sculpts a folk legend into a fun, thrilling and ultimately tragic adventure movie, and turns out a pretty good movie while it's at it.great job as Goemon, both as the rakish thief and the tormented ninja avenger -- sort of like a Japanese Errol Flynn with a touch of Harrison Ford.

B004BSIJ9Q|5.0|Of course it is subjective but this album too me is Kanye West's most grand and ambitious entry in his music career thus far. One would commonly believe any artist mixing together so many types of instrumentals into one song would certainly be insane and perhaps Kanye West is but this album is proof that he is as well brilliant. Every beat is masterfully put together and from beginning to end the album has a consistent theme which blends seamlessly together. Yet again Kanye West has set the bar and defined the rules from which will be used as an example to make a successful and relative rap/hip-hop album. The question is, will anyone else have the courage or talent to take on that challenge and even if they do will they even come close to what Kanye West has done with My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy?
0786939532|4.0|I've remained a virtual shared world virgin for many years having only read two Star Wars novels and one ST:NG. At least from what I can recall, but the DnD/Forgotten Realms/Drizzt books were definitely new territory. That said I didn't enter Homeland with too many preconceptions, which was probably for the best.     I knew that Homeland was actually not the first written Drizzt book that was The Crystal Shard, but the first in a prequel trilogy to explain his origins.  At first I was surprised because Homeland begins before Drizzt is even born, but gives a great portend of the future in the actions that proceed his light being brought into a very dark world. Most characters in Menzoberranzan, the City of the Spider Queen, do bad things because doing good would show weakness which can not be abided. Salvatore has gone to great detail about nearly every facet of Drizzt's upbringing, which caused an immediate connection to the plight of this young Dark Elf. Homeland is not a challenging book in the least, but it sure is entertaining a good window into the Dark Elf society.    The underworld society is a place where malicious intent is looked upon fondly in this society and much revered if done stealthy. It was also interesting to see such a matriarchal society from the perspective of a young boy who is often left in the dark about the whys. The story is very politics heavy, which got to be too much at times. But when training and life beyond service to the aptly named Matron Malice of House Do'Urden gets going for Drizzt things move at a much quickened pace with the Swords & Sorcery aspect coming to the fore. The training of the Drow was particularly interesting and seems to be setting of things for the future.  Most of the other characters are not focused on enough to make them more than one sided, but Drizzt is the lone wolf you want more of as seeds are sowed to make him something very special, especially with his panther companion.    All in all Homeland is much deeper read than I expected from a shared world novel and certainly shows why Salvatore and the first couple Drizzt arcs are so well revered with its sometimes breath taking action that I know will only get better over the course of the next few books, but I'm hoping some of Drizzt's aloofness wears off as he ages.  With more than a couple hundred Forgotten Realms novels now out this story doesn't make me interested in reading a lot more in the wider world, but Homeland does make me interested in Drizzt's further adventures. I have a feeling I'd like to see him a little older so jumping ahead in the series (Crystal Shard maybe) might be in order as I'd like to get to more action instead of politics and family squabbles. This is a series the 15 year-old in me loves and I need to keep the slacker happy a few times a year.
0061537969|4.0|Being a new dog lover I was interested to read this book.  I could have done without the race car talking but I do understand how it fits in the story.  I feel in love with Enzo and was sad to see the book end.  I want a part 2 to this book!
B0009MDPYM|4.0|Family member possessed by demons? Call John Constantine [Keanu Reeves], a spiritual warrior for hire. In Constantine's world, shady dealers sell dragon's breath and holy water to people like Constantine, who can see demons in their true form, and battle them back to hell. But, chain-smoking, coughing up blood, it's not demons that are going to get him, it's lung cancer.<br /><br />Constantine isn't selfless, especially with death so close. He wants to win his way into the good graces of god, but no matter how many souls he saves, it's not enough. Or so his mentor, a half-breed angel-human, Gabriel [Tilda Swinton], tells him. Not until he stops squandering his gift (Constantine would call it a curse), and does good for the sake of doing good. But Constantine calls it unfair, and refuses to play. Gabriel has no answers for him--tormented by the demons, Constantine attempted suicide as a youth, and was dead for two minutes. For that sin, he is damned.<br /><br />The strange world Constantine lives in has become even stranger. Full demons are attacking him and others, something they are not supposed to be able to do. Half-breeds, part human, part demon or angel, can exist on our plane, but full demons and angels stay home, in hell or heaven. Constantine must find the reason for this breach of the rules before the worst of the worst cross over into our plane and consign all humanity to hell.<br /><br />Fascinating in the rich world that it creates, Constantine will keep you asking questions about good and evil, heaven and hell, and the power of humanity to choose.
1591843162|5.0|Quite simply, this was one of the most inspiring books I have ever read.  Seriously, I read a lot of books, and I often say \\"uh huh, this would help me do better\\" ... but this book actually caused me to change my behavior.  It changed the way I think about things.  Very powerful.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|What an excellent ending to a great trilogy. There was a few times I was nervous it was going to end badly, but my 6 year old who had seen it in the theater with her grandparents, kept reassuring me.  I loved it and thought it was well done.
B004B4RCDE|4.0|I heard a few of her songs on the radio like \\"what's my name\\" and \\"only girl in the world\\" and it wasn't as catchy as the songs from her good girl gone bad days. It's definitely less depressing than the Rated R album. I really thought this album was going to bomb too but I guess I grew to like it after listening to it. My favorites are \\"S&M\\", \\"cheers,\\" \\"man down,\\" and \\"california king bed.\\" I like how she brought the cribbean flavor to \\"man down\\" even though it's a song about shooting a man.
0061433047|5.0|I was a little concerned buying this one knowing about Terry Pratchett's current condition. There are so many authors who I enjoy for years and then their work just tapers off and isn't nearly as good as usual. Not so with Terry Pratchett! I love the Tiffany Aching series, maybe because the Feegles speak in a Yorkshire accent (or at least I think they do) and that's where I'm originally from. This is another really solid novel and I loved it. If you like Discworld, the witches series, etc. you will like this one. It's best to read the other novels in the series first (Wee Free Men, A Hat Full of Sky, and WinterSmith) and if you really want to \\"get\\" all the \\"in\\" comments, you should probably read the Discworld Witches books (Equal Rites, Wyrd Sisters, and Witches Abroad). All are wonderful books. Frankly, there's nothing by Terry Pratchett that I don't like. I love how he is able to keep the Discworld fresh and not use the same plots over and over. Pratchett really knows how to engage a reader and keep their interest. If you're new to Discworld, a good starting one is Soul Music. You don't need to read the Discworld books in order, but this is a good introduction to the Discworld. Note- The Tiffany Aching series is set in the Discworld, but follows characters not found elsewhere in the books.<br /><br />If you are looking at this for a child to read, be aware that this one does have some darker themes (****spoiler**** there is child abuse, mob rule, an attempted suicide, and a stillborn child). Granted, this is just one small part and it is dealt with very well, not in a sinister way. It is necessary to show the power of the \\"rough music\\" and what happens. It certainly isn't graphic and most happens off screen and you just learn about it through the bruise on the girl, etc.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this story. Terry Pratchett always has something to say, and some commentary within his books. This one is no exception. Very well written, and one I will certainly re-read.
B003UYV08E|4.0|OK there was a reason this movie wasn't nominated for any major acadamy awards.  It's not supposed to be over thought or made out to be something it's not.  Rather it is supposed to be enjoyed and the best way to do it is to sit back and watch the movie with a big bowl of popcorn because movies like this one are perfect for that.     The story is simply a continuation of the previous one. All of the performances are near to perfect and are very enjoyable. Micky Rourke does stand out and is always at his best when playing slimy greaseballs.  I was glad to see Nick Fury given a larger role in this movie which was enjoyable.  All in all this movie is fun.  Silly, stupid, non-sensical fun but fun none the less. Sit back and enjoy!
0374290024|2.0|Since this is a topic that I have been interested in for years, I bought this book with extreme enthusiasm.  I'm now on P.207, reading about water levels in the Nile in 2300 BCE, and am considering dropping this reading project and donating the book to the local library.  While much of what is being said is interesting, it has only marginal (at best) relevance to the thesis of the book. You need to get way past P.100 to even get to the existence of East and West; why cave paintings failed to move northward from their initial sites may be interesting, but I cannot see its relevance.  For someone who has more than a passing familiarity with history, this read can be very slow, repetitive, and yes, boring.  A much sharper focus would help the reader follow the thread better, and keep things hopping.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|This movie is a definite have-to-have for your collection.  Beautifully and sensitively done and sprinkled with humor.  Getting it from a seller made the price right too!

B00127RAJY|5.0|This DVD kicks my butt. At the end of day one I felt AWESOME, but I wasn't sore at all... until I woke up the next day. I feel the burn of the exercises ALL day, and I'm still sore from day one after one week! Jillian motivates you the entire workout to finish until the end. [\\"If you wanna look like this...\\"] I'm not big on most other workouts because all they say is \\"You can do it!\\" That's motivation, but Jillian gets into your head! It's also great because the workouts are under 30 minutes, so I can fit it into my babies' sleep schedules in the morning. I definitely recommend this to anybody who wants a good workout. [But you've got to want it, because you will be sore for DAYS!]

B0034G4OUO|3.0|I think this is a good action film and I do like the Rock Dwayne Johnson but man oh man he really needs some acting lessons. The Dwayne Johnson looks tough as nails and like he could take on 5 guys and win but can not pull off any emotion other then anger. The rest of the cast is great and this could be part of the issue since we have all these good actors along side one very bad actor, it just stands out more. Billy Bob Thornton pulls off his role as the junky cop with a checkered past and Maggie Grace is great in her role as hit man number ones wife.<br />Lots of action and a twisted up mystery is why you should see this film but most will figure out what is going on faster then they should. I myself like to guess what is going to happen and am always happy when it do's not go my way. Ignore the Rocks bad acting and see this film anyway, it's worth it.
B003UBTX72|5.0|I'd always thought of Richards as a talented albeit drug-addled rock star. Yes, he's done his share of drugs, but behind it all is a fascinating, intelligent man. Richards' candor about himself and his relationships (including his relationship with Mick Jagger) is refreshing -- he pulls no punches. Despite the angry rocker stereotype, Richards seems a trusting, forgiving soul. And throughout it all, it's not about fame... he genuinely loves music and respects the talents of fellow musicians. The book also references his serious head injury in Fiji which required neurosurgery, and how he moved beyond the injury.<br /><br />I enjoyed Richards' autobiography very much: It left me with a new respect for Richards, both as a musician and as a human being.
B003NFM3JU|1.0|I don't do many reviews but this movie was so bad that I had to. So many unnecessary and stupid variations from the original story. Dark would be OK but most of the dark parts were just plain stupid. Marley's mouth dropping open, Scrooge chased by red eyed horses, sliding on a chunk of ice and shrunk to miniature size? What? Just awful. This was a chance for Disney and the director to use the technology to enhance the story but it misses on so many levels.
B002VPE1Z2|4.0|This case is well made and very well insulated.  I ordered it for my Panasonic DMC TS2.  The TS2 is one of the larger pocket cameras and is waterproof, shockproof, dust-proof, and cold temperature-proof.<br /><br />There is not a thing wrong with this camera case.  However, I do not need all that insulation.  My camera is very well protected without it.  The problem is that my pocket camera is already a bit large.  I don't want to make it that much larger just so I can wear it on my belt.<br /><br />I'll look around for another camera case that suits me.  Just don't be put off by my report.  This camera case is a great buy for someone who wants extra camera protection.
B0042YHC38|1.0|This is a great idea yet this particular one misses the mark.  The band does not fit unless you are a tiny woman, even then it won't stay in place.  My husband bought it for himself and he couldn't even get it around his arm.  I am a little over 5 ft. tall and weigh 120 and this arm band just makes it around my arm.  Definitely a good concept, too bad it doesn't fit the average arm.

B002BU0DPE|2.0|Overall the px21's have great sound quality. It has a deep bass and i love the fact that you can control the level of game sound and chat seperately. what i dont love, is that not even a month after recieving them, THEY BROKE!!! when i was pulling off the headset by the ear cups as most people are liable to do... the left ear cup (one with the mic) snapped off the head piece!!! when i saw it, the only thing holding the cup to the headset was a thin plastic tube encasing the tiny wire... not what i expected considering the headset is 80 dollars from their website and the plastic around the tube is ginormously thick... if it were not for the shaudy craftsmanship i would have given them five stars but due to the fact that they couldn't even last one month under normal wear by an adult... anyone's better off buying a different expensive headset.
B00005JNJV|5.0|Read the comics for years, and have been disappointed with almost every single batman until this one (the Val Kilmer one was decent, but bad cinematography, it looked like it was a part of a big set, no realism).  This is the way I've always imagined the Batman, SCARY!!! Bad guys run away from him, he's your worst nightmare come alive; even Superman wouldn't take on the Batman without backup. Loved the scene where the Batman winched up the crooked cop and screamed in his face, that was perfect, that was what sealed the movie for me as the best Batman movie of all time, in fact the best super hero portrayal movie of all time.  [Have you played the PS3 game DC Universe v/s Mortal Kombat? the Batman and Liu Kang are the most fluid characters there.]  The rest of the cast is equally stellar, but its obvious who the lightweights are- Cillian Murphy and Katie Holmes. Michael Caine didn't fit my visual image of Alfred, but wow, what a performance in a supporting role; Morgan Stanley equally so.  I've seen the movie in the theatre and I've bought the DVD to see it again over and over.

B001GZ6QBU|5.0|The Chris-chris combo have done it again. This is how batman movies should be, gritty, on the edge and with a possibility that Batman might lose. The villains don't always have to lose in the end, this is not the Adam West TV series.    What else can I say? Excellent acting from all concerned, although in comparison Christian Bale looked a bit wooden :-O. Eagerly waiting for the Batman-Two Face clash.
B000002HMH|5.0|First of all, don't listen to the 1 star reviews. All it they are is a bunch of close minded metalheads who think metal is the only genre of music that exists. I would like to say I love metal, and it's probably my favorite genre, but I have a very open mind to music. This album is a masterpiece. Give it a chance. Some songs took some listens for me to fully grasp, but they all got a hold of me, excluding The Thorn Within. It's still an enjoyable song, but I wouldn't miss it if it were axed. This is still my favorite Metallica album to date. If you're expecting something like Megadeth did with Risk, you are surely mistaken. (although Risk wasn't THAT bad)

Don't get this video if you are going for an abs workout, you won't get it here.  The very first part of the workout in the \\"easiest\\" 1st level one is 30 full push-ups, which is difficult even for seasoned exercisers - don't let this make you quit!  The rest of the workout is actually easier, almost seems to be starting out the hardest and then working down, not sure if that is the best, but whatever works, I guess.    You are forced to listen to Jillian talk about how great she is for a couple of minutes in the beginning of the DVD, cannot avoid it and that is irritating.  She calls the two women working out with her, her \\"girls\\", and it is entertaining to watch the woman on her left, Natalie, phone it in at times she thinks the camera is not on her.  And she is the one who is supposed to be doing the workout the hardest.  Could have been edited or at least watched and parts redone before they produced this on a large scale, seems like low-end production, if you know what I mean.    Updated to add that after doing this for a few months I am taking a break, my knees sound terrible!  I am 5'7 and 130 lbs, used to working out on a daily basis.  Was doing this more to tone than lose weight.  My knees are making a terrible grinding sound and I have been diligent about not overextending when doing the numerous knee moves.  Worried this DVD has done some damage, am going to see a orthopedist.   Please be careful!
