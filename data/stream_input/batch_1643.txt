B000001FOS|5.0|Another metal masterpiece from the legendary Swedish guitar god.Yngwie J Malmsteen's Rising Force \\"Odyssey\\" most definitely does not dissapoint.From the always well thought,planned&executed guitar work of Yngwie J Malmsteen to the seasoned,skilled,experienced&masterfully performed vocal workings of former Ritchie Blackmore's \\"Rainbow\\" frontman Joe Lynn Turner I really fell in love with this studio album I thought i't to be certainly one of the best metal's album to ever grace my sense of hearing.And I don't say this litely being forty and having grown up during the hayday of hardrock&HeavyMetal in the \\"70\\"s the \\"80\\"s and the \\"90\\"s I can say with out a doubt this album is a solid piece of exquisitely performed heavy metal art work purchase a copy for own personal collection i'll assure you that you most definitely will not be dissapointed and this is coming from a guy that grew up listening exclusively to hardrock&heavymetal a must have for any serious fan of the genre.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|What an amazing story of personal triumph and redemption.  I don't think I've ever read a story of someone who had such great promise personally destroy himself and those around him, but then fight his personal demons and largely overcome them to be the best of the best the military has to offer both physically and mentally.  Most uplifting is the story of those who loved him, helped him like himself again, and ultimately rebuild him into a great husband, father, son and brother.  I read the entire book in two sittings within 12 hours of ordering it.  I literally could not put it down.  Buy and read this book!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love reading the Bible and thanks to this app I read everywhere I go...it's easy to used and finding scriptures also I live the listen to scripture being read to me. I pray this app sill be s blessings to someone else...God bless.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I do not normally buy books to read but this one intrigued me after the reports on the TV news.  I obtained an electronic copy and read it withing several days.  I loved it and it was hard to put it down.  It was so factual with no axe to grind.  It gives you real insight as to training and feelings of seals on a mission.<br /><br />I highly recommend reading it.  Enjoy!
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|great game! good story line and good graphics. kept me interested through whole game. best part was I never had any problems loading or playing this app.!!
0345803493|5.0|Sometimes when there is so much hype about a book one is left disappointed.  This is certainly NOT the case with the Fifty Shades books.  All three were fabulous.  I highly recommend them.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Good game. You do end up having to buy coins to get very far but I do enjoy the game.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|By the third book, the carrying on between the two gets old and boring. It should have stopped at two books.
B0094KF4WG|3.0|As I have a non military background, this novel provides an interesting insight into the training and equipping of today's professional soldier.  although the media hype raised the issue the book may have revealed trade secrets leading to a potential for  legal action, the book did not over step the mark any more than a Hollywood script.  An easy and quick read.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this app is really easy to use, and I love all the interesting things I can pin!! so fun to pin interesting things!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|this is one of the better hidden object games out there. its got a great story line and its a bit different so it is more interesting
B007ZCQJOM|5.0|I purchased the album after hearing \\"Myth\\" After one listen I enjoyed it, but felt that a lot of the songs sounded the same. After a few more times through, I can totally overlook this because all of the songs do sound nice and put me into a calmed state. The consistency in sound also allows it to flow well as an album, and I like to think this is part of a unique style the band has created. I've personally become a fan after this and want to go listen to their older albums and am looking forward to the next one.
B000GOVU3G|5.0|Very good acting and an interesting story so true to life. I especially liked the mother in this movie. It does have a sad ending and it made me cry, but like I said it is true to life.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|This book is poorly written and the story line is weak. I regret spending money on it and had I investigated the book more thoroughly before purchasing, I would not have bought it.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|What a wonderful rendition of Austen's novel. Let me first state, many people say \\"watch the BBC\\" version. Now I think that version has more details of the book, BUT there is also a big difference when you have 6 hours to tell a story vs 2 hours. Compare apples to apples.<br /><br />I loved the leads in this film. Matthew & Kiera brought such a youthful, freshness to the roles of Darcy & Lizzy, which fit more with the traditional characters and their ages. I could see & feel Lizzie falling in love with Darcy rather than just accepting she was wrong about him & his character. I thought they had great chemistry on screen. I didn't mind the changes made, it is after all an adaptation. They kept all the main themes & motifs of the original tale & that's what is important to me.<br /><br />The other principles chewed the scenery equally well, particularily the actress who portayed Mrs. Bennet. Loved her! Donald Sutherland, Tom Hollander, & Judi Dench--no words can do these people justice.<br /><br />The look of the film is exquisite & the music is extraordinary. A very entertaining two hours. If you're a lover of Colin Firth as Darcy & Jennifer Ehle as Lizzy, don't be surprised to find your image of the characters changing to Macfadyen & Knightly.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is wonderful! Many previous bugs worked out. I use it all the time on my Kindle and cell phone.
B003ZFCBJ0|5.0|What made this movie great for me was how much I could relate to the story. Miley Cyrus may not be the best actress but she manages to create this atmosphere of emotion completely surrounding you. Its impossible to watch this movie and not tear up at least once. Admittedly this story is a cl&iacute;che but who cares. All that matters is that is worth seeing and for those who based the movie rating on mileys past should understand that she engulfs herself in a project leaving you wondering is this the same girl I saw on the news hitting the bong. Basically you should watch it with a neutral feeling towards Cyrus you'll enjoy the movie more!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Enjoy playing solitaire it's a good game when I'm board.  I don't have to wait for someone else to take their turn.
0316228532|5.0|This book shows a realistic, slightly cynical, portrayal of people. It is in no way, shape, or form a sugarcoated version of a novel. I am ashamed that so many people are giving it low star reviews because they either a) don't like the price or b) don't like its Kindle formatting.<br /><br />This book does not need to be compared to Harry Potter, but it seems everyone insists it does. Go into the book with an open mindset, the way you should go into all books, and you should like it. It's painful to accept at first, but in the end you will lament that it is an accurate portrayal of the greedy, terrible human beings we have become. But do not be discouraged because to know despair, you must first know hope. Hope is abound in the book. There are people that you will find yourself rooting for to succeed, and the book benefits from this.<br /><br />The character development is among the most elaborate I have ever experienced. Over 100 pages into the book and I was still struggling to remember who was who. That's one of the greatest things about the book though. It feels so detailed that I almost felt close to some of the characters. It seems like they're all just a bunch of ants running around but it's okay that way -- it's how we are as humans.<br /><br />The book does not set out to be a feel good book. It's painfully realistic. However, the sheer number of problems, although realistic problems, seems unrealistic to be so abounding in a tiny town like Pagford. It's also perverse, but not unrealistically. It's perverse in a way that makes you go \\"How did you know I would think those things?!\\"<br /><br />The Casual Vacancy confronts the ultimate human dilemma: being human....being alive.<br /><br />So what are you waiting for?! Go read it! A book which has such mixed reviews means the only true judge of it will be yourself.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|catchy song.  although I am not a woman, I believe it expresses what many single women feel at times.  They want to get to know someone or they see someone or meet someone and would like to see them again but are hesitant, therefore the \\"call me maybe\\" verse.  They're not sure, don't want to appear aggressive or assertive, but then they do, but then they don't.  of course I am stating the obvious.  I'm sure it resonates with a lot of women and men
B006LSZECO|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a long time.  I read three or four books a month. I liked the characters at times they seemd likable and at times crazy/shallow people.  But don't we all expect someone to fill our needs and make us better?
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Another great book by Albom. His writings are always quite enjoyable.If you enjoy light fiction , this is a book for you.
0525953728|5.0|This book is one of the better written books I have read in terms of first person accounts of various historical events.  Too often I have books poorly edited, redundant and too centered on the author.  \\"No Easy Day\\" is a clear exception.  It is a fast and easy read that is pretty much impossible to put down once you start.<br /><br />And the inside story from one of the members of SEAL Team 6 is completely gripping from start to finish.  The training, planning and execution of the operation is compelling and gripping.  It is impossible to not feel the tension as the helicopter goes down for example.<br /><br />Highly recommended without hesitation if you like military books or other first person accounts of events.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I loved this book. It is gripping from the beginning to the end.  Fabulous story. Great characters. Cant wait to read the other 2 books.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|When is the next one!  Need more...<br />Never have been disappointed with Jack Reacher.  Love that man!<br />Hate to start each book because they are read quickly and am left with the need for more!
B005JE1KFG|5.0|As always the intrigue and depth of the characters just sweeps you long. The battle between Chade & The Fool for the \\"changers\\" loyalty is so well balanced and a continuing theme.<br /><br />Just love these books and hate to go to work as it interrupts the flow. . .
1401322786|3.0|I loved the idea for the book.  However, I thought the two characters that Dor encounters were pretty boring.  I guess they were supposed to represent everyman and everywoman, but they seemed very one dimensional.  My motto in life is Be Here Now, so the concept intrigued me, but although the message came through loud and clear, the road to get there was fairly uneventful and a bit dull.  Albom's writing is a bit too simple for me, and his bold \\"headings\\" throughout the chapters were distracting.  All in all, a disappointment.
B005JE1KD8|5.0|Was very excited to see this trilogy as have followed Fitz all the way through. Just engrossed - genius of a first book just makes you want to go straight into the second. .
B004UID2LC|3.0|it worked. then it stopped working. I cant view videos or download anything. it claims to be &quot;searching &quot; but it doesn't make it farther than that
B005JE1JZC|5.0|Piebalds, danger to the crown, the fool and Fitz being in the middle, hasn't he served the Farseers enough!. Not on your Nellie or even (Nettle). . . love it!
B005K2KCPG|5.0|Another awesome album from some of the greatest musicians around! Sammy, Joe, Michael, and Steve are great together and make an awesome team. I do think this album has a little more Sammy in it then the first. Loved the way the first one came out too. Great songs and some with a good hard hitting message about the state of our nation at this time. Check it out!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl is a pleasant summer read that has an excellent start but towards the middle loses some steam. The insights in sharing a life with someone were remarkably cogent, especially regarding the relationship between males and females. What we expect from a relationship, how men treat women and vice versa rang very true since they were so up-to-date.<br />Nevertheless, towards the middle of the book, the plot became more and more unbelievable making it difficult to identify with both the wife and the husband. The humor and insightful comments were still there but the reader tends to distance him/herself more from the main characters.<br />I recommend the book as a good summer read when you just want to put your mind at rest and smile every once in a while.
1594744769|1.0|I really tried to get into this book, but the more I read then more uninterested I became.<br />Def not worth the money or the time...
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I fell in love with the characters immediately and didn't want to put it down. I am excited to read the author's next book that takes the other character's point of view.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|My husband and I saw \\"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel\\" in our local theater over the summer, and we both agree that it was the best movie we saw this year. After all, with both Judi Dench and Maggie Smith, how could it be anything but wonderful.<br /><br />A group of cash-poor retirees looking for an affordable retirement choice head from cool and civilized London to the hot and crowded streets of India. Depending on a colorful (and somewhat imaginative brochure), they expect a luxury hotel complete with all the amenities. Instead, they find a rather run-down hotel, once a grand dame, but now a faded version of her former self. There are few amenities other than the dreams of its young and inexperienced proprietor.<br /><br />Many movies use the theme of a group of individuals from disparate backgrounds being forced together, but this film handles the conflict beautifully. Both conflicts and alliances are formed, hearts and dreams are broken, and, like the Phoenix, this hotel rises from the proverbial ashes to relive her glorious past. There are touches of both love and death, hope and loss, and beginnings as well as endings. Oh, and most of this happens to people who are on the other side of fifty, just to prove that not all interesting things happen to the young.<br /><br />In general, I am NOT a movie watcher (my husband will watch and love just about anything) and we don't even own a DVD/Blu-Ray player, but we just may need to buy one (along with a flat screen TV because we still have an old, small CRT) because I would really like to own this movie. It would be a wonderful replacement for Prozac. As the ads say, it really IS the \\"feel good movie of 2012\\".
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Great movie! Yes, Kristen is all doe-eyed and such but, the movie has so much more. Just watch it if you love the period age.
B008NR91DO|5.0|Ok so I worked last night 12 hours. I've been asleep for about an hour and the mail man honks his horn. I come back in the house with this DVD and that was 3 hours ago. Gary is possessed in this performance. Its obvious he cut his teeth playing some of Jimi's songs. Its none stop musical,mayhem bliss. He only stops once after about 4 songs to ask the crowd \\"How ya doin?\\" and rips off into another assault. Sure the drummer isn't quite right on \\"manic depression\\" but not many could get that right anyway. When Billy and Mitch take the stage I'm sure Gary was given another injection of power cause it shows in \\"red house\\". If you only Buy one DVD this year make it this one. Its a slice of history but the time goes by to fast... Thanks for reading... Aww finally bed time!!!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Contrary to Kellz's review, this app certainly did not come pre-installed on the kindle fire. As most of us know the kindle fire came with nothing more than a shortcut to facebook mobile (hence the reason it opened the browser...) this is an actual legitimate facebook APP, works just as well as you could expect, no issues so far. This is a reasonable alternative to those of you who are still running Amazon's android 2.3 gingerbread factory operating system and have side-loaded the facebook app from Google play (as it comes with auto updates instead of manual side-loaded) or those of you still just using facebook mobile and dislike it!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Hi, my name is Darneshia... and I'm addicted to pinning. I honestly hope that I never lose my pins. Love it!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I decided to read the first book in the series after watching the first season of GoT on HBO. I instantly fell in love with show and thought I would give the first book a shot. A friend of mine told me that they were difficult books to read owing to the fact that they have a large number of characters and frequently switch points of view. He was right but once I got started I couldnt stop. I believe it took me a little less than a month to read the book, which is quick for someone like me who has poor reading comprehension skills and not a lot of free time.<br /><br />Anyone that enjoys the fantasy/sci-fi genre needs to pick up this book. Interesting and deep characters, amazing imagery on the part of the author and plot twists that you will never guess make this book extremely hard to put down.
B006M4F67A|3.0|The latest update of this game has a couple of frustrating flaws. The worst one is that the game board now moves easily around the field, which makes it impossible to play quickly. Another quirk in this update is that now you can enlarge/shrink the game board...sometimes accidentally, which is quite disruptive to playing.<br /><br />Before this update, the game was great. I'm hoping the next update will correct these problems.
1451673442|5.0|I love all the books from this author. is a great book it looks nice. is just the reading that I like to do.
B00866H7SS|4.0|Very good, cant wait for the next one..Similar in story line to 50 shades of Grey but enjoyable none the less
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|American Horror Story defines a whole new \\"era\\" of TV. I am an avid horror fan and I enjoy everything from the serial killer, the monsters, the zombies, the suspenseful family-member related stuff, the blood, guts and gore, the Sci-Fi horrors, the ghosts....everything. This somehow manages to combine everything into one for the most captivating series that you just can't look away from. There were parts where I wanted to cover my eyes. There were parts where I wanted to cry. There were parts where I felt like I was part of the show and something would affect me directly. It has ties to real life things that go on, affairs, abortions, births, deaths, school violence, bullying, secrets, spousal issues...and makes them a million times more interesting. The actors were fantastic. Every main character in the show was Emmy-Worthy. The most exciting part of my whole week was waiting for Wednesday night at 10 to turn on FX to watch this show. The twists and turns and unexpected events that happen are just impeccably written and well thought out. It leaves you on the edge of your seat begging for more. Truly a 5 Star, A Plus show and I am so excited to watch it all again when I buy the First Season.<br />Sometimes when movies or shows produce a second season or a sequel, it falls flat and lacks the captivation that the first had. I know that this one will not have that problem and I can't wait until October 17th to watch.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book i never thought peeta would have lived!! katniss was a huge help for him! i am already reading catching fire the second book!!!!!! and i love it!! the next series im going to read by suzzane collins is the greggor series i hope it is good!!!!!!!!!
B005974CNA|5.0|This is a great album. I bought it the week it came out at my record store and a year later, I still listen to it regularly. From the opening chord of On the Backs of Angels to the epic chorus of Build Me Up, Break Me Down, to the prog metal-fest that is Lost Not Forgotten, every song is epic and fantastic. You will not regret this purchase!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Fast paced, well written novel about post 9-11 government programs. Although assumed to be fictional, this book reminds us that under the Patriot Act passed by Congress, many of our freedoms can be placed on hold by our Federal Government Agencies such as the FBI, DEA, DHS and others. Lee Child doesn't have Reacher fight the government, he just has him get AHEAD of the agency, FBI in this case which has mis-managed the monitoring and control of a terrorist cell providing financial support to other terrorist groups. Afterwards, Reacher, as usual disappears without a look back having accomplished his objective and leaving a core of dedicated and hard working FBI agents to clean up the mess others created.
B007TMON8M|4.0|I love this game, but sometimes I think the physics are slightly less than realistic. I very well could be wrong, either way this thing is challenging.
B004SDSSFY|1.0|Full of bullcrap app dont waste yiur time. Does not function like excel cant really do anything. Need a whole lot of improvements.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|good game fun with lots of killing and monsters.  shop for new upgrades up great equipment you already have<br />yes
B0087HT36U|5.0|love it. as fun as angry birds. works great on kindle fire. very addicting. cute fun entertaining game. make more levels
B0044WSF5M|5.0|Very good movie that the whole family can watch and enjoy.  The music is exceptional movie is a must see for anyone that was in high school in the 60s.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|pretty cool I guess as long as they don't make it impossible to play without spending a crap load of money.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|thanks for making this game it's great for those times you just want to do something silly.<br />a good time.
B009B50QOU|4.0|This album is censored!  Do not buy it if you enjoy your F bombs.  Although, if you enjoy music that has been changed from its original form, go right ahead.
B00004R99U|5.0|I'm soo glad to get Pocahontas 2. I already have the original and now I have both of them . There was a two disc set released with both movies , but I didn't want to buy another Pocahotas original since I had this one . I was very pleased that the sequel was on sale on at amazon.com , at a very good price. I received it in few days , the quality looks almost brand new and it was priced really good . Some of the stores in my area were selling the same movie at a much higher price. I'm very happy that I foubd this on Amazon.com Thank You very much
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book takes you on a journey of romance, mystery and suspense. It wakes up all your senses and motivates you to embrace and explore your libido. Once you start reading it you will be completely immersed in it.
B0099G3I96|3.0|Like most, I was super excited and had the release date memorized. I just listened to the album for the first time and overall feeling is: Meh. There are some good songs (like 4) that I will probably play on repeat. The album teases with some of No Doubts original sounds, but not many. Like most ppl said: pretty much a Gwen Stefani solo album, standard radio \\"New Hits\\" pop. If you like the standard Really catchy in the begining-could be the song during the montage scene in a romcom movie-mellows-slightly different from the rest of the album-then dreamy slow song flow, this is a cookie cutter album. Think Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus, Pink, etc. I'm glad I paid 5.99 on Amazon vice 13.99 at Target. Overall: Not Great, Not horrible.
B0087HT36U|5.0|great app. Its a something different than Angry Birds games.  Enjoy to play with different tools.  Try it!<br />You will find it a fresh exciting game.
B000K8EQ5W|4.0|This is a very entertaining love story with a great twist.  Very well cast.  Even the guys will like it.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I'm not sure where I learned about this, probably an amazon recommendation after having read the Farseer books.<br /><br />This is, by far, the best fantasy I've read in years.<br /><br />Others have written overmuch about the quality of the character development, comparisons to Robin Hobb, etc.  So I won't do that.<br /><br />But the wordcraft for a debut effort is startling.  I can't recommend it highly enough.
B009GEAPYW|3.0|Really three 1/2 stars... May swing up or down once we have the whole movie (parts 1 AND 2) to judge.<br /><br />So... BATMAN: THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS PART 1... Very satisfied in some regards, a bit bummed and underwhelmed in others. Strongest when it's focusing on Cary Kelly/Robin (despite one painfully bad bit of voice acting) and when dealing with the mutants. As with any film adaptation of a book I love, the question I have to ask myself isn't so much \\"Is it as good as the book?\\" (these things must be judged on their own merits and all that) but rather \\"If I didn't know the source material, would I still even get it?\\" Leaning towards: If you want a solidly fun, badass Batman movie, you got it... These yearly animated Batman features have been a joy, and this is a welcome addition. But if you're not familiar with Frank Miller's graphic novel, you'd be forgiven for not understanding why this is considered one of the BEST BATMAN STORIES EVER TOLD. As such, last year's BATMAN: YEAR ONE was way more satisfying, I dare say a cut above two out of three of Nolan's movies in many respects. This one, though, loses a LOT of impact and meaning for lack of Batman and Gordon's voice-over narration... Some visual sequences, for lack of it, became cases of \\"Why are we even lingering on this/why is this even here?\\" or (such as in flashback to parents' murder) \\"Haven't we seen this in EVERY OTHER screen Batman? What's this depiction add?\\" Inexplicable abridgments left the Two-Face subplot feeling almost superfluous... Harvey and his history are barely established enough for us to care that he falls straight back into crime, and there's zero suspense about whether or not he will. The more button-pushing controversial aspects are softened around the edges, but still very much present and not nearly as watered/dumbed down as I'd feared. Peter Weller has a fine Batman voice, except a bit too \\"zen old wise man,\\" not enough \\"Psycho-Bats\\" edge. Some key smaller scenes are rearranged a bit, in a ways that actually work really well. So does the split into two movies, actually. The fight with the mutant leader makes a fitting build-up/action-climax. Moving a certain cameo to the tale-end cliffhanger was a stroke of genius. Left me far more psyched for Part Two than I might otherwise have been... a reminder that this is, after all (much like Kill Bill) only the first half, and we won't truly have it in perspective 'til we're able to watch both halves.<br /><br />In the context of DC's animated Batman films so far, this felt weirdly as though it was trying to be more of a piece with UNDER THE READ HOOD than YEAR ONE, which isn't necessarily bad, just... weird (the Christopher Drake score - which realizes it's own tuneful Batman theme, despite still trying way too hard to sound like Zimmer/Shore in places - is a big tipoff).
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Despite what any negative reviews may say, this has been the best battery app I have ever used for an Android phone. It not only can have your battery level in the notifications bar, but also different widgets to choose from. Tons of customization optons, estimates on how long your battery will last and custom colors. I have tried other apps and I felt like they drained the battery more. I have had this for over a couple months now and each time I come back. I am considering paying the $2 for it like I did for the ChompSMS app. The developers deserve some credit here!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I am completely stuck on this game. its not as frustrating as the game u play at the fair. my kid even is loven the game.
B008F5YDRI|5.0|We wanted to see this movie because we really like British films and my husband is a fly fisherman.  We were pleasantly surprised that we liked it even more than we expected.  We found a warm, funny, even touching movie.  To describe it as a romantic comedy does it a disservice.  Excellent performances from all the actors, interesting scenery, an entertaining movie and I learned a lot about salmon to boot!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Fantastic accounts and very well written.  Glad to be informed, thank you!!!  I highly recommend this book to all who want to know the truth about Osama Bin Laden.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|The Raven's Shadow reminds me somewhat of books by David Gemmell.  Great character development in a fantasy story that is more martial than magic.  There is magic in this world, but it does not over weight the plot or character development.<br /><br />Some stories start out with a legendary character.  This story starts out with the son of a legend.  It develops this character from a scared little boy into a legend greater than his father.  It does so in a real and believable way.  You see his challenges, his flaws, and his humanity.  You see the difference between the man and legend, but in a way that makes the man that much more heroic.<br /><br />This is one of the better Fantasy books that I have read lately.  It left me wanting more!  The writter did not make the mistake of limiting  the scope of his story.  It takes us from boy to man, and through three wars.  The world that is created is broad and filled with potential and mystery.  5 Stars!!!
B004PR71JC|5.0|I bought this specifically for my daughter's Rio themed birthday party. It was a success. She loved this soundtrack. We play it in the car all the time.

0345803485|1.0|I bought the book out of curiosity as I was going away on holiday and because of all the hype I had read about 50 Shades I thought it might be a good book to take away with me. Yes it was in so far as it was a Mill & Boon type of story saturated with graphic sex scenes however, after sex scene number 5 or 6 the sex became so repetitive and boring that I ended up skipping the sex scenes to focus more on the story, which after book 3 was a let down.<br />The books are badly written with undeveloped and shallow characters. None of them really come to life and as for the two main characters Ana and Christian well, they are both so unbelievable that it beggars belief that E.L.James would want to write 3 books on two such insignificant people.<br />It seems to be targeting a very young age group, and I think it gives a very distorted picture of relationships where the focus on sex is so excessive that nothing else seems to matter. The two main characters are both so sexually charged that they appear to have orgasms every time they clap eyes on each other<br />I did read the follow up books 2 & 3 to see if the storyline improved but I have to say I was left very dissatisfied and disappointed. I certainly will not be recommending it to any of my friends.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put the book down! I didn't want it to end. very good writing...you have a picture in your head without the need for extreme detail. I would recommend this to anyone
B008220DIC|3.0|I really wanted to like this film.<br /><br />I'm a fan of director and writer Paul Thomas Anderson, who's had five years since \\"There Will Be Blood\\" to craft this film.  I absolutely LOVE Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman, and am also a fan of Amy Adams and Laura Dern and Rami Malek.  What could go wrong?<br /><br />Well, let me tell you...<br /><br />I was NOT a fan of this film, and it's a real shame.  While the acting was impeccable, the story line went nowhere, leaving me to wonder how a movie that ran so long could have so many holes in it.<br /><br />The opening thrilled me, even though there was much that had to be filled in by the astute viewer.  I didn't mind having to guess at the root of the problems facing anchorless ex-WWII sailor Freddie Quell (Phoenix)--there were enough clues throughout that I think a fair assessment can be made.  But it was how Phoenix displayed those trials through his body and face that floored me: his character is a man so uncomfortable in his own skin that he appears knotted. I will be shocked if he is not Oscar bound.<br /><br />As \\"The Master\\" of \\"The Cause\\" Hoffman, too, is at the top of his game, a charlatan who is so skilled with eloquent words and new age concepts that he carries himself like the cock of the walk, ebullient and charming and as smooth as the master salesman he is.  That his cockamamie \\"product\\" is as flimsy as gauze is beside the point: he tells his \\"patients\\" that he is helping them trace their souls through \\"trillions\\" of years of history...yes, TRILLIONS.<br /><br />That he--Lancaster Dodd--has a legion of supporters is not surprising; that he writes books, delivers lectures, travels, gains degrees, etc., etc., is not a mystery... snake oil salesmen would not exist without willing dupes eager to trade sane reason for quick cures.  What is fascinating is the interplay between Quell and  Dodd, both as a factor of the story and as two \\"masters\\" of their craft doing what they do best.<br /><br />So far, so good, as far as I have explained it.  Yet so much is left out or dropped from this tale that story lines are left hanging.  A minor example occurs in the opening scene in the movie: a shot in which a helmeted Quell peers timidly over a wall.  What that has to do with anything is absolutely unclear, and it is never developed why this navy man is seen as a helmeted soldier in the first place.<br /><br />Another, more telling one: the whole first two-thirds of the movie is wrapped around Quell's rampant alcoholism; yet at one point he is told to stop drinking and then the story line does nothing to detail whether he succeeds or fails.  That his behavior remains erratic is a non-clue: the movie has dwelled heavily on the details of his drinking, and then it is just dropped.<br /><br />There is a scene in which a furious Quell roughs up a person who questions The Master--what happened to that person, and to what extent the person was \\"dealt with\\" are left completely up to our imagination.  The same occurs again later in the film.  At one point there is a scene in which an important character sends signals that she is interested in an affair with Quell--what became of that, and why it was even included is a mystery.  The same goes for a scene in which Quell apparently imagines all of the women in the Cause naked.  Why is unclear.  One might argue that it is evidence of his intractable nature, but the scene is surprising and awkward and does nothing for storytelling.  Why it occurs there, at that time, seems ludicrous and smacks of sensationalism.<br /><br />There is a scene late in the movie in which Quell--who has run off from The Cause--is tracked down and is told that he must travel to England to see The Master.  Quell does, and appears shortly after in England (though the film does little to convince us that indeed this scene takes place there other than show some children in school uniforms).  Here  it takes only a moment for The Master and Quell to have their final scene, and without revealing too many details it is clear that all--The Master,  Quell, and the audience--have taken a long walk to nowhere.<br /><br />It is indeed a shame, for this movie began so promisingly.  That it had nothing to do with Scientology--which it was rumored to expose--is not the problem here.  What bothered me was that it was ultimately so empty...an exercise, full of effort, signifying nothing.ir final scene, and without revealing too many details it is clear that all--The Master,  Quell, and the audience--have taken a long walk to nowhere.<br /><br />It is indeed a shame, for this movie began so promisingly.

0316228532|1.0|I was anticipating the release of The Casual Vacancy because it promised to be an interwoven tale of the residents of an English village.  Yesterday I eagerly went to my local bookstore where there they sat--big, thick copies of this wonderful sounding story.  I picked up my copy, bought it, and returned home to began to read.  What a disappointment it turned out to be!  Sure there were lots of characters but I didn't feel any sympathy toward them.  And the language!  No thanks, I don't need to read all that profanity and tasteless talk. Why couldn't this adult book be written for grown-ups?  Why is something considered \\"adult\\" because it is filled with tasteless profanity* just for the sake of it i.e. the F bomb ad nauseum?  We expect our children not to talk that way and read that stuff but as adults we accept it?  I guess I had hoped that Ms Rowling's story would be along the lines of other British writers such as Rosamunde Pilcher or Maeve Binchy.  Oh well, I'll have to just reread The Shell Seekers or Circle of Friends.<br />One more thought, it is a shame that such a wonderful writer of children's books had to write her first \\"adult book\\" in this manner.  I wonder how many children will be so curious to read it and in doing so be quite sadly surprised and disappointed that their favorite author writes such garbage.<br /><br />*(In my original review I had used the term \\"bathroom talk\\" because isn't that what children get a kick out of--saying \\"naughty words\\"? The people commenting on my review were so fixated on that term I decided I needed to revise my point).

0060775858|5.0|My mom and aunt were on a mission to get this book for my two daughters this past Christmas. Since then I've read it to my girls (age 1 and 2) several times and always enjoy doing so. My now 2 1/2 year old loves reading it because its easy for her to identify objects and read back to me. Great for bedtime, excellent for infants and toddlers. Definitely would reccomend.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|An iteresting and exciting novel which is both informative and enthralling. The background commences just prior to 1914(the first of the trilogy)and now the second starts with the rise of Hitler, and readers are taken on a review of that event in Germany, the UK,the USA, Russia and Japan. The background is World War 11. Read it, enjoy and learn!

B007KOYEOC|1.0|I read the first book, and thought it was the most poorly written book I had ever read. I bought the second one, hoping the author had improved her writing style, and found it just marginally better (which isn't very good), although the story itself had gotten even worse. After reading reviews on Amazon.com I decided not to buy the third book. But alas, in a drunken stupor I somehow came to the conclusion that maybe the third wouldn't be as bad after all! Oh my, was my drunken inner goodess (irritating creature!!) terribly wrong, as the more sober me was very aware of.<br /><br />I have now read three chapters in the third book, and I want to drown my Kindle and never see that awful book again. The story is unbelievable, which would have been okay if it also wasn't unbelievably bad. The characters annoy me more and more by each page. Christian had the potential to be a fascinating character, but the author hasn't managed to develop him at all. Ana is just boring, and I can't understand why Christian would fall for her. The sex scenes are repetetive, and unrealistic, and I've found myself skimming over them or not reading them at all.<br /><br />If people want a good love story, read the Outlander-series by Diana Gabaldon (so much more than a  love story, though, the books are romance (with excellent sex scenes), historical drama, action, drama, mystery, etc etc) instead. If people want erotica, I recommend the Sleeping Beauty-trilogy by A.N. Roquelaure (the pen-name of Anne Rice), ravishing books that don't pretend to be anything else but erotica, and excellent erotica at that ;)
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Loved it. Couldn't stop watching it till I was finished with every episode. Can't wait till season 5 comes out so I can stay up all night and watch it.

B004UID2LC|1.0|the app is not able to download any videos from you tube . it used to work but I think YouTube changed something causing this app to be useless
0316223239|5.0|I finished this book even before it was released for review, only to find that very special people had been chosen to review it before then. I saved my review until I was able to post, and here it is.<br /><br />When I first began listening to this book, the voice of a young child took me off guard and I didn't think I wanted to continue beyond the first five minutes, but something inside made me listen on.  At first, I thought it was a type of \\"bubble boy\\" situation.<br />I couldn't have been more wrong.<br /><br />As the story progressed,  Jack's  narration took hold of my entire mind and heart.<br />By the time I realized what had happened to Jack's mother and how he came to be, an eerie feeling crept over me and I knew there was no way I could not finish this story.<br /><br />Imagine being born into an  room that becomes your entire world and existence.  Try explaining the color  yellow to a blind person, or to a child who wants to know \\"why yellow is yellow?\\"  Try explaining to child who thinks that the things he sees on TV is fantasy or that \\"Planes do really exist!\\"  How do you explain to someone who has never been outside that there is in fact, an outside?<br /><br />The author Emma Donoghue does an amazing job transferring the total and complete innocence of this child to the readers. She makes ROOM almost a living entity because its the only place Jack knows.  His mom does a remarkable job of trying to keep him safe and out of the sadistic clutches of a mad man. How do you shield your child from sordid acts when the perpetrator could not care less if he sees or not?<br /><br />When escape becomes necessary, I found my pulse racing as I joined them in coming up with and executing their seemingly hopeless plan. Try to imagine the constant explanation to try and convince a five  year old that it will work and the things he must pretend to do in order for it to be a success. Try to envision your life without the only thing that matters, the life you brought into the world and the very real possibility that you may not see it again.<br /><br />ROOM is an amazing story and I suggest that you LISTEN to the audio version.<br />You will not be sorry and you'll get a whole other flavor of Jack's voice, his incredible maturity and tenacity of will.<br /><br />Ms. Donoghue ties up the loose ends and while she does not expound, the bad guy gets  his. My one little criticism was I felt the (SPOILER ALERT)  the post rescue suicide attempt was unwarranted.<br /><br />This is a good read and I highly recommend it.
B000002HMH|5.0|I used to be a metalhead. One of \\"those\\" metalheads. You know the kind: an obnoxious, over-opinionated elitist who thought my personal opinion stood as scientific fact as a general rule, and that anyone who even slightly disagreed with me or had more mainstream tastes was an expendable, inadequate baboon who should be studied at a science lab. Needless to say, I was just a whiny teenager who hated the world. I still love a lot of \\"true\\" heavy metal, but I've drifted away from the purists and have learned to take anything they vehemently spew with a grain of salt.<br /><br />Which brings us to the issue at hand: Metallca's 6th studio album from 1996, \\"Load\\", one of the most despised creations of bemulleted misanthropes worldwide. But does it deserve such a bad rap? Not in the slightest. True, the songs are slower, bluesier, and have a certain emotional candidness that seems a bit \\"soft\\" at first. But people, if you can ignore for awhile that it says \\"Metallica\\" on the tin, and all the heightened expectations that name conjurs from their 80's thrash dynasty, there's still PLENTY to like here.<br /><br />Don't expect anything resembling thrash metal. This was a daring experiment that covered a broad scope of musical tapestries, including blues, darker hard rock in the vein of Alice In Chains and even *GASP* country. \\"Ain't My B*tch\\", \\"The House Jack Built\\", \\"Until It Sleeps\\", \\"Thorn Within\\", \\"King Nothing\\" and \\"Hero Of The Day\\" are all great, but \\"Bleeding Me\\" and \\"The Outlaw Torn\\" are the album's shining opuses. If \\"Fade To Black\\" was instumental in making some people think twice about suicide, than \\"Bleeding Me\\" should do the same for those looking to get sober, a truly moving track. And \\"Outlaw\\" is a monster of a closing track that ends \\"Load\\" perfectly.<br /><br />I'd advise anyone who considers themselves an open-minded hard rock fan to check this out. And to the purists: please, don't ever change. Keep living in the past and keep laboring under the delusion thatyour personal opinion is rock-solid fact. You'll just keep getting mocked at every turn by the rest of us \\"sell outs\\" who've decided it's high time to GROW THE HELL UP...
B006LSZECO|5.0|wow, totally interesting and surprising, well-written, suspenseful, such a brilliant plot.  I could not put this book down, it was driving my husband crazy!  A must read!!!!
0061928356|3.0|Our large book group gave this high ratings for good story line and easy reading. We had a wonderful discussion<br />about the characters and issues in the story, which were enhanced by having one of our members married to a man<br />from India.

B008VSIAN2|5.0|After the death of Mac, I was a little skeptical about this album. I tend to be a purist with my bands -- feeling that swapping people out ruins the chemistry. Even when I first started playing March of Progress, I was startled by hearing \\"the Threshold sound\\" but with different vocals. However, after the standard \\"progressive 3-listen test\\", I have found my myself completely addicted to this album. It runs with the traditional \\"progressive but listenable\\" vibe that Threshold is known for. The songs are well-crafted, the solo sections are powerful but don't turn into a barrage of wandering notes, the lyrics are thought-provoking, the production is tight... everything we expect from Threshold.<br /><br />All things considered, I highly recommend this album.<br /><br />For reference on my tastes, my progressive catalog consists of Dream Theater, Circus Maximus, Vanden Plas, Sieges Even, Seventh Wonder, Rush, Queensryche, Redemption, etc.

B004LWZW4C|5.0|(This review contains minor spoilers.)<br /><br />I have to confess up front I'm a fan of the franchise. But given that there are now five of these movies I can tell you objectively that I'd order them as follows:<br /><br />1. First Class<br />2. X-Men United<br />3. X-Men<br />4. The Last Stand<br />5. Wolverine<br /><br />The negatives...include some plot gaps--never showed Magneto helping Prof X build Cerebro under ground, absolutely no indication in the original X-Men that Mystique was an X-Man, and the statement by Prof X in the original X-Men that he met Magneto when he was 17 (but in First Class he clearly is in his early-20s), among others--that make First Class its own story within the X-Men mythology and not necessarily a true prequel to X-Men. (They did try to stay somewhat consistent as Mystique becomes Magneto's buddy by the end of the flick.) I also thought it was odd that original comic book team members Scott Summers and Jean Grey were not part of this story. Perhaps they figured they needed to introduce \\"new\\" characters but in reality those two should have been part of it.<br /><br />...are far outweighed by the positives, primarily the performances of James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender as Charles Xavier/Professor X and Eric Lehnsherr/Magneto, respectively. Magneto is portrayed as a child abused by experimentary methods of Sebastian Shaw, a Nazi during WWII. Shaw, while different in context than the comics, was done creatively and Kevin Bacon nailed the performance; the handoff of power from Shaw to Magneto was also sensational.<br /><br />The bottom line is that fans of the franchise NEED to own this movie. It was unappreciated at the box office but is THE BEST X-flick to-date. (With the cliffhanger ending as good as it was I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE SEQUEL!)
B0091REZMW|2.0|games ok so far but a little slow.  I had to uninstall and reinstall just to get past the first room. also there is no main menu it took forever to turn the sound off
B0034G4OYK|4.0|Hotel Transylvania comes to us from the same creative team that brought us other big box-office, computer-animated hits such as Jonah: A Veggie Tales Movie, Astro Boy and Space Chimps 2: Zartog Takes a Drink, which I think is a good thing, as Martha Stewart would say!<br /><br />I saw an advanced screening of this silver screen gem with my amigos, and I have to say that all of us have not been as entertained as the last time we saw the latest release of Girls Gone Really Wild on DVD. But enough about us...on to Hotel Transylvania. It basically tells the story of Count Dracula (not the Bela Lugosi type, but more the Gary Oldman type from the ultra-erotic Bram Stoker's Dracula!) throwing a birthday shindig in order to commemorate the coming-out party of his only daughter, Beavis. She will be coming out as a 118-year-old lady vampire. Of course, this being a borderline-monster type of movie, all the guests are some of the most diabolical and horrifying monsters that you can think of, such as Nosferatu, the Basilisk, Satan himself, Goatman from Maryland, the Abominable Snowman, Nessie, and, in a totally weird casting move, Scooby Doo.<br /><br />However, along comes Jonathan, voiced by the lovably clumsy, liberal, Obama-supporting comedian Andrake Samberg. Jonathan and Beavis begin to feel sexually attracted to each other, which is where Count Dracula comes in: He tries everything in his undead and evil power to make sure that Jonathan and Beavis don't end up sleeping together! To do this, he enlists the help of Lon Chaney's the Wolfman and Boris Karloff's Frankenstein's Monster. The three of them ambush Jonathan, beat him up, and, finally, tie a block of cement to his feet and throw him into the Danube River.<br /><br />All in all, I thought that Hotel Transylvania's strength was to be found in its sociopolitical message, which is likely too lofty for kids to understand. The way I interpreted it, Hotel Transylvania is really about the \\"high life\\" in America and all of the greed, excess and obsession with money that goes along with it. See, some of you inobservant watchers probably failed to note this, but in the song that plays over the closing credits, there is the line \\"you can check out any time, but you can never leave.\\" I think this proves my very intellectual observation very handily.the greed, excess and obsession with money that goes along with it.

B0083SBJXS|5.0|Chances are, if you are looking at this page you have probably already seen the movie.  For any who have not, here goes.  First, you have to be a fan of superhero movies.  If they do nothing for you in general, this one probably will not do anything for you either.  That part of it is totally subjective, and nothing I say will sway you either way.<br /><br />If you are a fan of them, especially Iron Man, you will love this.  This can almost be considered Iron Man 2.5, given that off all the characters Robert Downey Jr. is probably in the movie the most, either as Iron Man or Tony Stark.  Even so, I think a good job was done giving the other characters enough screen time that no single character was the focus of the movie.  It is like the cast an ensemble.  The movie also presumes that you know the back stories as told in Iron Man 1 and 2, Thor, Captain America, and to a lesser extent The Incredible Hulk.  Not that you have to see any of those movies to grasp the concept, but it will help in knowing who the bad guy is, and how all the characters came to be.<br /><br />I liked the addition of Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner.  Even though I thought Edward Norton did a good job with the character, and would not have minded seeing him come back, given what he was rumored to be like on his Hulk movie I am not surprised that he was replaced.  One thing I did like about Ruffalo, is you can buy him as a normal guy.  He is not physically imposing like Chris Evans (to some extent) and Chris Hemsworth are, yet you bought by the way he played the character that he was dangerous.  I admit that I was, as a fan of the Hulk TV series, skeptical of a CGI Hulk.  It was not done all that well in the first Hulk movie (the forgettable one with Eric Bana) but has got better over time. And since Hulk is supposed to be 9ft tall, the only way to pull that off is CGI.  Plus they can make him move like no real person can.<br /><br />The script was very well done, which as any Joss Whedon fans cantell you was no surprise.  He brought the same blend of action, drama and humor (mostly involving the Hulk in the last 1/3 of the movie) that he did on his TV shows. I think it was written assuming the audience is smart and wanted a good story and good acting, and did not just rely on action, explosions and eye candy.  As I said, if you like the genre, you are most likely going to love this movie.  It looks and sounds great on Blu Ray, and is definitely worth a spot in your collection.
B005LAII8K|5.0|Looper is an extremely excellent movie that stars Bruce Willis, of that Academy Award-winning Hudson Hawk movie fame, and, even better, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, whom we all know and love for his appearance on Late Night with Carson Daily in the late 90s where he played a few chords from a guitar...early in the morning.<br /><br />The premise of Looper is simple, which is why it kept my attention to where I enjoyed it even more than Barack Obama's wealth redistribution scheme. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Joe, who happens to be an alien from another planet, other than Earth. Along with his crazy dad, weirdo brother and overly masculine older sister (who are really all fellow aliens on a mission to Earth), he lives in a house. Since aliens have to earn money because some parts of the Earth work on a capitalist system, young Joe has to get a job, which is what the titular Looper refers to. A looper is basically a glorified UPS driver who also moonlights as an a/s/s/a/s/sin of older people on the side.<br /><br />One day, young Joe meets Hudson Hawk (AKA, Bruce Willis), whom he recognizes as his older self; except, Joe's older self is now out work and can't collect Social Security because it went insolvent back in the year 2020 thanks to the Democrats always failing to address the insolvency issue. Upset at Hudson Hawk (AKA, Bruce Willis), Joe decides to k/i/l/l him, only to find out that the real enemy happens to be an extremely muddled and confusing plot in this movie!<br /><br />Now, I won't dare spoil the ending at all because I respect fellow moviegoers. However, I will say the climatic ending involves Joe, Hudson Hawk, several references to Obama deputy camping manager Stephanie Cutter, many unfounded accusations against Mitt Romney, and, ultimately, something about a \\"third rock from the sun\\"...whatever the heck that is!<br />All in all, I loved Looper, and I plan on buying it on VHS when it finally comes out on home video, several months from now!

I can think of several better choices to portray Jack Reacher.
B008220DGE|3.0|There's a lot of strengths to PT Anderson's film \\"The Master\\".  Joaquin Phoenix is simply brilliant and mesmerizing to watch as a mentally deranged drunk named Freddy who falls into the thrall of a cult leader named Lancaster Dodd:  Phoenix's expressions are captured like a Van Gogh self-portrait on film.  The cinematography is simple but supple, a visual feast of colors and contrasts that belie the complex psychology of the individuals.  Amy Adams is terrific as the loyal and domineering wife of Lancaster Dodd who single-handedly wills her husband to success.  And then there's the dark volatile chemistry between Freddy and Lancaster Dodd.<br /><br />Dodd anoints Freddy his guinea pig and his protege, and most of the movie is devoted to the eery tactics that Dodd employs to \\"make better\\" Freddy, mainly teaching him how to distort reality and how to disassociate with it, so that Freddy's anger and insanity become trapped inside with the intensity of a star that is about to go supernova.  What's intriguing about the relationship is how Freddy is merely an emaciated and erratic doppelganger of Dodd.  Both are insane and aggressive megalomaniacs in their own right -- it's just that Lancaster Dodd is more adept with words, spinning an illusion to snare those looking to be snared.<br /><br />But while there were many intriguing possibilities in the movie, it eventually spun out of control into incoherence.  PT Anderson is a master filmmaker, but \\"The Master\\" is self-indulgent, undisciplined, and erratic.  It was a chore to watch.

She is good...but<br />not good enough for this big movie.<br />But i still enjoyed it.
B002RVCD6O|4.0|Ah the Half Blood Prince, we're nearing the end.  This is after all the sixth book/movie in the series.  And if you haven't seen any of the others go do that first, you shouldn't be starting here.  It just doesn't make sense.  Moving on, I was a little more relieved to see that this movie followed the story better than the previous ones, but not nearly as good as the first few movies in the series.<br /><br />Voldemort is back and the entire wizarding community now knows it.  Still reeling from the loss of Sirius, Harry approaches school with a restlessness that can't seem to settle.  He also realizes he has rising feelings for a classmate and a rising hatred for Draco Malfoy who he suspects is up to no good.  Under the tutelage of Dumbledore he begins to learn about Lord Voldemort and start unraveling the mysteries of how to beat him.  But he's more dangerous than ever, especially with all of his followers free and eager to get at Harry.  Even Hogwarts is weakening in its protection of the students.  And it's hard to concentrate on school let alone learn in that type of environment.<br /><br />Characters:<br />Daniel Radcliffe:  Harry Potter<br />Rupert Grint: Ron Weasley<br />Emma Watson: Hermione Granger<br />Helena Bonham Carter: Bellatrix Lestrange<br />Jim Broadbent: Horace Slughorn<br />Robbie Coltrane: Rubeus Hagrid<br />Warwick Davis: Filius Flitwick<br />Tom Felton: Draco Malfoy<br />Michael Gambon: Albus Dumbledore<br />Alan Rickman: Severus Snape<br />Maggie Smith: Minerva McGonagall<br />David Thewlis: Remus Lupin<br /><br />Radcliffe did another fantastic job in this movie.  He really shows the maturity that Harry gets after the events of the previous year and what he's seen.  It was really neat to see him grow that way.  Grint and Watson were also good, just not as good as Radliffe, although they all still work marvelously together.  Carter as Bellatrix is always a hoot to watch, she's got the mad nutter routine down well and you can't help but giggle even if she is a bad guy.  Gambon really stepped it up as Dumbledore as well, he finally had that compassion that I'd come to expect from the books and he really looks after Harry in this one.  That and he is very very brave in the role he has to play.  The rest of the characters were ok, I enjoyed Luna Lovegood again and Ron's girlfriend is a sight to behold as goofy as she is.  But they didn't really take center stage and Radcliffe had the most screentime, as is proper.<br /><br />This one followed the book a little better, but it was still missing several scenes that really made the story.  But it did include some really good ones, especially the scenes with Dumbledore and Harry.  I appreciated that they took quite a bit of movie time to include those.  But still, there was a little bit of rushing in this story and I kind of wish with some of these books that they would have split them in two like they did with the last book.  I think it would have really made the series better, especially for fans of the books.  Regardless, the movie was still enjoyable and I can definitely see those who haven't read the book enjoying it completely.<br /><br />The special effects were ok in this one.  The details were missing again, and it seemed that the good special effects were only brought out for the big stuff (with the exception of the beginning in Fred & George's store, that was excellent).  I wish that they would go back to working on the details, it's what made the first two movies so wonderful.  The music was a little less in this one too, and even the starting song was changed slightly.  Not enough to really disappoint me, but enough that I noticed.  Overall, I guess I just have to say I wish they put as much care into this movie as they did the first.<br /><br />Still a valuable part of the series, and you can't watch the rest without watching this one.  It belongs on the shelf with all the rest.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012even if she is a bad guy.

B008602KQI|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. The action was great and the story is interesting. I never read the books. Looking forward to the next installment of this series.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Ok, so I may have teared up a couple of times, I admit it.  Yes, at a Harry Potter movie.  But that's ok, I have no shame, it was touching and I think it did justice to the finale of the book series.  If you haven't seen the other movies, don't bother with this review, go watch the first one.  They are meant to be enjoyed in order.<br /><br />Continuing where the first book left off, Harry and co have buried Dobie and decide to search for the remaining horcruxes.  This involves dangerous forays into Gringotts and also back to Hogwarts itself.  But there are secrets Harry must know, secrets that could effect everything that he knows.  Voldemort's army is growing and becoming more dangerous day by day.  As Harry searches for the remaining Horcruxes within Hogwarts, Voldemort starts battering its defenses for the final showdown.<br /><br />Characters:<br />Daniel Radcliffe: Harry Potter<br />Rupert Grint: Ron Weasley<br />Emma Watson: Hermione Granger<br />Helena Bonham Carter: Bellatrix Lestrange<br />Jim Broadbent: Horace Slughorn<br />Robbie Coltrane: Rubeus Hagrid<br />Warwick Davis: Filius Flitwick<br />Ralph Fiennes: Lord Voldemore<br />Michael Gambon: Albus Dumbledore<br />John Hurt: Ollivander<br />Jason Isaacs: Lucius Malfoy<br />Gary Oldman: Sirius Black<br />Alan Rickman: Severus Snape<br />Maggie Smith: Minerva McGonagall<br />David Thewlis: Remus Lupin<br />Julie Walters: Molly Weasley<br /><br />The characters, as usual, were wonderful.  All the actors are marvelously placed in their roles and never fail to please.  Radcliffe as Potter rarely fails to please and he plays a very believable Harry.  He made me feel like I was reading the books, and that's always a good thing.  What's great about Radcliffe in the role is that not only does he look like what I envision Harry to be, he has a quiet noble way about him that I associate with Harry's personality.  Surprisingly, Ron and Hermione didn't have as large of roles in this movie.  They usually have more of a part and while they were there, it just didn't seem like the usual showing of their characters.  The side characters were also well done and while I would have liked to see more of them, I was content with it how it was.  My only complaint on characters would be Voldemort.  He just didn't seem very menacing in this particular edition.  In fact, he almost seemed a little weak and granted he was enduring Horcruxes being destroyed, but I thought he would be a lot more violent.  The real standout character was Neville, just like in the books he showed a lot of bravery and fortitude in this one with his actions against Voldemort.<br /><br />The plot follows the book of course although there were some deviations.  But it didn't take away from the enjoyment and if you've only ever watched the movies, it probably wasn't even noticeable.  I still prefer the books (but then again I always do) but the movies are extremely well done.  Not only are they visually stunning with all the special effects, they do carry the plot well.  For the special effects the broom riding is always impressive, but they had a lot of other fight scenes and scenes involving magic that just couldn't be made without the effects. They did some really neat effects involving fire as well. As said before I even teared up at this one which its very rare a movie can make me do that. I just thought that a lot of emotion was portrayed and even though I know its a movie, I felt bad for what the characters were going through. The music too was great and is always very haunting.  Yet, it still fits the movies perfectly and honestly adds to it.<br /><br />Great finale to the movie series and much better than the first part of the Deathly Hallows.  This is one I'll definitely be buying when it comes out.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2011a part and while they were there, it just didn't seem like the usual showing of their characters.

B00005N6KG|5.0|These earphones are wonderful!  I have never had anything fit so comfortably in my ear.  You don't know they are there.  Set is light and just right for my usage.  Walkman while doing yard work.<br />Highly recommend.
B0067RQYNW|3.0|It is free so I really shouldn't complain.  The setup is good.  Easy to move around and work within.  I like its main page (library) where you can see all the documents.  Problem is when I want to send the document by e-mail, it just doesn't happen.  It shows as attached on this end(can see the attached doc.), but it does not show up on the other end.  The only way that I can attach and be successful is to go to the e-mail app, open it, hit write, hit attachment, then open Kindle Documents and attach.  I e-mailed Kingsoft Office about this.  They responded quickly and requested more detailed information.  I went through my attempt to e-mail doc. directly from Kingsoft step by step.  That was about a month ago..........no response.
B0080SZ0V8|1.0|What a game!  Totally useless on my device, a Motorola Xoom.  Why?  Well AzAdA (FULL) freezes at various points in the game.  when I first opened the game, I couldn't get past the main entry doors - the game froze completely before I could make any move - essentially not even allowing me to begin.  I tried to Reset it, that didn't work, so I had to shut it down.<br /><br />I started it once again; this time I was able to get as far as the title screen, before it froze/locked up.  The third time, I was able to get to Titus's book in his Den.  I opened the book was allowed to read a bit, then the game locked up once more.<br /><br /> This was getting old; I gave up - it just was not worth the aggravation.<br /><br />All I can say is that the software for this game needs to be thoroughly tested and validated, because right now, it's completely unstable on my Motorola Xoom.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|It is just like the coin games you see at arcades. It's fun but it can get old fast. I play it when I want something that requires no thinking.
B000RW3YYA|4.0|While this series hasn't reached the level as its predecessor overall the series does grow in entertainment and quality per episode, especially as we get some screen time with some of the other background characters in the series as well.  While the Wraith remain the primary enemy on the series we also get some intrusion from past enemies as well from G'aould to the Replicators as well as some cameo time from some of the SG1 team members too.  While Shepard is no Jack O'Neill he has started getting his own personality it seems that fits the series well and while the super model leader Teyla still feels unneeded she has become somewhat less annoying in the series as well.  If you have the Stargate series I say for the price these sets are going for that it's a pretty good bargain to add the five seasons of Stargate Atlantis to the shelf as well....
0066620996|5.0|This book: Good to great of Jim Collins, is the best book I've ever read on business mangement.<br />I owned many business in my life (I'm 59 yers old) and I've made all the mistakes possible. This book is a concentrate about the manner to manage correctly and in a vision of long term, based on intelligence and confidence.It's a concentrate about few companies which succeed over time and competition. Buy it, read all, and do what these few companies did.<br />Magellan Dionne, Québec, Canada
B003L77G6A|5.0|Fans of comedy rejoice as we finally get the fourth season of this hilarious entertaining series to add to our t.v. show library collection.  The series introduced us to a nice love triangle somewhat as Leonard becomes romantically involved with another woman and we see the small conflict this causes between Penny and Leonard's friend/couple relationship somewhat. The season also give our wannabe suave engineer tech Howard Wolowitz leaving poor Raj Koothrappali the single man out of the quartet for right now but you never know. The hijinx and situations these friends get into despite their intelligence always brings the hilarity and laughter as you watch the situations.As expected this season like the last three is filmed in front of a live studio audience so you'll hear laughter throughout the episodes and if you find that annoying then this series is sadly probably not for you though you'll be missing out on one great series if you do pass it over.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The beginning of mockingjay was kinda boring but part 2 and  3 were pretty good. i wish her and Gale had a happier ending
B002N5N4M6|5.0|If you already have started your collection of this hilarious series then there's no way you can miss out on the third season which continues to bring the comedy gold to this series.  The cast have such a great chemistry it shows in their work as the hilarity and entertainment grows by leaps and bounds and while will get some sticky and some dramatic relationship scenarios the humor that's intermingled just make watching this season all the better.Yes this series is filmed in front of a studio audience so if you don't like hearing laughter in some of the scenes this series sadly is one you might pass on but if you're looking for a great comedy series and can overlook your dislike for this one small point then a hilarious and enjoyable season and series await you.
B0087HT36U|3.0|fun alternative to angry birds. often glitchy - blow up a beam but the objects don't fall. kids love it
B0024FAR5M|5.0|sons of anarchy delivers a very gritty and entertaining look at a fictional motorcycle club. i am a longtime fan and lend my seasons to all my friends so they can get hooked just like me!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Twist and turns.  plots i wasnt expecting.   you cheer for Kat.  cant wait to read the third installment in this trillogy.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|this season is really good. i bought it and then watched it nonstop when i had the flu. it was a great way to spend a not fun situation. i cant wait for next season!
034580404X|5.0|Very very good delivery BUT the book was too repetitive on a couple of parts but it was okay. I think if it was christian's pov it would have been better :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|great game way better than block story it actually saves your game block story does not save and it keeps you busy you can play with TNT or hunt or kill monster's or you can mine
B00992CF6W|3.0|Id say, this game was rushed at first, working of the basic foundation of minecraft classic, but a few updates later and its as good as 1.5 version. But, seven dollors still isn't doing this game justice, I like how they added flint and steel to blow up Tnt and what not, but its missing a serious creative mode, or hell, even the ability to cook ores into ingots and ACTUALLY use a crafting table. but still, the fact that its minecraft and that its gotten much better from after day 1. only thing missing now, is a controller you can pop your kindel into and use thumb sticks to move rather than put your hand alover the screen.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|All i have to say is that this book is addicting. I found myself reading the book until 4:00 o'clock in the mooring on a work week and as soon as i wake up I'm grabbing the book. Awesome book i just wish it continues with Christian Grey point of view in the story.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It lets me know when to plug my kindle in and saves my battery power 50%. I really believe that BatteryHD&trade; works! And when I turn my kindle on its right there on the screen telling me the battery power.
0316228532|4.0|When I heard that J.K. Rowling was going to be writing an adult fiction novel, my first thoughts were apprehensive.  As the deadline for the novel's release crept closer, I finally buckled down and decided I would read it (although I'm super annoyed at the ridiculously expensive Kindle price for the book).<br /><br />Before you even read the book, if you are expecting a happy-go-lucky Rowling, you will be disappointed.  I made the conscious decision that as I read the book, I would not think of my Harry Potter author, but of a new author instead.  I believe that pretending she wasn't the author seems kind of strange, but it could have been beneficial to my enjoyment as I read.<br /><br />In \\"The Casual Vacancy\\" by J.K. Rowling, we are just introduced to Barry Fairbrother, when he drops down dead at the golf club restaurant in the small town of Pagford, England. The town erupts into a gossipy mess, struggling amongst themselves to determine who can fill Barry's position on the Parish Council.  The town is divided in this aspect, between two factions with opposite ideals for The Fields, a neighborhood filled with people on public assistance.<br /><br />\\"The Casual Vacancy\\" is a darker novel, with scenes involving sex, drugs, physical and sexual abuse, self-harm, and gossipy townspeople.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the novel, I'm not sure if it's a must-read.  This is a tough review for me to write because I think the book was good, kept me interested, and was an interesting way for Rowling to come out as an adult writer.<br /><br />Should you read it?  I think you should.  Will you love it and recommend it to everyone you know?  Probably not.  I'm left feeling not crazy excited about it, but not disliking it either.  I'm very much in the middle.<br /><br />What are your thoughts on J.K. Rowling as an adult author? Are you going to read \\"The Casual Vacancy\\"?<br /><br />Thanks for reading,<br /><br />Rebecca @ Love at First Book
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love this app! the only downfall is an excessive amount of force closes, but I can over look that. I love the share features and everything repins quickly. Huge Fan!
1594200823|5.0|I started the Kindle version over a year ago. I liked the style and was impressed by the information, but got burned out on the sad and sometimes dreary information in the first part.  I went back to it recently,  started on the part about hunting and gathering, and loved it.  By the time I cycled back to the beginning of the book, the recent news about Monsanto and GMOs had come out - the studies relating GMO's to honey bee Colony Collapse Disorder (resulting in its ban in Poland,)and to tumors and organ failure in rats (resulting in ban in Russia, action by France and many other countries). Suddenly, Pollan had my attention. His explanation of the so-called Farm Subsidy Program, which really subsidizes Monsanto, ADM, KRB and some other big corps, is a heinous scam on the American people, especially farmers. Yes, folks, Monsanto IS evil, and so are its partners in crime, the agribusiness exploiters that spread GMOs like a fatal virus through every facet of our diet and lives.  ABSOLUTE MUST READ!
B0011UGLK6|4.0|Unaccustomed Earth was selected by my book club.  I wasn't sure what to expect, and found it to be a well-written, thought provoking book.  I found the cultural clashes between family members worthy of discussion with my book club as they involve many grey areas. I really enjoyed the second half of the book with each section focusing on a different perspective of a character in the overall story being shared.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Orson Scott Card is a brilliant writer with an even more brilliant mind.  I was totally caught up in the Ender saga, and I couldn't wait for more.  This was not the Ender centric novel that I expected, yet it is still an Ender centric novel, but much richer in characters and story line than I could have ever imagined.  Before Ender, I had never heard of Orson Scott Card.  Now I just want to read more of his engrossing novels.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Okay, at this point, we've all seen the movie. It lives up to the review it's been hyping: \\"The best superhero movie of all time.\\" Trust me, if you're a fan of comics, Marvel, or superhero movies in general, you'll love this. But you've probably already seen it, so let's get on to reviewing this particular product.<br /><br />Let's see here: Blu-ray, 3D Blu-ray, DVD, digital copy, AND a digital download of the soundtrack, all for twenty bucks? Get out of here. No way it's possible. Well, actually, it is. That's the deal I got, and it rocks. You even get a surprise digital comic download (Avengers Assemble #1) that isn't advertised on the box! Shipping was overnight, as ordered. The digital copy was almost instantly on my computer from the time I got the package, and the soundtrack wasn't far behind. My wife and I watched the DVD last night, wonderful as usual. Haven't had a chance to try the Blu-ray (3D or regular) yet as we don't have a Blu-ray player, but this deal was just too good to pass up.<br /><br />If I were forced to complain about anything here, it'd be the same complaint I have about most movies today: the sound effects and music are insanely loud compared to the murmuring of the dialogue. I notice this with nearly every movie I watch anymore, no matter what format I'm watching it on (theater, TV, computer, whatever). I'm not sure what convinced all the filmmakers that this is a good idea, but it's really not. This particular film isn't as bad on it as some, but I still had to adjust the volume on our TV every now and then, as we live in an apartment and aren't too keen on blaring the speakers through to our grad student neighbors.<br /><br />Overall, I implore you to get this movie and this spectacular deal. You really can't beat it. Every actor is perfectly cast, Whedon's direction and writing are impeccable as always, and you get so much for so little cost. Do this and don't think twice.
B0083GVHJG|4.0|Somehow our Tivo messed up with the last show of the season and I really needed to see the episode. I was so pleased that Amazon had it available.<br />The show series is really absorbing and fun to watch. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the theatre and theatre people - whether or not it is so really true to life I do not know but it is great fun and I look forward to next season.

B005IQZB14|2.0|Slow and not so interesting.  Surprised for it being a NY Times Bestseller and endorsed by Oprah.  I want to finish reading but not sure that will happen.
B0058W74UY|1.0|Everytime I tried tony open the app, it says app is stopped and closes. Uninstalled and I don't recommend anyone else waste their time on this app.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this app and it works GREAT on my Kindle Fire. So happy to finally be able to check pinterest.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|Shipping and delivery through Amazon was once again wonderful. As far as the actual show goes, it's great as well. Anyone interested in fairytales with a twist on the classic stories should enjoy this series. Plenty of characters abound: Snow White and her charming prince, an evil queen, the Beast and Belle, some dwarves and fairies, a well noted Genie, and so many more wonderful characters that I wouldn't want to spoil... with lots and lots of magic thrown in the mix. If you're wanting something different out of a television show, then this is for you!
B00701QVVY|4.0|this is probably one of the best metal cds of the year, as it needs to be. I like more the previous one \\"ironbound\\" but this one stays on the same line, staying true to metal, vocals great, sound great, melody great, overkill is so under rated and have great stuff like this
B0071BGOJC|3.0|Most of the book was quite good, however, I felt that it ran out of gas at the end and was unable to maintain the same level of interest.
B007IPJMCM|5.0|its pantera and its VDOP, even that 20 years have passed this cd rules over many bands of today, the dvd quality is not as good as you may want, the single videos is always a plus, having the bonus track is great.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Kept me coming back for more. There's always something just around the bend. A great romance with good twists and turns. Cannot wait to read the next book..
B0082LUEW8|3.0|this cd sounds more like mudvayne (at some point of it) than hellyeah, the change in production/record label is the first thing you can notice, has great melody lyrics not so much, IT FEELS TO ME that they dont match and Chad's vocals sound flat for at least 4 songs straight, he doesnt need to scream all the time. if you are a fan of hellyeah, buy it, if you are courious download it or borrow from a friend
B0089AF2DS|2.0|meh. i am not sure what is up with folks these days. if a band does something slightly unexpected--even if it's crazy trite--people think it's genius.<br /><br />i love the first few baroness eps, but then they turned into a pretty 1:1 mastodon clone. sometimes that was ok; they clearly have huge musical prowess...but everything smacks of trying too hard. a lot of the joy of good song craftsmanship was lost to an overriding, heavy-handed approach at trying really, really hard to be \\"technically complex.\\"<br /><br />this album gave me hope again. because, the hooks. man, i love hooks. you can be poppy, just write great songs and wormy hooks. hooks in heavy music steal whatever that mass is where my heart should be.<br /><br />the first few times i heard \\"take my bones away\\" and \\"eula,\\" it got all earwormy. and i got excited.<br /><br />i went on a long vacation and had some good downtime to really focus on the whole album. in total, this is more offputting than listenable. again, there's such an over-reach of effort to \\"be\\" something that they really organically are not.<br /><br />the hooks are shallow and as i said, trite. they are taking hooks and melodies we've heard a billion times in non-metal and repackaging them around baroness-y ancillary elements. some songs are straight up rip offs (28 days later theme). the lyrics are...man. they are just stupid a lot of the time. \\"settle down, this won't last long\\" is the coolest thing he says--but it's in a song titled--what?--Eula.<br />huh.<br /><br />and that one other song is a very VERY thinly veiled \\"hide yo' kids, hide yo' wife.\\"<br /><br />again, this is more trying too hard to be something they naturally arent--in this case, deep or meaningful in lyrics.<br /><br />anyway. sorry. it was hooky for like a second, and i was fired up...but the whole thing reeks of gimmick. beyond that, after the initial earwormery, all desire to re-listen to it is lost. count me out.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|I loved this movie and cant wait to buy it on Blue ray. I hope there is a lot of special features.
1594203334|4.0|I get the impression that a lot of people end up taking this personally.<br />I think Pamela is a woman who became a mother in Paris and observed differences between two cultures that she thought might be interesting to share.<br />And it is interesting.<br />I didn't ever get the impression that she is saying, `hey, you are doing this wrong, this is the right way to do it.' It's more of a, `hey, I never thought to try this.'<br />She speaks of the difference between Parisian mothers and the rest of France, and she always mentions that of course, there are exceptions.<br />I am almost done with the book and I have found it enjoyable and enlightening.

0824835921|4.0|No matter the route you take to learning Japanese you will end up learning kanji in one way or another. This book has you memorizing stories while supplying \\"particles\\" in which to reference figures you'll see repeatedly to make up a kanjis meaning. I'm surprised by how much it works honestly. Each \\"particle\\" is given a key word meaning which is referenced in the story to make you draw out the meaning of the symbol. Using this method and referring back to parts you've learned already you end up creating outlandish images that cement the story and symbol into your mind.<br /><br />There are some things I don't like however. The writer assumes you have a broad knowledge of culture, history and religion referring to these topics a good amount of times throughout the book. Also it uses words like \\"nosegay\\" to convey a story which left me confused as I had no utter idea what a \\"nosegay\\" could possibly be. It's a great book but somethings should've been left a bit easier for the mass public.
B007Y6DUHI|4.0|Than you Paul Bowden.  The book is now so much easier to understand.  I find I can take in and retain the information given in the lessons as the language is more informal and therefore so much more interesting.  The original writing was penned some time ago so it came across as being somewhat archaic in places. Some sentences took some effort in comprehending the current meaning. Now the text is more alive.<br />There are some other books in the same vein that could be better understood if they too were updated and reprinted along with their original versions.

Also if you have tall heatsinks on your RAM it may be an issue depending on your MOBO.

B0062NAX1U|5.0|I have read the book and seen the movie, and both were very well done.  Having been a policeman and experienced the death of my child, I can relate with what the deputy and his family were going through from the time that he first got the notification until the end of the movie.  That sort of sorrow never leaves you, but stays with you for, for me it has been some 29 years now.  You never forget them, and the memories that you had with them, you can't!  You have to keep them close to your heart otherwise you would totaly forget them. It is the special days without them that makes it hard.<br /><br />Having been a policeman for 26 years, at the end of the movie, I wanted to stand up with the officers in that church and be recognized as one of those heroes.  And yes, I have signed a similar resolution a long time a go taking responsibility for the actions of my family, and also made a promise to my wife of 38 years that regardless of what happens, we would always stay together, and obviously, we have, and we have survived the worse that anyone could throw at us...the loss of a child.<br /><br />It would behoove every officer and deputy of every department in this great country, to take the time, and make a date night, and go and see this movie, or rent it or even spend the money and purchase it!  It would be money well spent for his family, and his department.

1451678193|4.0|This is a collection of Ray Bradbury's Mars colonization stories which were originally published in pulp magazines over a period of a few years. They are independent of each other in plot, but it is fascinating how Bradbury managed to pull them all together in a cohesive whole which told a story in itself. This book is considered the bridge between classic pulp science fiction (which targeted lowest-common-denominator audiences) and the more thoughtful and sophisticated modern science fiction. The stories have the same raw imagination as pulp, but each one tackles one or more social issues as well. The stories are fast and fun, and yet intriguing.<br /><br />My favorite story is about two missionaries bent on saving the Martians from sins that we humans haven't even imagined yet. The philosophical discussion of sin and the ironic use of Christian symbolism meshed surprisingly well with the sf-pulpy imagery. Bradbury also touched on evils-of-colonization, race-relations and xenophobia, and politics...to name but a few issues. I was also impressed by Bradbury's expectations of \\"the future\\" (1999 - 2020). Unavoidably, some of his themes were dated--we no longer worry about nuclear holocaust and (I hope!) lynch mobs are very rare in the US these days. He didn't foresee the civil rights movement or the cooling of the arms race. Despite this lack of foresight, he showed that humans never change. We may think we're living in an enlightened age, but xenophobia still exists and we're still willing to destroy the history and of an old land in order to set up our new world. Yes, I did feel that the stories tended to be a bit on the dreary side, but for some reason it didn't bother me so much because it was made palatable by Bradbury's fantastic imagination.<br /><br />This is a fantastic classic that any science fiction fan should read.

1400079276|4.0|Kafka on the shore follows two seemingly unrelated characters whose stories collide in surreality. The first character is a 15-year-old runaway boy who has renamed himself Kafka Tamura. Kafka runs away from his father for reasons that slowly reveal themselves as the plot thickens. He ends up in an obscure library, where he must overcome a dark curse. The second character is Nakata, an old man who suffered an injury as a child and lives as on a stipend for the mentally disabled. Nakata may not be very smart, but he can talk to cats, and he has an uncanny ability to accept surreal events at face value, thus providing a unique perspective to the strange plot twists. Kafka on the Shore highlighted the extreme effects alienation can have on a person's psyche. It had some VERY dark undercurrents (and even one scene of brutality that was quite shocking). It was a fascinating story, but after thinking about it for several days, I'm still unable to figure out quite what it meant. Perhaps it was only an expression of dark loneliness and nothing more? Whether I'm missing the deeper meaning or not, I greatly enjoyed reading my first Murakami book, and look forward to reading many more of these fascinating works.

0783222149|4.0|The River Wild(released Sept/94) has been a TV fave for years and did deservedly well at ye olde box office.This film stars Meryl Streep as Gail,Kevin Bacon as Wade,David Strathairn as Tom,Gails husband,Joseph Mazzello as Roarke,Gail and Tom's son,and John C. Reilly as Terry,Wades partner.It's a film that slowly builds its' suspense throughout,keeping the characters and us in the dark until it needs to.This is a neat trick,but a good one,often used to pull the audience right into the action on screen.<br />The plot finds Gail and Tom in a marriage strained.Tom is a busy architect who doesn't seem to have much time for his family.Gail has packed up for a trip white water rafting,back near her hometown in Idaho.Tom comes home but is unable to go,apparently because of his workload.Gail leaves with her two children and returns home.The next day Gail,their dog and her son are all set with the raft(her daughter stays behind with her parents),when Tom pulls up at the last minute to join them.The trip,for the first while,is a strained one,as their personal problems come periodically boiling to the surface.<br />Down stream they meet up with two men,Wade and Terry,who they had meet when first starting out.It seems the third man in their party,a white water guide,has walked out on them after an argument.They have a raft but were afraid to attempt upcoming rapids nearby alone,as they had no experience.Gail and Tom reluctantly agree to take them along.<br />Along the way Wade accidentally falls into the water and Tom jumps in and attempts a rescue.Tom is almost pulled under and drowned by Wade until Tom has to use force on Wade to calm him down.Wade cozy's up to Roarke,the pairs son,even giving Roarke $200 on his birthday.Roarke is forced to return the money,starining the air between the couple and the two men.One night after Tom and Gail look like they are on their way to re-connecting,Gail takes a skinny dip to wash up.It starts to rain and the dog,who is kind of standing guard,starts to bark.In the flicker of the lightning in the sky she sees Wade standing on an embankment staring at her.<br />The next day the pair decide they had better high tail it out, as they just do not trust the men anymore.In a ruse Tom gets away from Terry and he runs and jumps into the waiting raft Gail is in.They break away down river to pick up their son who is there fishing.Tom has to run after Roarke who does not want to leave his new found friend Wade;and that is who they both run into.Wade and Tom have words and Wade pulls out a gun.From now on,it is game on.We learn Wade and Terry are fugitives from an auction robbery of quite a substantial sum of money.They picked the river as an escape route,thinking no one would ever think to look for them there.They also intend going past the last safe stop point on the river,and proceed down through off-limit rapids,and they will use Gail as their guide through them.<br />One evening Tom manages to escape from the men,as had their dog previously that day.Wade claims/thinks he fatally shot Tom.Tom follows the four of them,and in fact reaches an old abandoned safe station below the killer rapids first.He rigs up an old thick wire that spans the river to up end the raft once it reaches that spot.Meanwhile Gail,who has been tied to the raft,along with her son,is busy maneuvering the rapids with the men's help.The four come close to being upended but in the end Gail sails the raft successfully through.Through smoke signals Tom makes,Gail realizes Tom is alright and she reaches the point Tom wants her to.Tom releases the wire which upends the boat.Gail gets Wade's gun and forced to shoot Wade,who drifts downstream.Tom,Roarke and Gail are reunited and the authorities are called and arrive to pick up the bodies and rescue everyone.<br />The film was shot on location in Montana and Oregon and features some pretty spectacular scenery throughout.It is obvious that Streep did alot of her own rowing,which she is to be commendedfor.Rafting is a tough sport and require tons of stamina and skill.Bacon does a great job as the menacing Wade,cold and calculating.David Strathairn also does a good job as the husband whose strained marriage shows on every inch of his face.I could remark on some plot holes:like Tom's miraculous speed as he beat Streep and the guys down river(he was traveling light after all,I guess!),the implausibility of Gail sticking around another second after she was google-eyed by Wade that night while bathing alone,and any of them sticking around as long as they did with these guys.Would you have ignored such warning signs that long? However,this is Hollywood folks and it is just a movie,not real life.We have a plot to get from A-Z with and sometimes in order to get there we have to circumvent a few letters along the way.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and looks clear.It does have however some dirt and the odd line here and there in it,but overall its pretty good looking.Extras include some cast and crew bios and production notes.<br />All in all a very good thriller,with the plot base around a white water rafting trip that goes south before its main participants have time to react.Well acted,ignore the plot holes and just enjoy the suspense.Recommended.for.Rafting is a tough sport and require tons of stamina and skill.Bacon does a great job as the menacing Wade,cold and calculating.David Strathairn also does a good job as the husband whose strained marriage shows on every inch of his face.I could remark on some plot holes:like Tom's miraculous speed as he beat Streep and the guys down river(he was traveling light after all,I guess!),the implausibility of Gail sticking around another second after she was google-eyed by Wade that night while bathing alone,and any of them sticking around as long as they did with these guys.Would you have ignored such warning signs that long?

They kept posting on FB things like Laying Down The Horn Tracks Today and posting lots of pictures. In the end they did not deliver, some songs are just generic, like everything else on the radio and top 40ish. Other songs feel more adult contemporary, lacking passion and power from this once highly energetic group.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|Puss in Boots(released Oct/11)stars Antonio Banderas back in the lead voice of Shrek's beloved character....Puss in Boots,of course.This animated film,from the same people at Dreamworks that gave us the Shrek franchise,features Puss in his own back story of his earlier life and how he became an outlaw,of sorts.<br />The plot takes place in San Ricardo as Puss in Boots returns to his hometown.He walks into a bar and is made fun of by the locals,until he gets the one up on someone who tries to sneak up on him from behind.With his rapier under the man`s chin he questions everyone as to what he could steal,and the magic beans come up.It seems Jack(billy Bob Thornton)and Jill(Amy Sedaris)have arrived in town with said magical beans.Puss thought they were just legend until he sneaks into Jack and Jills room at the hotel and sees them for himself.However there is a rival on scene,a cat dressed in a bat-like costume,also there to steal the beans.They argue and before you know it Jack and Jill are on their cases.They flee and Puss follows the rival to a bar,where the two dance fight.<br />After the ``fight``,the rival reveals that it is a she-cat,not a he as Puss/we first thought.This is Kitty Soft Paws(Salma Hayek),a self styled thief who has a definite knack for pocket picking.She introduces a friend to Puss,Humpty Dumpty,who is Puss`s old friend but turned enemy.Humpty wants Puss to forgive him and work with he and Kitty to restore their reps and their friendship by helping steal the magic beans.Once they have the beans they can go to the giants castle in the air,steal the Golden Goose,and pay back the town for their past misdeeds.<br />Puss walks out,unable to trust Humpty at all.It is at this point we get a back story to Humpty and Puss`s animosity.Both grew up in an orphanage in town and became fast friends.Humpty would think of schemes and have inventive ideas which Puss always played along with.As they grew older Humpty`s schemes were getting the pair in trouble more often than not.When Humpty raided the San Ricardo bank,Puss had had enough.With the law on their tail they fled,but their wagon loaded with loot,cascaded over a bridge and down into a river far below.Puss escaped but Humpty was left behind and caught and thrown in prison.<br />Puss,after persuasion from Kitty,eventually relents and agrees to help the pair retrieve the beans.Jack and Jill are heading out of town through the desert and it is here,Humpty has reasoned, would be the best place to rob the pair of their valuable cargo.A long but dangerous chase ensues with the beans exchanging hands constantly until the trio finally have their treasure.They follow Humpty`s directions and stop to plant the beans in a spot,which they are certain to grow in.A dark cloud comes over and pours down water on the beans.Only a small sprout pops up,but a few seconds go by and boom,the stalk grows and rises up and up,until it eventually reaches the clouds.The trio play for a short time in the clouds,during which their voices sound like chipmunks.When they get into the castle the air pressure changes and their voices return to normal.They find the goose,a not much bigger than them chick.It is laying eggs they can barely pick up.They grab it and return home.<br />While celebrating their victory Puss is knocked out by Jack.When he comes to and walks into town Puss finds Humpty and others laughing at Puss.It seems Jack and Jill,Kitty and Humpty himself,were all in on a con to sucker Puss back into town so he could be arrested.Humpty becomes a hero and Puss is taken to the slammer.In jail Puss meets up with Jack,of Jack and the Beanstalk fame.Now old,he warns Puss that Humpty doesn`t have THE goose,but its offspring and the real Golden Goose,its mother,will be back looking for her baby.And in fact this is what happens as the big bird appears,roaming through the town.Kitty helps Jack and Puss escape and she and Puss help to return the Gooses`s gosling to its mum.In the struggle though Humpty gets taken up by the Golden Goose into the clouds along with her chick.Puss is returned as a hero to the townsfolk,but someone forgot to inform the law as they still pursue him.And Puss and Kitty...well,you`ll have to watch for yourself.<br />This film is just a wonderful movie from start to finish.There are few slow spots at all and the story is highly inventive.You will find yourself laughing at all the twists and turns this story takes,especially where the fairy tale folks are concerned.<br />Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp in its 1:78:1 a/r.Extras include deleted scenes,a featurette on the actors who did the voices and trailers.<br />All in all a puurfect addition to your family movie library,and if you own the Shrek franchise like I do,it is also a perfect addition to that.However,don`t think you will have needed to have seen a Shrek movie,as this film firmly stands on its own two feet,er paws! Great fum the whole family can watch.Highly recommended.pty gets taken up by the Golden Goose into the clouds along with her chick.Puss is returned as a hero to the townsfolk,but someone forgot to inform the law as they still pursue him.And Puss and Kitty...well,you`ll have to watch for yourself.<br />This film is just a wonderful movie from start to finish.There are few slow spots at all and the story is highly inventive.You will find yourself laughing at all the twists and turns this story takes,especially where the fairy tale folks are concerned.<br />Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp in its 1:78:1 a/r.Extras include deleted scenes,a featurette on the actors who did the voices and trailers.<br />All in all a puurfect addition to your family movie library,and if you own the Shrek franchise like I do,it is also a perfect addition to that.However,don`t think you will have needed to have seen a Shrek movie,as this film firmly stands on its own two feet,er paws!

030758836X|2.0|I will also not sum up the plot or point out all of the unbelievable holes in the ending - it has already been articulately done. I loved reading most of this book - feeling like it was an interesting character study of narcissistic women and men who loved them with interesting plot twists. But the ending is so disappointing, it is not worth wasting your time reading the rest of the book. It's a shame, because obviously the author has lots of potential. I would never buy another one of her books until it was well-vetted, and I am assured of a satisfying (believable, character-consistent,  loose ends wrapped up) ending. Gillian, you let us down :-(

1582701709|1.0|I found The Secret on the garbage pile outside my neighbour's house. Out of curiosity, I picked it up. I was on my way to an audition. We live in the suburbs of Malolos way up north of the City of Manila where the audition will be. I was running late, and it's a two-hour ride. I thought I might as well read through The Secret while on the bus commute and see what all the fuss is about.<br /><br />By the time I returned home from audition, I carefully replaced The Secret back into my neighbour's garbage pile... where it belonged. For every inspirational statement or encouragement you read, there are two or three sentences after it that blame you for your current lack of abundance. This book also carries dangerous lies that can deceive a lot of people.<br /><br />The Secret does carry some principles and virtues such as: doing things in love, gratitude for everything, goodwill for others, faith, and taking responsibility for this world's current state. These are taught in the Bible. In fact, what attracted me to The Secret and allowed me to read it through with an open mind was because it quoted from the Bible on a few instances and cited it as its source.<br /><br />The Secret makes several claims that are contrary to what the Bible teaches, however. One is that mankind created the Universe we are in now. The Bible teaches that in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.<br /><br />There is also a page there where the author asserts that each time we declare \\"I AM ___,\\" that statement comes true. God's name is \\"I AM\\" and I remembered that the serpent's deceptive promise to Eve was that \\"You will be like God\\" and it's just too close to what The Secret teaches.<br /><br />Do not read this book. If you need something inspiring to read, this is not it.

For any of you out there that are in your 60's now and would like to experience some real nostalgia, some real Deja Vu, this is the album. It takes you back to a turbulent time where you remember how the violence and upheaval of the late 60's-early 70's could be transformed, if just for two album sides length of time, into an enjoyable escape.

0375704027|4.0|I enjoyed this book for the most part. The beginning was a little slow for me but as the story developed, I got more interested.<br />First, I'm going to say a few things about what bothered me.<br />I have issues with a few of the scenes, I don't want to give out any spoilers but some the suicide scenes were a bit hard to take in. I mean, one moment the character is acting like everything is fine, and then suicide. I guess I can accept that as a cultural difference. Another part of the book that bothered me was the sex talk, it always comes out of nowhere. It's like \\"oh everything is beautiful we were having a nice conversation in the woods and then she started to wrap her lips around my....\\" Ok that's a bit exaggerated but what I mean is there were a few moments that made me go \\"hmm ya..\\"<br />I read from other reviewers that there's a better translation of the book, but I couldn't find it, it may be out of print.<br />Nevertheless, I did enjoy the book. Did remind me a little of Catcher and the Rye.<br />4 stars for the book and 3 stars for the translation

B000021Y77|5.0|Tom Tykwer must've been hopped up on seven pots of Cuban coffee when he wrote the screenplay to RUN LOLA RUN. It's a nervy, jolting 1998 German thriller that hurtles like a runaway train. It's packed with urgent, kinetic moments. It's goaded by a pulsing techno score. It ambushes you with an unusual plot twist a third into it. It won the 1999 Sundance Film Festival Audience Award and plenty of other awards, so it can shout that from the rooftops.<br /><br />What ever happened to Franka Potente? She'd amassed so much cachet after her electrifying performance here, I'm surprised I haven't seen her more on-screen since. RUN LOLA RUN doesn't ef around. It right away establishes the two leads and the story's central conflict. Potente plays \\"Lola,\\" a redheaded whirling dervish of a girl who dashes off to rescue her frantic boyfriend Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu) who only has 20 minutes left to recover the 100,000 German marks that he'd lost, and then hand that over to his boss... his very testy mob boss. You wonder what an ordinary girl like Lola can do. I mean, besides run really fast and with arm-pumping abandon. One third thru the film, when things seem at its bleakest, maybe she'll surprise you. Because the thing that happens, I think she wills it into happening.<br /><br />***Hey now, SPOILERS alert for this paragraph!!*** Some say that this film is comprised of three parallel realities that showcase the same characters. Me, I prefer to regard RUN LOLA RUN as a time travel story, because it's cooler that way and it presents a stronger connective tissue. Sort of more [[ASIN:B000BZN1NM 12:01]] than, say, [[ASIN:6305210411 Sliding Doors]]. RUN LOLA RUN tweaks your senses with some metaphysical themes: free will versus determinism, pure chance versus conscious manipulation of events (see Lola's actions in the casino)... In each of Lola's run, she encounters various passers-by and demonstrates that even the most incidental contact can have far-reaching consequences. I really dig the flash-forward sequences as we learn, in quick-hitting snapshots, what befalls those passers-by, dependent on how their run-in with Lola went. Lola gets three do-overs, and each one presents a different outcome for one and all. That butterfly must be getting tired, flapping its wings so much.<br /><br />Artsy yet unpretentious, visually arresting and generating a frenetic energy, RUN LOLA RUN exhilarates. It makes me not resent reading foreign sub-titles. It makes me want to see more of Franka Potente, if only she would do more movies I had heard of. I mean, there's this one and then the Jason Bourne movies. I may have to tune in to her new show on BBC America, COPPER.<br /><br />The DVD's bonus stuff:<br /><br />- Audio Commentary (in English) by Franka Petente and director Tom Tykwer<br />- Music Video featuring Franka Petente's vocals<br />- Talent Files - brief bios and selected filmographies for Tom Tykwer, Franka Petente, and Moritz Bleibtreu<br />- Theatrical Trailer for RUN LOLA RUNig the flash-forward sequences as we learn, in quick-hitting snapshots, what befalls those passers-by, dependent on how their run-in with Lola went.

I may have to tune in to her new show on BBC America, COPPER.<br /><br />The DVD's bonus stuff:<br /><br />- Audio Commentary (in English) by Franka Petente and director Tom Tykwer<br />- Music Video featuring Franka Petente's vocals<br />- Talent Files - brief bios and selected filmographies for Tom Tykwer, Franka Petente, and Moritz Bleibtreu<br />- Theatrical Trailer for RUN LOLA RUN
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|An homage to a truly courageous/fearless man. Most inspiring is the human (fallible) side of him which draws everyone into the story.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Loved the buildup of characters, and the possessive side of Travis. the middle got a little boring but then there was lots of action ahead
B00064WSNM|5.0|Their first six albums were all outstanding. I could not pick a favourite out of them. And this is one of those six. Musically brilliant and well remastered.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|addicting game. I love it. reminds me of going to the fair as a kid. I will play every day.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Excelent app. I defenetly love it. I can download all my favorite songs as mp3 for free. I really recommend this app.
B002BVOYBW|5.0|For whatever reason, I was resistant to this movie. The first time I saw it, I had trouble getting into it, but as the story progressed, the characters -- and their predicament -- grew on me. Each time I've watched it, I've liked it better. I also think that it contains one of those absolutely, drop-dead classic movie scenes (don't want to be a spoiler but it involves a window and Johnny Depp's frantic attempts to get Mary Stuart Masterson's attention).<br /><br />It's a great movie, about love and being different. And it contains some terrific lines. Paraphrasing: \\"But aside from a little mental illness, she's okay, right?\\" Don't fight it. Watch this movie, and give in to its timeless appeal.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Cheryl Strayed's brutally honest tale of her adventures on the Pacific Crest Trail - a journey we can only take vicariously with her, is an easy and thought-provoking read.
B008X9Z3UC|5.0|This is exactly what I wanted. 1) It fits perfectly.  2) It closes by 2 zippers.  3)  It protects my 7\\" HD,  4) It is not bulky.  5) I can use my HD without having a cumbersome case.  6)  The price is right.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love this app! so addicting<br />it works great on my kindle fire.not sure why it has bad reviews from others?
B000054OTY|5.0|Liked this film a lot. Brando is a great director. Too bad he diodn't do more like this. Will buy more like this.
B0063HC7EQ|5.0|I re-read this on kindle a good 20 years after my first reading. As a long time motorcycle tragic and a keen observer of what makes humans tick I got so much from the text.  I don't know what Pirsig's actual experience of riding was but I'd be amazed if anyone who does not ride could have evoked the two wheel experience so totally. I loved the relationship that his friends have with technology and have frequently swung between embracing technology and eschewing it in fits of pique. If you ride, read it, if you question bigger questions about our existence read it and if you are approaching 50, rode in the past and can feel the claws of rather time scratching your shoulderblades reds it, buy the biggest motorcycle you can afford and point it at the horizon with no thought of your destination. Shiny side up!
B00932A2MC|3.0|I found this movie Battleship to be an awesome adventure, with syfy bad guys. The trailers were a bit miss leading when it comes to actor Liam Neeson. He is not in the movie a lot. It gets a little long in the middle but hang in there the ending is worth it. The ending though worth it is far fetched to think it would really work out that way. However the music is classic rock and just the thought is cool. My family truly enjoyed this movie. If you don't try to pick it apart and remember everything goes in the movies you'll like it just fine.
B006LSZECO|2.0|The first 1/3 of the book was a page-turner, compelling; the second 1/3 was a disappointment; and the final 1/3 was totally unrealistic and made me angry. Don't waste your money on this one.
B0061PEAUY|2.0|This was the most disappointing book I have read in awhile. The repeated plot of damsel in distress is grating, the lack of a cohesive plot, the Iphone that she mentions every 2 paragraphs, and the overall lack of forensics have me wishing I had waited and paid less for this book. This feels thrown together and pushed to publish.
0062124293|5.0|UPDATE to below riff:<br /><br />this book's a masterpiece and she's swaggered to her place in writing after a drive by shooting of ideas. the fact that it's a best seller almost cheapens and undermines its genius. for the courtney (imaginary-ish live-in lover) and sister story alone, every woman needs to read that section. moran's gonna piss off a lot of people for so many different things. that's a wonderful sign of someone doing a drive by, setting all the stores on fire and looting the place before they shoot her.<br /><br />she gives aways all our own secrets to ourselves. she's gonna infuriate a lot of people who're gonna try and rip her tetas off and make her turn her vagina in, but she won't have it. you can tell moran isn't going anywhere now. she fought for herself, piece by piece. those're the ones you can't ever get to hush up and behave.<br /><br />if you're looking for an author to agree with, you're a lazy reader and the reason we're in so much trouble. people who shut off and look away from what doesn't make them HAPPY in the moment. or FEEL GOOD. prepare to be irked with her at times and love it. maybe later if not now. be grateful that she even GOT to do this beautiful tirade.<br /><br />this is the book naomi wolff would've wanted to write, but didn't know even know could exist. some famous musician said there's only the blues and zippety do dah. naomi wolff's in zippedy do dah as her head was too far in the clouds or between her own self absorbed legs, instead of the publicly dark alleys of her own vaginal choices. it's funny that both of their books are out at the same time and getting pop culture press. it shows our schizo sides duking it out in plain sight.<br /><br />thank you and best wishes, ms moran. hang in there. it's all gonna be a good laugh later. i mean, it's GOT to be, right?<br /><br />EARLIER riff:<br /><br />i haven't laughed out loud at a published woman or anyone in years. i'm glad caitlin moran even exists and it's about timesuch a woman got published with actual promotion/distribution. this book is a love letter to women of all ages, and just when i think she's skating atop her humor, she goes deep, deep, deep. many way want to \\"cut to commercial\\" rather than look some of her essays on her struggle with her body too long in the eye, for you can only see yourself.<br /><br />and that is art at its best.<br /><br />i think she's too good and deep to attach her message to feminism or any \\"ism.\\" isms of all kinds become baggage instantly, and are too fragile to fashions of the day, but true introspection and sharing is eternal. what we have in common with everyone, always.<br /><br />first third of the book is worth the price alone because so many other books out there from women suck right now. yeah, i said it. it's all \\"let them eat cake,\\" lavender bath affirmations while rome's burning.<br /><br />she's so right about the commodification of everything, including our own vaginas. (i say \\"chocha\\" mostly) but she loses me on her love of feminism. i come from one of those affluent white second wave feminists, and being on the other side of that, you see it's not so \\"equal\\" for all of us girls.<br /><br />theoretically, feminism is wonderful. she's right: if you have a vagina and want control over it, you're a feminist.<br /><br />but that's simplistic logic. cute. because what rabid capitalist would say, \\"yeah, i hate the earth. kill the earth\\" even as they're stockpiling carbon offset credits for a big, poisonous dump?<br /><br />it's focus. it's heart. it's what you'll live and die for at the end of the day. not what you wrote on your linked in or facebook resume.<br /><br />so who can disagree with the theory of feminism with an upper or lower case \\"f\\"?<br /><br />however, in PRACTICE, feminism has actually become about affluent white women having more of these beloved CHOICES: like regretting a half-dozen abortions during college, then adopting poor colored or third world children afterspending their reproductive years seeing how ambitious they can be, then having the inevitable epiphany that blind ambition's shallow and sucks, so then they can quit, stay at home, live on their husband's income, and write Atlantic Monthly articles about the guilt about giving up a good paying white collar job, while the rest of us are working three soul sucking jobs or clawing our way for just ONE.<br /><br />so they can be free to find themselves. choices like that are wonderful things, indeed.<br /><br />if we all had the luxury of exploring them.<br /><br />so what about the rest of us who're left to eat all this cheap high fructose \\"cake\\"? do we not have dreams? do we not bleed if cut and stabbed mercilessly? yes, we may have to sew our own stitches at home with the sewing kit, but we have dreams, too.<br /><br />i'm tired of working harder for affluent white folks to have more of that creamy \\"Justice\\" they're on about for themselves, and symbolically the rest of us with a few token crumbs of successes.<br /><br />just like gay rights became about bourgeois marriage and the option to visit loved ones in the hospital when the rest of us were unable to even get ADMITTED into the hospital.<br /><br />it's all about class. and until we each have our own cab fare home, we're compromised, no matter how many injustices you rail about with more \\"isms.\\"<br />because a young girl toddling out there on her own soon learns: cash, grass, or azz, no one rides for free.<br /><br />but this is the crusty, advanced dark-abyss thinking of a 45 year old dame. god can't be dead unless you thought there was a god in the first place. so yeah, start with trying to get pubic hair hot and free again because that's the beginning and the end, the snake eating its tail.<br /><br />if you can't get off on public hair, forget about god. you've got a long way to go before you even get to ask if there's one.<br /><br />she's right about the neutered sexuality of the young. as an author, i've heard similar tales of girls getting \\"eeeew, you've got HAIR\\" from oblivious boys all over the western world. even CANADA.<br /><br />oh, canada! say it isn't so. any straight boys who shun a real vagina ought to be banned to sexual siberia for life for their lack of fawning gratitude for even having been there before it.<br /><br />oh, yeah. they already are in sexual siberia. and thus are we all. cripes. she's so right about the porn.<br /><br />but i have a lot of guy friends, and i'm MORTIFIED at what messed up stuff girls/women do to play with or manipulate men (as well as each other). insane, contradictory demands. feminism is all frosting on worm wood because until we get ourselves right, we're just spitting into the wind and that's why we're coming on our own faces at the end of every scene.<br /><br />anyhow, it's a good thing caitlin moran exists. thank whoever you thank that she's got the energy to fight for pubic hair... and thus us all.<br /><br />so yay for caitlin moran.<br /><br />but screw feminism.<br /><br />i want a full on revolution for ALL. we all need our little pieces of cab fare home.<br /><br />i don't care how uppity it may sound to those of you in the big house, but i'm just not pleased as punch to become the maid at the end of all this.<br /><br />feminism, sheminism.<br /><br />what are words, anyway? it's become a little more visceral and preverbal for me now. i also miss dustings of armpit hair and humanity. emotions. eye contact. people not answering phones during dinner or personal visits in general. it's like a black market thing, this being an individual and all. that's what i want now. just the freedom to be MYSELF without having to steel myself for the money shots just to stay here.<br /><br />but i think this book is a love letter to women of any age. if you think you're too old, then you're not listening to what she's really telling you.<br /><br />her message is simply about love. once you stop hating yourself, you realizehow precious we each are.<br /><br />we haven't heard the last of moran. i hope she wedges her foot firmly in the door she's re-opening and rips it off the hinges. i cheer her on. people are gonna wanna shred her. especially the better she does in the states.<br /><br />she makes me smile because i felt it was time for the kind of mom who loves enough to lift buses off her children instead of the other kind with frozen faces and lost stories of our history so we've no clue how to become who we were born to become.<br /><br />--erika lopez<br /><br />(an author who's recanted her own capital \\"F\\" \\"Feminism\\".)

0385344333|1.0|I'm not sure what was going in the author's mind (and the publisher's) when he wrote this book. It is so bad that the onlt possible answer is greed. Shame.
B009329ZF2|1.0|Only interesting part of the movie was WWII veterans that kicked butt. Other than that it was a forgettable alien movie.
0525953728|4.0|Great book,once started reading could not put it down.The details were just enough without revealing confidential military information.Finally the truth has been told without all the political garb.Highly recommend reading this book.
B0071BGOJC|4.0|A good engrossing wide ranging read with strong characters. Gives an excellent background to the major struggles of the 20th century. Dont know why he bothers with the rather clumsy sex scenes though.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it is a great game and I love it but it makes your arms. after awhile. its awesome to play I love pickills
0553801473|2.0|Very disappointing. I'm assuming that everyone buying this book has read Books 1-4 of ASOIAF. If you thought book four was boring, book five is just as bad. Too many characters to keep track of, too many locations, not enough action. I don't know what HBO is going to do when Game of Thrones gets this far on.
B008XG1X18|5.0|ive used this app for awhile and other than the occasional hang ups I haven't had any problems!  I recommend!
B00571F26Y|2.0|I agree that wheat is one of the worst things we can eat and he does a good job telling us why.  I myself developed wheat intolerance as I got older.  I, unfortunately, was born right at the time of mega food processing...living on Wonder Bread and sugar.  I'm a diabetic (no surprise there) now and am really paying the price.  However, it's very hard to think of this author as legit when he's ok with using Splenda among other things. So, I did find his take on wheat and what's been done to it very interesting and informative, but I don't agree with how he's telling us to eat now.
B005LLSNNE|4.0|Very exciting season. Fun to watch albeit a little drawn out at times, which led me to drop a star.
B0054LVP3Q|3.0|A rather hard to get your head around concept of having to start everyday with no memory of the last.  Just enough information is given through-out the story to hold my interest, however, the last couple of chapters are are a dis-credit to the novel.

B003VANOFY|1.0|*edited, newest content at top*<br /><br />I'm not sure I've ever been more frustrated by a piece of computer hardware.  For the money, it's just trash.  The mic constantly cuts in and out with no warning, friends on Skype calls complain about it at least once every 5 minutes.  It will randomly connect and disconnect when it feels like it, sometimes it beeps to tell you, sometimes it doesn't and your sound just goes away.  Add this to the power button issue (will not turn on when plugged in via USB) and the other minor annoyances and it's rage-inducing once you remember how much money you spent on a supposedly \\"premium\\" headset.  I ordered a new, different headset and I will be throwing this in the trash when I get it because I couldn't bear the conscience of burdening someone else with these things.  May sound like an overdramtization, but it's not much of one.  Buy this at your own risk. /new<br /><br />*initial review*<br />I don't feel like I got my money's worth.  It's marketed as a premium headset but to be honest a lot of the premium features aren't that great.  It's not a *bad* headset, it's just not worth the money.<br /><br />Battery life- It's ok.  I understand that there is a tradeoff here between battery life and weight/comfort of the headset.  When I use it wirelessly, I do sometimes run out of battery in a single day of heavy use.<br /><br />G-keys- almost completely pointless, for me.  I listen to music while playing games and it seems like they haven't figured out how to make the G-keys control programs outside of the program that is currently running.  This is an issue with the G15 keyboard I have from Logitech as well so it seems like a common software problem.  I don't see the point of them- who is going to be reaching up to their headset while gaming to hit buttons?  The volume control is VERY useful, though.<br /><br />Sound quality- mediocre.  I'm a headphone enthusiast, I have several pairs of headphones ranging from $20-$1000.  The sound quality is well below that of my Sennheiser HD280 Pro, which is a $100 headphone.  The \\"7.1\\" sound is kind of a gimmick.  I guess it's cool in games with positional audio.<br /><br />Comfort- Exceptional.  This is the first headset I've owned that fits completely over and puts no pressure on my somewhat large ears.  I can wear it as long as I want with no discomfort whatsoever.  Comfort is on par with high-end headphones.<br /><br />Microphone- Very good sound quality, and has a nice feature that mutes it when you tilt it up and unmutes it when you tilt it back down.  Because of this very thoughtful addition, I don't even use the mute button.<br /><br />Annoyance:  The power button doesn't function right when the headset is plugged in.  Sometimes it doesn't function right when it's unplugged either.  Just google \\"g930 power button\\" for plenty of stories.<br /><br />However, if you want a wireless headset, this is one of the few options.  I think Razor has one but it's significantly more expensive.  Just be aware that adding wireless to this price point causes a drop in quality in some other areas.
B0034CNSFU|5.0|This collection of Hendrix is great! A whole bunch of great tunes packed into one CD. If you are a Hendrix nut, and only have a one disc CD player in your car, this is the one to have.
0553801473|3.0|... nowhere near to living up to the fast pace and compelling storytelling of the first two books of the series. It's still a fantastic piece of fantasy literature and a \\"must read\\" for all ASoIaF fans, but Martin himself has set the bar with previous books to a level which just want allow me to be more generous with the rating.<br /><br />I would compare the experience I got from this book with sitting in a theater and waiting for the curtain to open. Then finally the curtain opens and the book ends...<br /><br />It's a \\"setting the scene\\" fantasy epic. There are so many colorful storylines and complex characters, but they don't really get anywhere. It builds my anticipation for the next book, but it doesn't do anything for this volume.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|This two disc set is chock full of the greatest Garth from past to present. A nice surprise for me was the DVD that I didn't notice was included. So you get two CDs and a DVD. For the price, this is a no brainer!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|very easy to use. I work inuse finance and would use this at my desk but would never leave my fire unattended.
B0087HT36U|4.0|Good game, even for an obvious angry birds 'rip off'. There are some levels that need updating, otherwise there is no possible way to get the max score (i.e. Gold crown). Too much delay when level loads. Occasionally they're is a glitch and things look like they're floating. Very well made game besides this though. Also would like to see the ability to earn bombs with points, instead of having to pay for them.
B005MWPW86|5.0|If you are a fan of Craig Ferguson, or merely coming to America stories, you owe it to yourself to read this book. Even better, get the audiobook version, and allow Craig to read it for you. His voice would have been in your head anyways.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I am in the process of checking out this dvd set and so far it has no defects.  I would recommend purchasing from Amazon since I tend to have less problems with playback.  I always pre-order Supernatural seasons, and see no reason to change the routine.<br /><br />I hope Supernatural continues for a long time.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|It took me a little while to get into this game but once I did I loved it. The concept is simple, bagging groceries, but there is enough depth and difficulty to the game to keep it interesting. There are a range of different modes, where you might have to bag groceries without crushing them, or crush as many as you can, or fit a certain selection into a bag that doesn't seem big enough. Getting three stars or meeting certain additional requirements adds challenges to the levels and increases replayability. There are enough levels that you won't burn through it in a day, and a couple levels with theoretical infinite replayability to beat high scores, but I was still left wanting more after finishing the main game. Good game.
B008220DGE|4.0|Paul Thomas Anderson's earlier works \\"Hard Eight\\" and \\"Boogie Nights\\" were very accessible. After that he really started putting his audiences through the paces and \\"The Master\\" is no exception.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. Joaquin Phoenix is in the Pacific during WWII. It's not really said if he is a screwed up guy naturally or if the war made him that way, but I suspect it's the former. Now stateside, he gets a job as a department store photographer. He also has a talent for making booze from just about anything at hand. Through a mishap with one of his concoctions he's on the run and ends up on a small ship captained by a New Age-ish guru who is, more than likely scamming his followers. He is taken on by said captain as an acolyte and the adventure begins.<br /><br />This is a character driven movie so the plot line is not laid out in, what one might consider, the normal fashion. I know it would take me at least one more viewing to get a better handle on what this was all about, but it's a fascinating watch nonetheless. Both Phoenix and Hoffman have created memorable characters. Amy Adams is also on hand as Hoffman's wife and a formidable force behind the man. She does a truly stand up job. All the second tier characters are also well drawn. Great attention is paid to period detail. Particularly the costuming. The viewer has no reason to believe he's not looking through a time portal. All the production values, especially the music, are as good as they get. This is a near seamless endeavor.<br /><br />But, getting back to it, this is a character driven film. These people are fascinating. You probably haven't seen the likes of them before, and, even if you don't quite 'get it' right off, it will still nail you to your chair. This is not for the casual movie goer. I heard some people in the theater complaining about the slow pacing but it didn't bother me in the least. I also wondered if it was based on \\"The Process Church\\" which was a Scientology splinter group inthe 60s, but that's another story. If you like a cinematic workout, this might just be what you're looking for.

0740748475|5.0|I got this collection for my husband as an anniversary gift. He has loved Calvin & Hobbs since he was a kid, and is loving having all the strips and the original published date at his finger tips. He loved finding the one published on his birthday!! I was a little concerned buying this after reading the reviews here because of the complaints about the binding of the book (which were apparently glued) and pages falling out. However I am delighted to report that the volumes we received are binded properly with stitches and appear to be really great quality. My husband was also super excited about the intro/ foreword by the author because (according to my husband) he has only done one interview since the comic strip finished. I am very pleased that I got this for him, he ins busy reading it at the kitchen table now!!

B007GCY8FS|1.0|If I wanted to read a narrative or research \\"fly over country\\" like Nebraska or Iowa.....I would use Google.<br /><br />What a disappointment.  I have read every Lee Child novel, some of them twice and have recommended them to my friends from Day 1.....but Lee must have used other writers or is so immersed in Tom Cruise playing Reacher in the coming movie....that he took his eye off the ball.<br /><br />Boring characters, boring narrative, and boring story. Easy to put down and hard to pick up.  I finished it last night....whew...a labor of love that never climaxed.  I kept thinking that there was redemption at some point in this story....but was disappointed to find out that I was wrong.<br /><br />Maybe Reacher needs to get to Virginia and get lucky with his fantasy lady.....and then retire.<br /><br />What a shame and waste of time.

B009329ZF2|3.0|Battleship was entertaining at best.  The CGI was a lttle over the top, and the love scenes between Hopper and Sam were detractions from the main plot of the movie. It was like there were two plots to the story, the invasion of the folks from outerspace, and the puppy dog love / lust affair between San and Hopper. The moview suffered because of the inherent conflict between these two primary plots.<br /><br />A
B0071BGOJC|4.0|A most enjoyable read from one of our favourite authors.<br />We will certainly want to read the third book in the trilogy
0345525558|5.0|This book is truly wonderful.  The writing is compelling, the characters are real and their lives move the reader - at different points my reaction varied from extreme frustration with and sadness for Victoria and her life situations, to joy in the beautiful and descriptive prose, to curiosity about the truth behind this language of flowers.<br /><br />The novel is told in alternating chapters - some from the present day, some from the year Victoria was ten years old.  That period in her life was her last childhood chance at having a family, before she became a permanent ward of the foster care system. Diffenbaugh paints a heartbreaking and vivid picture, not only of Victoria's past but also of her present.  Even as Victoria made me want to scream at her in frustration, I was riveted to the book in the desperate hope that a new page would bring her closer to  the love and happiness she seeks. Victoria's voice is at times hard, at times fearful, but always strong, as she relays the harsh realities of her time in foster care and reveals some scars that might never heal.  At the same time, I never felt preached-to by the author, nor did she ever try too hard to draw sympathy from the reader - rather, Victoria's complete lack of desire for empathy was the strongest draw for my emotions. I wanted to care more because she couldn't seem to care at all.<br /><br />I thought this book might be too 'chick-lit-y', I worried it might not be engaging. I was so wrong, I loved this book, I have recommended it to so many friends. The idea of a language of flowers is interesting to me, I've since read more about it, and that language weaves a thread through the novel that I think anyone would enjoy. I give this one a rousing 5 stars!
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|I loved this show...It is amazing...I could not wait to watch season two....This is defiantly a show you must buy..
B002BBJ52U|5.0|This was a great movie...however the amazon streaming was very poor. As such I will have to buy or rent a copy if I ever want to see it again.<br />The movie highlights and depicts the phrase 'action speaks louder than words'....loved it!!!!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I loved this game just wished it was longer, can't wait for the next one to come out.  The story line was good, I hope it continues on the same.

B008NW67E0|4.0|This album was a lot more polished than Sigh No More. Mumford & Son's first album was a gritty bluegrass jamfest heavy on the grit. I had a few complaints about the vocals on Sigh No More and all are gone for this new album. Through the course of touring it seems Mumford & Sons has polished their sound, finding what works and what doesn't. The vocals on this album are crisp, the lyrics are sharp and the instrumental is somehow both more bluegrass and less at the same time. This album was well worth the money I spent on it. I highly recommend. Mumford & Sons have really come into their sound and the growth they've experienced as artists since their last album really shows on this recording.
B0094U0RJQ|4.0|I like the older well seasoned voice of Dillan today. he's always been pretty real, pretty rustic but the stories he tells through his music have taken on a different feel... his deep worn tones sound like an ancient sage who's seen it all before and really knows of what he sings. And the stories told in Tempest range from the happy upbeat Duquesne Whistle down to the haunting Scarlet Town and then swinging back to the bluesy Early Roman Kings. a couple of tunes soung like they may have hurt to sing but overall I enjoyed the Bob's style on this one.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book had me on the edge of my seat from the very beginning all the way to the end!!! I love book that are spoken from the main character.  I made my husband very upset because I was so into this book but it was soooo worth it!!! It is a must read!!!

B005F3DFXG|5.0|For the record, this Blu-Ray will play on American BR players.  I played it on a JVC player that is about 2 and 1/2 years old, and it played with no problems.  I previously tried playing it in a Samsung player, and it would not play past the main menu.  However, when I did a firmware update, it played.  And my copy was ordered months before it was available on the American Amazon.com through Amazon.co.uk.<br />As far as the product itself, the quality is great, and it is an enjoyable program.  One of the better dino-related \\"documentaries\\" out there since it focuses very heavily on more recent scientific discoveries.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|A very enjoyable read. Entering the Silo with it's central steel stairs and over a hundred levels deep into the earth has been a riveting experience. I would like to read more about this enclosed and isolated society.
1451627297|2.0|I suppose if you are really interested in the Kennedy assassination, this might appeal to you, however I generally detest the alternate history genre, and this felt more like that than a sci-fi story. At times the story slowed and meandered, and I got sick of reading how cheap everything cost 50 years ago. Overall, it was okay, but didn't live up to my expectations.
B002UHSDUK|5.0|It's the Foo Fighters and all of their best songs. I could listen to this album all day. They are a talented bunch of guys.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|The books were very good until the end.  It is as if the author became  bored and just wanted to wrap up 10 years in three sentences.
B009GEPSDK|4.0|I very rarely write reviews on movies that are listed on Amazon, but after watching this movie on Amazon Streaming, I had to write something. Being a fan of Jessica Biel, I probably would not have watched this movie at all. Wow I'm so glad I did. I am amazed that this movie didn't receive the credit and better reviews that it did. Jessica Biel's Character/Part was outstanding, and she definetly showed us another side of her acting abilities, not another comedy or action film. First of all what made this film so unique was that it wasn't another re-make or another catchy action/drama flick that we've all seen before. I love the way this film was layed out, the design and scheme of it and of course keeping us intrigued till the very end, the best part! I certainly don't wish to give away too much of the movie and spoil it for those who haven't seen it. I gave this movie four stars and believe it is well deserved. For those of you who haven't seen this movie, instead of watching another action/adventure, drama movie tonight....Please do yourself a favor and watch this movie!

B002G1YPH0|5.0|So lets start with something you need to know here: this thing is the size of a VW Jetta radiator. Seriously its huge. I have a full size tower and it fits with the side shut with about 3mm of space to \\"spare\\". That said: this thing is amazing and awesome. I have an AMD Phenom X2 black and the fan that came with it was driving me insane. So loud. So high pitched. Now with this thing in there all I hear is the sweet low key \\"whoosh\\" of air flowing through my rig. Gone are my middle of the night power button hold in's... my backups and my hearing thank you cooler master. Oh... and it keeps my chip at a nice cool temperature so that's a good thing too!
B004XDYJRU|1.0|It starts to play com and it gets about 10 minutes in and then all it says is cannot find streams! What good is it if you can't listen to the entire thing?
B0090P98Z4|5.0|I  really like the dungeon crawling aspect of this version.  It gives it more of a linear feel than the first version of the game.
B0090P98Z4|1.0|Glu Mobile Inc. is such a rip off artist!  There should be a law against companies like you. In the real world they do, it's called bate and switch. You people have NO moral fiber what so ever!!!
1601251556|4.0|Right off the bat, I have to agree with those who have pointed out that the Chessex vinyl battlemat is going to be more durable overall.  It's also easier to pack away, as it can be rolled and then folded without suffering any damage.  It is also much easier to get to lay flat after being rolled/folded.<br /><br />That said, I still prefer Paizo's basic mat.  Why?  Because it will take _any_ kind of marker, not just wet-erase.  How much this matters probably depends on your DM-ing style, but I like to draw out elaborate maps beforehand in permanent marker, then use wet-erase to mark anything temporary during the battle (zones and the like, or to keep track of positions if we have to quit in the middle).  I draw out maps enough in advance that I actually have five of these basic mats (and a few of their more specialized ones, but only ones that leave one side blank).<br /><br />The downside is that, once folded, the Paizo maps do not like to lay flat.  My solution was to find a large art carry bag that I could put them in _without_ folding.  If you don't need to transport the maps and have someplace that they can lay flat, that's even better.  If you do have to fold them, the best suggestion I've seen for getting them to lay flat is to put binder clips on the problematic creases, and to make sure to lay the map out flat a decent amount of time before you plan to use it.<br /><br />My take on it is that if you're a DM who mostly draws battlemaps on the spur of the moment, or doesn't mind the limitation to wet-erase markers, go with Chessex.  If you're like me and like to draw them out beforehand and want the markings to last a fair amount of time, go with Paizo.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|It feels wonderful to reread the entire series again. I love Richard and Kahlan and can't get enough of them!
B0084I9QI2|5.0|I must say, this is a wonderful set, and worth all the money!<br /><br />If you are an MJ fan, you must have it. The songs that were never released on the album, were wonderful, and typical MJ flare/sytle.<br /><br />The DVD is good quality, and I like the fact it didn't pan out to the audience all the time, and stayed focused on the stage, MJ and the band members.<br /><br />I know everyone would recognize Sheryl Crow, as one of the back-up singers and also, forgive me, I don't know the back-up singer's name, the tallest male, he sings on Dancing With The Stars as a back up singer now. He was with MJ thru the Bad and Dangerous tours, I believe, and he might of even been with him on the History tours too, but I'm not sure.<br /><br />I had the priviledge and delight of seeing MJ in 1988 in Dallas Texas, and this DVD footage, brought back a lot of memories for me. I shed a few tears last night watching this.<br /><br />Please, get this if you are a fan!<br /><br />Cindy Hughes
B007THA4FI|1.0|The reason I chose to go to Kindle was to save money and space. (Stacks of books laying around get in the way) but come on publishers ...what makes you think the average workingman can or will pay that for a digital file?  Not Me. I work hard for my money. If I was going to pay that I would buy the hardback. I will just wait on the list at my local library. Seems strange to me that I can find some really good books for less than $5.00 by those who self publish but a large publisher wants a fortune because of a name. The book might be good but I somehow doubt it is $17.99 good.
B007KW55VK|5.0|By now, most everyone has heard the Karen Carpenter references in regards to Rumer's vocals. That may strike some as an easy comparison, but you can't escape the fact that Rumer really DOES sound like Karen on many songs. And for me, that's a most comforting sound. But Rumer is not a one-dimensional singer, and she is also capable of singing songs in other styles, too, as this fine new album demonstrates. \\"Boys Don't Cry\\" is a pleasing collection of covers of songs all written and originally performed by male artists in the 1970s. The album includes fairly well known tunes, such as Daryl Hall & John Oates' \\"Sara Smile\\" and Bob Marley's \\"Soul Rebel\\", balanced with more obscure compositions from big names such Leon Russell, Tim Hardin, Richie Havens, Isaac Hayes, and others. Rumer didn't select the \\"obvious hits\\" by these artists, but instead sought out album tracks that are less known. Clearly, she did her homework in picking songs that were not only suitable for her voice, but ones that really meant something to her. Hearing her sings these songs, the passion is evident. Perhaps the biggest surprise is the album's closing number, her cover of Neil Young's \\"A Man Needs a Maid.\\" That may strike many as an odd song for a woman to sing, but Rumer manages to put a new twist on those lyrics and transform the song into something less maudlin.<br /><br />Besides fine music, another plus to the CD edition of Boys Don't Cry is the accompanying booklet. In addition to the songwriting credits, each track listing has a cover photo of the album that the original song came from. Very cool touch! Hopefully, this might inspire a listener to seek out the original versions, songs by cool characters such as Townes Van Zandt, Terry Reid, and other fine singer-songwriters from that special era.<br /><br />I'm not bothered by the fact that this is a covers album. If Rumer needs more time to write some new original material, let her have it. No rush, as long as she is delivering quality music. And on this album, that's just what she gives us.sic. And on this album, that's just what she gives us.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|I've recently gotten into the genre, having read maybe 15 popular books (Weeks, Sanderson, Martin)in the last year or so.  I would put this squarely in the camp with those authors, and eagerly look forward to the rest of the trilogy.
B0083EW97W|5.0|This CD is very different from John Mayers usual work but its stil really good. This album shows the new found John. I love it
B0031Y9DCS|4.0|I'll guess that the number of five star ratings would be enough to rate worth reading but you never know if it's just a cliquey book for a cliquey group. I met a pilot recently and we got to talking about books and then flying and then he was surprised I had not read Chickenhawk. I chuckled, did he know what chickenhawk meant in the Castro?<br /><br />He had no idea the other connotations for chickenhawk, but apparently, Chickenhawk is a must read for pilots.<br /><br />So, it may be just such a cliquish book, but I'm not a pilot and probably never will be, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. (And I did read Blackhawk Down, which is almost in a different league.) While reading Chickenhawk, I found myself poking around on the Internet for regional simulators where I could have a go and flying so if nothing else, the book has spurred a new interest for me.<br /><br />It was a fun read, no doubt. Read the other reviewers for info on the accuracy etc. For me, it was just a fun and at times horrifying romp through Vietnam war space.<br /><br />Why not five stars? Maybe. If I find a desire to reread it again in a few years then I'll rate it five, no problem.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was a very good and easy read! The action keeps you glued to the book almost not letting you put it down.

B004NDVK1I|5.0|Personnel<br /><br />Rory Gallagher - vocals, guitar, harmonica<br />Gerry McAvoy - bass guitar<br />Lou Martin - keyboards<br />Rod de'Ath - drums, percussion<br /><br />I read,<br />\\"This live performance was recorded in Belfast, Dublin, and Cork at a time when precious few performers -- Irish or otherwise -- were even dreaming of touring the trouble-torn island. Irish Tour '74 music CDs Northern Ireland, in particular, was a rock & roll no-go area, but Gallagher never turned his back on the province and was rewarded with what history recalls as some of his best-ever gigs.\\"<br /><br />That sums it up. Play it loud and hard for the fans, that's what Rory was all about. This was his homeland. These were his countrymen. He wasn't going to abandon them.<br /><br />That is why Rory makes such a great connection with audiences at all of his live gigs. Another reason is his passion for the music, pure, unedited, no processing, overlays or studio enhancements. Rory displays a strong work ethic in all of his performances but this is definitely one of his best CD's and performances.<br /><br />Ireland's greatest blues and rock guitarist gives a flawless soulful vocal performance. He is held in such high esteem by his peers and his guitar variations and six string attacks on this offering explain why.<br /><br />Get this one now cause if you don't have it, your collection just isn't complete. Check out Simon McBride another great guitarist/vocalist from Ireland. [[ASIN:B003XNKEY8 Since Then]]
B003XL6EKS|5.0|This is a fantastic album.  I really liked it at first but have found after subsequent listens that it's literally all I want to play lately.  The spiritual themes Flowers presents are made in a really poetic and somewhat vague way that could touch anyone; and I appreciate that his lyrics have some depth to accompany the incredible and diverse music.  So glad I purchased the deluxe edition--the bonus tracks are some of my favorite songs, especially \\"Jacksonville\\".  LOVE this album.  You won't be disappointed.
B009GENZ12|1.0|This movie is reminiscent of The Village (only with a much lower budget). Acting? meh. Plot? nada. The shocking twist was shockingly boring, and the message conveyed to the viewer is a mish-mash of elitist nonsense that'll leave you wishing you had the last two hours of your life back.
1609611543|5.0|My doctor recommended that I buy this book and read every word, as I have some medical problems.<br />After reading the book, i have changed my life style, and feel better already.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone, healthy or not.
B0084I9QIW|2.0|It seems like people here are reviewing the BAD tour and Michael Jackson, forgetting that this place is for the DVD review.<br />So let me tell you, MJ is brilliant, BAD tour fantastic! With that being said, the quality of this DVD sucks! Common, VHS tape transfer? Really they couldn't do better than that?<br /><br />For the first time ever I felt like returning a MJ product! So buyers be aware, this will look pretty bad on your flat screen TVs! Sound is great though.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to the next 10-15 years when someone will \\"find\\" a decent footage of the BAD tour and release it on blu-ray.
B009157BWU|5.0|My wife and i both truly enjoyed this movie. The choice for the narrator was perfect. The way the story was told with both humor and wonderful facts, that often may us go wow, i didn't know that! truly made the whole movie an enjoyable experience.
1401937519|5.0|Excellent book.  After reading certainly makes one want to shift priorities and appreciate every breath of life and every day.  If we all could be more appreciate of each other, have a positive attitude and be thankful for every day - wouldn't it be a wonderful world.  Great, Great Book.
B003JTHESA|5.0|I have been a fan of this band since the mid-1980s. Today, I listen to a wide range of prog rock and prog metal. I always regarded Seventh Son as Maiden's best outing. But this album has kept locking me in since it was released in 2010. It's impossible to grow tired of it. It is incredibly complex and progressive. I now consider it Maiden's magnum opus, the finest work of one of the world's greatest rock bands.<br /><br />The two standout tracks are Isle of Avalon and Starblind and, in my view, these are the two very best songs Maiden has recorded. The Man Who Would Be King and When the Wild Wind Blows are also excellent. Mother of Mercy and Coming Home are also right up there in the Maiden pantheon.<br /><br />10/10
0394401522|5.0|This is Vol. 2 of a classic book that brings haute cuisine into everyone's kitchen. It is clear and well-written and belongs in the hands of everyone interested in good magnificently prepared.
B007VTVGAQ|2.0|As a big fan of Fiona Apple I really, really, really want to like this album, but I can't. Every listen makes it worst. It's a boring and ponderous slog from an artist who's previous 3 albums were, in my opinion, masterpieces of pop/rock. The songs all have a plodding sameness about them. A few tracks remind me of her creativity, energy  and passion from previous albums, but they are pale shadows that never approach the greatness of her previous work.  The songs just seem to go around in a circle. Imagine a car stuck in the mud and trying and failing miserably to get out. That's what this album sounds like to me.<br /><br />Like I said, I really, really, really wanted to like it. But I just can't. I hope her next album is better. It can't be worst.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book is easy to read  At times it is a little slow, but I can visualize the characters and<br />feel with them.
B004G606K8|5.0|I always put off reading this series because I always felt that it would be a long trek up a ever growing mountain. Well I started off being somewhat daunted, but after being so absorbed in the book, read it in about 12 hrs time, I am diving head first into the rest of the trilogy and working on what ones to go at next.<br />This is am amazing book, a definite must read for anyone who considers themselves and lover of fantasy novels.
0316228532|2.0|I have only read the sample, but that all it took for me to be disgusted.  Being a fan of Harry Potter I was happy to see that J.K. Rowling was publishing another book.  However, I didn't see this coming.  Yes, I looked past that boy wizard to read this book.  The language is valugar, I didn't care about the character at all when he died, and I felt embarrassed reading it. If this is what the future of books is becoming count me out.<br /><br />After finishing the sample I was in shock that someone who actually hooked me on reading has fallen so hard. This is the author who took me on a magical adventure to an enchanted school. I'm attempting to presue a career in writing because of J.K, but now I feel this stupid Twilight Symdrome crap has taken over. Idotic empty lust, empty minded characters, and shallow.  Now I know that J.K. is trying to get out from underneath Harry's shadow, but this was not how she could have done it.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give this a one star was I did not mind the detail in some places.  Plus, it actully has somewaht of a plot line.  This is one book I won't be buying.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome book! I couldn't put it down. Compelling. Exciting. Surprises around every corner. Love it! I highly recommend this book to all ages.

B007THA4FI|3.0|I'm only 1/4 of the way through the book but I just wanted to put forward a two thoughts that might influence your decision to get this book:<br /><br />1. This is NOT a kids book! I can see letting an elementary school child start Harry Potter, and even the final (darkest) book is completely appropriate for Junior Highers, but this I would question even letting a High School student read. It is very frank about reality but contains substantial profanity, sexuality, drug use and other adult topics. Critical: don't trust chapter 1 as an indicator of content. Chapter 1 is G rated, while chapter 2 jumps to PG-13/R in both profanity and sexuality, and the oscillation between the two continues throughout the book.<br /><br />2. The writing remains of a high caliber. It is not the best I have ever read, but it remains well composed and deeply steeped in classical references. I am not at all disappointed in the quality, and can say that I am enjoying that the pacing be a moderately faster than the Stieg Larsson books, and that the subject (while dark) is not quite as perverted (at this point) as the Dragon Tattoo & sequels.<br /><br />I'll plan on updating this review when I finish it in the next couple days, but given the adult content and the questions about whether Rowling could make the transition from whimsical fantasy to gritty life-like fiction I hope this will be helpful to someone in deciding whether this book is of interest to you.<br /><br />Update:<br />So, I finished the book, and I must say I only thought it was okay. Initially I mentioned chapter 2 was more representative of the adult content of the book, but having now read the full book that is more like saying that the cover for the Sports Illustrated will give you an idea of what to expect in a Playboy - it gets more explicit, and I now stand further behind my initial assessment that it is more like Dragon Tattoo, and while covering not quite as dark of a subject, remains quite explicit on a variety of sexual and dark topics. Ultimately, it deals very frankly with teenage sexual desires & encounters, masochism, suicide, marital conflict, drug addiction and more. I found it to be a thought provoking and uncensored view of poverty and wealth, but contrary to some other reviews I think it stopped short of being a thinly veiled piece of political propaganda. It was most valuable in putting you in the heads of each individual so that while you might not approve of their choices, you understand that their options are fewer than you might assume, and their motivations are more muddled giving a more rounded perspective than the purely self-centered or cynical motivations we commonly attribute to those different from ourselves. I can't say I have any intention of re-reading the book, and given the degree of sexual content I certainly wouldn't recommend it to everyone, but if that does not bother you it is an interesting examination of life and a quality piece of writing.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Easy , humorous, and suspenseful read in a dysfunction family relationship setting. Found the juxtaposed male- female interpretation of life events so telling.
B005J4TLN4|5.0|This was a wonderful movie to watch!  I'd heard a lot about it online, and of course was intrigued when I heard the same guys behind \\"Shawn of the Dead\\" and \\"Hot Fuzz\\" were a part of it.  I definitely rate this movie in my top ten favorites.  The characters were all well-defined and engaging, the plot was intriguing and felt realistic, and the aliens are very well designed and utilized as villains.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes humor, classic alien invasions stories, and clever, witty dialogue.

B008SOS63S|3.0|I ordered this CD as soon as it came out and I was really looking forward to listening to it. Joe is one of my favorite recording artists and I saw him on the tour recorded here earlier this year (without the guests of course). My first observation is that in my opinion the guests don't add much - particularly Paul Rodgers. John Hiatt is very good though and his Down Around My Place is one of the highlights of the CD.<br /><br />My second observation is that the crowd noise is so low that you almost forget this is a live recording. When I saw Joe the crowd was extremely loud and really added energy to the performance. That is largely missing here.<br /><br />Other highlights of the CD are the live versions of Bird on a Wire, Dust Bowl, Mountain Time and Young Man Blues. Young Man Blues was a real high point of the concert I saw and this version is shorter or perhaps edited down-it doesn't have the interplay between Joe and Tal Bergman the drummer which included the intro to Stairway to Heaven performed by Joe when I saw them. However still worth having in your collection.<br /><br />Any Joe Bonamassa CD is something worth listening to and this one is no exception. However the energy I experienced at the live show just isn't captured here and that's why I find it a little disappointing.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|love the free version lots of games and levels some are very challenging others quicker games free is always good. you wont be disappointed

0374203032|1.0|Let's be clear about what this book is and isn't.  It isn't academic, philosophic, original or remotely objective.  It's a short (even with a BIG font, just 200 pp), derivative page turner for reading with potato crisps, with which it shares similar depth.  It is a simply structured compendium of multiple snippets of 'research' --- the reporting of 'market' transactions whose outrageousness the author clearly will transport readers into a zone of transfigured moral superiority.<br /><br />The introduction reveals its game plan early: p8 'Why worry that we are moving toward a society in which everything is up for sale? For two reasons: one is about inequality; the other is about corruption'.  Obviously, Sandel is unfamiliar with Soviet Russia and Communist China -- whose income equality was extremely high, and where everything -- sex, cigarettes, toilet paper, legal approvals -- was for sale, and corruption the norm. Largely flat income distribution at bare subsistence levels didn't solve a 'moral' dilemma.  Yet uniform income distribution is an imperative of high academy-derived prescriptives on happiness.<br /><br />In fact, advanced capitalism merely offers a greater range of goods for exchange or barter.  It also -- thankfully for the author --- offers a wider opportunity for fallacious thinking masquerading as profundity and cloaked under institutional respectability. Sandel is evidently unacquainted with Kant whose statement 'From the crooked timber of humanity, nothing straight was ever hewn' might have given him pause before embarking on this presumptuous  pastiche in ersatz seriousness.  Sadly, far too many Harvard professors these days (not naming names) are indulging in this monetization of their professorial standing [sorry to have to diss my alma mater] - that in fact is the significant story here which merits a worthy research study.  Quite like Prof E Warren, the well-paid Harvard professor takes his or her $350K earnings, deplores income inequality, bashes other 1% earners and thus sanctifies her/her regular private bank deposits.<br /><br />When Sandel writes unequivocally on p14 that 'market reasoning also empties public life of moral argument', he bows in obeisance to one of his masters, Marx, if not the New Testament as well ('sooner will a camel...').  More importantly,however, unlike Marx, who was quite  sincere in his beliefs, this volume is itself a recursive pattern within the larger fractal geometry of the book as a whole: it is, in fact, an example of the 'moral limits of markets'.  This transaction is book for a publisher's advance and royalties...I hope the author seriously considers adding his recursive experience to the next edition, doubtless a cheaper paperback version. Is Sandel refused to accept a 'market' salary from Harvard, the privilege of the tenure system, or perhaps he has negotiated a below-market advance and royalty contract from FSG?<br /><br />Highly recommended to readers with strong confirmation bias who have strong beliefs on their moral (sic) superiority and would suggestively imply limiting the personal freedoms of others.ashes other 1% earners and thus sanctifies her/her regular private bank deposits.<br /><br />When Sandel writes unequivocally on p14 that 'market reasoning also empties public life of moral argument', he bows in obeisance to one of his masters, Marx, if not the New Testament as well ('sooner will a camel...').

B002GYVRRI|3.0|There is nothing much radically new to the mix here but the surround is decent enough. 96/24 layer for those who want it.... but I just cannot get over the fact I think this one is highly overrated.<br /><br />Not even sure it would make my top ten Crimson albums. Yeah, sue me. I could listen to Islands any day of the week over this and most of their other albums as well. I'll take any of the albums from the debut to the 80s stuff over it on most days.<br /><br />I like some of the songs for sure and appreciate some of the jamming but to me this record goes nowhere I need to go. It doesn't take me to some other world like a lot of the KC releases do and it sure doesn't have much melody to infect the jamming. A nice set for sure but I have no idea why this is so highly rated. Seems more like nostalgia to me, at a time when Americans were finally recognizing the band.

B004LUS390|5.0|I was skeptical at first, because of all the reviews saying it didn't work on kindle fire, but I figured for 25 cents how could I go wrong. Well it works and it's amazing! Perfect for art on the go. Not the same as pencil and paper, or charcoal, but it is close.
B009GEBBNQ|1.0|I agree with others that say the movie itself was really boring and dull. I don't understand how so many people LOVED IT!It took a LONG time for the story to get going, and then when it did it was a very repetitious series of explosions and an unlimited number of creatures destroying NYC, for no apparent reason. It seemed to go on and on forever and ever. It was like watching paint dry. Ugh!<br /><br />I really enjoyed Iron Man I and II. Robert Downey junior is an excellent actor and those movies were at least interesting and fun. I thought this one would be along those lines. Nah. Scarlet Johansen is really pretty, and captain america is pretty buff, so they tried to please both the male and female audience, but the plot was dull, dull dull.
B008I3QZKU|1.0|Some sounds evolve, some sounds get mature but, this sounds get you sleep.  If the band change it's direction the should change his name too: The Borings, not The Killers. Thanks Brandon for killimg a great band. May Sam's Town Rest in Peace.

B008J5T4Q4|5.0|Artist \\"Pink\\" and the music are great and even after purchasing the CD, this treasure in a modern LP is a genuine treasure.<br /><br />I purchased two, one is unsealed, mounted on my office wall along with other musical highlights from concert performances;  Just eh unexpectedness of finding and artist that cares enough to put her songs on an old-fashoned LP is beyond my expectations.  The quality is amazing and the packaging that Amazon provides for LP's is perfect, that I doubt they have ever had a return due to shipping.<br /><br />Thank you Pink for thinking of us collectors, would recommend this to any fan that wants a current piece of history.<br /><br />Full, 5 stars for everything.<br /><br />t

B008J34466|5.0|Who else has the voice to carry this range of tracks?  \\"The Truth about Love\\" skillfully covers the history of rock, the tender and the tough, acoustical to amped and torch to in-your-face rock.  Only Pink can deliver a great collection of songs like this new one.  Adult but playful lyrics (yeah, profane at times) and that honesty in her voice and delivery!  The whole range of longing, anguish, anger, playfulness and worldliness come through clearly and authentically. She really casts a serious shadow over virtually every other \\"rock goddess\\" currently recording.<br /><br />If you're sampling - be sure and try \\"Are We All We Are\\", \\"Just Give Me a Reason\\", \\"The Truth About Love\\" and \\"Beam Me Up\\".  Three of these are somewhat different territory for Pink and they're really quite special.  The fourth, \\"Are We All We Are\\" is classic Pink and very fine.<br /><br />This is a great effort by Pink, who doesn't do things in half measures, with virtually all of the tracks, including and maybe especially the ballads, candidates for top ten status.

0143034901|4.0|Daniel Sempere is the son of an antiquarian bookstore owner in Barcelona, Spain. In the summer of 1945 Daniel's father takes him for the first time to an inconspicuous, but remarkable place called the Cemetery of Forgotten Books. It's to this sanctuary of the written word that books are brought in order to ensure they don't go from obscurity to oblivion. In the labyrinths of books being overseen there, Daniel chooses a book that he will protect himself: The Shadow of the Wind by Julian Carax. As Daniel reads Carax's book, he quickly falls in love with it and learns that it's quite valuable.<br /><br />For years, copies of it, and every other book written by Carax have been disappearing under unusual circumstances. One night Daniel is approached by a mysterious man who is horribly disfigured and who introduces himself as La&iacute;n Coubert; the same name the devil goes by in The Shadow of the Wind. Coubert offers to buy the book from Daniel and seems willing to pay any price for it, but Daniel refuses.<br /><br />That encounter marks the beginning of a life-long fascination with the tragic life of Julian Carax. As he tries to uncover the events that led up to Carax's murder, layer upon layer of mysterious circumstances are revealed and Daniel finds himself the center of much unwanted attention.<br /><br />The book is wonderful. Zaf&oacute;n mixes in elements from numerous genres: mystery, fantasy, romance, and horror, and he does so flawlessly. The writing itself is fantastic and the plot is complex and intelligent. It is the first of three books written so far involving Daniel and the Cemetery of Forgotten Books and I'm looking forward to reading those as well. The Shadow of the Wind is an international best seller and has been translated into over 40 different languages, fortunately one of them is English.

B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|I loved A Thousand Suns - I thought it was much improved over Minutes to Midnight and brought an interesting new sound to Linkin Park. Living Things to me builds on the best best of the new sound while trimming the abundance of swearing that consigns A Thousand Suns to daddy's office instead of the car. That's not to say they should write their music to please fathers who cart their toddlers around town, but it is to say that this album will likely have a wider appeal because of it.  ; )<br /><br />I've listened through 30+ times since it got delivered - it's great working music and obviously holds my interest. Definitely recommended to existing fans or folks who thought they knew what Linkin Park sounded like and didn't like it. You'll be pleasantly surprised. : )

0743297334|4.0|What a great book.  Seriously.  The prose is top-notch; the characters are full, interesting, even real.  There's a plot that's good and that works.  I can't not recommend this book.<br />That said, there's a lot wrong at the center of the book, and that's ignoring all the blatant bigotism and antisemitism and sexism and so on.  Simply put, there's an emptiness in the book, like Hemingway would rather have his narrator observe as a perfect outsider to any problem than show any flaws in himself.  It then reads almost like the perfect man complaining about how much everybody else just sucks, and no matter how good the rest of the book is, in the center it's cold.<br />(Also, other complaints about the general message of the book, but I think I've complained enough for a four-star review)

B008N1LL42|3.0|As a rule, I'm generally leery of movies based on games (either the board or the video variety).  With that said, I decided to take a chance with Battleship and I dont regret it.  Oh sure, the acting is nothing special, the premise is waaaay out there and without giving spoilers, the climatic battle is frankly silly.  But, with all that said, if you need a relentlessly pro-USA, pro-military show, put this on your Roku watch list right next to Battle Las Angeles and indulge in some mindless fun.  It's better than mowing the lawn.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|I absolutely fell in love with the show when a buddy let me borrow the first three seasons. I could not wait for this season to come out and it did not fail to impress.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I knocked this one out during a single quiet shift at work.  The author tells a good story, but you don't see anything new here that hasn't already been covered in the initial \\"Bin Laden is Dead\\" news stories that broke in 2011.  Still, its a good read and worth the few bucks it costs to put on your Kindle.
B008LSVLVA|5.0|What can I say but amazing. Saw the live show in Boston, and this certainly rivals the experience. I never wanted that show to end and I am soooo happy that this came out. Living it over again and again. Cannot get enough of all that I deserve! Sound, picture, musicianship are all on here. It blows me away every time I watch it. My only wish is that there was an alternate angle camera showing the whole stage thru out the show. The projections Lasse created are just mind blowing and I would have loved to fawn over them for hours.

1455502758|5.0|I admit, I first heard of Christopher Hitchens on the day that he died. My Twitter feed blew up with literary aficionados mourning the loss of the writer.<br /><br />Hichens wrote without barriers. If he thought it, he wrote it. According to Graydon Carter, a fellow \\"Vanity Fair\\" journalist who wrote the foreword to \\"Mortality,\\" \\"He wrote often--constantly, in fact, and right up to the end.\\"<br /><br />Hitchens died in 2011, a victim of cancer that began in his esophagus and explored t he rest of him like the Western territory. He described his initial tumor as a \\"blind, emotionless alien,\\" though noted soon after that it was a mistake to describe it as an actual living thing.<br /><br />Mortality is not an inspirational book. Hitchens did not write his essays to better the lives of others. They do that on their own, and not in the traditional sense. His final book is a posthumous collection of his views on death. Those who have read him at all will understand how grounded a realist he is, and those who haven't will appreciate his frankness.<br /><br />Hitchens was a devout athiest, and received a lot of backlash for his views. One offended reader wrote on an anti-Hitchens website about the correlation between Hitchens' fateful diagnosis and God's tendency to smite those who blaspheme him. This particular comment he dissects with incredible religious knowledge and wit only available to the man who has no belief in the religions he understands so well.<br /><br />But, whatever his personal opinions are, writers like this come few and far between. He will be missed, surely. After news of his death spread around the social media and physical worlds, his books, including the essay collection \\"God is Not Great,\\" and personal memoir \\"Hitch-22,\\" re-established their hold on the bestseller lists.<br /><br />Hitchens left behind a wife, three children, and millions of readers. His final moments are captured by his wife, Carol Blue, who writes the afterword.<br /><br />\\"My husband is an impossible act to follow,\\" she writes. \\"And yet, I must follow him. I have been forced to have the last word.\\"<br /><br />But, as Blue states later in her memory of him, writers like Hitchens do not die with their bodies. They remain on our bookshelves and in our hearts, and they always have the last word.sband is an impossible act to follow,\\" she writes. \\"And yet, I must follow him.

B008RV5K4U|4.0|1986 was a year marked by the Challenger Space Shuttle disaster, the Reagan/Gorbachev Nuclear Arms reduction talks breaking down, the first massive workplace shooting, the Iran-Contra scandal breaking and Geraldo Rivera opening empty mob vaults in prime time.  It was a very unsetting time, and into all this came a Batman story unlike any other that captured this uncertain time like a fleeing perp in a police helicopter searchlight.  Raw, poignant, satirical, and thrilling, Batman: The Dark Knight Returns (TDKR) literally changed the comic industry forever.  One of the best elements of TDKR were the asides that Batman had as he comments on himself, his struggles and his mission.  These \\"thought bubbles\\" revealed a Batman that was indeed borderline psychotic, obsessive, and deeply driven.  Unlike previous Batman internal musing, this was the first time we \\"heard\\" what Bruce Wayne really thought about Clark Kent, himself, Harvey Dent and his war everlasting.  This is what distinguished TDKR from a average Batman story, and made it a classic.  Sadly, this animated version did not include any of these asides.<br /><br />This animated version is very true to the art, style, and pace of the first two chapters of TDKR to include the satirical look on the media, but I think it missed being really great by omitting the Batman mental asides which allowed the reader to peer into a very uncomfortable place.  At the risk of sounding like a rabid fan-boy, I clearly understand the differences in the media and respect directorial discression; however, omitting Bruce Wayne's thoughts on Harvey Dent (for example) during the fight on the Gotham Towers changed a poignant and sad end to a life Bruce couldn't save into a Two-Face vs. Batman clip lifted from any of the animated series.  Perhaps we will have more in Part 2.<br /><br />Good, but missed great.  Must buy for any Batman fan, rental for the rest of us.
B008RV5K4U|5.0|As a huge fan of Miller's comic, I was eagerly anticipating this adaptation.  Ultimately, I was pretty blown away by this film.  I truly believe it manages to completely capture the spirit, action, and social commentary that Frank Miller embedded in his work.  However, you must remember, this isn't a motion comic.  Don't compare it side by side with the book and complain about changes.  If you prefer the book, read the book, but remember that film is a different medium.  There are certainly some changes, mostly pretty minor as far as plot goes, and it makes for a better film experience.  I for one was unsure what to think when I read that the filmmakers removed Batman's internal monologue.  Ultimately I think it was a great choice.  It would have really bogged down the film in terms of pacing, and they sometimes manage to get that monologue out through spoken words anyway.  Remember, being truer to the source does not make it a better film.  So on its own, it is a superbly crafted animated film.  Everything about it is smooth, action-packed, thought provoking, exciting, and just a complete joy to watch.  I have full confidence that Part 2 will blow me away just as much.

B003VTZTU8|5.0|Ben Goldacre does an excellent job of de-puffing all the health related puffery out there, and there's a lot out there.  It's very revealing that the drug companies spend much more on advertising than on research.  They know if they convince the public, the doctors will follow.  He's fighting an uphill battle.  The public (I don't exclude myself) is always more willing to believe a good story rather than good science.  Kudos to the author for waging that battle.

0525953728|5.0|OK My first full book review. I finished \\"No Easy Day \\"  the firsthand account of the mission that killed Osama Bin Laden. The book was refreshing in that the author (with assumed name) was compelling in telling his story but giving full credit to all his Brothers in Arms for their actions. At no point did I feel that he was operating out of ego or even being hyperbole in his comments. I believe this book to be a true and accurate account from a very honorable American Hero.  The very small amount of  knowledge about training techniques that I have affirms everything he says about his own training.  He states that the majority of the books profits are going to help other Seals and Seal organizations. I highly recommend this book to all.  I Pray that God Bless our Military and our very special forces heroes, like this Seal.

B008B0QH5S|4.0|This album is 5 Stars--One listen to \\"I'm Invisible\\" and its clear the Pet Shop Boys are far more than a synth pop band with a flare for danceable pop tunes.  These guys are mature musicians that transcend their genre tag and go well beyond with this gorgeous aural experience.  It resembles \\"Release\\" especially \\"Breathing Space\\" but goes way beyond in the beautiful soundscapes Chris is creating.  People who don't like it just don't understand the PSB are not a dance band, just listen to \\"Fundamental\\" if you don't believe me.  The lyrics are well constructed and send vivid messages, some quite sad, but like \\"Winner\\" some quite optimistic.  Although the enjoy it while it lasts does mute the joy a little as it should.  This is a wonderful album, much superior to their last.  I thought that was quite bland and predictable.  But listen to the radio, that seems to be what everyone wants.  Not me, I love this and it is in heavy rotation with the new Blaqk Audio, Bright Black Heaven.  Check that one out as well.
1441866868|5.0|I suppose steampunk SHOULD evoke a sense of nostalgia for an era that never really existed, but a lot of it doesn't, being just gears and steam added to whatever story the writer REALLY wants to tell. But The Windup Girl is different -- the world of this novel IS steampunk, and there would be no story or characters without the existence of this world. It makes the reader want to walk around in this universe for a while, but also tells a story that is immediate and compelling. A great book.

Dylan's songwriting is so much tougher, and more tender, than anyone else that he's simply in a league of his own at this point, extending the potentials of the art form beyond Billboard's wildest dreams. The Walt Whitman of American popular music. Tightest \\"bar band\\" recording today.

B009B50QOU|4.0|Someone said this feels like it feel between Nimrod and Warning. That's the best description I've seen on the sound. I really liked Warning. This has the clean guitars like that album. But it's not as experimental. There is a feeling of deja vu with a number of tracks, like Carpe Diem. But from beginning to end this is a good album I've already listened to about 5 times. Not their best, for sure. But so what. At this point they can cash in on the rapport they've built with fans over the years. And I bought it for $5. It's completely worth that price.
006097625X|5.0|As a professional comic creator myself, I can't heap enough praise onto the work of Scott McCloud. Scott takes a scalpel and tray and dissects the very fabric of what comic books are, in a comic book format, and keeps your mind engaged throughout the entire book. \\"Understanding Comics\\" takes readers on a mind expanding journey that educates, and more importantly, inspires. Highly recommended!
B0058DRTGC|5.0|First of all, Good to Great, is a good book, not a great book.  It is skewed too heavily toward using an organization's market performance as the yardstick for measuring what is truly \\"great.\\"  The information was excellent, but flawed as a result.  In the Social Sector version, Jim Collins makes up for his transgression.  Social Sector takes what is best about Good to Great and applies to not-for-profits or other organizations where greatness means more than what appears in financial reports.  Well-written and immediately useful.

0688156819|1.0|First off, the be clear, Tim Burton didn't draw anything in this book.  It was all done by Interrobang Design Studios.<br /><br />See that name, \\"Interrobang\\"?  It is probably the most interesting thing you will see in this book.<br /><br />I love most Tim Burton movies, but this book it a complete waste of money.  Go to your local Barnes & Noble in the mall and thumb through it for free.  Most pages have only 4 lines of REALLY bad poems on it.  you will literally read the entire book in less than 40 mins.  If you just like flipping pages for the sake of flippin pages, then buy this book.<br /><br />A good comparison to the quality of the poetry...go get baked on some Mary Jane with a few of your closest friends and while you are all slouched in your chairs afterwards munching of cheetos and devil dogs start making up poems about the dumbest topics you can think of.  THAT will surely be better than this book.  No lie!<br /><br />Only the most die-hard or dillusional Tim Burton fans will enjoy the jibberish that graces the acid free paper in the collection.  I am looking forward to throwing this into my chimnea to see if it will at least burn with some cool colors so I can feel like I got my $7.33 worth out of it.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Spooky story..... well written with twists and turns and chills. Kept me up until the wee hours of the night. Numerous plot twists..
034580404X|3.0|Ok, so just like others, I resisted this for a while but then my curiosity got the best of me and I read it anyway.<br />It had to be the worst and unintelligent book series I've ever read and I'm not talking about the sex. That didn't bother me because I knew what to expect going in (except by book 3 it becomes very redundant and pointless). The constant repetition of words and phrases, the lack of intelligent story-telling and incorrect grammar is what baffled me. However, the reason why I give it 3 stars is because somehow I didn't want to stop until I got through all 3 books and after seeing an interview with the author, I changed my opinion of her somewhat. It appears that she began to write just for fun and the fact that it got published and sold like hot cakes isn't really her 'fault'. She seemed embarrassed (as she should be) when confronted with questions and critism and from the interview you could easily see why the books lack a skilled writing style. I'm convinced the only reason this series is successful is because of the explicit sex scenes and the subject of BDSM. If it wasn't for that no one would even talk about it.<br />Of course, everyone is entilted to their opinion, but the way I see it, if someone gives this series 5 stars it is because they are simply at the same level of intellect.
1585104205|5.0|First off, this book was the missing link for me to understanding Latin.  I tried a few other books and just became lost in the declensions and verb forms when it came time to apply the knowledge to actual Latin paragraphs.<br />This book is far different.  Some people mention a lack of a Latin-English dictionary.  This book does NOT come with a Latin-English vocabulary...however the context of the sentance will help you figure the word out as it starts very simply such as \\"Roma in Italia est.\\"(Rome is in Italy) then will slowly build in a new vocabulary word such as \\"sunt\\" Roma et Gallia in Europa sunt\\"(Rome and Gaul are both in Europe). If you ever tried the Rosetta stone, this is based off a similar learning principal.<br /><br />This book helped me really start to understand Latin.  I tried wheelocks and memorized the declensions and some verb forms but I couldn't figure anything out....I also tried Learn to read Latin by Keller and Russell.  While these books work for many..they did not work for me.<br /><br /> I would recommend this book for those that just want to learn to read and translate Latin and not necessarily teach it....though I suppose after going through this book, you could use this as a stepping stone to more advanced Latin study.  In addition, a Latin-English dictionary and something on Latin grammer would be beneficial to have close by in case you have questions.  I bought a Latin Grammar card from Amazon that has the declensions, verb forms and other things on 1 paper for reference.  Enjoy!

B0083SBMBM|5.0|After five origin movies ([[ASIN:B001FD5KJM Iron Man]], [[ASIN:B0043JDUNS Iron Man 2]], [[ASIN:B001LM1456 The Incredible Hulk]], [[ASIN:B005ZCXPP0 Captain America: The First Avenger]], [[ASIN:B005H9B44A Thor]]), The Avengers ares finally assembled in an action-packed film directed by Joss Whedon. Putting all these superheroes into one movie couldn't have been easy, but Joss managed to give all the characters screen time, some more than others. The movie is a little slow at the beginning, but it picks up about forty-five minutes into it. I never cared for Loki in last year's Thor, but the character has grown in The Avengers. I was skeptical about Mark Ruffalo playing Bruce Dr. Banner/Hulk, but he played the character wonderfully. Finally, we get a Hulk that actually resembles the comic Hulk! The alien invading plot has been done to death (most recently in [[ASIN:B005OT2YVA Transformers: Dark of the Moon]]), but it worked out well in The Avengers. Overall, I loved the DVD and I though the movie was great thanks to Joss's quirky dialogue.

B001AQO3QA|5.0|I can see where Star Wars got the idea for their packaging for the Blu-Ray release of their series, it was a copy of the design of the Alien Anthology which has a far more impressing design. I was really impressed with the packaging of this series, the slip case is shiny and holographic in its color while the book inside the slip case that houses the actual Blu-Ray discs, has a matte finish that is sharp and clean looking. It's probably the best designed Blu-Ray packaging I've seen to date, although I do really like the Lord of the Rings extended edition packaging. The discs are a little hard to get out of this anthology set, but it's not a big deal. As far as the movies themselves, they have retained the actual film grain, they look stellar on Blu-Ray and are really sharp and the detail looks great. Some of the best transfers I've seen. And the supplemental features, man there is a lot of those. There are just a mass amount of features for each movie and this really should be a lesson for comparison for all other companies putting out boxed sets. This is an exceptional presentation in packaging, the films themselves as well as the special features. For this price, anyone who is a fan of these movies should own them.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I enjoy playing this in my spare time. I remember playing it when the fair came to town. would recommend to everyone.
B0059XTTW8|3.0|Gary Oldman and Tinker, Tailor have an impossible task: to measure up to the 1979 BBC mini-series of the same name.  The movie makes a good try, but ultimately falls short. There is just too much to the Le Carre story, and it cannot be told in two hours.<br /><br />There are some interesting aspects to the movie. For instance, the tawdry, bedraggled look to the sets is reminiscent of \\"1984\\" or \\"The Hour,\\" and provides an interesting subtext to the gray, unexciting, and often desperately pointless lives of the main characters.  Also, the movie does clarify a few aspects of the plot that were left undeveloped in the mini-series (the fate of Irina chief among them).  But in the main, the viewer is left with the feeling that he came expecting a banquet, only to find that he missed the main course.  Gary Oldman does a good job portraying Smiley, but it is just not possible to top the 1979 performance of Alec Guiness.  I must also say that the supporting cast of the 1979 mini-series is so good (particularly Ian Richardson) that it is hard to overlook how lacking the movie's supporting cast is by comparison. Worse still, a number of characters are combined in the movie while others, like Karla, are dealt with off-stage -- there just isn't enough time to tell the tale.<br /><br />Take my advice: buy a multi-system TV, buy the original BBC mini-series on Amazon.UK (only availble in PAL, Region 2, and only on videotape), and you'll never regret your decision.  I've watched the mini-series at least a dozen times, and every time I discover something new. The movie is entertaining and worth watching, but only once. The mini-series is for the ages.  (Note: don't buy the PBS version of the mini-series, available on American NTSC -- the editing is atrocious.)

B009B50QOU|1.0|It pains me to write this review.  It really, really does.  I have been a fanatical Green Day fan since 1994, when I was 15 years old.  I have purchased everything they've ever put out.  Nimrod was my go-to album when I was at college in South Carolina.  American Idiot was the soundtrack to the years I spent living in Florida.  Green Day has always been there with me, and for me.  So naturally, I was VERY excited about Uno!<br /><br />When, \\"Oh Love\\" hit the radios, I was taken back.  I didn't like the sound, didn't like the lyrics, didn't like anything about it.  I didn't worry too much though, because I actually didn't like the song \\"American Idiot\\" much when I first heard it.  And that album turned out to be a masterpiece.  So, I reserved judgement, and jumped all over the album as soon as I could get it.  Oh, boy.... \\"Oh Love\\" was actually a perfect representation of the album.<br /><br />Uno! is a muddled mess of Power Punk & Pop. Green Day has been transitioning into a straight up Rock band, with only very subtle, minor pop and punk influences.  They have evolved into a Stadium Rock band, much like Foo Fighters.  Bands evolve (usually for the worse), but in Green Day's case, it was for the better.  They went from being punk little kids, to becoming craftsman of beautiful, big time Modern Rock songs (and Top 100 smash hits), with anthems that you can bellow out, with all your hearts glee.  Uno! is obviously an homage to their past punk influences, but this time around, it doesn't work.  Why?  Because these guys are NOT punk artists anymore.  It's like a girl who used to be a sexy, gorgeous cheerleader back in college, trying to be just as sexy and athletic when she's 49.  It doesn't work.  And this album, this Power Punk/Pop sound, DOES NOT work for Green Day anymore.  Maybe it would have when they were still at that point of their lives, but guys in their 40's trying to be kids again is a flat out disaster.<br /><br />I hope Dos! is different.  I can only pray that all 3 of these albums aren't as awful as this one.<br /><br />**Edit/Update: All 3 albums are awful. :(  Tre is the least awful out of the 3, but what a complete disaster this trilogy was.  I hope and pray Green Day's next album is a Concept Album.that all 3 of these albums aren't as awful as this one.<br /><br />**Edit/Update: All 3 albums are awful. :(  Tre is the least awful out of the 3, but what a complete disaster this trilogy was.

B002RI9ZQ8|4.0|This book was a well written, fast paced thriller which never failed to keep the reader fully engaged. Thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish and look forward to the next one.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Lee Child has created popular fiction's best action hero. But he operates best in the realm of possibility and lately the premise of the inevitable \\"OK Corral Moment\\" seems a bit thin. Perhaps Child should consider Reacher returning to scenarios like his earlier dustups that did not require gargantuan props and stretches of the imagination. Otherwise, he has stayed true to Reacher's quest for an elusive moment of inner peace and I appreciate that.
B002OSXDAU|2.0|I had read The Fountainhead decades ago in school so I thought I'd give it another read.  For those who haven't read Ayn Rand before, or if you forgot a bit like I had, a little refresher is in order.  Ayn Rand considered herself quite a philosopher.  Another reviewer had commented that she was a better story teller than a philosopher.  Judging the book on the basis of either fiction or philosophy I would say it has not stood the test of time and therefor it's not a classic.<br /><br />The sign of a good story is that it quickly establishes an emotional link with the reader.  That generally requires hitting on central human themes.  The hero and heroine in the Fountainhead are so out of touch with normal human feelings and values as to make that connection imposible for me; they were mere stick people.  The villan actually has more human characteristics but they are not enviable traits, he's a real sleaze.  Without feeling some connection with the hero and/or the heroine there's very little to keep you turning the page.<br /><br />This was Ayn Rand first major work as a philosopher.  In the days before MTV when attention spans were somewhat longer I still remember having trouble plowing through the long, rambling speeches that the main characters deliver while laying out Rand's philosophy.  Today I simply have no patience for her pages-long sermons.  Where Hemingway was known for short, concise sentences it seems Ayn Rand was seeking to expand her prose as though she was paid by the word.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|No Easy Day is well written and moves along nicely.  I found it informative and interesting to read.  He gave an overview of how they train and their lifestyle.  Don't know what the big deal was about him supposedly letting out classified information..  I found nothing that I didn't already know or that one could not easily find online.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Simplistic waste of time. But many apps are, really. In the end, the graphics are rather good, the coin-pushing concept is basic nostalgic good time fun. Sound effects are as good as expected. You only can play for a few minutes until your coin supply runs out, unless you actually want to buy more. Don't know why anyone would want to do that. Just move on to something else for a while and the coins will reload themselves pretty quickly.
0345803485|2.0|I really tried to like it.  Bought this one in paperback and decided not to read the hype. Also read without prejudice. I really want to say bravo, but I can't. This book is thin on substance and I think it was exactly what I expected.  Still it takes courage to write this kind of stuff and I suppose there are a great many who will see something in this. Lightly amusing but so very superficial in plot content, a fault so many romance and erotica writers fall into, I think I will be sticking with the better old hands at erotica like V, Bliss, Grace, Toni Sands, Coldwell, Kell, Stormy Glen and Alcamia Payne.  However it's not all bad, I have two friends who love it.
B0025T6EY0|5.0|After watching Season 1 of Californication I was hooked!  I have been a fan of David Duchovny's since way back to the X-Files.  His special sense of humor is hysterical!  This series really grabs you with all the destructive behavior of Hank Moody and his real love for his family - you cannot help but pull for him.  All the other characters are wonderful too.  I have purchased all the other seasons up to Season 5 that I could get....NOT patiently waiting for Season 6 and 7 so I can get my Hank Moody fix! One of the best shows I have seen since I don't know when.....LOVE!~

B000K7UG34|5.0|a really moving and heartfelt war movie ,sypathetic to both sides in the vietnam war , and at the end a film that is powerfully for  our  simple and basic humanity.<br />  However the moment the credits begin we are given the names of the soldiers who died during the battle this film is based on, and as a result 79 names are flashed on so fast it is hard to read even one of them,<br />  i feel this is a huge insult to the lives of those real individuals whose story we have experienced some part of.  whats worse is that after the split seconds devoted to those men who gave their lives ,  the credits for the actors, producers, special effects technicians  and caterers then unfold at a slow and leisurley pace.<br />  Generally when we remember those who have fallen in battle we hold a minutes silence... and the mood at the end of this otherwise moving picture cries out for us to reflect on the lives given by some of the people portrayed within it.<br />  so much so that i rewound and froze each frame of soldiers names and quietly read and reflected about them before i let the rest of the credits roll, it took me about a minute and a half to read each mans name.<br />  i suspect somebody in hollywood overode the director on giving us sufficent  time to  pay tribute to those who gave their lives for us. and i hope that if theres ever a directors cut , that he gets a chance to remedy this jarring error
B008Y7GPY6|1.0|I fast forwarded the first three minutes because there was absolutely nothing going on.  Just a black screen.  I know why.  But it was boring.  It never recovered.

B007VT6QSI|5.0|Justin Bieber's CD \\"Believe\\" is really pretty good! This is my first Justin Bieber album and initially after reading the mixed reviews I honestly wasn't sure what to expect. Fortunately, I was pleased. I discovered that Justin doesn't sound like a girl; he has songwriting skills in addition to being able to sing with genuine emotion and he does some excellent songs here including a few with other artists. The quality of the sound is quite good; and the artwork includes pictures of Justin; a website address for the lyrics to each song; song credits and more.<br /><br />There's really not a bad track here. True, some of these songs I like a little more than others but overall it's still a relatively solid album. \\"All Around the World\\" featuring Ludacris gives the track set a good start; and I really like \\"Boyfriend.\\" I understand why \\"Boyfriend\\" became so popular so fast; it's terrific music. \\"As Long As You Love Me\\" with Big Sean is good and \\"Catching Feelings\\" has a pretty mellow flavor! \\"Take You\\" sounds like good music for clubs and \\"Right Here\\" featuring Drake is good although it's not quite one of my favorites. \\"Fall\\" and \\"Die In Your Arms\\" are poignant and \\"Thought of You\\" is more first-rate music. \\"Beauty and the Beat\\" which Justin performs with Nicki Minaj is another awesome tune and \\"One Love\\" is very well done. \\"Be Alright\\" sounds mellow once again; I like the guitar in that arrangement! \\"Believe,\\" the title track, is a highlight of the album and \\"Out of Town Girl\\" switches gears once more to a number that reminds me of a hip-hop sound. \\"She Don't Like the Lights\\" and \\"Maria\\" end the CD with Justin performing at his best.<br /><br />Not only has Justin Bieber released a very good album; he has a bright future. I look forward to him developing his skill further to make even better albums that this one! The deluxe edition of this album is a must-have for Justin's fans; and based on my own experience it's a great place to start if like me this is your first Justin Bieber album.stin Bieber album.

B005I3PAUO|4.0|I understand and accept some of the criticism for some of Baldacci's latest work. However, this is still an exciting and easy read. The new hero he has introduced is interesting and fresh. Once again there are a few too many unlikely coincidences, but the book still has pace and intrigue. I look forward to further adventures with the John Puller character. If you require something more intellectual, you will need to look elsewhere. If you simply want to get swallowed up in a story of death, corruption, terrorism, and investigation, then this might be a great book to consider...

034580404X|5.0|My husband and I both read this series. It can get very steamy in places, however we found Christian to be very willing to make changes in his life for the woman he loved. I can see where this book can bring couples closer (as it did us) without all the S&M. I found some of the things done to Ana very degrading, painful, and honestly....sick! Her love for him seemed to be far more important than what he was doing to her, and I'm glad she stuck to her guns (so to speak) when it came to some of the \\"tortures\\" I thought she was going through. Being raise that intimacy is to be a beautiful thing between a couple I was very shocked as to what she allowed him to do. Especially seeing that he was her first ( and only) partner. The ending left it open for another series. It would be nice to see that happen.
B0006GAO5Y|5.0|Rocky's appeal for me is that this movie could've come out in 2012 and still had the same resonance that it did in 1976. Why? It's because we all love the underdog story, and a movie like this doesn't need CGI to make it work. This movie's appeal comes from the rawness of Rocky's character and the whole Philadelphia street thing. The actors in this movie turned out to be the right choices, especially Burt Young, Carl Weathers and Talia Shire. There's a lot of realness to this movie that appeals to the viewer who may not have ever seen the movie before, and is just now seeing it for the first time. From a new viewer's perspective, I'm sure that the lack of technology during that time period and the less than fancy production would be refreshing. I love this movie, and it never gets old. It didn't hurt that this movie also came out during a golden era of boxing, and with the likes of Howard Cosell calling memorable heavyweight bouts on network television, before the advent of cable TV or satellite.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I've read the whole series and enjoyed them all.  This one is not my favorite because it did not seem to have the same abount of action as others in the series.
B008MPQ0R2|5.0|Have been waiting for a long time for this film to come in HD format. Bought it today and the image is excellent, sharp, 3D with warm and saturated, rich colour. Have to admit that having watched it several times, feel the pace is a little bit slow, nevertheless it blends wonderfully with the music.
B00370J7E0|1.0|Although the production is good and I suppose the songs are not the usual for the time, this album lacks the heart and soul of the Fleetwood Mac I have been listening to since the late 60's. Lindsey Buckingham is a musical genius (witness the two POP explosions of Fleetwood Mac and Rumours), and I would die a happy man if I could spend an evening in a Parisienne apartment with Christine McVie singing softly in my ear; but this album is just some ersatz pop mush. Usual professional baselines and rhythm set by Mick and John, the ultimate professionals with more experience than any other 15 POP bands! All this talent and no sizzle no auditory surprises and inspirations. This is not the blues driven stuff I love, but neither were MAC and Rumours which were unvelievably good POP albums. You can listen to those albums over and they hold up. There is nothing memorable about this album other than the lack of memorable moments. And who said Stevie Nicks can sing? She has a vibretto style and a crap voice that work on a few songs, but there is no voice there... Just style... I put off listening to this album until now because I have never heard anything worthy from this album other than Tusk... Now I realize that was a good decision... This is how I feel... disappointed!
B008Y5OWMK|5.0|Forget the adverse reviews of this brilliant film - and the statements that the plot is bewildering. These are the same people who preferred the shortened (butchered) version of Once Upon a Time in America. Visually this is one of the best made films ever and the plot, a class war in the West (based largely upon a true occurrence) is provocative, which is why Hollywood hated it, but ultimately fascinating. The opening at Harvard with Hurt and Kristofferson is spellbinding while the shots of Kristofferson in Wyoming are unforgettable. Yes it goes on for four hours, but that is why it may well be best viewed at home. Nothing says that you absolutely must watch it in one sitting and indeed it repays multiple viewings. I already have the dvd but I shall be buying the blu ray as soon as it is released. Now let's get The Conformist released on Blu Ray.

And published! Is this really what they do at British universities?

0547258305|5.0|Katsu is graced with killing. A bit of an odd grace for a woman but one that shaped her into the character she was-not what she could become. On an undercover rescue mission, Katsu meets Po, and man graced with fighting. He finally meets his match. Along their adventure to find out why his grandfather was kidnapped, he teaches her more about herself than she could ever have guessed.<br /><br />Out of all the books I have read thus far, this was the catchiest opening. From the start, you jumped into the action and told only bits of the world, enough to take a breath and continue on with the action. It was a great opening to keep the reader interested from the first page.<br /><br />While there were a couple \\"suddenly she understands\\" moments that were a bit awkward to read, the author did a great job of showing the growth of both Katsu and Po. Katsu changed greatly through the novel but the progression was well thought through and fit completely with the story line.<br /><br />I enjoyed the adventure and recommend it to anyone that likes YA fantasy.
0385342063|4.0|I love Sophie Kinsella's books. In fact, I own all of them!<br /><br />However, I'm beginning to feel like all of her books are EXACTLY the same. Same slightly ditzy girl, same mysterious stranger, same foppish doofus boyfriend! Really, read the little synopsis on the flap, use a modicum of your imagination and you will have figured out 99% of the plot.<br /><br />But, I'm still giving 4 stars because I found the book entertaining and read the whole thing in 2 nights. It's cute, funny, everything you want chick lit to be. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I can't wait for the next Sophie Kinsella book to come out :)

B008LSVL6U|5.0|As a big PTree fan, I was at first a little disappointed with Steven's solo work... I wanted him to quit screwing around and make another PTree record.  I must say he is winning me over... this concert blu-ray is simply stunning in every way.  Except for Marco Minneman, I'd never heard of any of these musicians, but they are all fantastic.  The guitarist (Niko Tsonev) in particular is a standout, I will have to check out more of his work.<br /><br />I'd only heard Grace for Drowning in stereo, but I see now why people were raving about the surround mix... this music really comes to life in 5.1.  My home theater has never sounded/looked this good.

B007GCY8FS|4.0|I am surprised that so many reviewers rate this book as a \\"1\\" or a \\"2\\" star effort.  The first 2/3 of this book are among the best of the Reacher series, where Child shifts back and forth between Reacher's point of view, as a passenger in a kidnappers' car, and the investigation of the kidnapping as conducted by FBI and other law enforcement agencies.  I think the device works very well and ramps up both the mystery and the suspense.<br /><br />The weakness of the novel is in the last 1/3.  Once it becomes clear that both the passengers in the kidnappers' vehicle and the individuals involved in the investigation of the crime are not who they seem to be, Child seems to provide the easiest and least interesting of the possible resolutions to the mystery.  [Spoiler alert]  Is the \\"kidnapped\\" woman really one of the criminals operating under a false identity?  Is she a secret Federal or State agent?  Is she really an innocent bystander?  Is the \\"eyewitness\\" really part of the criminal conspiracy?  Are the criminals going to poison a water supply?  Is the FBI agent investigating the conspiracy really a criminal traitor?  Who is the mastermind behind the conspiracy, and what is that conspiracy?  Once the conspiracy and the nature of the players is revealed, it is a bit of a letdown.  And the final chapters regarding Reacher's usual heroics in destroying the \\"bad guys\\" is rather familiar Superman stuff.<br /><br />That said, this book is more than worth it for the first 2/3rds and fans of Reacher will probably like the daring-do at the end more than I do.

B007THA4FI|4.0|Update: finished the book.  Not really my kind of fiction, I read fiction to STOP thinking about the depressing inequalities and unhappy endings in real life. (Slight spolier) I knew there was going to be a suicide in the book from reading reviews. I found myself wondering which character it would be (there are over 20 characters whom we get point of view from, maybe over 30) but not particularly caring too much. It was one of the top 5 I suspected, tho the triggering event was a bit of a surprise it was predictable many pages before the triggering event happened. Folks DO need to go in prepared, one thing I didn't see mentioned in reviews was that one of the characters is a cutter. This, plus the POV portrayals of spousal and child physical abuse and rape could be very triggering for some folks. Being inside the mind of a character while they are slicing up their arm with a razor blade if you are a recovering cutter (or other self-mutilation behavior) could be a very bad thing is my concern. I finished the book feeling like I had just sat through a really rough time with a friend who was just really awakening to the horrible disparities in society and hadn't really found their footing & hope for the future yet. It is not an optimistic book, and there weren't any characters I really connected with - none of them felt at any point like people I would really want to sit & have a cuppa with if I knew even as much about them as the other characters did. Might be a really good book for folks thinking of going into social work or community activism to read though. Depressingly accurate portrayl of that from my experience. I suspect a lot of this was JKR trying to process & come to terms with her own kids being teens/young adults in the socioeconomic situations she's been in, etc, and her trying to understand why some of these horrible things happen in the world where she doesn't see any humans as pure saints or pure evil.<br /><br />Original review was titled \\"20% of theway in, it's holding my interest but not as a Potter fan\\" and is below<br />NOT going to be letting my kids read this anytime soon, that's for sure. LOTS of swearing and other NC17 type stuff in here(annoying as I'm switching between the Audible version and the Kindle version while puttering around the house and have to turn off the audio if one of the kids comes near). As a social scientist, I am enjoying her delving into the inner workings and motivations of very different characters. It DOES make it hard to follow the audiobook version at times, though, as the perspective character switches FREQUENTLY, and inner dialogue isn't necessarily obviously such in the audio (the audiobook reader is no Jim Dale). Also rather annoyed that Amazon/Audible didn't do the audio whispersync thing with this that they're promoting so heavily. Really challenging to figure out what chapter I'm on in the audio when I switch to it with the way the chaptering is done on this one (more difficult than dong the same thing with the Harry Potter books - the chapters in the Audible one are just numbered sequentially without the way they're done in the table of contents of the print book, and they don't have chapter names, and the book restarts the chapter number count with each of the \\"days\\"... it's a pain). I took off half a star for that, and half for it not being, thus far, up to my \\"draw from all kinds of literary/mythology references to send me scurrying for an encyclopedia to learn more about something new\\" like the Harry Potter books did (and still do, after repeated rereads, so maybe I'll catch some references that send me off to learn more in a reread of this too). It's gritty and very realistic, sometimes depressingly so. It feels like Ms. Rowling might be giving a bit of personal commentary on the types of people who would be in the cafes when she was writing the early Harry Potter books in towns that I suspect were similar to this one, and giving us a little insight into the kinds of neighbors she's had herself going from the \\"living on the public dole\\" types after growing up very middle class and now finding herself very wealthy. If nothing else it will give you a lot of insight into how a very powerful woman perceives the inner workings of people she's been around throughout her life. She's not necessarily kind to many of them, there are lots of warts in here.

1451696191|5.0|\\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" has quickly become one of my favorite books due to interesting characters, relatability to the struggles of teen years and Stephen Chbosky's excellent writing style. The book deals with some of life's most difficult aspects such as suicide, depression, rape, drugs, and even homosexuality. And these things are exactly why the novel is so powerful and easy to relate to, woven into the story seamlessly and naturally by Chbosky.<br /><br />The story is about Charlie, an awkward teenager who is writing a series of letters to an anonymous \\"friend\\" about his experiences as a high school freshman. Charlie is quite intelligent for his age, with a keen ability to analyze the world around him, which convinces his English teacher Bill to continually assign books for him outside of the normal class curriculum. Their student/mentor relationship is definitely a focal point in the story and a great one. There is also Patrick and Sam, step siblings and seniors who take Charlie under their wing to teach him about life and love.<br /><br />In the novel, Charlie describes to his friend his growing love for Sam, who is beautiful, smart and kind. Charlie wants to pursue something romantic with Sam, but she doesn't see him in the same way, at least at first. Without revealing too much, let's just say that their feelings for one another prove to be more than mutual. One of the sweetest moments is when Sam gives Charlie his first kiss, wishing the first girl he kisses to be someone who loves him. Their relationship is complex and touching, and it grows throughout the book. Charlie begins as a naive kid who has a crush on an older student and later becomes someone who understands and respects the love that Sam gives him, something rarely seen among people but is possible.<br /><br />Patrick was one of my favorite characters due to his loyalty to friendship and his secret lover Brad. In regards to friendship, he treats his friends well, especially Charlie whois new to many ideas and experiences they go through. For instance, Patrick described his being gay to Charlie, even giving intimate details about who was the \\"dominant\\" one in his and Brad's relationship. And with time, Charlie speaks of being gay as normal and not a big deal, something definitely needed in a diverse world.<br /><br />\\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" is simply an amazing piece of literature. The characters are well developed and three-dimensional, and the issues present in the book ring incredibly true for many teenagers and even slightly older folks who recall their adolescence with nostalgia and even regret. For me, this novel was sad and painful during many parts, partially because I went through similar experiences as some of the characters and could empathize easily. And it is Chbosky's brilliant, enthralling writing that will quickly draw the reader in and bring the characters to life.

0739352989|5.0|I loved reading Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy.  When I found out it was on audio I had to get it.  It was not disappoining over all, however, the reader was good, but when she would change her voice for Christian I felt she didn't capture his voice very well, all of the rest of them were great.  I also had problem with disc 14 on Fifty Shades darker chapter 12, I didn't miss much and it wasn't a big deal because I also had the trilogy in print.  I can't wait for the movie.  I also bought the music from Fifty Shades of Grey, I love clasical music. I can't wait for it to get here.  Over all I have to give this the highest rating.

B002BU0DPE|1.0|I went through 3 pair of these headsets. They sound great but lack quality construction. My first pair started shorting out due to a bad wire on the second week. However, Turtle Beach did replace them after I sent them in under the warranty. Then they broke again where the head phone and headband meet 3 weeks later. I then bought a pair for my son and within a month the same thing happened. I loved my old Turtle Beach headset when they first came out and they were mono sound. I've had them for 3 years now and they still work great but the sound quality is lacking. I was a dedicated Turtle Beach fan, but it will be a long time before I will have faith in there quality anymore. Just 1 more thing, I had 2 fiends online that had the same problems with the same headset.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I really liked this book. Couldn't put it down at times.  The ending could have happened so may ways and maybe didn't happen the way I wanted it to... this is because I had feelings for the characters and maybe wanted a \\"lived happily ever after\\" type ending.  But that would have been the predictable thing to do and we don't always get our happily ever afters.  Great job making me feel for the characters in such a way.
0545425115|5.0|I like the movie, but I love this book! I read the books well before the movie came out and I much prefer the book. Although I do like the movie I think it left a lot out. This is a GREAT price! As soon as I saw how cheap it was selling for I had to buy it. Now I have the movie edition of the book as well as the original book. What a great deal! It was on time and arrived in perfect condition. One of my best Amazon deals so far.

B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Beautiful Disaster<br />All Abby Abernathy (aka, Piegeon, Pidge, Cookie, Lucky13) wanted to do was<br />escape her life in Las Vegas. The life she grew to hate with her gambling<br />alcoholic father. Abby and her best friend America (Mare) leave the bright lights<br />of sin city to head to Eastern University where she takes on the persona of a<br />cashmere sweater, pearl earring wearing freshman.<br />Travis Maddox, gorgeous tattooed bad boy is known for having a different girl in<br />his bed every night. Trav's cousin Sheply is the boyfriend of America, Abby's BFF.<br />Abby and Travis meet at an underground fight in which Travis is a victor.<br />Travis is attracted to Abby immediately and Abby has no plan on becoming another<br />freshman that Travis beds and throws away!<br />I liked this book right from the beginning. The entire bad boy meets seemingly good girl<br />with her own secrets was appealing. I enjoyed watching their relationship from friend<br />to a couple grow. In between Travis's fights in \\"The Circle\\" and the constant banter that emerges<br />from them was most entertaining, not to mention a cute love story!
0385343248|5.0|I've been meaning to read this for a long time but never got around to it. I was a little bemused why Clavell wrapped the ending up so quickly however I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Don't be put off by the length or even if you know little about Japanese culture as this is a book that should appeal to all adults. Even though it's very long, it's NEVER boring.
B007BLCGNU|3.0|As others have mentioned, \\"J. Edgar\\" is more of a character study than a straightforward biography or documentary, and there are times when \\"soap opera\\" might be a better term. The general picture it paints is one of an ultra-neurotic buffoon, albeit one with a few admirable qualities. Although Hoover may have been a hard guy to completely like or admire, it just seems the creators had some issues with their subject that show through a bit too obviously. Also, the way the film reverberates between public (Hoover's formation of the FBI, Communist subversives, kidnapping of the Lindbergh's baby, etc) and private life (his close relationship with his overbearing mother, awkwardness with most other women,workaholism,cross-dressing and apparent latent homosexuality, etc) gives it a patchy feeling. Granted, coverage of both areas is necessary, and they are not easy ones for a director to synthesize. Nevertheless, some bad choices were made here regarding what to include and what not to. There is nothing, for example, on the prosecution of the Rosenbergs or the FBI's role during the Vietnam War years. I, for one, would have liked to see more on such areas and less on Hoover's family life (or lack thereof) and his relationship with his right-hand man, Clyde Tolson.<br /><br />Despite the long time-span it covers, \\"J. Edgar\\" is smooth enough to follow, and Hoover's conflicting qualities--e.g., insistence on professional conduct and limitations of the Bureau's jurisdiction, yet, defiance of his own standards by becoming a sort of Rona Barrett of Washington--are often quite intriguing. Still, a linear biography told from a more distant and objective third person perspective might have worked better as the structure of this film.<br /><br />Most of the acting is tepid, but Judi Dench and Naomi Watts both give admirable performances as the two important women in Hoover's life (though I agree, the make-up is terrible).

B007XUMHQK|4.0|It's great that this old Quicksilver stuff has become available again. The Quicksilver album \\"Happy Trails\\" has always been a favorite of mine, and probably their best, particularly in that it's live and the bands of this period were at their best in the live setting. But I think \\"Shady Grove\\" also captures a unique essence of that time period, the exuberance and optimism characteristic of that time, and a sense of certainty that American society was going to change for the better. The guitar work by John Cippolina is particularly unique stylistically, and the powerful lead vocals by David Freiberg are trademarks of the early Quicksilver Messenger Service of this period in San Francisco Rock history. Shady Grove shares the \\"gettin' back to the Country\\" vibe and subject matter that began to surface in the music of the Grateful Dead and other prominent groups of the time, eventually becoming a full blown musical renaissance of music of every style. Adding to the country element on this album is Freiberg's viola licks and the great Nicky Hopkins on piano. For those looking for an emotionally uplifting bit of San Francisco rock, this is a good one. The quality of the remastering seems very true to the original recording on vinyl.

B006IYFCIM|4.0|Everybody would benefit from reading this collection of experiments with human behavior.<br /><br />I think it would be fair to compare the book's accomplishments with its declared goals. The author states the book's primary goal early on when he writes, \\"..We need to first figure out what forces really cause people to cheat and then apply this improved understanding to curb dishonesty. That's exactly what this book is about.\\" He continues to state, \\"Once we more clearly understand the forces that really drive us, we discover that we are not helpless in the face of our human follies (dishonesty included), that we can restructure our environment, and that by doing so we can achieve better behaviors and outcomes.\\"<br /><br />I appreciate the author's research that describes and delineates what his experiments chose to observe. For example, in one series of experiments, people lied in order to get tokens that a few seconds later were exchanged into money. These subjects cheated to an extent that was almost twice the amount of people who lied in order to directly get money.<br /><br />Another series of experiments showed that when people were tired or stressed, they were more likely to cheat. The amount that mentally exhausted subjects cheated was almost three times the amount of non-stressed subjects.<br /><br />There was also a series of experiments that tested the \\"what the hell\\" effect. The researchers found that the amount of cheating was not linear. A point was frequently reached where the subjects apparently decided to abandon a little bit of cheating, and started to cheat at every opportunity.<br /><br />The author proposes that a \\"fake it until you make it\\" approach doesn't ultimately lead to honest behavior. He suggests that it would probably start a chain of events that proceed through the \\"what the hell\\" context, where a little bit of cheating becomes a lot, and ends up with suffering when the truth is eventually revealed.<br /><br />But what these experiments examined, in my view, was not the origins of dishonest behavior, but rather the middle and ending parts of dishonest behaviors. As such, I don't see how the book's primary goal can be achieved.<br /><br />Without exploring the precedents to dishonest behavior, we are also left with a patchwork approach to achieving the secondary goal of changing outcomes by influencing the salient aspects of behavior.<br /><br />Understanding that I'm not an expert or a researcher, let me offer an approach that could be more conducive to achieving the primary and secondary goals of the book. In my opinion, the necessary but unexplored research area would be along the lines of, \\"What do I feel just before I act dishonestly?\\"<br /><br />I feel that the subjects' probable answers to this unasked question would indicate that the person's unfulfilled needs were in play. These needs are for the most part unconscious, and are the sources of automatic behavior that seeks to fulfill these needs. The outward manifestations of this automatic behavior will lead the subjects to symbolic fulfillment of their old needs.<br /><br />The subjects in the experiments may not be able to make the connection between their behaviors of say, cheating on a pledge to quit smoking, and their driving forces. This is probably because the subjects aren't consciously aware of the feelings they had just before they acted.<br /><br />The researchers may be able to bridge this gap with information obtained from measurements done by fMRIs and other instruments. They can integrate these measurements with the subjects' reports of their feelings.<br /><br />In my view, it is important that the researchers uncover the subjects' underlying feelings to meet the goals of the book. This is necessary because their feelings are closer to the causes of behavior, in my view.<br /><br />The subjects' behaviors are symptoms of their problems, not the problems themselves. The researchers would be better served to study the entiresituation as best they can.<br /><br />All of us anticipate while we read a book that there will be prescriptions and answers to the circumstances and troubles presented. But because The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty doesn't identify \\"what forces really cause people to cheat\\", the primary goal, to \\"clearly understand the forces that really drive us\\", isn't attained.<br /><br />Realization of the secondary goal is undecided. The author presented several examples of how environments affect people's dishonesty, such as conflicts of interests. He showed how people's rationalizations allow them to permit a level of dishonesty that doesn't harm their ideas about their own morality. But how can effective and enduring solutions arise \\"so we can achieve better behaviors and outcomes\\" when the roots of the behaviors aren't examined?

B000V4NX04|5.0|James Bond is a fictional hero. The film shows real heroes are quiet, sensitive and very brave all at the same time. Acting and plot are above the mark, and direction, especially the last 15 minutes, is understated, but makes the point very well. Guardian angels may not have wings, but it is their spirit which rises above the banal. Intrigue, betrayal, jealousy, lust, artistic creativity, idealism under intense pressure, tragedy, gratitude, redemption  - by trying to right many past mistakes - is hinted, and all these are depicted without undue drama. The movie gives rise to the belief - All life is Yoga. It makes an interesting comparison to Vibhishana in the Ramayana trying to constantly suggest the right path to His evil brother Ravana, at great danger to himself. The main character lives in a police state, but rises to protect the best examples of his society, secretly and under trying circumstances, under constant danger of being found out - and in the end, seeks neither name nor fame. The question left to ask is, is it because he made many mistakes in his initial career, and put away many innocents, before undergoing a moral transformation, and turning against his own devious masters ? Were there others angry with the state's oppression and interference ? Yes. One can struggle against tyranny in many ways, which way is right, one may ask ?

I now have my kids hooked on Pratchett and have read every Practhett novel at least 3 times. \\"The Amazing Maurice\\" is one of my perennial favourites.<br /><br />Think Pied Piper on steroids and you have the faintest gleamings of 'The Amazing Maurice'. Pratchett is the master satirist. He uses the story to deliver a message, and even some history. The rats history closely parallels human history; and the problems they face are the same as what we face. Pratchett is brilliant - I honestly don't think there is a living writer who can touch him. In the midst of humour he throws in deep philosophical arguments and statements.<br />Here is one of my favourite lines from this novel: 'If you don't turn your life into a story, you just become a part of someone else's story.'<br />'And what if your story doesn't work?'<br />'You keep changing it until you find one that does.'<br /><br />The cherry on the top for me is the name of the rats- Additives, Big Savings, Sardines, and Hamnpork, all taken from the items around them when they learnt to read!<br /><br />Pick this book up, claim it is for the kids, but keep it for yourself.
B008JAGZDE|5.0|thia movie was so awesome and jut as funny as the first one. It has all of the same carachters in it which makes it even better because without all of the same people then it will suck. I hope they come out with another one bacause this pone was excellent. the directers who wrote these movies were excellent and did a wonderful job! :)
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Works like a charm on my Samsung Tab 2. Syncs perfectly with my Kindle on all my other devices, and has the same capabilities such as highlighting, changing font, etc. I highly recommend it to anyone using a tablet for work or entertainment.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|The Shawshank Redemption is definitely one of my all time favorite movies. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman do an outstanding job in their roles. The story and characters are just phenomenal. I really want to read the book to gain an even greater understanding of the characters.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I was so moved by Cheryl's bravery and honesty.  She's a compelling storyteller with a unique voice.<br />If you are looking for a book that takes you deep into the harder parts of your life, look no further.  Do you want to be inspired to face your fears and heal your own heart?  This book is a good start.
030758836X|2.0|Too my surprise my son gave me this book on Audio and loved it.  The story should be compelling and I have a daughter named Amy so it was a good hook.  Then every other word was the f word and not necessary to make the point.  The C word was used over and over,  The story that never fully developed was the story Nick Dunn's father.  He was in a nursing home and hated women but that is all we got.  The only character that I liked was Nick's Mom who passes away and his sister.  I listened hoping that there was some magical reason to finish this novel.  There wasn't the  Amazing Amy gets more deranged and Nick falls into her world of deceit.  I am so sorry I wasted 2 weeks listening I actually felt sick knowing that my son and daughter in law thought this was a great book.  It shows how low society and what we think is acceptable has come.  This book is at least 100 pages way too long and repeats over and over.  Let gone girl be gone!

B0050DIWFC|4.0|Enjoyed reading this author's book giving it 4 stars. Was not prepared for what ensued. Completely startled once. Decided that was the end. Then completely startled again!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I believe the author did a great job in describing what really happened. I think we all knew where the leaks came from. All the politicians trying to get all the credit They could when they really did not do anything.Seal team 6 gets all the credit as far as I am  concerned. America owes them a great deal more than we could ever give them. All our men & women in the armed services are the most unselfish people on this earth to be willing to give their lives if necessary for the citizens of America. I purchased the book from Amazon for my Kindle.

B008MEM24S|1.0|its a horribly bad game and nobody should get it I promise you'll hate it its not fun and a dollor a stinkin dollor its one level then you pay a lot more for the other levels but you may think the other levels are better. WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I think they should make this game unable to sell!!

B008HK3XU4|1.0|This standing case would be GREAT if the battery on my Kindle 7\\" HD held a high charge. I constantly have to have the USB plugged into my computer to keep the battery from going too low. (no, I DO NOT have the Wifi on, and just playing a game like Angry Birds brings my battery down to 50% after playing for just 1/2 hr!! grrr)<br /><br />Unfortunately, the USB is at the BOTTOM of the Kindle Fire HD and it is frustrating to use my stand while it is plugged in because it is in the way of the grips on the stand!!!  It does not hold when the USB is plugged it.  I tried to turn it upside down, but all apps will NOT convert to the upside down screen!!!<br /><br />You cannot use the stand for vertical placement, either.  It has to ALWAYS be in the landscape position to use. (ggggrrrrrr)<br /><br />Also, the thick plastic case for the stand muffles my awesome speakers for HD and that is quite annoying!<br /><br />I should return it and get something more compatible to my needs.  Any feedback or helpful hints would be appreciated!!!!!

0307474259|5.0|Thank you Gary Taubes for creating a wonderful book that really explains in mostly laymen's terms what makes us fat (and sick), and more importantly, what to do about it.<br /><br />There is an old adage that if you tell a lie enough times it becomes a truth. Mr. Taubes does an excellent job of exposing the many myths around weight loss, weight gain, and the underlying causes that not only make us fat, but ruin our health in the process.<br /><br />Everyone interested in improving their health needs to absorb Mr. Taubes' writing. And no, the secret to controlling your body fat is not to eat less and exercise more - the real truth is that this doesn't work, however logical it might seem.<br /><br />Read this book - open your mind - your health depends on it.
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|I have enjoyed Lee Child's Jack Reacher stories for a long time which is why I pre-purchased A Wanted Man however, I don't believe I will do this again.<br /><br />This story was so unlike a Lee Child's novel, in that it lacked continuity and left things hanging to a point where my only feeling upon completion was relief.  On reflection, it appeared the Author was rushed into completeing this book, and so the ascending excitement we have come to expect was missing and as I said, I was relieved when I completed the book, and that is not the emotion I expect with Jack Reacher.  Some ideas that seemed so important in the early stages of the book, such as the broken nose, hadn't any connection and was never given one.  The characters were by and large given little definition and whilst the plot had a great deal of potential, unfortunately I found myself wishing he had written it differently.<br /><br />If this was your first encounter with Jack Reacher, do not despair, because the earlier novels are excellent and definitely worth reading.
0007466064|5.0|the book arrived on time and looked like it had never been opened. would definitely do business with them again. thanks!
B006LSZECO|2.0|Although the book seems to be very popular I could not get that interested in the plot and it did not hold my interest.  Our book club had mixed feeling about the book and it was just not as good as advertised.
B009D0LBRO|5.0|Easy, Intuitive, and cheap! The graphics are great and optimized well for my tablet and gameplay is fun. Be warned, though; the game needs to download an additional 68 mb after purchase.

B007LB1O3I|3.0|\\"MDNA\\" is a clumsy abbreviation, but Madonna already made a self-titled album. And I don't think this one has any connection to that one. So, as bad of an idea as it was back then, in 1983, when self-titled debuts were commonplace, it's even worse now. Surely after Hard Candy; a title both sweet and fitting; she could've come-up with something better.<br /><br />The good thing is that, with the exception of two features from pop music's most annoying rapper, Nicki Minaj, the title is the worst thing about the album. The songs are typical Madonna, which isn't bad. I didn't say it was good; her teen-sing melodies are rarely catchy and her lyrics stay trite all night; but it's not bad, mainly because of the beats.<br /><br />The \\"Queen\\" of pop has a thing for electronic dance music. That's what I like about her. She surrounds herself with producers like William Orbit and the Benassi Bros. They provide her with music that pops and flares with thumpy drums, pulsating bass and snazzy synths. So it's not hard to block-out lead vocals if necessary and just groove to the music.<br /><br />The album's coolest moment comes at the end of the Gang Bang song, which isn't about what you might think. Madonna has kids now. She's not nearly as erotic as she used to be, at-least not in public. But she can still shock. \\"Now if you're gonna act like a bitch,\\" she says, while holding a gun to her lover's head, \\"then you're gonna die like a bitch.\\"<br /><br />marcellee.com
B008I3QZKU|5.0|This is a great CD.  The Killers never disappoint. Brandon's voice gets better with each CD, as does the overall music production. I love the lyrics that everyone can relate to...well at least those of us that grew up in the mid-western states.  The songwriting has depth and variety just like Day & Age, and Sams Town had.  I don't get the complaints about the ballads...Since when is an awesome ballad a bad thing? Its not like they are boring ballads either, they are like Dustland Fairytale which rocked. Great CD, I will be spinning this one for a long time to come.
B005LAII8A|4.0|A mind game we all play with ourselves is, if we could go back in time and kill Hitler, would you? What if Hitler were a ten year old child? Are you killing a person who will be the mass murderer of millions or a ten year old? This is roughly the premise of \\"Looper.\\"<br /><br />\\"Looper\\" stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Joe, a hit-man, who has it pretty easy as hitmen can have it, he sets out a plastic tarp in a secluded location and the hit appears and he kills them and disposes of the body. The `hits' have been transported back in time from the year 2073 by the mob. Joe is living the high criminal life, he has a money to spare, parties with strippers and has a drug addiction. The world around him is easily extrapolated from the world we live in now and seems on the verge of chaos, the poor roam the streets and people openly carry guns to ward off danger or perceived danger. Although the world doesn`t seem totally dystopian, large glittering cities are seen in the distance and China seems a shining jewel of the future.<br /><br />Joe's life seems to be going better than most even though he's on the seamier side of crime and he seems to understand that. One of the hits that comes through the time portal is a middle-aged man who he recognizes as himself from the future, he hesitates a moment and doesn't kill his older self (Bruce Willis) and he escapes. Soon the mob is after Joe, both old and young, while the young Joe tries to elude the mob and find his older self and finish the hit. In a meeting Joe learns from his older self of a crime boss in the future called `the rainmaker' who has taken over all the mobs without an army and has murdered hundreds or thousands of those who got in his way in the future and he's closing the loop on the loopers sending their older selves back in time and having them kill 'themselves.'<br /><br />Joe discovers one of the possible places `the rainmaker' grows up as a boy and goes to the house to wait for his older self to show up. In the mean time Joe meets the boy that will undoubtedly grow up to be `the rainmaker' and even though he knows what the boy will grow up to do, protects him from himself.<br /><br />If this synopsis is a little dizzying don't worry, the movie isn't. It's written and directed by Rian Johnson and the future he envisions is terrifyingly real looking, the seedy sides of the city look seedy and the city's proper are gleaming jewels. Even though Joe's life can be seen in any gangster movie, there's some nice science-fiction touches to make \\"Looper\\" fresh. Jeff Daniels also appears as a crime boss from the future that has some darkly comic moments.<br /><br />\\"Looper\\" is like a gangster movie meets \\"Terminator,\\" and it will keep you wondering what will happen next, there doesn't seem to be any formula filmmaking here. When you leave the theater you may find yourself asking yourself is destiny fate? Is there redemption for a would-be mass-murderer if his past could be changed?mean time Joe meets the boy that will undoubtedly grow up to be `the rainmaker' and even though he knows what the boy will grow up to do, protects him from himself.<br /><br />If this synopsis is a little dizzying don't worry, the movie isn't.

B00846REIS|1.0|BTY is awful....without getting into the who copied who and when....probably that story of people with giant egos looking to destroy each other over book sales deserves its  own book ( which i will not read) i don't have time for any of them.....i will say this simply a case of good math, bought BTY when it was $5.... I read it without knowing the back story, and around the same time i read FSOG, the trilogy. I would not buy BTY at the $8 price tag it has now because its just not a good book and i definitely will not be buying the follow up at $10... I simply have too many great and highly creative authors to choose from ([[ASIN:B007XIBZ5G Hold 'Em]],[[ASIN:1937608042 The Men with the Golden Cuffs, Masters and Mercenaries, Book 2 (Volume 2)]], [[ASIN:B009B56JWI Creed (Unfinished Heroes)]]) to care much about copycat authors whose work appears to be the publishing equivalent of thievery.  Also, I looked at SD's  profile on amazon and she is so self-promoting and almost like she can't believe she is true, who makes a listmania list of her own books, in every format even of books that have not come out yet, she seems slimy and sleazy to me.<br />Also,  everyone is abused in these books,seems to be a common theme in romance today....  The man was abused, the woman is definitely abused, her sister too, the dog maybe, the friend and the neighbour (not to trivialize the importance of sexual abuse as a situation in our society, i think these stupid authors are doing a pretty good job of trivializing this issue, by using it to add sensationalism to their books to boost sales). I can picture the publishing exec sitting in some conference room telling the brainless author \\" sexual abuse sells books.....pedophilia especially\\", and this self-absorbed author sitting there saying \\"yes of course you are right if i can add $4 to the price of my book\\". I would suggest to all romance authors out there, it is not pleasant to imagine other people, woman or man at any age being abused just for the sake of your boosting sales, its a very real issue that touches the hearts and lives of real people and their loved ones.<br />So  dear author,I made a mistake and bought one book of yours and never will again, so slither away into  your hole in the ground and keep writing copycat books....you will never see another dime from me.
B008Z9YGEE|3.0|This is a so-so book. I bought it since I was hearing \\"hunger Games\\" all over the television ... Is this book foreshadowing American society? Is it a call to rebellion? ... You tell me

0316098515|4.0|I will come out and say straight up that Eleven Madison Park cookbook is one of my all-time favorite cookbooks. The book itself is laid-out in an artful but logical and easy-to-read format. Special mention should go to the \\"back-of-the-book\\" recipes, which are organized into sections such as [fluid] gels, purees, ice creams, jus, butter, etc. I have never seen a high-end restaurant cookbook with such a vast section of component recipes. It goes without saying that the food photography is world-class and I have yet to see any cookbook with better photography.<br /><br />The recipes are obviously the heart of the book, and they will not dissapoint. This book features a collection of complex dishes, organized by season. Each dish generally features one or two star ingredients, along with a multitude of component recipes that serve to highlight that ingredient in very unique flavor combinations. For example, my favorite dish I've cooked so far out of this book was \\"Pork Belly with Mint, Peas, and Lettuce.\\" Other combinations are even more inventive, such as \\"Foi gras terrine with plums and bitter almond.\\"<br /><br />A word of warning: these recipes are not for the novice home cook. Many of the recipes call out for specialized equipment such as dehydrators, sous vide equipment, professional blenders, and liquid nitrogen. I do applaud the authors for attempting to make the recipes *slightly* more accessible to home cooks by offering alternative preparation techniques when available. Most of the sous vide recipes also offer an oven-roasted alternative preparation. Similarly, many of the liquid nitrogen recipes (such as \\"almond milk snow\\" and \\"green apple snow\\") also offer options to prepare using a standard freezer.<br /><br />I did take off one star for the use of volumetric measurements, which is a bit perplexing. It is pretty much the de-facto standard to use weight measurements in advanced cooking, but Humm has chosen to use volumetric measurements (cups) instead - which makes executing the recipes less precise. He still provides weight measurements (in grams) for some ingredients that require the extra precision, such as modernist ingredients (agar agar, xantham gum, etc). It is also worth mentioning that the recipes seem to be a bit salt-heavy across the board. I don't know if I'm just a bad cook, but I have more-or-less used half the amount of salt the recipes call for to achieve a reasonable saltiness.<br /><br />Make no mistake about it - these recipes will take a lot of time to prepare (I would estimate between 3 and 8 hours per recipe) and will often call for hard-to-source ingredients (unless you don't mind going online). As such, this book is probably only appropriate for adventurous home cooks and restaurateurs. But for those who are interested in this sort of thing, it's the best offering this side of the Modernist Cuisine.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|To begin with, David McCullough's acclaimed biography is fine literature as well as history and Tom Hanks' production takes the story another step into emotional depth.  Having seen them in recent films, I was at first distracted by Paul Giamatti and Laura Linney as John and Abigail Adams.  But as the series went on, Giamatti and Linney disappeared and simply became John and Abigail.  The short, squat Adams seemed out of place in the pantheon of Founding Fathers.  This series shows that without his stubborn spirit (which was often not appreciated) the American Revolution would likely have failed.  And without Abigail's \\"ballast,\\" as John called it, John would likely not have been able to be the force he was.  In addition to seeing this country come into being, we see the intimate relationship of a remarkable couple as they face years of separation due to his work, tragedies with their children, scorn from the public and other elected officials, and difficult living conditions.  (Most of their life is on their farm, which they work themselves, and they move into the White House when it is half finished.  An interesting footnote is that the U.S. White House, now inhabited by an African American family, was built largely by slave labor.)  Director Tom Hooper does not pretty things up, giving a deep sense of realism to the film.  What a great way to learn American history!
B007VTVGFQ|5.0|LARGO is one of the best songs of the new cd and it does not appear on this version (at least according to the track list shown here).  It is marvelous, so find the cd with LARGO (track 11).<br /><br />Anyway. It's easy to see why most of my friends are turned off by Fiona's new cd.  Let's face it, if you don't have the patience, then you won't get it.  I'm sure Fiona designed it that way on purpose.  That's how she rolls...or flies or whatever.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|Mama Mia is the big-screen adaptation of the hit Broadway musical. Sophie lives on a remote Greek island with her ex-rock star mother Donna (Meryl Streep, who, you may know, can nail a song). Sophie is about to marry Sky and she really wants her dad to give her away. Unfortunately, Sophie doesn't know who her father is. Finding her mother's diary, she invites the three men Donna was involved with at the time: Bill (Stellan Skarsgard), Sam (Pierce Brosnan) and Harry (Colin Firth).  Mostly the film is a showcase for singing and dancing to the best of ABBA's songs.  It got a lot of critical reviews, but it definitely worked for me.  A lot of fun.
B000H4QD1O|5.0|Probably the most original television series I've ever viewed. Somehow this series manages to take the outrageous idea of combining science fiction with the western genre and pulls together something both deeply interesting and incredibly entertaining. The characters are well-developed and, in some cases, very mysterious, and the universe is well-imagined.<br /><br />Of course, everyone knows this series ended well before its time. Many loose ends are left hanging at the end of this series, but, as I understand, the 2005 Universal Studios film \\"Serenity,\\" based on this series, ties up some of those loose ends. This series is well worth watching and paying money for (free on Prime)!
B001LRJH0U|5.0|Ed Harris decided to take a stab at the western genre, and the result is not a predictable film.  He directs Appaloosa and also plays Virgil Cole, a good guy gunman who hires out with his partner, Everett (Viggo Mortensen) to clean the bad guys out of Western towns.  Jeremy Irons plays the bad guy in the town of Appaloosa.  The woman in the story is Renee Zellweger.  Harris makes good use of this fine cast to tell a story with subtlety and insight into the characters.  Virgil and Everett's friendship is marked by its honesty and trust and their ability to expertly handle the complications that arise in gunfights, negotiating with townspeople and Indians, releasing hostages, and such.  Their biggest challenge is dealing with the widow that Virgil falls for.  Zellweger's Allison French reveals the vulnerable situation of women in such a society.  What looks like superficial promiscuity on her part is actually a strong instinct for survival.  The gunfights are interesting and well done, but the best part is the slow-paced dialogue and meaningful glances.  A fine film.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|THE LAST EPISODE  WHICH WAS ALL OVER THE  PLACE AND  TERRIBLE will not keep me from giving this seires five stars.<br />i will just never watch the last episode. as easy as that! this show is scary, creepy, interesting, and keeps  me<br />wanting  more with each epsiode. really  scary! the house, music, sets, lighting,editing are all top notch. the actors<br />are great and JESSICA LANGE- JESSICA LANGE- what can i say just the best actress today. she gets better and has reinvented<br />her whole acting range to higher and different levels and she isn't afraid to take chances. in my opinion she looks better<br />than ever and actually becomes what character she plays into unbelieveable realism.  JESSICA LANGE is the reason this series<br /> worked she added class, excellence, and  knowledge into a show which could have easily been looked over. i don't really care<br />to understand this series, the characters, the actions, i want it to  be thrown at me like each new episode was. i don't<br />want this to make sense or have any other purpose but what it did to scare, fascinate, and entertain me!
0312427999|5.0|The father of the Shock Doctrine is the late Milton Friedman, economist at the University of Chicago School of Economics beginning in the 1950s.  In his counterrevolution against the New Deal of economist John Maynard Keynes, Friedman foisted on the world his policies of privatization, free trade, and slashed social spending.  His first experiments were in Chile (where he consulted with Pinochet) and Argentina.  After laying waste to those two countries, Friedman and the \\"Chicago Boys\\" carried their destructive policies to Poland, South Africa, Russia, Sri Lanka, and other hapless countries.  More recently we have seen the disastrous results of his policies in Iraq, New Orleans, and the current financial crisis in the U.S.  Donald Rumsfeld was one of Friedman's adoring students.  Rumsfeld didn't pull the phrase \\"shock and awe\\" out of the air when attacking Iraq.  Friedman's theory is to either create disaster (Iraq War) or take advantage of disaster (9/11, tsunami, Katrina) and use the disorientation of the populace to put in place your new programs, namely corporate control.<br /><br />Journalist Klein chronicles decades of these disasters, country by country.  Likening free-market shock therapies to torture by electroshock, she demonstrates how free-market ideologues welcome, and provoke, the collapse of other people's economies. Her conclusion is a powerful populist indictment of the current economic orthodoxy.  In Klein's words:  \\". . the real track record of the free-market crusade: the dismal reality of inequality, corruption, and environmental degradation left behind when government after government embraced Friedman's advice, given to Pinochet all those years ago,that it was a mistake to try `to do good with other people's money'.\\"<br /><br />Klein documents that when some of the populace come out of the shock, become lucid, and begin to challenge the implementation of the policies (such as the loss of democracy, prices through the roof), the next step of shock doctrine is to terrorize,  torture, or to make the challengers disappear.<br /><br />Klein also tells about the International Monetary Fund, founded after World War II to help struggling countries and their economies recover. Many of its managers and policy-makers have been graduates of the Chicago School of Economics and have imposed the Friedman creed wherever possible.  Davison Budhoo, an IMF staffer, became a whistle-blower in 1988 and wrote a scathing letter of resignation.  He resigned, he said, after twelve years of \\". . hawking your bag of tricks.  To me resignation is a priceless liberation, for with it I have taken the first big step to that place where I may hope to wash my hands of what in my mind's eye is the blood of millions of poor and starving peoples.  . . Sometimes I feel that there is not enough soap in the whole world to cleanse me from the things that I did do in your name.\\"<br /><br />Klein says that the endless war with \\"Terrorism\\" that George W. Bush proposed was an expression of the Friedman doctrine.  It is not a war that can be won.  Winning is not the point.  The point is \\"to create `security' inside fortress states bolstered by endless low-level conflict outside their walls.\\"  She holds up Israel as the most advanced example of such a fortified, gated community.  \\"This is what a society looks like when it has lost its incentive for peace and is heavily invested in fighting and profiting from an endless and unwinnable War on Terror.  One part looks like Israel; the other part looks like Gaza.\\"<br /><br />Klein's summation of the Chicago School experiment:  \\"It has been one of mass corruption and corporatist collusion between security states and large corporations, from Chile's piranhas, to Argentina's crony privatizations, to Russia's oligarchs, to Enron's energy shell game, to Iraq's `free fraud zone.'  The point of shock therapy is to open up a window for enormous profits to be made very quickly -- not despite the lawlessness but precisely because of it.<br /><br />It is impossible to do Klein's book justice.  It has been highly praised by many with such words as:  brilliant, brave, terrifying, epic, masterful, stunning, required reading.  I like this one best:  written with perfectly distilled anger.
B0027Z9C2I|1.0|Watching Mama Mia makes me yearn for riveting documentaries about economic theories.  Bollywood movies have more unpredictable plot twists than this dog.
B00125WAWS|5.0|The Great Debaters is based on a true story about an underdog debate team that wins a national championship.  The team is from Wiley College in Marshall, Texas, a black institution in the Jim Crow South of the 1930s. The school's English professor is Melvin Tolson (Denzel Washington), who is also a secret organizer for a national sharecropper's union.  Tolson was one of America's leading poets as well, although the movie barely touches on that.  The movie is more about how the debate team, its coach, its school and community believe that an education is their best way out of the morass of racism and discrimination. They are black, proud, single-minded, and focused.  One of the features on the dvd is allowing us to meet some of the actual debaters who were on this team.
0345803485|1.0|This book perpetuates the idea that people who like BDSM were sexually abused. What is practiced is not BDSM, it is abuse, considering consent is rarely given. This is a poorly written fantasy that excuses an abusive relationship in exchange for sex and money. How has this even been published?
B001HN6922|2.0|I'm not sure that this deserved a G rating. This sequel is a Bond-style spy thriller. There are LOTS of explosions and bullets flying. Mater is rigged with a bomb at one point. In my opinion, this Cars movie is far too violent, fast-paced, and dark for little kids. (My son is three.)
0525953728|5.0|This is an excellent book and I would recommend it to everyone to read. Well written, some redundent parts, but very easy reading.
B0087HT36U|4.0|This game is definitely not like Angry Birds. While true, the goal is somewhat similar, the game play is what I much prefer here. I'm not much of a fan of the &quot;pull back and shoot&quot; games, so this is perfect. Since I got it as a free app, I've had no issues with the other problems people have been reporting.

B007GCY8FS|3.0|This was very good, but a little far-fetched even for Mr. Reacher and Mr. Child. The one glaring error was at the very end, when Reacher is continuing to wend his way East: after spending he night crawling in mud and cowshit he gets onto the highway to hitch a ride--usually he makes an effort to get cleaned up a bit before setting out to hitch.

B007WULJ5G|4.0|OK. So if you are reading this you are looking to see one pretty sick film. I am going to try to give a review for those people.<br /><br />When I first started watching, I was really surprised at the production quality. Usually when you go searching for one of these \\"underground\\" disturbing movies the production value is usually what I would call \\"B-Movie\\" quality. This movie is not however. It is extremely high quality.<br /><br />The music. This was by FAR my favorite part of the movie. The music was expertly chosen to create an un-nerving atmosphere through the entire movie. But the music's biggest role was to create that mood up through the slower beginning of the movie till around mid-way through. But honestly, the music really does rock, completely sets that mood.<br /><br />So now, let's get down to the nuts and bolts. I am not going to talk about the plot or story of the movie. If you want that, google it! I am here just to provide some info. I have heard A LOT about this movie. And being an avid horror/thriller/B-movie fan for a while. I've seen so much of the good, bad and ugly. This is certainly an interesting one. I did my homework on it. Reading reviews, checking websites, etc..... And I wasn't sure what to expect when I finally watched it. Some reviewers were saying thinks like, 'I want to punch the director', 'I couldn't finish the movie', 'It scarred me for life', and much of the like. Now this is where I might get some heat. Don't get me wrong in any way shape or form, this movie has some massively disturbing content. But.... It's a movie. It's not real. The topics, special effects, and content are all disturbing and do push the limit. But it really was just a movie. Some parts were even chuckle worthy. Maybe I'm just a grizzled veteran of horror films, but for me this movie was as disturbing as Saving Private Ryan IMO. Sorry, to burst any bubbles here, but if you are a horror afficionado you might not find this as depraved as so many reviewers arestating. It is most certainly worth a watch as I think it is a very interesting movie with some excellent music and effects. I wouldn't really recommend this for the squimish or easily offended, but for someone who is up for the challenge and has a few horror films under their belts. Go for it.<br /><br />The movie pushes the envelope in it's effects, music and certainly it's controversial content. IMO though, it is just that. A controversial movie that provides an interesting evening of entertainment for the few sick individuals watching it, myself included. But in the end, it's just a movie.
B000XR4OC0|5.0|Are you sick of those cheap, uncomfortable Wall-mart shoes that make your feet feel terrible after five- minutes of wearing them? If you are Toms are the perfect shoes for you! Toms are supper comfortable and cute , you can wear them in the summer or winter. They are made with canvas, with and arch support on the inside.<br /> Toms come in a lot of different styles and patterns. You won't have the same Toms as somebody else because they are all so different. Toms are fifty dollars that's a little pricey but, some of the money buys a little kid in need of shoes Toms. So it's worth it!<br /> I like Toms because they are comfortable. When we went to Disneyland we had to walk around a lot. I was the only on e in my family wearing Toms. All day everyone was complaining about how much their feet hurt, and my feet didn't hurt at all! Me and my friends all have toms we all wear them all the time! You can wear Toms anywhere, to school to a football game anywhere you want! If you are looking to be in style and comfortable then these are the shoes are the shoes for you!
B000Y7U98W|4.0|I know this review is coming late in the game, but I recently re-watched this film.  I remember how psyched I was to see it when it opened, but it never came to any of the multiplex theaters near where I live.  This surprised and disappointed me since Danny Boyle and Alex Garland were just coming off their success with 28 Days Later.  The reviews I read at the time said that the ending was a ridiculous bummer, but I was not deterred.  I bought the movie the day it was released on DVD, watched it, and found it to be intelligent, entertaining and unusual for a big-budget movie of its type.  I thought the horror element added to the end of the film (no spoilers) was not the monkey-wrench many made it out to be.  I thought it added an extra dimension of tension and was creepy and stylishly shot.  The film itself is also harrowing and suspenseful.  What can I say, it worked for me.  The always-reliable Cillian Murphy pulls off his role with absolute believability and Chris Evans makes a nice emotional flip-side to Murphy's coin.  Evans may not be the best actor, but he brought the role in with conviction and commitment.  I really believe this is an underrated Sci-Fi flick that deserves a second look from fans of the genre.  Is it 2001: A Space Odyssey?  Heck, no.  But you could do a lot worse when it comes to effects-laden sci-fi disaster/adventure films.  Check it out if you have a mind to.  You may enjoy it.
B0049U4NQO|5.0|Horowitz is amazing..all his books are amazing.. people didnt like the ending bc Jack died..but I still loved it..the plot,characters, and the action were amazing!!!!!
0316776963|5.0|I've read a few of David Sedaris' books and enjoyed them all but this one is by far my favorite. I've kept finding myself laughing out loud.
B000F9RB8A|5.0|It came in a couple of days with Amazon Prime membership. I primarly bought this because it has the original Chinese language audio. I'm not a fan of English dubbing over non-English movies. I prefer the original language with subtitles. A very good movie with lots of action and humor.
B0085A9J18|5.0|This movie is amazing. Action sequences are brilliantly choreographed, overall pace has you nearly jumping out of your seat, and plenty of \\"Holy ^*&%!!!!\\" moments. Seriously, buy this movie.<br /><br />Amazon service was excellent. I had preordered this movie and had a price reduction to match lowest offered price between the time when I ordered and the product shipped. The product came as I expected it to - great condition, on time, and with cloud feature streaming available.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Bible comes complete with daily devotions you can use.  I'm currently doing the one on godly responses for every emotion.

As the Bible says &quot;God uses all things for the good of those who love Him.
0393061310|5.0|This is one of those books that should be required reading for everybody, for the class of life.<br />My only complaint is that it is a very long and dense book; it requires more effort to read then many people are willing to give. Which is a shame, because this book is very, very good.
0345803485|5.0|I HAVE READ AND RE READ. LOVE THIS BOOK. IT MADE ME SMILE. THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS. I LIKE ALL BOOKS. KUDOS TO THE AUTHOR FOR ENTERTAINING ME. I LOVED ALL 3.

B008RV5K4U|5.0|Let me say this first.  I know there are those who get all up in arms over any and all deviations from source material (which in this case are slight), however lets just consider for one moment the possibility that a film animated or otherwise can stand alone as it's own work.<br /><br />That aside... This Film Is Fantastic.  It is Dark, Sharp, and Poignant.  It gives a well deserved homage to \\"Batman The Animated Series\\" while also taking strong stylistic cues from the great (and unfortunately largely forgotten) HBO Spawn t.v. series.  The whole thing is wonderfully rounded out by a stunning score, which gives the whole film an eerie  futuristic driving force, and hints back at the 80's distopian films like Blade Runner and John Carpenter's Escape From New York.  It almost feels like a subtle hint to the audience of the era the source material came from as well as the era it is about.  I was into it from the very beginning and stayed on the edge of my seat for the whole thing.<br /><br />Check it out... It's probably the best thing DC films has put out yet!!!
0525953728|5.0|Very straight forward and concise narration. Can't put the book down, I love it, It is even better than what I anticipated. No, I'm not a Navy Seal operator : )
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I have this book both for the Kindle (iPad App, my $79 Kindle, and the Audible version). First that technology is very cool and allows me to switch between listening and reading as the situation allows.<br /><br />On the content of the book, I had heard about this on various podcasts and found it fascinating. The book lived up and exceeded those previews and is very helpful in seeing how people do things and why they end up doing them. It is a great insight of knowledge that can help you be a better person by recognizing triggers in your own habits and in those you work with and family.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|I'd never heard of this movie until my girlfriend brought it over...it is great !!!<br />This actor as the young kid in the movie Primal Fear and the new Hulk movies...he's really good and in this movie he really shows his talent. In a time when most movies lack a good story...this movie is a good story, good special affects, a surprise ending and courage along the way...I love it and I've added it to my library of movies I could watch over and over again...
B008NW67E0|2.0|Amazon recommended this record because I owned Miles Davis' \\"Kind of Blue\\". It's not bad - reminds me a bit of \\"Swell Season\\" but I don't get the connection to Miles.
1575666286|5.0|This is sooooo sad to find out how our corporations and politicians they buy have absolutely no conscience and have been intentionally keeping this information from us as a nation of people suffering from corporate poisons simply because they don't see any money in health...the book says it well: \\"there's more people making money from cancer than are suffering from it\\"...I'm counting on God's justice for those individuals. As the rest of us, we need to read this book and learn about the healthy opportunities God has been providing us all along. What's also shameful is you have to leave the country to get this treatment.

055357342X|5.0|Following the great battle at King's Landing that concluded A Clash of Kings, A Storm of Swords picks up at a time when many are dead and allegiances are left shaken.  In the Seven Kingdoms, it is a time of regrouping and forming new plots to gain power and a crown.  In the North, the conflict between the Wildling army and the men of the Night's Watch continues, with Jon Snow questioning his own motives and plans.  Across the sea, Daenarys Targaryen is raising her dragons and plotting to find a way back to Westeros, where she too can fight for a crown.<br /><br />After being slightly disappointed with A Clash of Kings, I was glad to see that this one was as good as the first in the series.  There was action in each characters story, and I especially loved that some of the plot lines actually began to merge and come together.  Existing characters that have never had chapters before are also given them in this book, which was interesting, as the reader can then get to know these characters more deeply.  A highly recommended series.
B004J4WN0I|4.0|Drawn in by the promise of an exciting magic-filled adventure starring a modern-day druid, I eagerly snatched this story up when I came across it.  No disappointment here after reading it, either.  As always, I was taken with a new to me author creatively introducing me to his version of the modern world where everything of myth and legend really exists and lives side by side and amongst the humans.  It was a refreshing novel take on it because the hero wasn't a vampire, a werewolf or an angel, but a wise-cracking and witty druid who just wanted to be left alone to do his thing while instead he has a veritable queue of magical types lined up to make the last druid all dead.  And it was one exciting adventure after another to see how he craftily got his way through it.<br /><br />Atticus, though that's only the name he is stylizing himself as these days, is the owner of a specialty shop of all things natural and some things magical for the variety of residents of Tempe.  He has chosen to settle in Arizona for a very practical reason.  The more than two thousand year old druid is tired of living the vagabond life and just wants to be left in peace.  Arizona's locale is refreshingly devoid of ancient gods and the truly powerful nasties that walk the earth so Atticus shares his turf primarily with a vampire, a wolf pack, a witch coven and one minor mischievous local god, Coyote.  All this starts to change when he slips up and gets discovered.  Now an Irish fae god set on vengeance and acquisition has set his sights on Atticus forcing the druid to repel attack after attack while cunningly balancing traded favors with other fae gods and local magic users for help.  It was pretty exciting to see him in the role of the underdog hero.<br /><br />The plot was exciting, well paced and strong.  It was fun figuring out who was allied with whom and what they were all up to.  The story is told in first person point of view.  Slainte to Atticus who was a strong, engaging character with a fun, bantering 'voice' even when his back was up against the proverbial wall.  There is the refreshing addition of a great sidekick Irish wolf-hound named Oberon whom Atticus has taught to mindspeak and several other well-written minor characters that I really enjoyed meeting.  There is the mysterious Granuaile who is the bartender at Atticus' favorite Irish pub, Leif the Viking vampire who is his night-time lawyer and sparring partner, Hal the werewolf his daytime lawyer, his old Irish lady friend Mrs. MacDonagh who hates the British, and the bevy of freaky scary strong Irish fae goddesses who seem to either want to bed him or behead him.  Needless to say, I think the characters are the strength of this book to me.<br /><br />The main conflict of the story was resolved, but as is the beauty of Urban Fantasy there is the evidence of long range story arcs to enjoy as the series progresses with the blend of wit, danger and a little cunning.<br /><br />I caution those whose tastes lean toward the paranormal romance and heartily recommend this one to those who enjoy an Urban Fantasy that is strong on action and world building with a solid group of recurring characters led by a worthy character hero.<br /><br />Thank you to Net Galley for providing the book for review purposes.with a fun, bantering 'voice' even when his back was up against the proverbial wall.

0061122416|2.0|The author throws in a bunch of random info that isn't interesting, doesn't add to the story, and in some cases is just confusing. At the same time, I found the magic aspect to be unimaginative, and the internal conflict created between the characters is weak and strained, at best.

The images of the titanic are just so clear, crisp, and just put right into ship. I would recommend this movie to anyone that has either owned the VHS copy, saw it in the theater or just wants to see it for the first time. This copy comes with some amazing extras of the behind the scenes of the making and also of the actual titanic itself.

B007GCY8FS|4.0|Let's get something straight first: I am a great Jack Reacher fan, having devoured every Reacher novel and I agree with so many others that the selection of Tom Cruise to play Jack Reacher in the movie is quite frankly a commercial sell out and cynical mis-casting of monumental proportions. However, the terrible bad taste that it leaves in the mouth surely can't be allowed to bleed into reviews of A Wanted Man, as it appears to have done with a number of reviews I have read.<br /><br />Sure, A Wanted Man is different to many of the Reacher novels that have gone before. But it is still a great book! The action all comes at the end of the story, but I think the plot is interesting and well thought through, even if it perhaps slips away right at the end. The lack of action however I feel is replaced by a more thoughtful, even cerebral or reflective atmosphere, as Reacher sifts all of the incoming data and slowly works through the inconsistencies and red herrings to get to the truth.<br /><br />Another reviewer complained about the replays of the 911 call but I disagree - this again was evidence of the more meticulous, deductive approach that seems to be a constant thread running through the story. And some of this reflection seemed, for the first time in many Reacher novels, to be occasionally pointing a quizzical finger back at Reacher's own vagrant-esque lifestyle choices.<br /><br />And, without dropping a spoiler on any prospective reader, Lee Child still retains the ability to drop a massive unforeseen shock into the plot like an incoming RPG that knocks the reader backwards without warning.<br /><br />In summary? Can Tom Cruise wear Jack Reacher's shoes? No! Did Lee Child sell Reacher down the river with that decision? Yes! Is A Wanted Man different to previous Reacher novels? In some ways, yes. Would I recommend A Wanted Man? Definitely yes!!

B008Q0AZVK|3.0|I was pretty disappointed.  The actresses are wonderful, the story has real potential - everything else does not work right.  It does not feel like a period piece, which requires some getting used to.
B000002B7S|5.0|While not as good as Diary in my mind its better than Blizzard because its a more rounded album with the best songs being the title track , Im so Tired , Rock and Roll Rebel and Journey to the center of Eternity ! Blizzard has its moments but Bark is his second best solo album ! A earlier reviewer said Bark was a failer but it went platinum which in todays terms is Gold ! Great cd to own if ur a Ozzy fan!
B009A3NGF4|5.0|It's a great album, with a number of truly memorable songs. Some of the criticisms for it are centered around the notion that \\"it sounds just like Sigh No More\\" - a claim that needs a caveat to acknowledge the deconstruction of the instrumentation and lyrics on Babel.<br /><br />Nearly every track on Babel would fit in on their first album, but would be overshadowed by The Cave or Little Lion Man. The band returns with their frenetic, blaring instrumentation, though with a simpler sound. These songs lack the lyrical complexity - and literary allusions - of SNM.<br /><br />Babel, overall, is an efficient second album. It soars higher, it punches harder, and it is more focused on its expression and in its execution.<br /><br />I recommend grabbing the Deluxe Edition, though almost entirely for the cover of Paul Simon's The Boxer - fantastic rendition. I fully intend to pick up the vinyl as well, especially since it comes with a digital recording of the test pressing. M&S feels like music that should be accompanied by the hiss and pop of analog media.
B007RI56NY|5.0|Train hit California 37 out of the park! I can't get enough of it. I love listening and tapping my toes right along. This goes right up there with their previous albums that I can listen to over and over again. Love how the words are really true to the Train from the heart songwriting.

B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I think that everyone should read this book. It is one of the best book I have ever read in my whole life and I have read a lot of books in the past. Also, the books in the series are even better then this one!!!! I am in love with this book. If you don't read it you are gonna regret it.
B0091REZMW|5.0|love its very easy to play and a lot of fun with no loading. issues or constant ads bothering you

630587493X|5.0|I saw this movie so many years ago. My husband hasn't seen the movie so we decided to buy a copy of it. We drove around town to different video stores but couldn't find it. I went online and purchased it on Amazon.com; dvd plus shipping only cost me over $8. My husband played the movie one night, and to my surprise he liked it very much! He didn't expect that this movie would entertain him. I couldn't believe when he said that this is so far the most entertaining movie we've watched together- next to Planet of the Apes! I recommend this movie. It is very wholesome and it touches your heart...it was worth more than $8!
B00846REIS|2.0|This was way too similar too the \\"Fifty Shades\\" book, except it was like its generic, uncreative sister.<br /><br />Really predictable, story line was even sillier than \\"Fifty\\", if there are really THAT many young women so naive and desperate for love/sex that they'd jump in bed with these ridiculously controlling sociopathic men- and we're willing to buy into this \\"fantasy\\", I'd say something's wrong in women's lives that they find these story lines \\"romantic\\".

B0089BSM70|1.0|So I was really happy to see this set come out with both the film and TV version all in one set. I already own the Universal Halloween 2 release on blu-ray that came out a few months back.<br /><br />I was SHOCKED when I opened this blu-ray and found 2 discs. The Movie version is on blu-ray. HOWEVER.... The TV version is on DVD. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? So I am really only buying this version to get the TV version on blu-ray and I get a DVD.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS if you are expected to get both versions on Blu-ray.<br /><br />For the price tag I have to say I have been totally ripped off and scammed by Shout Factory. NO WHERE does it say on the box is the TV version on DVD at all. If you buy a Blu-ray you expect to get the film on BLU-RAY!
B0001O3YD0|5.0|The DVD arrived in a timely manner and was exactly as described.  There were no flaws in it, it functions perfectly, and its a pretty good movie too.  I'd certainly recommend it to sci-fi fans.

B007N85ZXY|5.0|What can I say about Neil. He is the best. This CD proves that he is an Alchemist in his own way. Instead of changing a rock into gold, he can change a song like Ole Susanna to rock out, Neil Young style. It is worth having in your music collection as you will shake your head saying \\"Why couldn't I do that?\\"<br />This is Neil doing what \\"The Vanilla Fudge\\" did to other songs back in the 60's. But Neil went back to days before electricity and the Civil War and before.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B007N85ZXY Americana]]

B007MJ9LA2|4.0|Carlos is back again. As always Carlos keeps his backbone while reinventing himself. This CD is a nice change from listening to rock. Has a nice Latin flavor, with a pinch of rock and soul. With Santana on guitar you can't go wrong. This has to be one of the stronger Albums in his vast assortment of albums. I recently saw him play and he did quite a few songs from this Cd, it impressed me so much that I had to buy it. It is worth it. All I can say again is Viva Santana!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B007MJ9LA2 Shape Shifter]]
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Loki has made an arrangement with the alien race named the Chitauri.  He is to go to Earth and find the Tesseract and open a portal into space so that the Chitauri can send an army to conquer the world.  They promise that Loki can be the ruler of the Earth.  Loki wants to rule the Earth but he also wants vengeance on his adopted brother Thor.<br /><br />The Tesseract is an ancient artifact of unlimited power that by legend comes from Asgard and was owned by Odin. Some on earth are trying to harness its power to generate unlimited energy to light the world while others want to use it to create weapons of mass destruction.  The Tesseract begins emitting energy pulses of its own accord and it opens a portal through which Loki arrives on Earth.<br /><br />Loki uses a saber energy weapon to convert some of the people into his followers and to kill others. Loki and his followers steal the Tesseract cube and shoot Director Fury. Loki has taken a key agent, Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner, Hawkeye) and the main scientist for the project. The cavern the laboratory is built in collapses and a crater a mile across is created as the Tesseract runs out of control from the overload of energy.  Director Nick Fury ( Samuel L. Jackson) barely escapes with his life while Loki and his team escape with the Tesseract cube.<br /><br />Director Fury brings together a team of super humans, a god and a pair of assassins to form a team called The Avengers.  The team members are Thor, Iron Man, Black Widow, The Hulk, Captain America, and eventually Hawkeye and the task is simple.  Defeat Loki and conquer the invading aliens or face the destruction of the Earth.....<br /><br />This is a fast action film filled with marvelous special effects and a good storyline.  I loved the interaction between the Avenger members, the action and at times the comedy was wonderful.  This is a top notch film and I really enjoyed it from start to finish.  This film was entertaining and my family enjoyed it a lot.  I recommend it to you.recommend it to you.
B008PE9GSA|5.0|That \\"Lil Ole Band From Texas\\" is at it again. This is their first new CD (Album) out in 9 years and one of their best. I can't believe that it is over 40 years since I first saw them and they only keep on getting better. I don't want to spoil the CD for you but I can't take it off. It is raw ZZ!  If you like ZZ Top, if you love rock, then this Album is worth putting between your ears and turning the volume up to 11. Or should I say \\"Best when played loud\\"!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B008PE9GSA La Futura]]

B008QE9VJI|4.0|Warner Bros. Home Entertainment is doing the smart thing and releasing Tim Burton's \\"Dark Shadows\\" just in time to soak up some Halloween spirit. The film performed poorly in studios but will no doubt do good business on Blu-ray and DVD since the holiday season puts people in the mood to see something spooky and kooky to celebrate. \\"Dark Shadows\\" is perfect for viewers who want to get the chills and some thrills but not overdose on them. A good helping of humor helps to balance things out.<br /><br />The vampire Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) returns to his home town of Collinsport after being locked up in a coffin for two centuries. He discovers the witch Angelique (Eva Green) who cursed him is alive and well. The small fishing town his father founded is now under her control. Barnabas must find a way to restore his family name to its rightful glory. He also longs to be free of his curse and the hunger for blood it causes him to have. At the same time, a new visitor (Bella Heathcote) to Collinswood resembles his lost love from centuries before. Could she be the reincarnated woman he's longed for so long?<br /><br />\\"Dark Shadows\\" has the same perfect blend of sophisticated and unrefined humor we've come to expect from director Tim Burton. You could say it's a blend of \\"Beetlejuice\\" comicality and the gothic seriousness of \\"Sleepy Hollow.\\" Most of the comedy comes thanks to Depp's portrayal of the \\"out-of-time\\" Barnabas being exposed to 1972 culture and technology. That's not to say the horror and supernatural elements are put on the back burner. They're very much present and play a big part in the movie.<br /><br />The high-definition transfer of \\"Dark Shadows\\" is stunning. All the darks colors stand out in contrast and Burton's beautifully gloomy color schemes shine through nicely. Helena Bonham Carter's red hair dances across the screen clashing with the grey scenery around her. It also brings out all the nooks and crannies of the old Collinswood mansion.<br /><br />The 5.1 surround sound mix spreads out all the creepy sounds, creaks, crashing waves, and Danny Elfman's masterful score throughout the speakers. It will heighten the viewing experience in a home theater.<br /><br />Special features included in the Blu-ray edition consist of Maximum Movie Mode, Focus Points, and deleted scenes. Maximum Movie Mode gives us picture-in-picture commentary from Tim Burton, cast, and crew about different facets of the movie. 37-minutes of Focus Points are broke up into different featurettes entitled \\"Becoming Barnabas,\\" \\"Welcome to Collinsport,\\" \\"The Collinses: Every Family Has Its Demons,\\" \\"Reliving a Decade,\\" \\"Angelique: A Witch Scorned,\\" \\"Alice Cooper Rocks Collinsport,\\" \\"Dark Shadowy Secrets,\\" \\"A Melee of Monstrous Proportions\\" and \\"'Dark Shadows:' The Legend Bites Back.\\" Five deleted scenes round out the bonus material.<br /><br />I think if people give \\"Dark Shadows\\" a chance on Blu-ray or DVD, they'll discover an entertaining Tim Burton film that celebrates the television show many of us grew up watching. It's one of the best examples of a movie where the directors and stars successfully poke fun at the unintended campiness of its source material while being reverent to it at the same time. If you're a fan of Burton, his ensemble casts, and / or Johnny Depp, \\"Dark Shadows\\" is a must-see.r />The 5.1 surround sound mix spreads out all the creepy sounds, creaks, crashing waves, and Danny Elfman's masterful score throughout the speakers.

B008X77K8W|5.0|I own most of Knight's discography so I knew what to expect, and was not disappointed.  Songs about the common man fighting common issues, with survival considered a victory.  From rocking songs like Low Down Rambling Blues to slower songs such as an updated version of Hard Edges, Knights music is catchy enough for anyone to enjoy, but it is his lyrics that force you to fall in love with his songs.<br />My favorite is Out Of This Hole for personal reasons.  One of my all time favorite sayings comes from my dad when I complained about being in debt; he just looked at me and said \\"when you find yourself in a hole quit digging\\".  Knight hit on this theme and I have to smile when I hear the irony he is reaching for.

I've lost about 20lbs so far and trying to get back to my body fat goals. If you can motivate yourself and use this book as a guideline you will see results, fast.

Was reading it in the kitchen, while cooking meals; in the laundry room folding towels...truly spell binding and I could feel every emotion the characters were going through because Mr. Dashner was so through in his ability to describe EVERYTHING!

B0091XRL86|1.0|Rented this for my son because he's into pirates. It was just silly and stupid. It didn't hold his interest or mine. I love all his favorite animated movies, but Pirates had none of the heart, poignancy or even good story like Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo,etc. Plot was silly and characters were flat.

B0083GQ2A0|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. I like Liam Neeson and watched the movie thinking it MUST be good because he is a wonderful actor. Just wasted 2 hours of my life. What was advertised as \\"suspenseful\\" was actually boring - with a triple O. A lot of problems with this movie. Characters were not flashed out or in any way sympathetic, so it was hard to feel for them, their predicament and/or death. The \\"wolves\\" looked really phony in the few real views the movie allowed, mostly just growling noises and a lot of yelling and shaky camera movements - ending up with a mauled person. Horrible language - every 2nd word is a 4 letter word of every variety possible. The end was one of these \\"no ends\\", however, it is not a long shot to imagine that the wolves won.<br />PLEASE don't waste your time, this is pure trash. Won't even go into the inaccuracies or improbabilities - the other viewer already covered them in detail.<br />Liam - PLEASE think twice before accepting such a ridiculous script!!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very insightful. You can tell the pride the author takes in being a seal throughout the book. Although the entire world might have thought it was a huge deal killing OBL, for these guys its just another day in the office.

1409136612|5.0|Maeve Binchey's \\"Full House\\" is about a family with all their adult children still living at home.  It really struck a chord with me.  I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to any Maeve Binchey fan, and if you aren't familiar with her books start with this one.
B004UID2LC|3.0|the app was working just fine on my kindle fire and then just a few days ago it quit downloading videos all it says is searching then quits :(
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This was the highlight of my summer.  Great movie and the cast seemed to play off each other really well.  One of the things Joss has always been best at is directing ensembles and here is one the best examples of that.  The only characters who end up slightly off balance are Clint Barton and Tony Stark.  Tony is a screen hog, but as the biggest piece of the Marvel movie franchise that is to be expected.  Clint spends the first half of the movie as a zombified slave to Loki, so he does not get as much time with the good guys.  I could have wished for Black Widow (Natasha Romanov) to have some more screen time but she was key in several scenes (especially with Bruce Banner and Hulk).  The best performance of the movie changes but I will say that Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner was a wonder.  He is the best Banner since the TV show in the seventies, hands down.  Not much else to say, except that as an old fan of Coulson from the Iron Man movies, I really hope he isn't dead.  The comics have proven that Nick Fury has no issue lying to further his own agenda, and I hope this is the case here.  Coulson gives a face and wit to the nameless agents of SHIELD, and that will be hard to replace in the movies going forward.
B005LAII8K|5.0|Despite containing more paradoxes than the moles in a Whack-a-Mole game \\"Looper\\" may well be the best time travel movie in years and it connected with me because it seemed to be a choice by the Director to not spend too much time wrapped up in the question of whether his time travel methodology was scientifically accurate and instead spend his time in the conflicts, motivations and stress factors that would affect this group of men causing them to use time travel not for the betterment of mankind, but instead in this heinous fashion.<br /><br />From the previews you get all the facts you need, the mob has time travel and they use to disappear people into the past because it's too difficult to hide a body in their future. If you are one of these past time hit-men you are a Looper and your contract ends when you \\"close\\" your loop (Kill your future self). What makes \\"Looper\\" so interesting is that the main story line takes place between 10 and 30 years in the future, making it both a SciFi movie and a time travel movie.<br /><br />I highly recommend you see this movie, Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance is brilliance, in point of fact I think he may do Bruce Willis better even than Bruce Willis does and the action scenes, although sometimes \\"action movie\\" ridiculous (including one scene where Bruce Willis holds a body much larger than himself in front of himself as a human shield as he runs down a hall shooting), help keep this movie fast and well paced despite it being about why the characters are doing what they are doing.<br /><br />For the ladies, there is also a nice sized subplot between Emily Blunt and Joseph Gordon-Levitt that is evokes such movies as \\"Witness\\" and \\"The Bodyguard\\", so guys don't forget your girls.
B008X77K8W|5.0|Chris Knight is an American treasure, much like Bruce Springsteen and Steve Earle back when they were relevant. The album is full of honest, gritty music. It has a live feel to it. There's no place for Auto-Tune here. In the meantime and Nothing on me are the standout tracks. Jack Loved Jesse is also a favorite. Sounds like Buddy Miller on guitar on that track. Little Victories is a good song and I hate to say it but John Prine's voice is a bit distracting. It's not as shot as Bob Dylan's but there's not much tune there.
B0034G4OYA|3.0|This animated tale offers fun, but there's no big surprises going on, just a different take on an Adam Sandler flick. All the monsters including:Dracula; The Invisible Man; Frankenstein and his bride venture off on a mission to a hotel for the sole purpose of escaping a world filled with humans. However, a young man stumbles onto the resort with romantic sparks for Mavis, and trouble begins to brew. The story is about trusting a child to make their own discoveries. The themes are nightmare vacations, vampires, and werewolves. It's more entertaining than it is funny, and the characters do grab your attention!
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|I am sure it is a great series, but frankly for a first in the series, I found it a bit hard to swallow.  I get the whole, \\"torn, lonesome hero,\\" it is the stuff of hero's going back to tales around the campfire.  The basic premise of location and subsequent events are a bit challenging to one's suspension of disbelief abilities.  Read it if you want to have an easy fast read, dare to hope that you come to know and love the character in subsequent books, but the Borne series was better, as was almost every other Bond and/or Sherlock Holmes.  Frankly, I was so unimpressed, I will have to read another just to learn if I was right.

They fight to climb to the golden ladder of success in a cutthroat world. A world in which there's a combination of being cool, and insanity. The music is Good, Acting Performance Excellent, and there are moments of laugh-out-loud fun. Rated PG13, not for very young children. Highly Entertaining from start to finish, and Enjoyable!
B008E6I1K8|5.0|Sure i haven't read it all yet just picked some of the 5.0 goodies (like asynchrony). Those parts are described thoroughly in very engaging way.

B008RV5K5E|3.0|OK so I am stupid. Make that too busy, and not enough time to run to the movies. I depended on the advertisemnet of this that it was The Dark Knight Rises. Its not.

I'll definetely read more carefully in the future.
B000024IJV|2.0|5 stars for my original vinyl album, which i still play, i am not happy with my newly received cd! as to the album itself & the selections, i love it.  however, i dislike the cd quality because it has been produced w/way too much treble.  i prefer my very old record & the warmth of sound far more than my brand new cd.  to be fair, i normally prefer vinyl to cd sound but my cd leaves a lot to be desired.  let's face it, most cd's you buy which weren't even available when an original album was made, are too often little more than bootleg quality buyers are stuck with.  in other words-be careful purchasing cd's in general, especially when the cd you purchase is recorded years after a performance only on vinyl was first available.  i do own a couple of other dr. john cd's & records, i am a fan & not complaining about their sound quality.

B004F27I3Q|5.0|I just discovered these guys about a week ago,and I've been HOOKED ever since.Like everyone else is saying,YES-it is like Sabbath,which is a GREAT thing! From beginning to end,this album is solid.They've managed to capture that perfect vintage/Sabbath sound,and the vocalist sounds like a cross between Ozzy-Dio-Ian Gillian.There will be times where you say to yourself while listening, \\"IS this a Sabbath re-make?..the lyrics even sound kind of like..\\" Just check out the names of the songs and you'll see what I mean.Its not very often when listening to an album, that I actually get excited to see what the next song is like.Now I'm just waiting to see these guys live some day! My current favorite album by far (besides the new Witchcraft) But,GET THIS ALBUM IF YOU LOVE SABBATH,YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!! \m/

B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I like the way the book starts. The story is interesting and fun. Loses me a bit at the end however as it gets a bit tedious. Photos in the book showed up well in HD. A pleasant book to spend an afternoon or two with.
B0098QBEXO|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect. I decided to watch it because of my love for Benedict Cumberbatch. But the film, all of the actors, the cinematography, the incredible script, took me completely by surprise. It was so lovely and so sad. I definitely recommend it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great series, great book!  Different subject matter than I'm used to but was definitely a page turner!  Last book ties everything together nicely.
B003L77G6A|5.0|If you are a nerd and a science type. You have to identify with these 4 guys who are the definition of Nerds. We laugh at every episode.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|This is the steak. amc has come out with some great shows, and now when I watch other shows I see how bad they are.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|I could only hope that Mumford & Sons wouldn't hit a sophomore slump with Babel and they definitely did not!  Ranging from upbeat tracks like 'Babel' and 'I Will Wait' to slower, emotional songs like 'Below My Feet' and 'For Those Below' (with Winston as lead vocals), they show their amazing craftsmanship yet again.  I'm glad I bought the deluxe edition as well because their rendition of 'The Boxer' is a classic all on its own.  A must-buy!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I simply could not put this book down.  Gillian Flynn is an excellent writer who uses plot twists and interesting deep characters to keep the reader guessing until the very end.  Camille was one of the most interesting characters I've read about in a long time.  Strangely disturbed and not fully recovered from her childhood, her pain touched me and reminded me of someone in my life.
B004Y1WCDE|4.0|Runs pretty well on HTC Vivid, it has locked up a couple of times requiring restarting the phone.  Hope this is fixed soon.
B0088TG252|4.0|Cold cruel action done right. Well scripted, good acting and realistic stunts. Gets down and plays just a little on the dirty side of spy craft.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Never having read the HP series, I was pleased when JK Rowling wrote this, a non-fantasy book.  I went to order it this morning and saw that the cost of the *Kindle Edition\\" is a whopping $17.99!!!!  I don't care WHO set the price -- that's outrageous for an ebook!  I've taken Rowling's book off my reading list and will be telling my book clubs why!
B008SVFX96|5.0|This CD is full of passionate songs showcasing his soulful lyrics and singing.  The best of his 3 solo albums - although all 3 are 5 star cd's.
B008H6GH8I|5.0|This latest animated Resident Evil film is a solid improvement over the previous outing, Resident Evil: Degeneration.  Degeneration was mildly entertaining and remains welcome for having a focus on two fan favorites: Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield.  But it was also stiffly animated and dryly directed, with action that looked exciting in stills but less so in motion.  Fortunately, aside from following its predecessor in again choosing to focus on Leon Kennedy and secondarily another character from Resident Evil 2 (Ada Wong), Resident Evil: Damnation advances in quality of animation, pacing, and action.<br /><br />In simplest terms, Damnation feels more lively than Degeneration.  Leon has more of his personality from RE4 in this one, and facial detail and expressions on all characters are impressive.  Ada is a bit more of a mixed bag in terms of chosen look, but solidly voiced and very entertaining whenever she is on screen.  And while her model here looks quite different from earlier (or current RE6) incarnations, this can also be considered an immaterial complaint to those coming into the movie without experience with the games. But she certainly acts as Ada would, and the movie makes nods to the shared history between her and Leon in the games.  Other characters specific to the movie environment in this fictional small European country (faced with revolution and attempts by multiple individuals to use and control the bioweapon monsters common to the series) are also well voiced and animated.<br /><br />Last but certainly not least is the action, limited in the beginning, moderated partway through, and then explosively violent and non-stop in the last third of the movie. Although it threatens to become repetitive near the end, the action ultimately holds up and with several memorable events.  Indeed, one may not look at the infamous \\"Licker\\" monsters (also from the games) the same way again.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Gave quit a bit of insight into myself and others. i would recommend it to anyone that wants ideas to spice things up.
0439023513|5.0|Great book. It kept me interested all the way through. I wish this was not the last book in the series.
098555780X|3.0|I have been following JD (TIAT) on Youtube for awhile now and he is the King of Paracord, so when this book came out, I jumped all over it.  Here's my review of the book:<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Softback and large lettering<br />- Very nice color photos showing the steps<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- All the weaves can be found on Youtube for free<br />- Sorry, but the instructions pale in comparison to watching the video<br />- Steps were a bit confusing<br />- Quite a few typos, was the book even edited or proofread before hitting the shelves?<br /><br />Personally, the book was just OK.  I gained nothing new from the book and still prefer to watch the videos.  If JD is looking to commercialize this, then he should have a paid website where his videos are exclusive and showing step-by-step instructions.  I will still always watch his videos and still think he is the King of Knots and Paracord, but I seriously doubt I will buy the second volume of this book when it's published.
B005LAII1C|1.0|i saw this movie in a beautiful, peaceful country.  i was the only american present.  the kind, graceful, beautiful people of the host country found this movie ugly, vulgar, violent, and crude.  most walked away from the screen, unable to understand what kind of creature could find this entertaining.  i was ashamed to be an american.
030758836X|4.0|An avid fan of mystery novels, I was first hesitant to read this due to some reviewers disliking the ending, however, this novel has really caught my attention. From beginning to end I was constantly on the edge of my seat craving to read more and uncover the truth. A marriage starting out perfect, yet ending unbelievably sour. On Nick and Amy's fifth wedding anniversary, Amy disappears from the house, a crime scene unraveling in their living room. The story continues after her disappearance.<br />Flynn does an excellent job of alternating first person perspectives between Amy and Nick giving the reader an advantage to learn what happens in their marriage behind closed doors. Flynn also reveals the characters insecurities, weaknesses, and flaws. A refreshing reminder that no one is perfect. Flynn took a daring move with this thriller, all the twists and turns in the novel always kept me intrigued. The unpredictable plot and jaw dropping moments are the reasons I would recommend this book to others. Also, Flynn really draws in the reader by using the blame game, trying to get the reader to decide which characters they should root for. Finally, I would recommend reading this book if you are drawn in by deep character relationships and the dramatic twists a mystery can carry.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I anticipate the arrival of all Lee Child's books.  They are always a good,  suspenseful read.  A Wanted Man was no different.  I could  hardly put it down, and am already looking forward to the next.  Full of suspense, mystery,  and Jack Reacher is a mysterious loner who finds himself in  not ordinary situations.
0887081770|1.0|Hi: the book is upper great....but....I never image that will be small size....I thought will be regular size....I am working with special kids and I am using it ...only doing one by one ...because the size donn't gave me another option...thank you anyway to asked me for the review...:)
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|AN AMAZING, TOUCHING , AND BEAUTIFUL STORY of a boy with a deformed face. it moade me cry, laugh, and both at the same time
B0094K1PW4|5.0|Wife and I loved this movie, had us entertained from beginning to end! Highly recommend, fun for the whole family with some cuss words but not to bad!
B001CDWFPC|1.0|I have Kindle application on my iPad. Unable to go directly to a verse. I returned it because without this basic capability it is worthless. Apparently if you have certain Kindle devices you can go directly, but if you have a Kindle Fire (or as in my case, a Kindle on another device) you cannot.
B006CQ89UE|5.0|I am a staunch follower of Woody Allen and, I believe, I've watched every single piece of work he has done so far, either as a director, as an actor, or both. He is a jazz musician too, and I've seen him performing live playing the clarinet with his New Orleans Funeral and Ragtime Orchestra several times. I find this an excellent documentary by Robert B. Weide, a massive piece of work over 3 hours as part of a series of American Masters for PBS, which covers all of his career, since his not very well known beginning as a joke writer for different publications, up to his movies from 2011. Besides some footage from many of his films, there are interviews with many of his actors and actresses, specially with Diane Keaton; with relatives, including his parents and sister, and with Woody Allen himself. His work as a jazz musician and musical avocation, however, it's widely and exclusively covered by the documentary Wild Man Blues, a 1997  film directed by Barbara Kopple. Anyway, Robert B. Weide has done an excellent work too.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|really perfect and I liked it a lot.  want more like it<br />. really good graphics. and a suspenseful story.  five stars
B008ALA6DW|5.0|This is a perfect ethernet adapter for my macbook air or any thunderbolt mac. Great for those ancient hotels without wifi or if you just want more speed than wifi. It looks great weighs nothing and is made by none other than apple. Just be careful to order it ship and sold by amazon for another 12 cents that way it wont be a fake. The only problem would have to be the time between connecting it and you computer realizing its there which is about 5 seconds and if you are already on wifi than its about 10 seconds. This also works great if you want ethernet and wifi together for lighting fast speed.
B005LAIHE0|5.0|I almost didn't watch this because I had read a lot of bad reviews, but I really enjoyed it.  I think it's because I often enjoy the journey more than the destination, and this movie took me on a journey. I found the characters realistic and interesting. I was thoroughly entertained by the way Jason Segel's character changed. This is not a typical romance movie with sweet, likable characters. It's a comedy with enjoyable scenes and witty dialogue. I loved it.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book was OK... I finished it but it just wasn't that interesting past the first 100 or so pages. It's great if you really like Twilight and incredibly fantastic sex scenes. Maybe I'm just jealous I don't orgasm 2-3 times each time I have sex??
0061537969|5.0|This is one of very few books I've bothered to read twice and I might just read it again one of these days. The core of the story is about Enzo, an aging dog, and his take on the world which is fantastic. Just when you think he's human, he has a very dog-like insight on something.<br /><br />The Enzo perspective is both fascinating and fantastic, but I loved this book just as much for its perspective on racing. I am a road racer myself and the insights here are absolutely on the mark. In particular, and not surprisingly given the title, the descriptions of both the challenge and process of actually racing in the rain (which is a lot of fun) are wonderful.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B008JAG2AA|2.0|It's American pie again.  Funny, but also corny. I'm glad I watched it, but I didn't have much else to do at the time.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I wanted so much to like it, but page after page brought out new characters whom I would not like in real life, treating everyone around them badly, spewing venom,...every page full of bad feeling....who reads books populated with unlikeable people being despicacble? Worse,,  reviewers saying 'we all know people just like them?' I don't know people like them, thank God! And for all the times I have used language that would make my mother blanch (followed here by a comment which Amazom would not approve for publication,  though the book is riddled with far worse than what I said) after the first three chapters of this book, I had had enough of being splattered with a verbal buffet of offensiveness. If this were a hardcover edition, it would be thrown out the window with great force: being an eBook, however, I intend to smoosh my finger on that 'delete this piece of refuse' X with great satisfaction and move on to something with redeeming value.<br />For the record, if J.K. Rowling were to read this review, it is not possible that she could feel worse than I did in feeling the need to write it.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|With its numerous deserved Emmy awards to the show, cast, and directors, Homeland deserves its accolades.  I cannot emphasize enough how great this show is, particularly the very first episode which grabs your attention and does not let it go.  After that, you will be hooked on Homeland.
0307592731|1.0|Boring didn't keep my attention.  Spent more time compaining of her parents rather then the actual trip.  Would of been more interesting if she experienced some really neat things while she was out there.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Clever language prevails.  Imaginative similes and metaphors, but this novel is hampered by unrealistic characters who change personna at the drop of the need for a plot twist.  In the final analysis, a deserved punishment for the two unlikeable protagonists would be to have to read this book again and again and again.  Very slowly.
B004UID2LC|5.0|just go to tootle then type in the app name and then click on the first link and then it says download over a encoder bar just click and then it will download
B00866JL96|5.0|The LUCKY ONE starred Zac Efron as Logan and Taylor Schilling as Beth-Its a wonderful love story with many twists and turns-Zac and Taylor played their roles beautifully-I enjoyed watching it and it even made my husband cry when Beth(Taylor)was greiving over the loss of her brother Drake in Iraq.[[ASIN:B00866JL96 The Lucky One (DVD+UltraViolet Digital Copy)]]
0307592731|1.0|I wanted to like this book, I really did. But it's pretty much one giant whine. Poor me, poor me, my feet hurt, my hips are chapped, where did I put the condoms, I lost my mother so I cheated on my husband.<br /><br />Ugh. If you are looking for a book about hiking in the wilderness, this one isn't for you. She was terribly unprepared for this trip. And if her pack was so freaking heavy, why didn't she lighten her load?<br /><br />Self-indulgent crap. The way she honored her mother was by destroying her marriage and hooking up with less than desirable men and shooting heroin.<br /><br />I got through nearly the first two-thirds of the book, then stopped. Shooting her beloved horse, with its horrifying and sickening description, defied belief. She had indirectly neglected the animal before she made her laughably compassionate decision to have her killed by someone who knew her, rather than humanely put down.<br /><br />I couldn't read much more after that. Many of us had tough childhoods, lost parents, failed at marriage. But many of her problems were of her own making. She's just plain annoying. Even changing her last name to \\"Strayed\\" is annoying. We get it, Cheryl, we get it.<br /><br />Just because Oprah recommends a book doesn't mean it's worth reading. This is going to Goodwill.<br /><br />If you want to read some books about wilderness quests, read Earl Shaffer's \\"Walking into Spring,\\" or Bill Bryson's \\"A Walk in the Woods.\\"
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved the book way better then 50th shades because they both have issues which makes the book more realistic and the sex parts are hot
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love the new update to the app. It's now so easy to navigate through the site and save your favorite pins. Awesome!
0525953728|1.0|The author is not a fabulous writer but was evenhanded in the book. Except for when he isn't. I would have recommended it unreservedly, except for his weird interjections about Obama (he doesn't like him) that made him seem petulant and small minded.  The Obama jabs added nothing to his gripping story and diminished his credibility as an objective storyteller. He should have left politics out of this one.
0529064847|5.0|Perfect for what I needed.  My spiritual adviser gave it two thumbs up as well.  It is arranged a bit differently than my husband's bible, but both are the Catholic versions and the differences are minimal at best.  Nice book to take with you on trips and great for study sessions and bible courses.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I am currently reading the second book in the series, and am engrossed in the character's lives. I took a Break after the second book, as there is a lot of tragedy, and I like to keep a Balance in my life.<br />  It definitely has a hold on me, as I've returned to the second series, and am sure that I'll return for the rest
B008XG1X18|3.0|I find this app often loads very slowly over our wifi connection and sometimes issues a force close error on my Kindle Fire. But when I have the patience to wait it can be quite fun.

1402760663|5.0|Here is one of the greatest multi Indian tribe books with superb illustrations. I was so glad I bought the illustrated edition.<br /><br />The late great author Dee Brown( 25 great books) wrote an epic classic in Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee.  It made the top lists when it was published and became an epic classic. Dee Brown only had a Librarian degree and not a PHD, so many of the academia tops scoffed at him saying how could he know so much about Indians without a PHD.<br /><br />We see the various tribes throughout North America, starting when Christopher Columbus landed on the West Indies islands and the Indians he encountered. The various tribes throughout the centuries and decades toward the 1900s are shown. The 544 page book read very well with no boring parts. Dee Brown took the \\"more Indian\\" point of view, seeing the approaching white man storming into their lands from the east rather than the \\"white man's\\" view of \\"Manifest Destiny\\" pointing towards the west.<br /><br />We see the many times various times the Indians initially helped the first white men into their lands  with food and assistance. Unfortunately it became an increasing flood of people wanting more of their land, gold under their land, senseless killing of their buffalo and need of their land for railroad usage. Some of the Indians believed the land belonged to no one and all should use it smartly, without destroying it and its creatures and plants. The book shows the whites had other ideas as to what they decided was important.<br /><br />Time after time treaties with the US Government are arranged with the Indians and become useless as settlers, miners and railroad officials bypassed the treaties. Political pull was used in Washington to  break treaties and bury the Indians. We see the greedy Indian agents and corrupt Federal Indian department giving the Indians poor meat, shoddy blankets, and poor working guns...if at all. Many times the Indians got nothing. They were herded like cattle onto smaller and small reservations in states they were not acclimated to and died by the thousands of starvation and various diseases.<br /><br />To me it was no wonder why many revolted and attacked the whites. Many of the Indians thought they were going to be exterminated.<br />We see the many massacres and inhumane atrocities the whites did against the Indians and the massacres and atrocities the red man gave the whites. What was really sad was thousands of both whites and Indians were innocent victims who never had bothered each other but were killed because of their race.<br /><br />I won't ruin the suburb ending of the book about the slaughter/ massacre of the Indians at Wounded Knee and the end of the Indian dream.<br /><br />This epic classic belongs in anyone's library interested in the Indian/white man interaction in the 1700-1800s and those wanting  some of the Indians view of what happened and why they were at times forced to act like they did. 5 stars plus. I can't wait to read Dee Brown's book on the Civil War.to smaller and small reservations in states they were not acclimated to and died by the thousands of starvation and various diseases.<br /><br />To me it was no wonder why many revolted and attacked the whites.

B006ZCWU5K|5.0|Haven't really listened to Bruce since \\"Born in the USA\\".  Picked this up in a yard sale for $1.  The woman said she usually loved Bruce but didn't like this album at all.  I said for a dollar I would give it a try.  Seriously, I don't know what's not to like cause in my opinion this is a fantastic cd.<br />He is just so \\"Bruce Springsteen\\" on here and like fine wine he has clearly gotten better with age.  I couldn't recommend this more highly.
B008XCJ03K|5.0|I saw him live with Ed Sheeran a few nights ago in Chicago.  I bought this album as soon as I got home.  He's brilliant!  I absolutely love this album.
B000TU16GS|5.0|This is a great book about a young boy who must become a spy and follow in the foot steps he never knew his late uncle had in order to save the world. I bought this book for my kindle fire and it worked perfectly. I will continue to enjoy this book for a long time. No complaints!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wow...this was an awesome book.  Everynight last week I would start reading at 9:30pm and before I knew it - it was midnight.  Did not want to put it down!!!  I would highly recommend that you have Book Two available when you finish Book One!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|ok you shouldn't need review cause its simple you like I will love love love love love love love love love and to be specific LLLLLLOOOOOOVVVVVVEEEEEE IT! : )

0316228532|1.0|Would you ask your grandmother to explain teenage sexuality? Would you read 500 pages of your grandmother explaining teenage sexuality? Well, it might read better than Rowling trying to do so...<br /><br />Just finished TCV and needed to voice my disappointment.
0316228532|4.0|Note: This review contains no spoilers about the plot.<br /><br />For me, the most surprising thing about The Casual Vacancy is how ordinary it is. It's not a great book, by any means, but it's not bad either. It's a well-written, slightly cliched book that entertained me while I was reading it, but which will probably not linger long in my memory; it's the kind of book you buy, enjoy, and then leave gathering dust on the shelf.<br /><br />It's a very traditional novel in every sense. The plotting is decent, although J.K. Rowling has a tendency to use un-subtle signposts that let the reader know something important is about to happen. The characters are quirky, if unrealistic. The author's moral view of the world is a little simplistic, which suits the uncomplicated tone of the whole book. This isn't a book that'll challenge your beliefs.<br /><br />There were moments where I felt that Rowling was trying too hard to come up with memorable and effective descriptions. Some passages are a little too long, and the emotion of the narrative is a little too carefully constructed to be truly effective. There are one or two lines that were obviously supposed to be clever, but which stand out and distract from the flow of the prose. I was never quite as immersed in the story as I'd have liked to have been, which was a shame because at the core of the book there's a very interesting tale.<br /><br />So J.K. Rowling hasn't embarrassed herself at all with this competently written book. I felt at times like Rowling herself was a character, because I could sense her trying very hard to slip the Harry Potter style, which means (unfortunately) that some of the attempts to introduce sexual elements felt forced, as if the author was desperate to prove a point. I'd recommend The Casual Vacancy, but try not to set your expectations too high. It'll entertain you and, so long as you're forgiving of the occasional mis-step, I think you'll enjoy the book. But I doubt it'll ever top anyone'slists of favourites.
B0086T6XQ2|5.0|Love this new show. I loved the modern version of Sherlock Holmes. This has to be one of my favorite Sherlock Holmes series. Cant wait for season 3.
B002MRROKS|5.0|I have to say I'm impressed by the quality of review writing so I hope to emulate even if mine is a tad shorter...<br />I was there... It's one of those things you throw in when some wanker is pissing in your ear (\\"blah blah gigs they've been to/bands they've seen/drunk with a member of/drugs they've tried etc).<br />It is as stated in the title, a fuzzy memory. It was a good festival. Not a whole lot of sleep but awesome line-ups on all 3 days.When it came to Nirvana I remember the whole wheelchair thing and some moments of clarity (Lithium in particular) but the rest is a blurry mash of flailing limbs, noise and adrenalin fuelled moshpit entry/exit, rest, sing, dance and share a glance and nod with your neighbour.<br />To re-visit this night through the eye of a camera does not do it justice but its pretty damn close.<br />My brain thanks you for a clearer picture.
B000OGR1SO|2.0|I think this book is boring me to read too much.  There are few pictures about how to draw human figures.  It is an old book. I gave this book two stars.
B007SSEBCU|3.0|I think that the acting was great.  Many of the scenes were difficult to follow.  Too much was made of her latter years to the point that I could not follow the \\"time machine\\" dramatics. I am glad that Amazon had this in stock.

B000M4RG42|5.0|I think this movie is good.  It is base on true story about five U.S. Marine rose US flag on Feb 25th, 1945.  I gave this five stars.

B008PE9GSA|5.0|Its been too many years since ZZ Top has had a new release. I was little the first time I heard ZZ Top on the radio. Now I have some gray hair and I still like them. There are several hits on this CD. Its well worth the price. Its not a dud.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|This is one of the best all time series I have seen in my life. The adventure, romance, intrigue, suspense and intensity is worth adding this series to my vast collection of VHS, DVD and Blue Ray movies. I highly recommend Once Upon a Time to any avid viewer and look forward to the series 2 version when it becomes available on Blue Ray next year.
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|Awsome, I can't wacth as the season is going on, so I get the DVD after the fact. Boardwalk Empire is a great watch I highly recommend it.

B007M0W8JC|4.0|I think this video is good.  I understood that some Japanese soldiers were not patriot.  So, another Japanese soldier beat them up to be patriots.  This is a sad story.  I gave this video four stars.
B0076NAWWA|4.0|From the opening bass line of \\"Blue Ocean\\" to the harmonizing vocal influences of Brian Wilson on \\"Love Is What I'm Waiting For\\"<br />and \\"All Falls Down\\" to the lengthy and melodic \\"Infinite Fire\\", if you are a Steve Morse fan you will probably like this CD quite<br />a lot. It gives Steve a new outlet for his virtuoso guitar playing, which is always a treat, as it was on Angelfire\\".<br />Mike Portnoy's departure from Dream Theater has left him with the time to do some other projects he has wanted to do with his good<br />friend, Neal Morse. I don't think this will be a full time band for any of the players, especially since Steve will probably not<br />want to leave Deep Purple, but we can always hope. I will buy the next CD if there is one.
B008MG1E4A|2.0|I wonder what all the hoopla is about for this book. I've talked to SOF guys in bars that spin a better tale. On the good side, there isn't much BS in the book. It is a plain spoken, straight forward recounting of the training and execution of the raid. As the cops say, \\"Nothing here to see. Move along...\\"
B001KVZ6HK|1.0|Great movie but about this BlueRay combo I just can say disappointing.  To download the movie you need a DVD drive in your computer/mac and then what you get is just the low resolution version of the movie.  Again, not worth it.
1451678193|5.0|Aside from hearing that The Martian Chronicles is a fabulous book, I had no expectations before diving in.  I knew it was a book about life on Mars, but didn't know much else.  I wasn't sure whether to expect Heinlen's Stranger in a Strange Land or Burroughs's Princess of Mars.  What I found was very distinct from either of those.<br /><br />The book is structured in a series of short chapters, each of which felt like it could stand on its own as a distinct short story.  Each chapter (perhaps with the exception of some of the shortest ones) had their own fun and interesting sets of character & environment developments, plot twists and story arcs.  At the same time, they are all bound together by the passing of time from the first story to the last story and the consequences and effects of each story on the life and world of Mars.<br /><br />Unlike the other 'life on Mars' books I mentioned above, this book envisions a race of Martians living very much like Earthlings.  In fact, for the first little bit I thought I was reading about Earth inhabitants living on Mars.  Instead they were Martians but with some of the Earth habits and quirks you might stereotypically find in TV shows from the 50s and 60s.  As the story progressed, the Martians definitely became their own distinct race with their own huge differences in behavior, community, rules and expectations.  I really enjoyed the way Bradbury did this.  He made the Martians immediately relatable by giving them Earth-like behaviors and traits but then quickly made them unique and intriguing by expounding on the differences of their world and their race.<br /><br />Within a few pages, we find that Earth is about to make contact with Mars.  Again and again and again.<br /><br />The results are consistently humorous and intriguingly provocative.  The interactions between Earthlings and Martians is a fun and interesting commentary on the way we all interact and deal with the unknown.  I absolutely loved laughing at the ridiculous and over the top reactions and interactions while at the same time thinking about the truth of the behaviors and wondering why it is we do the things we do.<br /><br />It was slightly off-putting the way Bradbury seemed to ignore some of the scientific realities of Mars.  I acknowledge that this is a work of science fiction and that it was written in the first half of the 20th century, but some of the elements struck me as a little odd for the first few chapters (such as the Earthlings being able to breath on Mars, the abundance of life both in terms of humanoid creatures and in other animals).  The way some of the behaviors mixed with mid-20th century America, I sometimes felt disoriented by the lack of \\"true\\" Martian planetary realities.  Fortunately this was very easy to ignore once I really dug into the story.  And thanks to the fast pace of the storytelling combined with short chapters and a short overall book, I found myself completely immersed very quickly and thoroughly enjoying the tale without worrying about \\"reality.\\"<br /><br />As a whole, I absolutely loved this book.  The full stretch of the story was very engaging from the initial Earth-Mars contact to the final pages of the book.  I also love the way the book is structured into a series of shorter almost stand-alone stories.  I had quite a few favorites but I love that I can quickly and easily return to and reread or share these favorites without worrying too much about them being \\"out of context.\\"  I really loved the combination of silly humor, amazing sci-fi creativity and thoughtful social commentary.  Definitely and A+ recommended read.<br /><br />*****<br />5 out of 5 stars
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|So, the actual head itself is amazing and I love it. The case for the discs is nicely done and overall the whole thing is put together well. I shouldn't really put 5 stars as I haven't actually watched them or tried them yet, but I can't as I'm in England and have yet to get a multiregional blu ray player.. I just needed this! Not disappointed!
B00198X0WW|4.0|One of the lesser-known Deniro films is also a gem. But I think Jeremy Irons stole the show as a sympathetic Jesuit. Liam Neeson was so young in it, it must have been one of his first roles. Beautiful sceneries and blu-ray really made the experience all that better. I'm glad I added this to my collection.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|wanna this but this dont let me I don't know why but please let me use thisss and I hats Guiana z
B0056C6XIA|1.0|I second the other reviewers who have mentioned that it broke soon after purchase. I went to bend a small piece of bailing wire on my backcountry pack and the small piece of metal keeping the pliers ridged snapped making them completely useless!!<br /><br />I do like to fire-starter although I found it works much better with a knife back or piece of steal rather then the file that it tels you to use.<br /><br />The case and other tools are fine but for those who use the pliers as the primary tool I do not recommend this model.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this!!  Its way better than what they showed on PBS here in the states.  :)  A MUST for any fan of the series!
B002RI9PKO|5.0|This is an amazing book, that challenges core beliefs about success and the roots of human achievement.  A great read for anyone who enjoys discovering totally knew perspectives on familiar subjects, and a must read for every parent!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The Kitchen House was an excellent read.  If you are looking for a good book this is the one.  Once you pick it up you will not be able to put it down.
B008S80P38|4.0|Superliminal - 3/5<br />Didn't really like it at first, but it grew on me. Very sharp and edgy, and reminiscent of \\"A City in Florida\\" from 4x4=12.<br /><br />Channel 42 - 4/5<br />Danceable and catchy. The drop sounds like the Ghostbusters theme. Wolfgang Gartner is a valuable contributor here. If I could change one thing about this track, I would make the drop at 2:44 last longer and come in earlier. Otherwise great track though.<br /><br />The Veldt - 3.5/5<br />Ah, The Veldt. We've had a lot of time to listen to and digest this one, so by the time I heard it on the album, I was kind of tired of it. Still, it's a soft, catchy track with a good melody and so-so lyrics. The voice, courtesy of Chris James is nice though and is a welcome addition to what otherwise would probably be a forgettable song.<br /><br />Fn Pig - 3.5/5<br />This song begins with a lot of buildup, and gives off sort of an epic vibe. Then, at around 2:52, we hear a simple synth line, which acts as a sort of second drop. After that ends, we're left with a very barebones crunchy, dirty synth. The second half, while not exactly bad, doesn't sound like it belongs with the first half. It just sounds like it would fit better in a different context. Still an enjoyable song, but a bit of a mishmash.<br /><br />Professional Griefers - 3.5/5<br />This is another one that grew on me. When I first heard it, I wasn't totally sure how I felt about the loud, screaming, forceful vocals of Gerard Way, frontman for My Chemical Romance.  As per usual with deadmau5 songs that contain vocals, the lyrics are rather empty and don't really mean anything, but if you're listening to electronic music in the first place that shouldn't be an issue. I've heard some say that it would be better without vocals, but I tend to think that it would just be a boring loop. The vocals really do  give it character. Back to the song, it's pounding and punchy, and would probably be a good gateway track for punk rockers looking to get into electronic music.<br /><br />Maths - 2.5/5<br />This is one of the record's weak points. It starts out with a pretty boring synthline followed by an empty bassline for far too long. The track does get more lively, but it takes too long, and by then most people probably will have skipped over it. Reptition in music is not a bad thing, but the beat that a producer bases the entire song on should be compelling, and well, worth repeating. This one isn't.<br /><br />There might be coffee - 5/5<br />And followed by Maths, we have one of the record's high points. It starts off with a catchy synthline, and evolves into a trancey, beautiful, upbeat production. This is one that many people will be rewinding to hear again.<br /><br />Take care of the proper paperwork - 2/5<br />I'm not sure what Joel was going for here. The track starts out with a few ambient sounds, followed by an industrial-sounding train-like beat. From there, it just gets louder until getting into a steady drum groove. Then we get various experimentation from what I presume is extra clanky, metallic VSTs that Joel had lying around. Overall, it's pretty messy, and I wouldn't listen to it again.<br /><br />Closer - 5/5<br />This one is fantastic. It takes a while to pick up, but when it does, you'll know it was worth the wait. The two-minute intro is a riff based on Close Encounters of the Third Kind, hence the title \\"Closer\\". The main beat is a bit reminiscent of \\"Slip\\" from Random Album Title. It's very addictive, and a sure standout on the album.<br /><br />October - 5/5<br />This is my favorite track on the record. From the second it starts, you'll be hooked. It's just the right length too, I didn't feel like it needed to be longer, as I usually do with electronic music. Although basic, the synthline is extremely catchy. This will definitely be one to be played at nightclubs.<br /><br />Sleepless - 4.5/5<br />This is a very different track for mau5. It harkens the return of the Stephen Hawking voice,or the voice that was present on \\"Sometimes Things Get, Whatever\\" from Random Album Title. The drum beat sounds like an actual drum kit, which is very different for deadmau5. I also hear a bass guitar in there, or maybe that's my imagination. I'm a big fan of the experimentation here, and if it wasn't on this album, I'd have no idea deadmau5 made it.<br /><br />Failbait - 3/5<br />What we have here is a Cypress Hill (a rap group, for the unaquainted) song with minimal deadmau5 influences. It sounds like it belongs on one of their albums rather than one of deadmau5's. It's not a bad song, it just isn't very original and the hook is pretty bad. Being a fan of rap, I was able to enjoy this track, but it certainly won't be for everyone.<br /><br />Telemiscommunications - 4/5<br />For the third time on the record, we have a dramatic departure from what we consider to be typical mau5, and as was the case before, I wouldn't be able to identify this as a deadmau5 track if no one told me. That being said, it's pretty good song. Although I've heard of them before, I'm not familiar with the work of Imogen Heap, the group featured on this track, so I couldn't tell you if it sounds anything like their typical songs. I respect the experimental aspect of it, and I like Joel's decision to make it the album closer.<br /><br />Overall, >album title goes here< is a very solid record, bar a few songs. I enjoyed it greatly and think that if you liked deadmau5 coming in, you will certainly like this album. Even if you don't like electronic music at all, there's probably something on here that you'll be able to listen to. The first ten songs are pretty much classic deadmau5 with the last three being more experimental. It's a good record. Buy it.<br /><br />7.5/10
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|great entertainment... my husband loves it, he comes home from work and plays he says it relaxes him. great for the whole family.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved it! so much better then the movie. didnt think it would be a good read but it turned out to be quite enjoyable
B001CTDH58|5.0|I bought this for myself when it came out.  I have a min pin and he loves to watch dog movies. When my first granddaughter Leilani started watching movies, I lived with her for two years, we would fall asleep watching a dog movie, her first movie was Bolt. then she found my movie and it became hers, she wore out the movie and I had to get her another one.  My daughter tried replacing the one she swiped from me and she got that one too!  We love the movie, all the animals were so funny and we liked the people in it too. Wish they stayed through the sequels..
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love this game.  wish it gave you more coins to start off with though. great on my kindle. five stars &lt;3
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It is so wicked awesome!!!!!!!  I love it. my friends like it tats. do u like ice cream lalalal I like africa
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very fun game! Thanks for the free download! I play it a lot while waiting for class to start. Yahoo!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|the only thing I found wrong with it was it didn't have parentheses otherwise yes I would def. get it
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I only started reading the triology because I wanted to know what all the talk was about.  I got \\"hooked\\".  Fifty Shades Freed was the final (maybe) book and I was so anxious to find out how this all ended.  Good read....I have heard the books referred to as several negative things but I guess it is up to the person reading the book to determine exactly what it is.  In my opinion the books were Great.  All three of them.  The second one being the least interesting.  I guess I am suppose to be reviewing Fifty Shades Freed and I have gone off on the whole triology.  Best thing I can say is that I am definitly glad I read them and can't wait for the movie to come out.  \\"Laters\\"....
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved it! always left me wanting to read more! I cant wait to read the final book in the series!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Brilliant<br />Exhilarating<br />Superb<br />Cannot wait for Season 3<br />This show is a Masterpiece of theatre!!<br />Everyone should own a copy of Any season!
B00932A2MC|1.0|99% of Hollywood producers are competent and committed. The remainder made this movie. Seriously, was this movie part of some science experiment to see if people would groan themselves to death?
B005CA4SQK|5.0|This was a awsome buy! It did not take long to receive ,i actually got it sooner than the expectant date, can't wait to get season 2!
B0055SWM08|5.0|The gameplay itself is fantastic, but the visuals and audio in this game are what really make it shine. Its all very well polished and really submerges you in the world of Quell.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I really enjoyed the directions of this massive story that Martin took in this book. At one point a book or two back I was feeling as though it was too meandering but it seemed to come together for me here.
0525953728|5.0|Excellent book! I highly recommend this book. Amazing what our young men do for our country. I'm really mad at Fox News for reporting the writers real name.  I'm afraid he will be looking over his shoulder for the rest of his life and probably his family too.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I've read some reviews and understand both sides to loving and hating this book...I came to this book from a recommendation of a friend who has always given me books I ended up enjoying...<br /><br />I however loved it. The psychology and everything that's twisted and great about it. It's original. I did start to get a little bored with Part 1, but Part 2 delivered. I definitely recommend this read.<br /><br />I'm starting on Sharp Objects but because of the content can only take it in small doses.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This has the best stuff to look at. Type in anything you want and it will come up. Kudos to whoever came up with this. Better than Facebook....
B004J4WKTW|5.0|The Night Circus kept me going as fast as I could move the kindle pages.  It is so well written and downright intriguing.  What a great subject and movement of characters. I have almost finished the book, and I do not want it to end!
0679735909|5.0|Saw this referenced in the movie Possession with Gwyneth Paltrow and wanted a copy. Found it here at a great price with good service. Thank you and would buy from again.
B000MCH5P4|2.0|I was both excited and hesitant to start watching this movie.  Excited because from what I'd heard of the movie and from the cover alone, I sensed the potential for learning something deep and profound about life and humanity.  Hesitant because I hated the movie crash, both for its vignette style and its propensity to hit you over the head with the message ever five minutes.  And I had heard that this movie was 'in a similar form.'  As it turns out this movie let me down on both counts.  The thing I remember most and disliked the most about Babel was the fact that the entire movie seemed to be one long silent montage of boring events.  Every camera pan to villagers in Morocco or flashes of Mexico from the car window was at least two minutes too long.  And when there was action?  The action would happen in short bursts, but no one's story was compelling or exciting enough to make up for the inevitable stretches of boredom that were to follow.  I did find myself mildly engrossed in the story line set in Japan, mostly because the struggles of the deaf mute girl seemed 1,000 times more real than either the nanny in Mexico or the couple in Morocco.  Why?  Maybe because no matter how hard the movie tried, I was never rooting for or even remotely cared about the blond mother that got shot or her deadbeat husband.  The same goes for all of the other characters, whose story lines were either too short, too predictable, or just too boring.  And the movie ultimately failed to bring any of the stories together in any sort of real meaningful way.  I suppose the message is that people everywhere struggle to communicate and exist together in a world that is changing and becoming increasingly more complicated (and this message I have gleaned solely from the story of Babylon and not from the movie itself).  But Babel failed to communicate anything to me other than my confusion as to why I didn't fast forward at least half of the movie while watching it.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this game is amazing! it lets u be creative and see how good of an artist u are. plus since you can get it on ur tablet you can play it on the go. I already have all of my friends and some extra. if u don't have this game u HAVE to get it
B000002KOQ|5.0|Great music written, played and sung by the legendary Joni Mitchell,when she sang in soprano.  Anyone familiar with her work should add this one to their collection.
0316228532|4.0|This review has no spoilers!<br /><br />The Casual Vacancy is no masterpiece (she would be hard-pressed to top Harry Potter), but it is certainly not a bad book. Rowling is a gifted writer, and once you get into the story and characters, it really pulls you in. I would not recommend this book for younger audiences, as it is full of swearing and sexual references. Rowling does not sugarcoat anything, and it can be a bit depressing and bleak at times. It touches on many dark (but true) aspects of human culture. That being said, Rowling is gifted at mixing in dark humor and satire, without breaking the seriousness of the situations. There's a few spots where the book can drag, but I hardly noticed them. The ending was well written, and I can't wait to see more from the author.<br /><br />Yes, the book is expensive. However, Amazon Prime is $20 for the book... I also saw the book for $20 at Walmart. Shop around, or wait for the price to drop.
0525952926|2.0|I'm only one-hundred pages into Ken Follett's latest and I haven't read any of the author's works in years but....  I appreciate that the story he is trying to tell is very ambitious, but his style is that of a seventh-grader and his exposition at a kindergarten level.  I don't know if I'll be able to make it through almost 900 pages of this......
B00070DK14|5.0|Like many people, it seems, I knew very little about this album and only acquired it out of a sense of duty while completing my JT collection. It was one of the last I bought, apart from a few I WON'T buy. On buying it, I dutifully listened to it and put it away for a couple of years. Then, I pulled it out again (I guess to justify having bought the thing) listened to it and was blown away! Having had no expectations, I was amazed at how good the compositions were and the instrumentation. Just shows - never write anything off. I don't have the remaster and can see the sound quality (especially vocals) is pretty substandard. But this is a winner!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Works well on my Mesmerize. I like the easy to read power distribution breakdown.  And best of all, its free!!!!!!
B007V80WUC|5.0|This is an awesome album that is well worth checking out if you like Dream Theater or Rush and want to see where the genre is going in the future. Here is my album breakdown:<br /><br />Forging: Basically an intro to Architect of Fortune<br /><br />Architect of Fortune: First big epic song on the album. Cool lyrics and great music.<br /><br />Namaste: Heavy, then soft, then heavy again.<br /><br />Game of Life: Cinematic. Groovin' throughout.<br /><br />Reach Within: The single. What more do I need to say?<br /><br />I Am: My favorite of the shorter tracks, the solo section is amazing.<br /><br />Used: Driving, heavy song. Absolute riff factory.<br /><br />The One: My second favorite short song on the album. Just listen to the keyboard solo!<br /><br />Burn After Reading: the first third reminds me of Muse, and the rest sounds completely original, an awesome song!<br /><br />Last Goodbye: A ballad to close the album, amazing!
B008XG1X18|5.0|this app is so awesome i can't turn it off. :) my husband wants to throw out my kindle. lol
B004UID2LC|4.0|i would say this is one of the best apps ever.  However, every other update makes it not function properly.  I realize this is due many times to YouTube and Google trying to circumvent apps like these, but it is quite annoying at the same time.  I love love love this app.  Just wish it was more reliable and consistent.  I have grown to depend on it with my Kindle Fire since I am not always around wifi.  Thank you!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Both actors in this new series are favorite actors of mine.  This series is also different than any of the new series introduced lately.  I hope this series endures for awhile.  I cannot recommend this series highly enough.
B00425S1H8|5.0|Since the cable insulation is clear, you can see the braided cable sheilding. Its a small thing but it looks sharp! It comes with a USB driver on CD but I didn't use it. Windows 7 already has the proper driver. The other thing I like about it is that its not too long. I already have too much cable behind my computer. I bought it for my Yaesu FT450 (amateur radio transceiver) which has a DB9 CAT connector. For those of you who know what I'm talking about, you'll also need a $2.00 female/female gender bender which is on Amazon. With FTBCAT software and your radio CAT port (serial) set at 38.4 K-baud it works just fine.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|When I first heard about the Fifty Shades trilogy, it seemed like a series that could be interesting.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  The storyline is almost non-existent in the first book, and the second tries to add more depth, but it fails miserably.  Because I had heard some good things about the series, I forced my way through the first hoping that the Fifty Shades Darker would be better.  It was almost identical in plot and the repetitiveness of sex, fighting, and then more sex made it feel like I was reading the same thing over and over.  I would not recommend this series to anyone, unless they really want to read a bad book.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|After months and months of hearing everyone rave about this book, I finally gave in and decided to get it on my kindle. I wasn't as impressed or excited by this book as the millions of women around the world have made such a fuss about. It's an ok book. Nothing great and not horrible, but expected much more. I would have been more impressed if the lead female character wasn't a twenty something virgin with absolutaely no male experiences in her life. Of course she would be blown away, what else did she ever experience? It's unbelieveable in many ways and the way they speak to each other is quite annoying. I am interetsed in some parts of the story and of course had to buy book 2. Who's the sucker now, huh?
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very emotional book that gets you hooked. Not just a sexual fantasy, but a great look at a wounded soul
0446585041|5.0|I am literally lmao everytime I open this book. It is perfect. Ellen is an amazing comedian and she writes books like she's talking to you. She's hilarious.<br />I watch her show so her voice (and Dory's) is stuck in my head, so when I was reading it, it was like a stand-up show just for myself.<br /><br />I highly recommend you to buy this book. You will have feel improved because she says true things about life and hopefully you'll laugh more and live better!
B0058YPL66|5.0|This series is a fantastic fantasy trip.  Full of fantastic actors.  I put it with my other favorite Grimm as two of the best series that I have added to my DVD collections this year.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Absolutely loved it.  Really followed the previous book and really pulled things together.  I liked how the story evolved and bothe characters really grew.
B0056BMK6K|4.0|I found John Locke's \\"How I Sold 1 Million eBooks in 5 Months\\" to be very informative and useful for someone just learning the ropes of social media marketing.  Learning about how to utilize blogs, websites and twitter effectively to spur book sales can be a very daunting process.  Mr. Locke clearly explains how he has utilized the social media exclusively to sell over a million books.  He writes with a clarity and enthusiasm that inspires even a novice to undertake the challenge. I needed that nudge to launch my wife's new book and often refer to his book to be sure that I am on target with our promotional efforts.

B008D28HYS|1.0|This Android app does not explain how to play the game well enough for me to use it.  You are supposed to fill in blocks or sequences of blocks with colors, but I never succeeded in getting the colors I wanted into the blocks I wanted (I am talking here about the mechanical process of moving my fingers around the screen).<br /><br />In addition, I believe there are many different games called Cross Me, so it is not really practical to search elsewhere for information about the concept and strategy of the game.

1616614609|2.0|As a card game, it has a lot of competition these days. Dominion and Thunderstone are excellent card games for a group of people. And for two player gaming you have classics like Lost Cities and Odin's Ravens.<br /><br />I would recommend any of those games more than Netrunner. They are excellent card games.<br /><br />Compared to those, Netrunner's gameplay really doesn't measure up. The rules are more complex than they need to be, and it feels like there's too much luck involved. I love the theming and the art is great, but Netrunner overall didn't do it for me.
B008RYN44U|3.0|No doubt's new album is really fun and addictive if you are a casual listener who enjoys pop music nowadays but, as far as the fans of ND is concerned (myself included) is difficult to really understand what the band is trying to do here. When \\"Rock Steady\\" (2001) was released I found it to be the most commercial album of the band so far but, at the same time it was really well produced and most of the songs were memorable in there:  the amazing Underneath it all, Detective, Hella good, Don't let me down, Running, etc. \\"Push and Shove\\" (2012) kind of follows that path where No doubt is trying to get friendlier with the radio in order to be liked by more people. Unfortunely, I kind of feel that this record is more commited to that than to show the band's real talent.<br /><br />Honestly, this is not a bad record at all, in fact it's really entertaining but, the electronic parts or samplers somehow wraps everything up without letting you appreciate what the band is actually playing in the album. I mean, are there any guitars somewhere? what about the trumpets and drums that they use for their ska style? I DO agree that bands must evolve and with them, their sound needs to change as well but, this record kind of shows the \\"easy way\\" to do that. Making a song sound so \\"pop\\" that is difficult to really understand that No doubt is actually playing on this record.<br /><br />I'd rather not talk about the songs and let you check that yourself in order to evaluate the album's features and I really hope that you point at me to say, \\"you were wrong\\" because, eventhough I \\"kind of\\" like the album i feel that the record company didn't really let the band flow naturally in here so, they decided to add a bunch of \\"catchy\\" samplers in order to be radio-friendly.<br /><br />I love No Doubt for a million reasons you would never believe. I have never been a fan of the kind of music they play but I do love them and now I have all their albums. I'm just not getting \\"Push and shove\\"
B0058YPGVQ|5.0|The show is awesome, I recommend it to everyone.. except small children. It is graphic but has a wonderful cast and plot.
B008X5XP9M|5.0|An incredible reality and a great read.  A story of willing hero's placed in unbelievable harm by politicians and leaders.  The feeling of accuracy brings the reader right into the action.

0525423281|5.0|I became a huge fan of Stephanie Perkins after reading Anna and the French Kiss. I was totally in love with the characters and the story. So, when I heard she was writing Lola and the Boy Next Door, there was no doubt in my mind that I was going to read that book. A special \\"Thank You\\" to my friend Arlene, who was so kind to share her copy with me.<br />Perkins, once again, has delivered another fantastic story.<br />Blurb:<br />Budding designer Lola Nolan doesn't believe in fashion . . . she believes in costume. The more expressive the outfit -- more sparkly, more fun, more wild -- the better. But even though Lola's style is outrageous, she's a devoted daughter and friend with some big plans for the future. And everything is pretty perfect (right down to her hot rocker boyfriend) until the dreaded Bell twins, Calliope and Cricket, return to the neighborhood.<br /><br />When Cricket -- a gifted inventor -- steps out from his twin sister's shadow and back into Lola's life, she must finally reconcile a lifetime of feelings for the boy next door.<br />I had so much fun reading this story. There for a while I was having mixed feelings about her \\"rocker boyfriend.\\" It seemed like she really had to work to make their relationship work. So when the Bell twins moved in next door, I found myself cheering on the obvious choice, Cricket.<br /><br />I'm just going to give a rundown of parts that I truly loved about the book...<br />~Lola: She is such a fun character and the way she expresses herself by design and her own fashion, really made her stunning and captivating. Her creative mind really infuses a special likeability about her.<br />~Andy: Who couldn't love Andy!! He was so awesome!<br />~Cricket's entrance: I would have just died!!! But loved every second of page 34!! \\"Cricket Bell grins. \\"Hi, Lola.\\" ~SWOON!!! (You will too, when you read this page!)<br />~Etienne and Anna: They were in this book more than I thought they would be. I was pleasantly surprised. It gave methe wanting feeling of reading Anna and the French Kiss again!<br />~Window moments: Ah, these were moments I craved throughout the book.<br />~Heavens to Betsy: Just love the name!<br />~The Sunday Family Picnic: Way to go Nathan and Andy!!<br />~Abby: The cute little niece. She opened a window of opportunity for Lola...<br />~The ending: EPIC!!<br /><br />Okay, so I can go on and on. The ending of this book had me all goo-goo eyed and sighing. I was totally and utterly in love with Cricket. (He is a man of many talents and will surprise you by his devotion. Who couldn't love a guy like that!) But what I really got out of this story besides a lasting impression, fantastic storyline and excellent characters, is \\"being yourself\\"
B00136NVH4|5.0|Listening to these songs brought back a lot of great memories from high school days!  Perfect for the lazy afternoon just lounging, listening, and dreaming.....
030758836X|3.0|Let me begin by saying that I am extremely glad I was able to borrow this book on Kindle from my local library.  I was really looking forward to reading this book and I wanted to love it.  It started out fantastic and I spent a near-sleepless night trying to get to the end.  However, about three-quarters of the way through, I realized that both lead characters were conceited, arrogant, hateful, vengeful, pathetic idiots who completely deserved each other.  Truly, both leads simply began to disgust me, but I plowed through the rest of the book hoping for a great payoff at the end.  NO!  This book has a weak and anticlimactic ending that really makes no sense.  Overall, a complete letdown.
B006R4H5FG|5.0|This book was awesome! Clearly written, great advice, short enough to complete in a few sittings and the examples were perfect to illustrate his points. Highly recommended!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|really really a fun game!  great puzzles along with a great story!  waiting for the second game from maple creek!!!
0142419400|5.0|So in love with this book. I want to read it again and again. Its a must read!!<br /><br />Okay, this is a NO-BRAINER!!! READ THIS!! After reading this amazing book, I felt like a giddy school girl crazy in love... I have to say this is probobly the best book i've read this year!!<br /><br />I totally lost myself in this book and I didn't want it to EVER end! I would totally give this book a way higher rating if it was available, no joke! The writting is smooth and easy to follow as well as the story itself. And the Characters, wow, love all of them (even the b*$%# Amanda) They were so well written it's like you actually know them.<br /><br />Who couldn't fall in love with a book so well written and staged in Paris, the most romantic city in the world...
B0015KGWZG|4.0|I like the book. I'm not quite finished reading it yet. I find much of the information useful/helpful, though parts of it are certainly debatable (in my humble opinion).
B0086700CM|3.0|it it is to play on an ipod or I phone if you want it u can get it but I'm not forcing you to.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|Works, but has some bugs.  Struggled to figure out how to get it to consistently view the documents I was trying to look at.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this app! Just the thing to relax. I can't stop playing! My whole family plays this game. Wonderful!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The ending seemed a bit rushed and was disappointing. I hope that when they do the movie, that they change the ending to make Katniss personality a bit stronger as in the first movie and to allow her to achieve her goal of killing off her nemesis.
B008C1O8CA|5.0|To begin with, this album does not live up to their previous work, after listening to the album I wasn't wowed like on previous albums. That being said, there are some pretty good songs on the album, it's different, but different doesn't mean bad. It took a couple times through for the songs to grow on me but there are a few good songs here. The lyrics are not as strong as they have been on previous albums, these songs just don't have as much meaning as i'm used to hearing from them. All in all its a good album, it isn't their usually fast punk songs but it is pretty good, the only thing I can really say I don't like about the album is that it just sounds too clean. I would suggest buying the album, it may not be as good as the standard Green Day, but it is a good album. I'll be looking forward to DOS and TRE and hope they are a little better.
B008JJM88Q|4.0|It is a fun game, but gets boring quickly. It keeps telling me that there is an update available but won't let me update it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is a really fun game.  Great for when you have some time to kill. I used it waiting for my kids to get out of school.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Received this beautiful looking set yesterday.  Started watching Raiders of the Lost Ark and it looks amazing.  Started inspecting the other discs in the set and noticed that discs 2 & 3(Temple of Doom and Last Crusade)had scratches on them.  Havent tried playing them yet, but am sending back the set anyway.  Don't know if anyone else has had this issue.  I realize that it may just be cosmetic and I don't mean to be nit-picky.  However, I don't know how deep the scratches have to be on a blu-ray disc to cause playback issues.  In my experience with playing movies, scratches are not a good thing in general and I would rather avoid any potential for trouble if I can.  Not docking the set on account of the scratches.  Hoping for better luck with my replacement set.
B003F1WM2K|2.0|They were close, they helped each other, they each had their issues (although he more than she), they supported each other with poetry even though they were starving...c'mon. Really? and she is a poet, great writer of thought and verse before singing....really?  And they never fought even tho he gave her his disease, and had taken a male lover. C'mon.<br /><br />If you wait twenty years (her promise to him) to tell the \\"story\\" do you think that it is going to be real? and the fact that she went on and settled down with her success and career that you cut someone huge slack and only remember the good stuff? Well, I think so.<br /><br />Ever go through a gut wrenching divorce and twenty years later you look at your ex-spouse and sorta remember why they were cool, intriguing, interesting, vibrant? Well I have, so I get that part it's just not real, not memoir in its purest form. I say there is much much dirt swept under the rug.<br /><br />Maybe these celeb memoirs are given too much hype, importance? perhaps, perhaps. No, for sure. That's why I still glance at PEOPLE magazine in the check out lane.
030758836X|3.0|I'd rate this novel 5stars for the writing style 2.5 for the plot. An exciting beginning, even if it felt predictable, I still enjoyed getting wrapped up in the characters and the details of their thoughts. About 2/3 of the way through the book, the events and characters started to get too unbelievable, that spoils it for me. Still there were many unexpected twists and developments so it never got boring - not until near the end. The last 1/4 of the story seemed weak, and as others have said, rushed.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved these books. They were awesome. I can't stop thinking about the story. It was a really great story and really kept my attention. I can not wait until the movie. I am super excited. It is both erotic and romantic. This review is under my husbands name but I read them he did not. I really think it is more of a girl thing but i am sure that all will enjoy.I really can not understand why it is getting some bad reviews. I was hooked from the first book!You have to read them all and for me that was not hard. I could not put it down. I really think you need to have an open mind and not expect it to be anything more than an entertaining, sexy , day dream. I doubt it was meant for you hard core thinkers!  M. Thomas
B00957T6X6|1.0|As the other reviewers have pointed out this is a 50% price hike while including only one extra book.  Also, why do they charge so much in the first place?  This is an ebook--they don't have to pay a company to print all the books, they don't have to pay to ship them, etc.  They have unlimited copies of this book to sell as anyone could purchase it and download it on the spot.  There is no reason ebooks should cost this much.
B007EDZ20O|3.0|In Missionary Position, Hitchens really challenges what is presented to us as \\"saintly\\" role models by the hierarchy of the Catholic Church and society in general.

B008MEM24S|4.0|This is a really cute game. Addicting.  I recommend this for all ages...not just Phineas and Ferb watchers.  five stars!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is a great game for mom, dad and the kids.  Our girls enjoy challenging each other and work on the harder ones together.  Great game for those rainy days.  We wish there were more levels. Very pleased.
B000001E3V|5.0|If my entire album, cd and dvd collection were wiped out, this, Derek and the Dominos In Concert and Layla and Assorted Other Love Songs would be the first things I would buy to begin rebuilding my collection.  In my opinion, quite simply, Derek and the Dominos were one of the best rock groups that ever existed, and this cd captures them perfectly.  To be sure, there are minor concerns.  I think the drums are mixed up a little too high and I prefer the version of Why Does Love Got To Be So Sad from the In Concert album better than the version here.  As another reviewer posted, the guitar solo from the album just might be my favorite Clapton solo of all time, so anything other than that is the tiniest of letdowns.  But taken as a whole, the cd is brilliant and a fitting tribute to a great band.
B0019I6WDG|4.0|The acting in this movie was great and the story line was had an unusual twist.  It was well made and the director gave much thought to reflecting real life experiences.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Ahhh I loved it!!!! Wow, this was so freaking good! I honestly had no idea what to expect after the first book. I did not know where Suzanne was going to take us. That is what made this book so great!<br /><br />Again, I have to say that Katniss is a really strong and awesome female character. She would do anything for the people she loves, which is why I love her! This book has so many twist and keeps you hooked right until the end. I really need to read the 3rd book, now!!!!! I need to know what happened.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is really awesome. I thought it was gonna end being a bust but it actually is very helpful womith usage and time breakdowns.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I really enjoyed these books. I would recommend them to anyone. There is a lot of twists and turns in the book that keep you interested. You always are surprised by what happens next.
B008966SIU|1.0|A very boring and blah release. With the exception of \\"Yet Again\\" the rest of the songs are \\"scraping the bottom of the barrel\\" inferior B side quality. Very disappointing considering the catchy material from the prior release.<br /><br />Take out \\"Yet Again\\" and it's guaranteed to induce sleep. Yes, you heard it here first, a cure for all insomniacs!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Fantastic read, a page turner from start to finish. The story gets to the details of the mission to kill Bin  Laden in a way that matches anything Clancy wrote for suspense. Having read all about BUD/S training in \\"Lone Survivor\\" (another great book), I was pleased this book did not spend a lot of time on that section of the training. Rather, he covered in some detail the Green Team training for Seal Team Six which was new ground for me. The added bonus of the chapter on the rescue of Captain Phillips from Somali pirates was a real treat. Great read - 5 Stars!
B005LAIHSG|1.0|I couldn't enjoy this movie, if it was a great script (not), good acting (not really) or even oscar worthy (not in a million years). I spent the whole time with the remote control in my hand, adjusting the volume up and down. When people were speaking, the sound was a whisper. Then, abruptly...the background music would blare forth and sound effects would completely overwhelm me.<br /><br />At one point, my husband came running into the room, thinking that something horrible had happened in our living room. Why? Because the volume of the special effects had suddenly awaken him in the other end of our home. He was afraid that I had been hurt (only my ears).<br /><br />A friend was given this DVD, because she said that her son wanted to see it. The 'gift' came with a warning that this movie might get complaints from your neighbors; so, keep the remote handy.<br /><br />What a waste of money!
B00785P2QC|5.0|i am addicted to this game. its a great way to pass the time.(: i love it! its slow at some places but its a lot of fun to play.
B007I1Q4W2|4.0|This movie was good, with a few caveats. Some major flaws include the mismatched guns that were all wrong for the period, including the opening scene where our hero is carrying a Marlin 1894 at the end of the civil war. And in one scene they are carrying nickel Colt 1873 Peacemakers (a cartridge pistol) and in the next scene they are front stuffing the cylinders of their blued revolvers with black powder. Another minor irritation is that the character spends a lot of the movie wearing a black leather jacket but black leather didn't come around until the early 20th century with the advent of chrome tanning; up until then leather was vegetable tanned in various shades of brown. But movies are all about the suspension of disbelief, right? Once I let go of these minor flaws I really enjoyed it. As the title of my review suggests it bears some thematic similarities to The Outlaw Josey Wales, except for the walking dead. This story was more about the spiritual journey than your typical zombie shred-fest, but it's a worthy addition to my collection of zombie documentaries.
B001GXYBY6|3.0|It's pretty much the way you remember the cartoons: lots of action, racing, not much thinking things through, cars, bloodless violence, racing, annoying kid brother, cars, family values, racing, and a chaste girlfriend. The good guys are squeaky clean, the bad guys storm and sneer, and being nice wins out in the end - and the bad guys get theirs. (C'mon, that's not really a spoiler. You knew it had to happen that way.) If that were all this movie offered, I wouldn't bother.<br /><br />The effects keep it moving at a roller-coaster pace, though. Fast cars on (and often in the air over) surreal race tracks pound together like supersonic bumper-cars, seen through vertiginous angles of the CGI \\"camera.\\" Everything gets amped up a notch by the movie's eye-popping use of color, flashing lights, and fast-moving montages. It's as if the Wachowskis were trying to grab your adrenal glands by reaching in through the optic nerve.<br /><br />As far as plot and all that go, this movie ranks a few steps below ordinary. As a fast paced effects-fest, though, there's nothing like it around.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B008I34Y6W|5.0|For the songs, album cover art, and musicianship- \\"One size fits all\\" is probably my favorite Zappa record. I like every song on it, the guitar solo on the first song \\"Inca roads\\" firmly places Zappa among Rock's premier guitar players (for anyone that needed convincing). Bizzare album art, inside jokes among the band with phrases like \\"booger bear\\" for lyrics, and music so advanced many rock musicians of today would not even be able to play it....welcome to the world of Frank Zappa. Great sound quality. Thanks to Gail Zappa, Universal music, and Robert Ludwig for this excellent remaster cd. Heartily recommend to old fans and newbies.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|great fun but for some reason I lost all my progress and I almost had beaten it for the samurai
B0011Z32KI|4.0|I enjoy listening to his singing.  There is a nice selection of songs.  It is great after a busy day to relax and listen to it on my Kindle Fire.
B007THA4FI|1.0|If I could give this 0 stars, I would.  I am so disgusted that an author, who possesses  such an enormous vocabulary and imagination would resort to f-bombs to convey her point.  Thank goodness I got a free sample for my kindle!!  I deleted it as soon as it was obvious that this book is garbage and that was way before I was even half way through the sample.  Try again, J.K. and next time make it a point to write without leaning on obscenities, as if that makes a book \\"adult\\".
B001N26GFC|4.0|'Poppy' Cross has one of those unfortunate names. This cheery grade school teacher has never had a cross moment in her life. Instead, she sails on through in bright colors, chunky heels, and an unsinkably happy outlook. Even her response to a painful chiropractic crunch is to laugh at it. If you can imagine Annie Hall in short skirts and brilliant hues, you've got Poppy's attire nailed - always wrestling at least one oversized bag, lots of bits and pieces flapping in the breeze.<br /><br />A few things save this from silly pointlessness. Rather than simple mania, Poppy's bright view of the world is a choice, one that she maintains with effort that rarely shows. The effort does come out, once in a while, though, like when she deals with that troubled child in her class, wound-too-tight sister, homeless man, or stalker. They cut to her serious core - but, if wounds healed the way blows to Poppy's optimism do, most emergency rooms would shut down for lack of business.<br /><br />I could have wished for a little more closure regarding that troubled child. And, more than once, Poppy crossed the line into genuinely annoying - but only occasionally, and she's pathologically forgivable. On the whole, it's a fun if forgettable bit of fluff.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
1400052181|5.0|We all agree the positive results of science but seldom ask what it takes to make these advancements. There are many unsung heroes in this scientific world and one is Henrietta Locks. She was a vibrant African American woman who was struck down by cancer. Her doctors at the time took care of her but went a step further and took some cell samples. These cells known as HELA have traverse the globe and even ventured into space. Virtually making her immortal.<br />Science writer Rebecca Skloot takes the reader on a fascinating journey into the history of how these cultured cells came to be. Part mystery and science this book humanizes the HELA cells and paints a portrait of Henrietta Locks. It even goes a step forward and brings her descendants into the picture and continues the saga.<br />This book touches on medicine, science, and ethics as the delicate balance between patients rights versus the potential benefits for humanity. I absolutely was drawn into the story and amazed that in our modern world, there are still the possibilities for my tissue samples to live beyond my mortal soul.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This was the best book that I have read in a long time. I could not put it down.  It was like I was there with Mark on his missions.
B006RXQ800|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite movies, excellent stars, and historic; I believe it to be well produced and directed.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|This movie is so fun.  I sure hope that the two of them make more movies of the type again.  Loved it!
B001PPLIEG|4.0|Ian Fleming's original James Bond owed more to Hugh Hefner than to the civil servants that Bond supposedly represented. Sean Connery did a great job portraying that womanizing, witty, high-living secret agent. Times change, though, and Daniel Craig is the agent of that change, even if not quite the romanticized agent of Fleming's original stories. The new bond is tougher, grittier, and a lot more believable. And, like the hero of this movie, the stakes of the game get a twenty-first century makeover too. The wealth isn't isn't gold, diamonds or nuclear weaponry - but you'll see that for yourself. Even the cinematography has a more modern look, especially that jaggedness that amplifies the hard edge of the fight scenes.<br /><br />It's a Bond movie, though, and a good one. It has all the action of Craig's previous work in this role, for one thing. Then there are the gorgeous and sometimes lethal Bond Babes. That includes Camille Montes who (like Tilly Masterson in \\"Goldfinger\\") has a score of her own to settle. And, as we've come to expect, there's an explosive finale.<br /><br />If you hoped for the debonair, droll Bond of the 1960s and 70s, well, this isn't him. Instead, as with any good myth, the Bond story stays fresh by changing with new tellings. The old Bond was good, but the new one is good too.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B000SEGUDE|5.0|After a few years of my son urging me to read this book, I finally did .  wow! Definitely worth pulling an all nighter. I was transported so many times to so many places. My final observation:evil is constant; only the coat changes

B004W2UBYW|5.0|Issacson has done a superb job of telling the reader who Steve Jobs was and what he created.  The author pulls no punches in describing some of Jobs' bizarre behaviors and his mistreatment of those who worked with / for him and even members of his own family.  But the author describes in great detail Jobs' genius in creating new products and pushing his team to refine them to be the finest products they could be.  Jobs was ahead of any curve you can imagine in developing consumer technology long before the consumer even knew what was coming, and he was mad about getting it perfectly correct.  This extended to marketing and even the feel of the box that your iPad comes in.  I could not put this book down and am using excerpts to help our team at work grow professionally.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love the large visible numbers. Easy to use and calculate. I use it for traveling, shopping, school and many other purposes. I really recommended this item to all.
B0094OLFUW|5.0|It's intriguing, I don't usually like this style of music; however, The xx portrays it in such a way that I cannot let it pass unnoticed. My friend told me about this group, I loved their first album. He showed me a stream they had set up to showcase their new album. I was in awe, absolute awe. Coexist brings something new to the music industry. While some insist that Coexist isn't as good as their first album, I'd beg to differ.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great album by an amazing band. Definitely worth the price.
B001BFFTO0|4.0|I have had mine for two years and I am coming back to buy a second pair.  They are dressy enough for the office and durable enough to survive our gravel sales lot. The insole wore out a little fast but that was only in one spot so that might not happen to people with a flatter arch. I would not use these for hiking or anything like that. Just a casual or semi formal shoe with ankle support is how you need to look at this boot.
B0090EIC3Y|3.0|Always funny SBC, once again, touches many \\"wrong\\" subjects.<br />Entertaining and with some great one liners. Definitely worth watching, but not necessarily a must-see movie
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Awesome game.....that really sums it up. There are so many upgrades and vehicles to choose from. I highly recommend this game
B002MCJZHS|5.0|I've only known about this band for a few months now, and every minute I spend listening to them is euphoric. I thoroughly enjoy this album along with their new album, Coexist. The xx tosses something else into the predetermined mixture, per se. They add something more than most bands nowadays, they add a new kind of conviction.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend The xx to anyone.

Bought it after I heard it on Spotify and find it playing VERY OFTEN in the car...because my CD player is broken, but i don't mind- it's cool.

Plus, I think I will be able to clear out some of my bookmarks, that are taking up space, because you can save everything you need and want in one place, with Pinterest! I highly recommended it to my 15 yr old daughter, and now she's addicted to the 'Hair and Beauty' boards.
B004SEVPWQ|5.0|This pool game is the best ever! I have been looking for one over the years for my pc, palm pilot, EVO, FOUND IT. the play with droid feature allows you to choose opponents level. If someone is online during your game play, it alerts you allowing you to play against a real person. I played pool with a British Pool team player a few weeks ago, what a great time. He cheered me on, when I made negative comments if I missed a shot. What great sportsmanship. We played two games, he won both, however most fun since I got the game. You will not be sorry if you get this one.
B004TACMZ8|2.0|Okay, I should have heeded the warnings of the previous reviews, but I thought that Bosch tools were impervious to problems as every other Bosch tool I own is the highest quality.  This is the exception - it was erratic in locating wood studs and never could locate electrical wires - even around switches and outlets. I have no idea why Fine Homebuilding rated this so highly. I have an old Black and Decker stud finder that outperforms this Bosch tool (I compared the two tools on a wall that I built and the old B&D worked flawlessly while the Bosch was crazy) - I bought the Bosch for a second home that I own and now will try another brand. I even tried calling the Bosch help line and they told me to return it - so that's what I am doing.

0765316994|4.0|John Scalzi has delivered with a highly entertaining humorous novel. I loved the original Star Trek when I was a child, and did not pick up on the death of all extra characters on a regular basis until years later. This is light-hearted and satirical. Enjoy it for what it is and if you have not already read Old Man's War, or re-read it.

B009GEBBNQ|3.0|I watched The Avengers on instant play.  And I mean that I WATCHED it.  The audio was horrible!!!!  I tested my PC audio...it works fine.  Amazon has to put some money into it's instant play feature.  Offer sub-titles on all movies and make sure the audio is working.  Netflix has them beat on those 2 items.<br />I'll probably have to wait until TA is available on Netflix to watch it again.  It looked like it was a good movie.  I'm just sorry I missed hearing what I think was a great script.<br />Maybe next time....

B001USHRCK|5.0|This is tied with the Millennium Falcon as my favorite lego set of all time.  The architecture of the buildings is gorgeous and the wide variety of acessories is amazing. The minifigures are great (I switch the blonde peasant and the little boy's hair) and they're perfect for posing or playing.  This is a set I would buy for my dad - definitely not just a little kid thing, although my 8 year-old brother loves it too.  If this is the only Kindoms set you get, it would be enough.<br />I was so excited I put it together in one afternoon - even though my hands got pretty sore =)<br />Two tired thumbs up!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I missed this movie when it was in theaters (being busy is the worst when it comes to making time for blockbusters), but I had read a lot of good reviews about it.  I pre-ordered it and it arrived yesterday (9/27/12).  As soon as we opened the package, we put it in our PS3 and the whole family sat down to watch it.  Here is how awesome it was: we normally eat at 6 pm, but we were ALL so hooked that no one even got up from the couch for a snack until the movie was over after 7 pm.  So, yeah, great movie.  If you missed it in theaters, definitely pick it up now.  Great action, great acting and while there were moments when the storyline was a bit convoluted, it really didn't matter since the fight scenes and the interactions between Avengers and each other and Avengers and bad guys was so good.  I bought this edition so we can watch the Bluray at home and the DVD on car trips or on a laptop.  Do not delay - especially if you, like me, didn't have time to see this on the big screen.  P.S. - Turn out the lights in your living room when you watch for a theater like experience!

B00007LTIB|5.0|It has got to the point in some of the great music of the 70s that \\"classic\\" is basically over-used. I missed out<br />on hearing RELAYER until some time later, I forget when, but it is an album that ( at least for me) still circulates around TALES. I did not get to hear ( also read \\"See\\" since the Gatefold experience of a Vinyl<br />disappears on a regular CD for the most part ) this album until probably after I had defined YES with the key<br />covers I had seen; so with the cover RELAYER has, it fit right in to the albums I thoroughly enjoyed. It was still<br />the case that I was a little defensive about Listening to YES, since I enjoyed Jon's vocals, but few other<br />musicians I knew had the same tastes. However, The key part of Sounds chaser, the Soon recitation that was<br />excerpted into a single I assume by the record company, was something that stuck in my mind always. However, I<br />seemed to always get the feeling, rightly or wrongly, that the albums were part of one great cosmic experience,<br />with the YES ALBUM being the ( and I say this with all the love for the album in the world) odd one out.Having<br />Discovered PKD relatively recently, I see the STARSHIP TROOPER reference kind of in a different light, but with the<br />same amount of affection for the album.<br />  Rhino has done the re-package of these albums superbly. For items with what I think have comparatively<br />less documentation in audio and video, the use of the track extras and the Booklets with the superb art-work, Rhino<br />has encapsulated a project for superb albums that work very well. My only concern with the production is that the<br />discs produced here are so often produced under such amazingly lesser standards. I don't know if the British/EU<br />production groups have thought to license this version of the albums with the tracks and extra imaginative content.<br />Hopefully there are some Videos of songs done album by album ( I hope not a best of ) done in more recent<br />productions.

B004DN3VEM|5.0|Outside of the Re-Mastered LA-Mix version of this Album, and the Munich 77 concert, I know of few CDs/-recordings<br />where the audio is so brilliantly great.The best thing about the Deluxe versions of these albums, is that it is the<br />next best thing to getting the Japanese pressings. The German discs that I have bought so far have packaging made<br />in other parts of the EU, but the discs are the key usually. The presentation has great packaging, pictures, and a<br />superb booklet. The New York Mix is not the greatest all-round mix, but if you want a mix that centres on the<br />guitar on vocals, then the NY mix works. The best all round mix is the LA mix since it has the NY sound with the<br />depth of the Bass into the mix. The Rough mix on disc two comes very close to being as good as the LA mix, but<br />fails on some level. If you want a great audio experience, put these discs on a 5.1 so that the channels will flesh<br />out, even though the mix is stereo ( I know that, okay certain persons) but I have software that uses the 5.1<br />channel to the optimum on the PC, and you do something similar on a TV surround sound. All in all these RAINBOW<br />discs are great. Overall my favorite all over sound is LONG LIVE ROCK AND ROLL, but this is still excellent, and<br />the package is great for fans, and the Booklet tells part of the story for this CD, a great product, and definitely<br />the LA Mix makes a great Car CD for those who need that in their travels.<br />  Just a minor note; The sounds you can hear developing in RAINBOW were starting to come around in the latter part of DEEP PURPLE, and as the Booklet notes, Blackmore learning the Cello helped him expand his composing skills and find a sound for some of his tonal variations that were changing. Ever the temperamental artist, it was probably almost inevitable that Blackmore wind up playing in his current band, BLACKMORES NIGHT which has some skillful guitar work as well as  brilliant ideas.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|This was a great movie to watch on my iPad while flying. Enjoyed the plot and keep me engaged the whole movie.
B0019EXZY4|4.0|BASED ON A TRUE STORY. A group of misfits plan and pull off one of BIGGEST bank robberies of the century. A taut, action filled movie. A very good cast. Jason Strathom does a very good job. The special features on the disk I own gave insight and back story on the real robbery.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|I just had to buy this DVD of the miniseries that BBC did as it was extremely well done! From the beginning, I was intrigued and mesmorized by the main character of Little Dorrit. Then, I just had to keep watching to to see the continuing happenings and of the story unfolding all around Little Dorrit. This is one of those series, that once you start watching, you must continue until the end. This series,was beautifully acted, wonderfully produced and is a true classic. I would reccommend this to everyone.
B003UTUQ3E|5.0|I saw the full Deluxe edition, and I must admit I did want that, but I wanted so many other CDs music, and DVDs<br />that I had to compromise. I have bought some of the super fan collections of items, but I can't do that with every<br />set. I will admit that this has the great material, a remastered Station to Station, which I had only heard certain<br />tracks in collections before, so the first disc ( The Studio Album) is great, with awesome detail in the mix, and<br />the live double disc is new to me, but is still a great set, whether heard before or not, its a unique performance<br />and great to listen to, since Bowie is one of those performers who give each date a unique edge, and the other<br />musicians give the studio version plus something extra so that you get an extra bonus for sure.<br />  The Set has a bunch of great items, the booklet is a part of a larger set that must be the Deluxe set with<br />everything thrown in, but it still looks great in the booklet set since it gives a great insight, and I am sure the<br />book will come out for a while as an item for fans. I remember seeing Bowie sometime around this period on the<br />Kenny Everett show, and he was a total scream. Whilst the Studio album is great all around, tracks 2,5, and 6 are<br />ones that stand out and have been the perennials.The live discs have varying degrees of greatness, but I enjoy things like the very evocative tone of track 15 ( FIVE YEARS) which has a continuation of the studio style, but<br />that was lacking a little in tone, so the live version has somewhat more power.At various points in the Live discs,<br />it speeds up tracks as you might know them, which is pretty standard for live albums, and Panic in Detroit is where<br />the Band is introduced. The rest of the Live Album  is a great experience in my opinion, even when compared to ,<br />for example, the GLASS SPIDERS tour, which had something else added to it that made it have a  very different tone.<br />But both of these shows are top arguments for Video-ed shows, or at the very least having Large Screens, since both<br />here and in some other Continents, the performances are almost indecernible with the theatrics without a large<br />screen if you are more than 15 rows back.<br />  The little extras are great. The booklet has photos of Tickets, but I would have liked the approach some<br />special editions did where the Laminates were reproduced. Minor but significant. the Special edition overall is a<br />great buy, but if you can afford the deluxe edition, go for it, I know that with deluxe editions in other cases, I<br />bought it, and with the right package, it is a great buy for fans, maybe not so good for the casual listener. And<br />in that theme, if you want an intro  to Bowie from this period without a Nosebleed price, the Special edition is<br />pretty good. And you can get the studio Album on its own if you just want that for a new listener. At the very<br />least you can appreciate the musicianship. But, I was happy with the Special edition, I just wish I could have got<br />the Deluxe version/edition.
B0053O89K6|5.0|I loved the show, now I have the complete series to watch when TV has junk on instead of shows that people really like.  So many good TV series are being taken off TV for stupid shows.
6305127697|5.0|All actors in this movie are great. Richard Gere in an amazing performance as a high powered, on the rise, no where to go but up lawyer who takes on a high profile murder case that he believes will take very little of his time and attention and bring him the notoriety he deserves. Enter the accused played by Edward Norton. Non stop ride from here on. A THRILLER that won't let go. A DEFINITE MUST SEE. The disk I have has a current interview (the movie is at least 10 years old) with Edward Norton that is amazing. He talks about how he got the role and how HE developed HIS character. His first movie Hollywood role and this performance put him on the map. The ending is MEMORABLE (actually,UNFORGETTABLE!!) YIKES!!! VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

B00005JKED|5.0|The movie is mediocre. A cop movie that is brutal and definitely action packed. BUT, both Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawk brought their A game for this film. Washington is Stellar in every movie he does, but he plays the monster in this one to the hilt. He is the movie. Despite the materials mediocrity, I can rewatch this one and always be taken in by Mr. Washington's powerful performance. He's the MAN.<br />I met with a friend of mine today to loan her some movies (I like to share) and I mentioned Denzel Washington.<br />She agreed That he is one of our best contemporary actors. She then said she doesn't like really violent movies, but was conflicted about the movie TRAINING DAY because both DENZEL WASHINGTON and ETHAN HAWKE were so magnificent in this movie, she liked to watch it anyway. (By the way, she agreed the movie was mediocre) It's all about the acting in this one. These two guys are the very best in this film!!!!
0345803485|4.0|Loved the book. It is sure fun to read and gives you ideas to hot up sex life. The plot, though, is not as intense as the sex scenes. It could be more well elaborated. But I've enjoyed every chapter and I've read it twice already. Thumbs up!

I don't see the downside, someone mentioned that it's a social media game, however it does not have to be. If you don't register a game name all it does is not move to the next playing levels so you don't earn stars.... That's how I played for awhile. I recommend this game to all who enjoy a good game of Mahjong
B0074JOCIG|5.0|I won't pretend to be an expert, but I know good music  when I hear it, and this performance is fan-fing-tastic from beginning to end.  Joe Bonamassa is an incredible musician and vocalist, and has surrounded himself with the best people.  This band is so in sync, and you can tell they are loving every second of it.  Old fans will love it, and I hope new fans will discover this rare talent...this performance is a great way to start!  For those who care, the production value is fantastic.  The director and crew deserve major kudos for a production that is so clearly well planned and expertly executed.  The lingering shots of Joe's hands are exactly what you want to see...you could almost believe that Steadicam was invented with Joe's hands in mind.  Everything about this disc is top-notch.  You won't be disappointed!
B009B50QOU|5.0|I've been a Green Day fan for a long time, but I've strayed away from their stuff for awhile (not a fan of 21st Century) and although i liked American Idiot, I longed for the songs about doing nothing and tongue in cheek humor. Green Day for a while there was straying from their classic roots and became almost ragingly too political and too Bob Dylan / John Lennon. !Uno (and Dos, Tres) is a welcome home to Green Day's old style, and while it's not Kerplunk, Dookie or Insomniac, this is as close to Green Day is going to get to their classic stuff. If you listen to some songs, you can tell Green Day went back and listened to some of their old material, example is, Let Yourself Go, which has strings from Maria (from Greatest Hits) and sounds from their album, Warning. Even Kill the DJ has a parody of today's pop-culture that is similar to their Italian-Godfather sound of Misery (off Warning).<br /><br />Listening to this album, it reminded me a lot of Warning with a strong mix with their side-project band, Foxboro Hot Tub. It has a different unique sound. You can tell they wanted to go back to their normal roots, but not lose their edge that they gained from American Idiot and, especially, 21st Century. one of the songs, Carpe Diem, definetly sound like something off 21st Century, close to resemblance to Life Before the Lobotomy. Troublemaker sound a lot like the old punk rockers like Joan Jett, but you can tell it has resemblance to their Foxboro band. Fans will definitely be happy giving this a strong listen. I'll admit, it took me a bit to listen to every song, but I can finally say that I'm happy with the results. Green Day has always been known for their catchy pop-punk tunes and this album does not disappoint. The songs, besides Oh Love, barely reach 4-5 minutes and not one of them sound like a 3-part ballad. Actually I compare this album, arguably, to bands like Lagwagon (Sweet 16) and Less than Jake. The theme also has kind of teenage love vibe singing about lost love or being one's sweet 16.<br /><br />I'm not sure why so many give this a hateful response. If one wants to compare to Kerplunk, then they should just stick to Kerplunk, because Green Day will not return to that type of punk rock material. If anything, unlike American Idiot and 21st Century, this is some of the best stuff Green Day has put out since Warning. No, there's no real hits like Waiting, Good Riddance, or Nice Guys Finish Last, but give it time and you'll find that some songs will stick out more than others.<br /><br />My favorite songs off the album is Let Yourself Go, because that is a song that I can say is closely knit to the Green Day I grew up with. I more than glad Green Day is back and I can't wait for Dos and Tres in the coming months! Welcome Back, Green Day!

B008H6GHL0|5.0|Finally...an adaptation that is worthy of being called a Resident evil movie. Resident Evil: Damnation rose to the occasion on this second installment of the CG movies. It does a great job of captivating a viewing experience that will appeal to hardcore fans of the video game franchise as well as viewers who are unfamiliar with the games. The storyline was thoughtful, entertaining and engaging. The mood and tone of the film stays true to the games and the overall themes conveyed in the game come through in the film beautifully-- without making it any less of a film. As I watched the film I felt myself being immersed in the gameplay all over again when the composition of a scene looked eerily familiar to one I remembered from one of the games. Leon and Ada's characters remain respectful to their originals in the game and are not overshadowed by characters created in the adaptation. BOW's do not become uncharacteristically humanized -- or beautified into infected superhuman heroines in tight clothes--insuring the integrity and the severity of the threat they pose. In essence, this was a film made with the intention of making a respectful adaptation of the Resident Evil Games franchise--not a series of shameless mockeries disguised as Resident Evil live action films. In surmise, yes, you have the introduction of new characters and a new setting but the overall important core elements of a Resident Evil based movie are not lost unlike the live action films. If you want to experience the survival horror series Resident Evil without playing the games or if you just want to see a good CG horror / action / zombie movie, then this movie is a must see.

1611761565|5.0|This book does not give away any national security secrets that loose-lipped politicians haven't already given away.  It DOES give the reader an insight into what our soldiers DO in this war, and how they manage to cope.  One of the most important things I've learned from this author is that these soldiers cannot just \\"turn off the war\\" even when they are at home on leave.  I would recommend that every person who has a soldier in this far-away war read this book.  It will help to understand a little bit about what these brave people face on a daily basis.  AND, the profit from the sale of this book goes to help the families of soldiers just like this author.  God bless you, Mark Owen, and thank you for all you've done to keep our country safe!
0316228532|2.0|This book is about what would have happened to Harry Potter had there been no Hogwarts.  It's an \\"alt\\" version - what happens to a neglected child in the welfare state, what happens when there is no magic, what happens in a world composed of Durselys.  That makes it an adult book and a very unpleasant read. I could not bring myself to care what happened to any of the Durselys. I see that almost everyone gained self knowledge (and most did not put it to any use); I see that hacked Facebook pages as a means of knowledge is very clever (JKR lives); I see that a girl who was being destroyed is more confident because she is imitating someone (Kristen) whom she does not really see as she is - but I didn't care.  I was glad I'd reached the end alive myself, that was all.  However I did read the entire book so Rowling is still a page turner. I will also buy her next book but I hope someday she can integrate what is at present a double vision - magic childhood and adult rottenness.

B004TN7QPG|5.0|With some books in my Kindle app, some in my Nook app, and others in Stanza I was looking for something that would support all of the major ebook formats.  Moon+ does this and a whole lot more.  You won't find a more customizable ereader out there....so many options in fact that it can appear overwhelming at first.  The icing in the cake is the text to speech function which works like a charm....essentially turning any book into an audible book.  Adding the ivona text to speech engine and your choice of voice makes the audio book sound like it's being read by an actual human being.<br /><br />The pro version is a steal at $4.99....it's worth double or even triple that amount.  Five stars and highly recommended....I just wish that there was a version that worked for the ipad.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|great game to kill time. I really enjoy playing this game when I don't have anything to do. just hope we could get more balls for free.
B00356CO1E|5.0|This video is amazing i love it so much. I didn't expect it to be that intense of a workout because it was shorter than most workout videos but dang it kicked my butt. I was sweating in the first five mins i learned no to judge a workout by its time:P If you want to get in shape this is the video for you:)
0060763280|1.0|He mentions his \\"Millionaire Mind Seminar\\" ALOT, trying to convince you how the seminar is great and worth it. Overall his message was good, but not different from Napoleon Hill books or other self help. $9.99 down the drain. I wish I could get my money back.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|all the seasons were awesome and this one is just as good. i would recommend it to anyone that watches tv
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|best game i've ever played, and the graphics look amazing. I would definately recommend this game to anyone. Buy it now you wont regret it.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I am a fan of this genre. I read American Snipper, which I also liked very much. But I enjoyed this more because of the historical significance. Having read American Snipper, a lot of the information about SEAL's wasn't new to me, but if you are unfamiliar with their dedication and sacrifice you will at the least increase your respect for these young men. I will never grow tired reading about these brave young men who are willing to sacrifice everything for their Country.
B006OOHYIC|1.0|Inventive concept, flawless execution, simple gameplay, brain teaser with no chance of a \\"That makes no sense\\" moment... You'll look smart being seen with this game.<br /><br />Edit: This review has been changed from a five-star because the latest update not only removed my progress in the game so far, but corrupted data for two other games as well. Unbelievable. And now this game will not run correctly half the time, with the ball unmovable until I restart the level.
B008EQIEWS|1.0|The disk will not load on my blue ray mechine. I have tried 10 time and each time I get an error message. I am really dissappointed. I guess I paid for a movie and got a coaster!!!
B000VR824S|5.0|I'm a big Clapton freak.  I also really like the old bluesmen.  For that reason, this is one of my favorite DVDs.  I seriously have listened to the Eric and Steve Winwood section a ton of times.  John Mayer is great on here too and I'm not a big fan of his.  However, the best parts are the old blues with guys that soon will no longer be in this world.  Buddy Guy recently said that after he and BB are gone the true, old bluesmen will be all gone.  I'm pretty sure that some of the young guys wouldn't agree with that but this is a fantastic DVD to have just to document the way old blues were played.  I don't know that I'd go as far as to say that Cheryl Crow was horrible on here but it's probably not her best effort.  I still enjoyed her and I always appreciate Willie Nelson.  Jeff Beck is good as he always is.  His young female bass player is excellent.  It was great to see Robbie Robertson out in public playing.  Johnny Winter has gone way down hill since then so if for nothing else, get it for the great version of highway 69.  I have the other two crossroads concerts and for me, this is the best of the three.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|this game is awesome.  great as something to do for an hour or more as well as something to do for a couple of minutes.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I got the E6 amp after reading several reviews on many different headphone amps. I needed something to boost the sound of the music in my helmet over my bike and wind noise. This little gem does the trick just fine. My helmet is not the most wind resistant out there, hence the higher wind noise at interstate speeds. Also, I'm using a DIY speaker setup with crappy headphone speakers. Still, the E6 amp does a surprisingly good job. I plan on swapping out the crappy speakers with some nicer PC headphone speakers. I know this will make an even greater difference. Highly recommended!
B0019CB5T8|3.0|3 1/2 Stars = Very Good<br /><br />As far as satanic possession films go, this one is pretty good. Based on a true story (Isn't half of them anymore?), \\"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\\" does have it's devilish pleasures, & it's creepy skin crawlers, but one has to think, have we not seen this all before, & better done? Yet, this is well worth the watch for those so inclined to be possessed by possession films!<br /><br />\\"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\\" 2005
B008XG1X18|4.0|Like an old lawnmower... I have to try to start this app sometimes  3-4 times before it doesn't crash. Then it goes like a champ. Very easy to use... too easy... there should be an alarm function so you know you have spent too much time on it and you really should be going to sleep.
B002ZG997C|5.0|A real eye opener. Fast paced and attention grabber. Mr Washington does a superlative job And I think most viewers would agree with me.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A great recap of this historic event. My hats off to seal team six. The best of the best. Thanks for all you do.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Didn't like the characters, didn't like author's writing style - just as self aborbed as her characters - and stopped reading at half way mark. Only do that with about one in one hundred books. Don't go looking for \\"Gone Girl.\\"  What a waste.
B0012QVJXS|5.0|This is a amazing remastering of The Superman movie into blu ray format. Great picture quality and sound which helps in presenting exactly what the director intended to show.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|We can't get enough of this series, absolutely love it, Buy all the series you will love it. Can't wait for the next season.!
B008D4AKYQ|5.0|Big Big Train has always been one of those bands, to me, that puts out good music but have always just kind of ended up in my \\"mediocre category\\". Not great, not bad, but not worth reviewing either.  Over the last few days I have compared \\"English Electric\\" with \\"The Difference Machine\\", \\"The Underfall Yard\\" (about their best offering to date, in my opinion) and \\"Gathering Speed\\" (which did not do a whole lot for me). Of the three mentioned I would have to say that \\"English Electric\\" would be the quintessential Big Big Train album. They have finally refined their sound and song composition to a point where the Prog world needs to listen up and pay attention. EE PT1 is quite simply a wonderful listen!<br /><br />They have a very pleasant sound and are very interesting to listen to. Nothing bombastic, over the top, or too symphonic.  \\"Progressive Archives\\" labels them as \\"Crossover Prog\\" and I would agree with that. Not really too eclectic and a bit too unique of a sound to label them as \\"Neo Prog\\" with maybe some slight leanings towards the Canterbury sound. There are 18 guest musicians/vocalists with 12 musicians guesting on 16 string and wind instruments. The list includes a couple of heavy hitters like Andy Tillison (The Tangent) and Martin Orford (IQ and Jadis)This adds very interesting elements to each song. While not all play on every song (that would be too much) each song uses various combinations of the instruments to enhance the music and add very interesting elements. Care seems to be taken with song length (most between 7 and 9 minutes) so as to allow time for the song to develop and evolve and not wear out their welcome for those who do not like 20 minute long marathons.<br /><br />Two of the shorter songs \\"Uncle Jack\\" and \\"Upton Heath\\" actually have prog folk undertones with the incorporation of more traditional instruments of folk/bluegrass guitar, fiddle and mandolin. But each song evolves into much more than that. David Longdon's vocals on each, soar. One cannot help but hear undertones of both early Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins, but David's vocals are much more pure with the ability to easily slide up to the higher registers. His vocals, particularly on \\"Upton Heath\\", are simply perfect. I can listen to both over and over again.<br /><br />I think this album has the unique quality that it may be listened to at various levels of volume to obtain a different experience. (Not unlike some of Marrilion's work.) English Electric is pleasant enough to listen at lower volumes, and let it encompass you; yet expansive enough to really send some chills down your spine when you crank it up!<br /><br />I am going to have to chide in with another 5 star review. Especially when compared to their other work. BBT has really hit a home run here! The very good news is that is just part one! We get part 2 next year. I am not going to vote it as the prog album of the year just yet but definitley in the running!.

B001KVZ6HK|4.0|As many can see by looking at the customer supplied pictures, Paramount and Marvel opted to sell this 4-disc boxset with 2 discs on the left side of the case and 2 discs on the right side of the case. This means that the discs are right on top of each other. Which is really really poor of Paramount and Marvel. I'm thoroughly disappointed and am now going to buy a 4 disc case online to make up for this nonsense so that my discs are available as i wan them. I dont see the need to remove my 3d bluray disc to get to the bluray disc. And that is why they lost a whole star from my rating.
0739352989|5.0|These audio books sure got my motor running and just when I thought I would be on overload I realized there was a very good story line.  My husband loves to listen with me while home in bed.  Big suprise!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I enjoyed the book and have read all three. It was especially easy as I put it on Kindle. After the first one I knew the story had to go on and if you read this one you will want to read the third. I tried the library and there was not one to be had within any of the library branches that says something.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|like. it fun and intertaining great for younger people easy to play really really liked playing it. all in all fun
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love the way you guys thought of the idea of coins and it is different and so fun.I love it
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|This was the last in the trilogy and was not dissapointing infact it was a great ending.  All three books were brilliant and hard to put down.  The author kept you on your toes all the way through each episode whenever I thought I knew what was about to happen Bang!!! wrong again, but enjoying every moment of the plot.  Highly recommended got to be amongst my top 10 books read.
B005DI66N4|4.0|Ever since I read, on 26 Aug 1999, We Die Alone, I have wanted to read this book.  It tells a story of a Pole sent to Siberia to a Stalinist labor camp, who escapes with six other prisoners and walks into Mongolia, acoss the Gobi desert, through Tibet, and finally reaches India and safety.  The account of the gruelling walk and the horrendous suffering they went hrough is riveting--and, one must admit, hard to believe.  And apparently there is substantial evidence that it is not true.  But it makes a terrific story and I am glad I finally was able to read it.  It is not as good a story as We Die Alone but is still an absorbing book.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|God love baby all is good love this app so so so so so so much get it or else
B0055SWM08|5.0|if you like puzzles and games that use logic this one is great.. it is not timed and there is little or no need for a tutorial... lots of fun!
B007SGM084|5.0|Arrived in excellent condition in good time.  An excellent read.  No complaints on any avenue. Will be an  Amazon client for many years to come.
0525953728|5.0|I think this was a great book and I enjoyed it from page one to the end.  I understand that some people have taken issue to his comments about Obama and breaking the code of silence of a Seal.  From my perspective,  it is great to read first hand how these elite group of Seals conduct a job most people could not fathom.  Put aside your political beliefs and enjoy a story about the sacrifices made by a group of men that make the rest of safer.
B008XG1X18|2.0|I really enjoy using Pinterest on my laptop but this app crashes all the time, like 75% of the time, the other 25% of the time it stalls the Kindle so bad that I have to shut down the device and restart. I would like to like this app but it's just not working for me.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|so freaking cool and addicting get this game it is extremely good and fun.GET IT RIGHT NOW YOU GUYS.okay you better listen GET IT NOW!
B00846REIS|5.0|Believe the 'HYPE,' regarding this novel, it's similar to E.L. James', '50 Shades of Grey,' yet UNPARALLELED to it! It's 10 X'S BETTER! Whatever you do, DON'T do as I have, and believe the IMBECILES who state that this novel, series, whichever, is an exact reproduction to Ms. James' masterpiece. If that was the fact, Ms. Day would be in violation of copyright infringements!! Make Your Own Decisions! When deciding which novels to read, if you're not interested within the first 100 pages, to me I don't bother with again!<br /><br />However, getting back to 'Bared to You.' This story is written at a fast pace, with INSATIABLE erotic scenes that will leave you BREATHLESS, CRAVING your own release!! I'm am being HELD HOSTAGE, by Gideon & Eva's unquenchable thirst for one another, to the point I CANNOT concentrate on anything else during the day! I completely zone out, TRAPPED in my own fantasies staring Mr. Cross!<br /><br />WELL DONE MS.

B006LSZECO|4.0|Starts a bit slow, and hard to get into, but it is all a set-up for what is to come.  Becomes a real page turner up to the end, where it leaves you hanging.  Good characterization, and a \\"are you kidding me?\\"
B004GYY714|5.0|Where do u begin? well its an overall good app! but u can tune into ur local radio or any station.in fact im listening to it right now as i type. you can find fav artists and songs.no glitches or viruses happend. very good for those people who really like to listen to the radio at night i know i do! Add songs and artists to ur favorite tad and either buy the song or see if its anywhere on the radio.PLZ do me a huge favor and get!!!!!
B008TMA1LY|4.0|this game is a cute lil ga.e if u like diner dash or games of that genre u will like this game also. only negative is that u need real money to buy certain items and tglhe better upgrades would bebetter if u could earn them like u do thecoins but guess the developer has to make money somehow?!
B008I3QZKU|5.0|This is a big record with a big sound. Think the 80's. Think a cross between U2, Journey, Meatloaf (yes, Meatloaf) filling arena's and stadiums with huge sing along anthems in with some mellow songs mixed in.  That is the sound of Battle Born.  It is a big ambitious sound and I think they pull it off pretty well. Well enough where I will give this release 5 stars after about 10 or so listens.<br /><br />My history of being a fan of the band is only about 2 years old after catching a live concert on the Paladium channel. I never gave them much credit before seeing that concert video. They have become one of my favorite bands.<br /><br />For reference, here is how I rank the other 4 Killers releases:<br />1. Day and Age - I didn't expect to like this one but I love it!<br />2. Hot Fuss<br />3. Sawdust (these were b-sides, one offs)<br />4. Sams Town - with just a few exceptions I find this release to be a mess. Read My Mind is my favorite Killers track.<br /><br />With all this, it did take a few listens to really get into it. Some songs hit me right away, some others are still growing on but I don't not like any of the songs. Some have been criticizing the flow of the record, but I think it is well put together.<br /><br />I know a lot of Killers fans are into the themes of the records or a story within the compilations of songs. (Hot Fuss is losely about a guy who kills a girl but says he is guilty, gets out of prison, enters the military, gets obsessed with another girl and kills her too in the end.  Day and Age is about the cycle of life, birth, death, etc.).<br /><br />What I find interesting about Battle Born is it isn't as much of a story within a story. Rather the songs are all different characters with a repeating them of being in a rough spot and thinking about the old days when a relationship was new, etc. How and why have things changed, how am I going to react to the changes and the tough times? That is what Battle Born means!<br /><br />There is also a neat little musical theme going on here. If you have Sawdust, you have a remix of Mr. Brightside. Take the keys progression on that remix, and on Battle Born the band has mixed into a lot of the songs here that same keys progression, slightly modified in some of the cases, and put them in the songs. Some are obvious, sme not obvious, but if you pay attention you can pick up on it.<br /><br />I wouldn't tell anyone to not get this record, I think it is great. Is it Hot Fuss?  heck no, but I was prepared to not like Day and Age cause of all the synthesizers and lack of guitar. Now it is my favorite Killers record that I listen to often - a lot more than Hot Fuss. I am expecting the same of Battle Born.
B0086700CM|5.0|I see some reviews about bad lagging on the kindle. I have not had that problem at all, so all I can say about it is to give it a try. If it works, that's awesome. If not, it was free anyway.
B0084BMUFA|4.0|I thought it was a good book.  It's old english which just adds color to the book.  I liked it.  I'll probably read it again.
B0091REZMW|5.0|cool game fun great not easy difficulties  !!!!!!!!!!!!! add me name mrzzluckey really dnt knw what to say they want u to Wright so much just to make review omg
0446547573|5.0|I did not want to put the book down.  Different than some of the other books, but very good.<br />No wonder they all make such good movies.  Look forward to his next book.
B007SGM084|2.0|I was lured into this book by the first 6 chapters of the first book.  While the story has a stimulating appeal, the writing is atrocious!  Gosh, the publishers and/or editors must be slacking off and shame on the writer for calling herself a \\"writer\\".<br /><br />While the writing is horrendous, I'll pull through to finish this book on my Kindle and never pick it up again... Don't know if I can say that the 30 bucks spent was a good investment.  Probably better that I'm reading it on the Kindle instead of holding the book for the mass to witness.  And I'm not ashamed by the content, I'm ashamed that I'm reading such a horribly written book.
0316228532|1.0|Reading this book felt so much more like an obligation than something done out of enjoyment. It was not a joy but a relief to finish it. I realize this wasn't supposed to be Harry Potter and comparisons are moot, but I didn't expect it to be the diametric opposite of HP. It is written for a totally different audience, an audience that does not consist of me. This thing can go sit on bookshelves with the likes of John Grisham and other rich people cranking out meaningless dramas. Where Harry Potter created a beautiful, rich, diverse cast of characters, The Casual Vacancy creates the same caricatured people I read to avoid. I found myself liking the characterizations of the teenaged characters (with the exception of social worker, Kay), and would be interested in seeing Jo create a realistic young adult novel, or even a more political novel, rather than the upper class gossipfest this was. There was some compelling themes that could have been explored further (the clinic, \\"the light of God shone from every soul\\") but ultimately went unresolved. It also would have worked better, in my opinion, as a linear novel, rather than one told from too many points of view, leading to a crowded, overwhelming read.
B002RHGYOA|5.0|I thought the first in the trillogy was great and this was just as good, stayed up until 4am reading it and then<br />couldn't wait to download the last episode.Can't wait to watch the movies.
B004XVN1T4|3.0|This was usually a page turner. Sometimes It felt that the cast of characters was a real stretch to keep connected across the storyline. And  the detail in the romantic scenes is gratuitous and detracts from the political intrigue.
B008SO9M8Q|2.0|A 350+ page anti-liberal, bigoted rant.  It is riddled with deliberate mis-interpretations of the accepted scientific theory of evolution, natural selection, and 'survival of the fittest', circular reasoning, christian apologetics, outright racism, and baseless anti-Jewish propaganda.  The only value this book has to a modern, free society is as a primary historical source and insight into the psyche of the original author.  I bought this book as a supplement for my latest Open University module (Religion in History) which will take me halfway through a history degree. (The principal importance of the study of history is to avoid repetition of humanity's past mistakes.)
1609419693|5.0|I loved this book, and I loved it even more listening to the Audio CD.  No one could have recorded this book better than her, (Tina reads the audio version) and it makes all the difference.  I did not read the print version, but listened to the audio version twice, and I'm sure I'll listen to it again sometime.  Loved it!
B0094OLFUW|5.0|I love this album. Shines light into the thoughts and ideas of a relationship. The questions we think of while we are in one. Loving someone so much that you ask yourself where things went wrong? Or a memory of being together and the thoughts that the heart draws up. Love it!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I heard mixed reviews about this series, so I was hesitant about purchasing it. I finally caved and downloaded the first book. I couldn't put it down!!! I was reading it during the day at work, in the morning when I woke up (almost making me late to work a few days), and I read it at night until I couldn't keep my eyes open any longer! This book kept me inticed and entertained. Some people complained about the writing style in these books, but I personally didn't have any issues reading it. It is comparable to other series I have read, so the writing style didn't bother me.<br /><br />I just started reading the second book in the series. I am seriously addicted!!! I cannot wait to see where Christian and Ana's relationship ends up!!
B008MJC6ZS|5.0|Testament is the greatest thrash metal of all time.  This Album like the rest is proof that these guys will never do anything wrong.

Congratulations guys for another kick ass release...

B006H5120E|5.0|Titanic is one of the few 'chick flicks' love stories that I really enjoy watching, and back then when it was first released, it was spectacular.  The story is beautiful, emotional, thrilling, and heart wrenching at the same time.<br /><br />Now, this has been made into a 3-D experience of a lifetime.  The picture clarity has gone beyond 'clear'.  It is now something beyond that, the picture is FLAWLESS.  Not a single smudge, blurr, or second out of focus, and the colors are absolutely vibrant with life.  The quality is so 'real', you are in the scenes able to just touch everything you can see.  This is only the second blue-ray/3D movie that I can say this about, out of dozens.  The sound is also incredibly immersive.  You have those quiet dialogue scenes, but when the music and excitement picks up, you are drowned out in special effects, background noises, and it's accompanying background music.  Seems to be genuinely theatre style.<br /><br />The story itself is just truly an experience to have to watch.  You will forget you are watching a movie only until you are prompted to insert Disc 2.  And THAT is my only dislike about the DvD.  But when the back of the box says it is split into 2 DvD's for maximum quality, the producers were not lying.  It is maximum quality.  And on top of the 3D experience, you get a blue-ray 2D copy, and a digital copy as well.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the movie Titanic, and are able to watch 3D, you will absolutely and without a doubt love the Titanic 3D experience.
B005HSL626|5.0|This is one of several games which my boys love the best. They can play individually or one on one.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|This book is a great find for any Les Miz fans.  The free download was very easy.  There are a few titles that appear in the book as M. sur M.__________  Not sure if the original was written like that, or if it's part of the free download.  It's not a deal breaker, but if you need a definitive version, I'd opt for one you have to pay for.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|good way to pass the time.  My grandchild would love.  she gets a kick out of finding objects. before me.  Habakkuk faster then you grandma.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|easy to see. lots of games.  I really like the way it shuffles automatically. I am enjoying the game very much.

B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|Paul's research and storytelling provide unique insights and antecedents to solving a perennial problem that is at the core of our effectiveness as a society and country. A new foundation on which to build more thoughtful, integrated, and impactful social, medical, and educational programs now exists. Thank you Paul for writing this book, and hats off to all the characters therein for their character and grace!
B00932HEX2|5.0|I absolutely loved the first season of this great new show. I was on the edge of my seat and drawn in from the first episode, the finale is truely a work of art. Looking forward to season 2.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I like the story alot, it picked right up after 61 Hours and did'nt stop.  I would reccommend it highly.
1439102430|4.0|Another Temperance Brennan novel. As usual it was excellent, a real page turner. The only thing missing was the love interest, or Temperance's interaction with her sister.The mystery had me on pins and needles until the last few pages.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|Great movie! Action packed! Followed the book fairly well. Actors did a good job. I can't wait for the sequel !!!
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I have to say it is a great time filler. Stayed up entirely to late playing. The down side is the coins go so quickly....and its waaaaaay to expensive to buy coins. I did and was mad at myself. Im looking forward to playing more but I will go to bed much earlier!
B0086700CM|4.0|My eight year old played this game the first time on a cell phone with a friend!  She loved it!  We downloaded it to her kindle and she loves to play it in the car.  Simple and entertaining.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is one of the best weather apps I have ever used. Good graphics and I love the 15 day forecast. The weather related news videos are an added plus. Easy to use and to add your favorite places.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Once you start its very difficult to stop. The relationship between Ana and Christian is just amazing. It just makes you believe in love at first sight.
B00003CXA4|5.0|This DVD arrived on time and was exactly as described.  I am very pleased with the product and service and will order again.
B003TP3UYG|4.0|Firstly, this is a review of the French Blu Ray release of 1492 and NOT the German Blu Ray release, or any of the DVD versions.<br /><br />Region Code -<br /><br />The disc is region free, however it's in Pal format so it might not play on non Pal systems.<br /><br />Picture -<br /><br />The picture is far superior to all of the DVD editions of this movie. The transfer is showing it's age however it's better than the Blu Ray transfer of Amadeus for example.<br /><br />The disc has an accidental 1080i transfer, but you can forgive that for being able to see the movie in HD with no optimisation like the DVD versions had. Unlike some 1080i transfers the aspect ratio appears to be correct and there is no stretching or squashing of the image.<br /><br />Sound -<br /><br />The audio distortion that appeared in places on the DVDs has now gone. I can only assume the audio has been re-encoded from it's original source just the same as the picture.<br /><br />Languages -<br /><br />The intro text and titles are all in French and the default audio track is the dubbed French version, however the original English audio track is included. Interestingly enough Depardieu does the dubbing for Columbus in the French audio track.<br /><br />Packaging -<br /><br />The packaging is not the cool sleeve with Columbus holding the sword against the firey background pattern. This was the concetp artwork that was scrapped and replaced by a design that looks very dated. A bit of a shame but it's better than not having it on Blu Ray at all.<br /><br />Final Thoughts -<br /><br />Buy it from Amazon.fr where it's cheapest. They will ship it world wide at a very reasonable rate.<br /><br />There is a German Blu Ray of 1492 that has a 1080p transfer and the English intro text and titles.<br />The picture on this version appears to have more vibrant colours, however it looks like a sharpening filter has been used on it.<br /><br />I've read a number of people saying that the French Blu Ray is identical to what they saw in theatres in terms of the colour mix,<br />so it may be that the German Blu Ray has been adjusted unnecessarily, which as we know happens allot with movies on Blu Ray.
B00881VLCE|3.0|My 7 year old son and I both enjoy jigsaws and this app version is no different.  I simply wish the images were better.  The ad brief makes it seem much more varied, but if you're not into Anne Gettes babies and kittens then there's not much for you.
031620157X|3.0|Alex and Conor are two twins who couldn't be more different. Alex is a smart and bookish girl and Conor slacks off and frequently takes naps at school. The Bailey family has been having financial difficulties ever since the twins' father was killed in an accident. Alex and Conor's grandmother gives them a book of fairy tales called The Land of Stories, which begins to mysteriously glow. Alex and Conor end up falling through the book into the very land which it describes!<br /><br />I enjoyed the plot of this middle-grade fantasy novel. But the writing, alas, left much to be desired. It was stilted and unreal; in the hands of another author this could have been a great book. But Colfer's descriptions of the wonders of the various kingdoms fell flat, and I couldn't really picture the scenes in my head. And the characters weren't well fleshed out and developed other than stereotypes (Alex the good student and teacher's pet, Conor the slacker.)<br /><br />However, as I said, the actual story-line itself was good. I enjoyed the land that Colfer created, even if I couldn't quite picture it in my head. That said, I think some beautiful color plates would have really helped and added a whole lot to the book. But Little Brown didn't do that (incidentally, Little Brown refused to give me a review copy, so I borrowed it from Emily.)<br /><br />Ah, yes, back to the writing. On page 215 there is a description of Red Riding Hood, now a queen: \\"Red Riding Hood was a very pretty young woman around the same age as Jack. She had bright blue eyes and blonde hair that was done up glamorously behind her crown. She wore a long, red gown with a matching hooded cape and a pink corset. She wore a necklace with a massive diamond, her shoulders were completely bare, and she wore a pair of long gloves with a dozen sparkly rings on her fingers.\\" First lesson of writing class. Never start two sentences with the exact same phrase. Plus, Colfer uses \\"she wore\\" a second time in the second sentences. And \\"pretty\\"? Really? It sounds awkward and is not very creative. The Evil Queen's back-story was quite interesting though.<br /><br />All of my reviews can be read at my blog at novareviews.blogspot.com.
