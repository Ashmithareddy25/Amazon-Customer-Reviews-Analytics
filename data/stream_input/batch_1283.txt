B004O3YGMC|1.0|I was not informed before BUYING this app that it would not work with my computers system. I am not impressed.
B002R4K6AG|1.0|I'm a fan. I like all of his stages. I even like most of \\"Self Portrait.\\" I listen to his albums since \\"Time Out of Mind\\" regularly, so its not his voice (and with Bob, one can never assume that the sound of his voice on a particular album is his real voice). I even seen him recently in concert (September 2011) and thoroughly enjoyed it. But this album, as an album, is really bad. And such a waste. I mean, with the voice he uses on this album, we could have had a truly spectacularly melancholic or wise selection of songs and arrangements (think Marianne Faithfull's \\"Easy Come Easy Go\\"). Indeed, there is a hint of this in \\"The Christmas Blues.\\" But what we get instead is, on many tracks, what sounds like karaoke versions of songs with standard arrangements (albeit played by a crackerjack band) and backup singers who sound like the ones on the worst songs from \\"Self Portrait.\\" And then there are the tracks that frustrate in their failure. Listen to \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.\\" This is the most pathetic, ironic, and sarcastic \\"Christmas song\\" in the repertoire. Watch Judy Garland sing this to the actress playing her sister in \\"Meet Me in St. Louis\\" as she struggles to keep it together while the little girl is, herself, crying and you'll know exactly why it is also one of the most misinterpreted songs there is. Even Dylan's restoration of \\" we'll have to muddle through somehow,\\" while admirable, does not make up for the bizarre phrasing. Which is such a shame because it almost hits the same mark that Rosemary Clooney did in her version. I would love to hear him apply the same care to his arrangements that he did with \\"As Good As I Been to You\\" or \\"World Gone Wrong,\\" but he hasn't. There is nothing unexpected in the arrangements and one feels that there was little to no connection between Dylan and these songs. There really is no reason to ever listen to this album again. I might put two or three of the songs (e.g., the aforementioned \\"The Christmas Blues\\" or \\"Must Be Santa\\") on a Christmas playlist, but most of the rest of them are simply throwaways. Which is why it is such a shame. This missed opportunity makes you crave for something truly inspired. And you just know that Dylan is capable of it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Works very well with Kindle Fire. Good options, great graphics, runs smooth, and is free! I have already wasted hours playing on my Kindle Fire so far. Worth the free down load.
B0060ZJ7BC|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  I admit I am not a huge baseball fan.  I prefer football over baseball, however I wanted to see this film based on the reviews.  I had no idea about the inner workings of trading players and that some teams have more money than others.  This movie gave insight to someone who knows nothing to the inner workings of \\"building a winning team.\\"  I will certainly read the book after watching this entertaining and informative movie.
B005DMNS4A|5.0|The Who released its sixth studio album Quadrophenia in October of 1973.<br />Following the success of Who's Next (which came from the unrealized Lifehouse project) and its subsequent tour, guitarist/songwriter Pete Townshend released his first solo album in 1972 titled Who Came First and also helped organize Eric Clapton's concert return from heroin addiction with the Rainbow concerts in early 1973, singer Roger Daltrey recorded his first solo album, bass player John Entwistle recorded his second and third solo albums and drummer Keith Moon appeared in the movies 200 Hotels and That'll Be the Day when he wasn't partying nor trashing hotels. The Who also found time to start recording another concept piece with Glyn Johns (who helped make Who's Next a masterpiece) called Rock Is Dead-Long Live Rock (three tracks for this were done \\"Long Live Rock\\", \\"Is It in My Head\\" and \\"Love Reign O'er Me\\" in addition to Lifehouse leftovers \\"Join Together\\", \\"The Relay\\" and Moon's B-side \\"Wasp Man\\"). Unhappy with results of the story, Townshend scrapped and recorded another rock opera/double album called Quadrophenia (with engineer Ron Nevison at The Who's own studio which became Ramport Studios) which tells the story of a teenaged Mod fan of The Who who has a four way personality split (each personality modeled after a Who member). When I first heard this album in 1988, I automatically loved the album and is my favorite Who album to this day.<br />We start with an instrumental overture called \\"I Am the Sea\\" which sets the mood with ocean noises and echoes of \\"Helpless Dancer\\", \\"Is It Me\\" (from \\"Doctor Jimmy\\"), \\"Bell Boy\\" and \\"Love Reign O'er Me\\"). We segue into the rocker \\"The Real Me\\" which is a stellar rocker featuring excellent vocals by Roger, rippling bass and horns by Entwistle, Townshend's power chords and Moonie's 4-armed/legged drumming. We then segue into the title cut which is a 6 minute instrumental which gets the story into high gear (and uses motifs from \\"Bell Boy\\", \\"Dr Jimmy\\", \\"Helpless Dancer\\" and \\"Love Reign O'er Me\\"). Then ocean noises segue into \\"Cut My Hair\\" featuring Pete on lead vocal for verses and multi-tracked harmonies by Roger for the chorus which references The Who's first B-side as The High Numbers \\"Zoot Suit\\" and their first single as The Who \\"I Can't Explain\\". Great song and also John Curle of the BBC plays the news reporter. The rocker \\"The Punk and the Godfather\\" is the encounter between Mod Jimmy and The Rocker called The Godfather. This tune does reference to The Who track \\"My Generation\\". Roger's vocal on the bulk of this track is excellent and Pete sings the bridge/Godfather role brilliantly.<br />\\"I'm One\\" starts the second half of first disc with Pete out on lead vocal and a great song using excellent guitar from Pete. Next is the rocker \\"The Dirty Jobs\\" which tells of the jobs only a Mod like Jimmy could ever have. We then go into the piano/brass/acoustic guitar driven \\"Helpless Dancer\\" (which is Roger's theme) with excellent brass work by Entwislte and Roger alternating between relaxed phased and powerful delayed responses in vocal delivery. Next is \\"Is It In My Head\\" (which was recorded with Glyn Johns in 1972) and helps explain Jimmy's plight more convincingly. We close disc one with the rocker \\"I've Had Enough\\" which saw Jimmy snap after seeing a fellow Mod with his lover and smashing his scooter.<br />\\"5:15\\" begins the second disc and was the single released from the album in the UK. This rock radio staple tells of Jimmy's train ride to Brighton. The dynamic \\"Sea and Sand\\" tells of Jimmy trying to relive his past while in Brighton and recalling fights with his family and Roger sings most of the track sans the \\"jacket is going to be cut\\" parts sung by Townshend. The rocker \\"Drowned\\" (featuring Chris Stainton on piano) is next and is a barnstorming rocker which sees Jimmy in wanting to commit suicide. We then come to \\"Bell Boy\\" (Keith Moon's theme) which has Daltrey on \\"the beach is a place...\\" partsand the late Keith Moon singing the rest as the former Mod turned bell boy at a hotel he had smashed while he was a Mod.<br />The last half of disc two starts with ocean and wind and storm noises that signals the album's longest track \\"Doctor Jimmy\\" which uses the madman personality to describe Jimmy's personality here in the rocking sections. Then the \\"Is It Me\\" part was Entwistle's theme and is haunting and almost gentle. Then the track ends with a segue of synthesizers and piano noises which then leads into a reprise instrumental of the title cut called \\"The Rock\\" (this time the \\"Bell Boy\\" riff is in E Flat to blend with rest of the piece) which sees Jimmy take a boat out to a rock. We close with the album's US single \\"Love Reign O'er Me\\" (recorded with Glyn Johns in 1972) in which Jimmy finds out his true self and comes to grips on who he is. This track features Daltrey's best vocal performance going from quiet to powerful to screaming, The Ox's bass playing is stellar, Pete's guitar and keyboard work here is brilliant and the late Keith Moon's percussion and drumming is unearthly (especially the ending drum solo after Daltrey's closing \\"LOVE\\" scream).<br />Quadrophenia rightfully hit #2 in the US in late 1973 (only Elton John's Goodbye Yellow Brick Road kept Quadrophenia from #1 in the States) and went Platinum. Many Who fans (including myself) have claimed Quadrophenia to be their best album.<br />In July of 1996, MCA Records re-released the album with a new mix by Jon Astley and supervised by Pete whom wasn't happy with the original mix (as he was exhausted from the sessions plus firing original manager Kit Lambert over a number of issues (he was replaced by Bill Curbishley, still manager today)). The 1996 mix is excellent (although the original mix was superb in my view and has some things not on remix and vice versa). Also the remixed/remastered CD contains the original photo booklet that came with the original vinyl LP.<br />Now in 2011, the album gets the Deluxe treatment which has the 1996 remix given a 2011 remaster which sounds almost identical to Bob Ludwig's remaster from 1996 but Side 3 gets split up at the end of CD 1 so it ends with \\"Drowned\\". Then CD 2 begins with \\"Bell Boy\\" and goes through Side 4 (a little getting used to but not griping). Also you get eleven demos which are early versions of \\"The Real Me\\", \\"Cut My Hair\\", \\"The Punk and the Godfather (called Punk)\\", \\"The Dirty Jobs\\", \\"Anymore\\" (which wasn't on the original album), \\"I've Had Enough\\", \\"Drowned\\", \\"Is It Me (which would be incorporated into Dr Jimmy)\\" then we close with \\"Doctor Jimmy\\" and \\"Love Reign O'er Me\\". Plus you get two booklets one which is the original photo album then another booklet with the essay, lyrics and credits plus a foreword from Pete Townshend and also Pete's notes on his demos.<br />RECOMMENDED!e Keith Moon singing the rest as the former Mod turned bell boy at a hotel he had smashed while he was a Mod.

B000UJ48VI|5.0|Black comedy is an art form. Stanley Kubrick is a fantastic director of such darkly humourous films. LOLITA, along w/ DR. STRANGELOVE, are among the best examples of this often misunderstood genre. The very definition of black comedy / humour, is the utilization of subjects that simply aren't supposed to be \\"funny\\" in ridiculous / absurd ways. Of course STRANGELOVE uses the cold war threat of nuclear holocaust in the same way that CATCH-22 uses blind opportunism and blithering bureaucracy during World War 2. LOLITA takes pedophilia and turns Humbert Humbert (James Mason) into a hopelessly obsessed buffoon. I found myself howling at his relentless, insane compulsion. Peter Sellers is equally silly, in a sinister sort of way, as the loathsome Claire Quilty. Sue Lyons is perfect as the title character, quietly leading Humbert to his destruction (at least in his mind). Shelley Winters plays Lolita's mum, Charlotte w/ imbecilic glee. LOLITA (at least Kubrick's version) isn't meant as a serious treatise on the hideous life of a pedophile. It is a comedy about obsessive, forbidden \\"love\\" gone mad. We are supposed to laugh at Humbert's folly, in spite of our better judgement...

B0015HZAK2|4.0|U2 was so much better at the beginning of their career. This is a classic album of some of their best work, live. What could be better?
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This is outstanding for a free app! It is very well written and has many options. Very similar layout to a Windows program I already use called \\"inSSIDer\\".

B003L77G8I|5.0|The best show on air, great story lines. Loved it.  Love the way the cast work together.  Hope they keep up the  great mix between the characters.
B005GVA2L0|3.0|I've given this disc about 5 listens, and the same sensation keeps popping up: this just feels forced.  The emotions, the song structures, everything.  Don't get me wrong.  It's still much better than 90% of the hard rock radio groups out there now.  But that's not saying anything.  Unfortunately, Amy Lee set the bar very high with the debut, Fallen, which is still an incredibly strong record nearly a decade later.  In the beginning, the emotions that bled through Evanescence's music felt genuine.  But now, not so much.  And a number of songs on here just don't get off the ground.  This is a little disappointing, but there are still some powerful tracks like \\"My Heart is Broken\\", \\"Lost in Paradise\\", and \\"Swimming Home\\".  What makes \\"Swimming Home\\" so compelling is that it's the one of the few tracks to break away from the formulaic sound that is now Evanescence.    If you're going to get this album, get the Deluxe version.  Inexplicably, those songs were left off the regular disc.  Shouldn't have been the case.  \\"Disappear\\" and \\"Secret Door\\" are very good too.  This album is a step down from \\"The Open Door\\" and a steep decline from \\"Fallen\\".  Perhaps this is just the law of diminishing returns when you go to the same well one too many times.  I certainly hope Lee has a long, prosperous career in music, because her voice is vibrant and rich.  I just think this album could've been so much more.
B006E531X8|4.0|I got this set for Christmas and overall I was pleased with the box set. My only complaint is that the single \\"Comfortably Numb\\" is edited and is not the full version. You get Roger's verses and then Dave's and then the song goes directly to the guitar solo amd done. So I was definitely not too happy with that. It seems that the other songs are the full versions minus the sound effects, which was fine with me.  I think the price of the set is a little on the high side for just 3 singles, a spindle, a poster and an edited vesion of Comfortably Numb. I could do without the spindle and please give me the full version of CN, regardless if that's what was released to the general public over in Japan!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I use this app every day. It allows me to listen to stations of a specific genre from around the world. The recommended stations are usually right on in terms of my taste. If you listen to radio this is a great app to use. I have encountered a few stations that do not allow broadcasts through the app, but there are so many choices that I don't find that to be a deal breaker. Besides, that is the station's choice, so that is not the developer's fault.
B000JJRIP2|5.0|This is definately the ultimate collection for the serious KISS fan.<br />You get ALL the live recorded concerts in one purchase at a great price.<br />It's also cool that each Alive version as well as the Millineum version are on just one disc each instead of being divided up on two like the original versions.One disc,one complete concert.<br />This is definately the way to go.<br />I also like the booklet that comes with it.It's got some great pics in it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love it! It really helps keep me organized. Love that it synge from my phone, kindle, and computer. I use it all the time.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have this on my HTC Incredible smartphone ... now on my Kindle Fire.  It is extremely easy to use and has many key features which are helpful in navigating.  The devotional and reading plans are both diverse (functionally) and right on target for the many purposes.

B004PAHZMC|4.0|My son and I really like this item for his Lego Star Wars pieces. It's nice and sturdy, colorful and a great play board. However they could have made this a little bigger.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|own this game on PC and its great. would love to play on android as well but freezes constantly on galaxy nexus (ICS). Please fix!
B005PTQPU0|5.0|This is a really special album.<br />My favorites are 1)Misty 2)Snowflake and 3)Lake Tahoe.<br />Kate has always included her family in the musical process and<br />this time we get the treat of her son singing lead on Snowflake.<br />The song is magical.  Her son sings from the perspective of a snowflake falling to earth, and Kate is very soothing<br />and reassuring that she will catch him.  It's pure magic.<br />For me the only low point is the inclusion of Elton John.<br />I do not dislike Elton; yet, the song is too boring for me.<br />If Kate were to duet with someone I'd much prefer it had been with either Andrea Bocelli or perhaps<br />Stevie Wonder...you know, something unexpected.<br /><br />Kate is the last of the true originals working today, and I can't wait to see what she and her son come up with next!
B000AMJC2K|5.0|Purchased for home use.  This is a real value for clearing desk clutter.  I'll admit it - I'm a messy desk guy & need space for stacks of stuff.  There's a little 'chatter' (vibration) when swinging the arm. But it holds position perfectly - and I move the monitor around quite a bit.  Up-down adjustment is a little awkward, but once I found 'my' height I haven't changed height anyway.  Appears heavily built with well designed/constructed joint architecture & easy install.  If you find lower price, remember to check shipping charges.
B000BT97AO|4.0|The disk played just fine, however I had been nervous about the multiple scratches on the back.  Overall, a good purchase.

Jeff Kinney's characters are funny and memorable. Get the boxset for your child, or just get this one. They will love it!
0439813786|5.0|I'm a Brian Selznick fan. After reading Wonderstruck, I had to read the Invention of Hugo Cabret. Only Brian Selznick can write about automaton, an orphan boy, a retired movie maker and a train station in Paris and create a wonderful story.<br />Through images and words, the story of Hugo is really the story of Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s, a filmmaker and how he is found by a little orphaned boy, living in the train station in Paris and the automaton that brings them together. Well researched and stitched together, this book has a bit of something for everyone.<br />Read this book with your child and then watch the wonderful movie adaptation.

B005D0RDKW|5.0|Unreal. Unwrapped this today. I just finished watching it. Great all around Rush show. I saw some reviews on I-tunes about Geddy's voice..Noticed nothing here..He sounds strong, very strong on the Blu-ray. The heart stopping pause rewind part for me is the encore. La Villa and Working Man are incredible. Alex throws down. Amazing stuff. I saw this show live but I have to say the Blu-ray captures Alex in a way that shows how capable he is on the guitar and how funny he is on stage. Amazing Blu-ray. A must for a hardcore Rush fan or anyone who wants to see an amazing band play live.

B005D9MUWY|5.0|I text heavily and hated Swype and the built in keyboards so much I was ready to chuck my Android and go back to my iPhone. Then a friend recommended SwiftKey X. This little app saved my Android from an untimely drowning! It makes up for my flying-fingers mistakes by being incredibly smart about word prediction. Normally, I hated word prediction because programs like Swype never got it right. With SKX I rarely ever have to go back and correct something it chooses. It allows you to choose your typing \\"style\\" - mine is rapid and clumsy - and adjusts itself accordingly. I cannot stress enough how easy this makes texting on an already keypad. After 6 months of using this app, I can think of no cons or caveats to post in this review - I give it 5 big fat stars!
0062101897|5.0|this book is not only fine in quality, but it tells everything you would want to know about the films.<br />If you want a \\"touch\\" experience then you must also purchase \\"Harry Potter Flim Wizardry\\"  which was done<br />by the people who made all the HP props.  There are actual mini props you can take out of this second book<br />(some are in sleeves) and some are glued to the pages.<br /><br />These two books sit on my coffee table and I have never been so pleased with anything in my life.

0321200683|5.0|Enterprise Integration Patterns are increasingly central to what I am doing on integration projects nowadays and how I am using them. It always depends on the context and technologies with which we are using the patterns. There have been many libraries and frameworks over the years to help with integration. But frequently the concepts behind the Enterprise Integration Patterns get transformed into some complex class hierarchies or objects that need to be wired together just so, and the original intentions and patterns are often lost. As a Java developer I am often forced from then on to focus on the low-level detail and some complex class library API, losing the bigger picture and patterns.  Many frameworks, like e.g. Apache Camel and enterprise service buses, like Fuse ESB, support the usage of enterprise integration patterns and watching the codebase, community, and number of components, technologies, and data formats grow massively as more and more developers have found frameworks like Apache Camel an ideal way to design, implement, and maintain the enterprise integration patterns, this awesome book has become the bible of enterprise integration patterns on which many of the concepts of Apache Camel are based. That's why... it should not be missed in any serious developer's technical library.

B003L77GRO|1.0|Series is great, however having a 3 minute ad for Homeland that is not skippable makes this set unwatchable.  I am paying for the discs so I don't have to watch ads.
B000CNFC76|4.0|I really enjoyed watching this film.  I'm not a fan of golf, particularly of watching golf.  But this film actually made me appreciate the game more. It's a nice (and true) story with characters you care about.  The pacing is good--they make golf seem almost fast-moving!  It's not one of those films that leaves you thinking about it for days after, but it is a very good film that will appeal to a wide variety of people.  (My 83 year old mother liked it, too!)

B000OVLBGC|5.0|This movie is just wonderful!  Great character development.  You see the evolution (or devolution, in one case) of the characters as they face unpleasant facts about the world they live in in East Germany.  It is also a profile in courage.  Your feelings change about the characters as they develop.  This is one of the best films of the decade.  Beautifully done!

0385523904|5.0|This is an excellent book about a country we really know so little about. When we think of \\"oppressive regimes\\" we often look to the middle east, but North Korea must be the most oppressive regime on the planet.  There is no access to foreign TV, radio or news, so the North Koreans have no idea what is happening in the rest of the world unless they risk a great deal to find out.  This book gives you a look inside.  It is as interesting as a novel, but extremely informative.  I couldn't put it down!

B003L77G6A|5.0|I love it!. Nice packaging, funny extras, excellent video quality even when is not blu ray.  Im currently buying more blurays than dvd's, but in the case of this tv shows, i dont think is necessary to have it on bluray, the audio in dvd is great and the video quality is really good (the only time you may see some compression is during the atoms animation between scenes). I have a 40 inches led tv and a 5.1 sounds system.

1932735410|4.0|This is a good starting PMP Exam Preparation book but I don't think you can completely rely on this book to pass the PMP Exam. It gives you very good foundation on the Project Management principles to get yourself ready for the exam.  I used a Power Exap Prep crash course for a refresher. Then I used this book as the primary reference. Finally I did 10-12 sample exams from `PMP Exam Prep: 1000+ Practice question by Christopher Scorodo'. All worked out well for me within 6 weeks of effort.  I rate this book high because I liked the content.
B004LWZWBU|5.0|You'd think a movie, based on something as low key as birdwatching, would be a tough sell to Hollywood. Folks tramping around remote areas, waiting, watching, sipping from thermoses to catch a glimpse of a single bird, yeah, not real up there on the excitement meter. This film delivers a whole lot of laid back moments and not a single high speed chase. Well... maybe I need to rephrase that, there are no hostage situations or shoot outs.<br /><br />Scenery and quirky characters abound. Steve Martin, Jack Black and Owen Wilson are perfectly cast and the acting is spot on. The interaction between characters is stellar and there is a bitter sweetness as each man comes to grip with the uniquely similar obsession to catch sight of elusive birds. Drama, depth of character, quirky editing, this story about men's secret passions and the lengths they will travel to plant a flag on a mountaintop, or a feather on a cap, is entertaining and inspiring. I loved this quirky, charming and character rich film.

B0062NAX1U|4.0|If you are reading reviews you are interested in seeing the movie. You  are also probably aware that the same guys who brought Fireproof produced and wrote Courageous. The Kendricks use their films to entertain, and share the importance of a relationship with God.  If you hate movies with messages or a moral, you aren't going to love this one, no matter how great the message, or the movie is.<br /><br />Films that are lower budget often look it. And films with a Christian theme are often cheesy. The Kendricks do a good job trying to avoid both of these pitfalls. The film contains a trace of each, but the storyline, the characters and the message help to make those details fall into the background.<br /><br />The message within the film is a convicting and clear call to be a man, a father, as God designed. I grew to care about the characters. The moments of intense emotion were broken with humor and feel good glimpses. Pacing was good with the movie clipping along and avoiding drag. There are even tense subplots to make for a few moments where I was on the edge of my seat. Overall, the story is a sad one tinged with lots of  hope. Do make sure you have tissues, I didn't and I definitely needed them.

B005MYEPXC|5.0|From the opening images of Paris the viewer knows that he is in for a classic Woody Allen experience. He has always worked at his best when he makes the setting of his tales a living breathing character, just as important in many ways as his lead actors. While he flirted with this in Annie Hall, it became all out love in Manhattan. New York City, misty, dusky, flowing with lights and life became Woody's greatest love, dwarfing his affections for his two female leads and in the end informing his character far more fully than either of them. He does it again in Paris, falling in love with the incomparable cultural and architectural history of the great city through his protagonist, played with great effect by Owen Wilson. Shedding his aw-shucks mannerisms for a more controlled, introspective performance he does a wonderful job portraying a man seeking his creative center amid a failing romance and what appears to be a series of delusional encounters with Paris' rich cast of creative luminaries. Ultimately he finds a new love, and thanks to the guidance of the friends he has made in his surreal experiences, begins to explore his boundaries as an artist. He finally realizes that the limits he had struggled with were entirely self imposed and that if he simply allows himself to have a little faith in his own abilities all things may be possible.
B00005JO9J|5.0|I ordered the season episodes because I saw it on TV and I was FAR behind but it was so GOOD, I had to know what happened to lead them up to the point in which I started watching. I am now have a new found LOVE for this show and will continue watching.

0307891372|5.0|Who actually needs a strategy guide to enjoy a game?  Well, for one, I don't normally purchase guides, but the in depth information included in this guide keeps you engrossed with the possibilities within the world of Skyrim.  All the potions, enchantments, need to know, or want to know information is here.  Your typical maps are included and complete to help orientate you to the world of Skyrim.  The real benefit though it to thumb through this at your leisure and decide just what you feel like doing.  Since everyone is bound to play this differently, there's so many combinations of what you can do (or not do) that this will help satisfy your curiosity with the gameplay.  Highly recommended as a supplemental reading, but recommend using this as a resource guide instead of a step by step / play by play guide - otherwise the world of Skyrim will lose it's mystery and luster.  Happy hunting!
B002BWP49C|1.0|Breaking Dawn sucked the life out of the Twilight saga.  There is hardly anything good that I can say about this film.  It is sad because I enjoyed Twilight, New Moon and Eclipse (especially). The last installment ruined the saga.  As for those who have given this film 5 stars, I'd like to know what medication you were taking before seeing it.  I sure wish I had something to ease the pain while I viewed it.  It was needed.  Since I've slammed this film so hard, I feel it only fair that I list reasons why I hated it so much.  Listed below are a few:  1.  The movie drags on way too long.  There is a wedding, a honeymoon, a pregnancy, a horrible delivery, a short battle and a death.  Why do 6 scenes have to take over 2 hours? As the movie finally neared its ending, it was hard for me to keep my eyes open (Perhaps not as hard as it was for Bella, but hard.)   2.  There was no joy in this movie.  It was a \\"downer\\".  How the producer/director managed to make a honeymoon depressing is beyond me.  Yet, it was.  Take my word for it.  3.  Many scenes made no sense.  Throughout the Twilight series, the point was made that the vampires should not be seen in the sunlight because they \\"sparkle\\".  Right? Yet, we have a vampire groom, his vampire family, and invited vampire guests (someone's  contact lenses looked like they were going to pop out of their heads) all attending a wedding that takes place outdoors (What idiot planned that?) on a sunny day without any of them twinkling one bit.  Now, that was a neat trick!    Then you have a scene where blood is stored in the customary plastic packets at the Cullen household for Bella's use.  In New Moon, Jasper went crazy over a paper cut on Bella's finger.  Here, he is surrounded by packets of blood and just needs to leave the room when one is whipped out for Bella to drink (disgusting)! Seriously?  4.  Wolves look fake.  Well, I didn't expect them to look 100% real, but they looked a whole lot better in New Moon and Eclipse.  They are smaller (almost the size of regular wolves) and in this movie they talk.  Yep, you hear wolf conversations.  I had to stifle a laugh.  Why not have the wolves talk when in human form?  Seems like a better choice to me.    5.  No chemistry between Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson.  I know these two are supposed to be a couple in real life, but on screen they do not sizzle.  They don't even simmer.  There is no passion.  The only chemistry I saw between the leads was the friendship between Kristen Stewart and Taylor Lautner.  I have to say the scene where Jacob dances with Bella and learns of her honeymoon plans was the best in the movie.  It seemed real.  They seemed to care about each other.  Sadly, this took place about 15 minutes into the movie.  It definitely was not enough to keep me from yawning the rest of the time it played.  6.  The dialogue.  I know the actors (especially TL) have been slammed by critics for their performances (for the most part), but I cannot blame them 100%.  I don't think Anthony Hopkins could have delivered some of the lines they were given convincingly.  A lot of the dialogue was just stupid.  7.  The controversial, gruesome birth scene.  It was disturbing to watch but not powerful.  If this scene were true to life, there would have been hysteria, ear-piercing screaming, and probably violence.  I think Jacob would have literally hopped over the table and lunged for Edward's throat when all was said and done.  Yet, none of the above takes place. The scene was not realistic.  8.  Best characters hardly had a line.  Why were Billy Burke and Gil Birmingham limited to a few lines?  Billy and Charlie are important characters (and enoyable ones).  They were lucky to have a couple of sentences between them.  Very sad.    9.  The end of the movie was depressing.  I'm not sure it was supposed to be.  I guess some people enjoyed how it ended and are looking forward to the next installment, but I'm not one of them. I came away from the moviewith the feeling the leads all made bad choices, and, sadly they would have to live with them forever.  That definitely brought me down.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone, especially to teenagers.  Moms, this is definitely not a movie that an impressionable teenage girl should see.

B004S82OAE|4.0|We determined that the print and Kindle copies of this book have different content.  I know I'm \\"breaking the rules\\" with this review by referring to a previous review.  I think it's justified in this case.  Thanks to Daniel's review, we looked into the errors for answers for some problems in Chapter 5 and found the following:  1. Based on the published errata list at the Sybex site, the print copy I purchased in Dec 2011 is at least \\"print run 3\\".    2. As of Dec 2011, the Kindle edition is apparently equal to \\"print run 1\\".  The copy Daniel downloaded has errors in answers to Chapter 5 problems, and the free sample I downloaded from Amazon has an error in the answers for a Chapter 1 problem.  According to the errata at the Sybex site, both were fixed after print run 1.  So, regardless of whether you buy a Kindle copy or print copy of the 7th edition, check the errata at the Sybex site.  Using the errata for the problems in Chapter 5 is a good way to determine what print run you have.    As for my review of the book's actual content - I think Lammle's book is much easier to read than Odom's two-book CCNA set, although I like Odom's better because he provides additional detail.  If I could afford only one or the other, I'd buy Lammle's book.  Be aware though, if you're a Linux or Mac gal or guy, that the programs he includes on CD are Windows-only.  Haven't tried them with wine (the program...).

030788743X|3.0|I so badly wanted to get lost in this book. Great reviews drew me too it. Strong premise and the 80's nostalgia suited me well. Problem is, it starts out slow and except for a brief glimpse of action about 1/3rd of the way, it sputtered in the middle and finally pulled up the nose for an ok landing.  Overall good effort but can't go beyond 3 stars.
B0013D8LOK|5.0|Amazing music is in this movie. I love Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter, they did such a great job in this musical.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|We purchased this saga for Christmas for our 5 year old son who has become quite a Star Wars junkie!  The movies are amazing on Blu-Ray, the colors and the sound effects.  We have only completely watched Return of the Jedi but are anxiously awaiting watching them all, as well as the three bonus films!  Highly recommend this item if you love Star Wars!

B0063IH60K|5.0|It is everything you expect from solitaire on a touch screen.  It adapts to your style of control, responds quickly, and is not so touchy that it is hard to play.  This is not a flashy app but for a great game of solitaire, this implementation is hard to beat.
1439152799|3.0|I love Kate Morton--she is just awesome.  I devoured House at Riverton & The Forgotten Garden.  Distant Hours is my third Kate Morton book.  I was expecting a book that was as good as the other two.  I was somewhat disappointed.  If I hadn't read her other two, I probably would have given this book another star.  It is just not her best.  It is well written and the characters are well fleshed out.  The story is a bit odd and the ending is, frankly, a bit unbelievable, but not to the point that it makes the story ridiculous, or the reader want to toss the book and shout, \\"I waited for that!\\"  On the other hand, the characters are not as likable, or interesting as the characters from her previous novels and the main character is very, well....long winded.  I think the editor could have cut out 25% of this book and it would have been easier to read and more of a page-turner.  I am still waiting for her next book, with eager anticipation.
B00650SSWG|5.0|hilarious, i laughed the whole time! i definitely recommend this movie to everyone who wants a romantic comedy!! i only rented the movie, but its really worth buying!
1416550534|5.0|This book takes you back in time, to a simpler time that was so different from our own.  This is so well written.  The author did her homework and manages to transport you, without bogging you down with too many details.  It is nostalgic, mysterious, bittersweet, and brilliantly written.  Imagine Gosford Park, but much, much better.  Loved, loved, loved!
B005QYKE2Y|1.0|Where to start....Well, firstly, why a national/world hero, who received a presidential medal, would be begging for a job? Anyone would hire him, if not for his skills, but in the very least, for publicity. John Malkovich's character was completely pointless and a waste of screen space (nothing against the actual actor, but he was poorly placed), ex: the red/yellow cup nonsense. Actually, about 30-40 minutes of the entire movie could've be easily taken out for the sheer god awful humor. Secondly, what is the purpose of Rosy's character? She is nothing but a piece of a** without any real functionality. Her relationship with Sam is not believable at all. I never bought for a second that they were in love and, in his words, she was \\"the one\\". At least Megan Fox was useful, she didn't just offer support to fight Deceptacons and help Sam, we could see their relationship grow and develop from high school acquaintances to full blown romance. But this woman was either flaunted as Sam's mandatory love interested or needed constant saving.<br /><br />Surely, the movie has a lot of good special effects, but no actual plot, character development, humor, and believable romance. Sam keeps whining about the same things he did in the first film, except that now he should've grown up a bit.
B003L77GGK|5.0|Cant go wrong with the Supernatural series. Especially if you like to watch the episodes whenever you want. Ive enjoyed the series and hope it keeps going!

B005OOL1IC|4.0|Not as good as the first but still a great movie for anyone that likes to party! I have watched it multiple times.
B003UESJEM|3.0|...this movie is a bit exaggerated in some places and too preachy in others. One wonders what Ben Affleck's compensation was in comparison to, let's say, a carpenter who worked on the set... What I found amusing, though, is how the wealthy Hollywood types are out of touch  with the real world. In the latter part of the film Ben Affleck gets an offer for an $80k a year and mentions that he used to make twice as much at this previous job. So let's see, here we have a guy who's been written as a $160k professional, and yet somehow he's living in an $850k house and drives a Porsche. That's stretching it a bit too thin.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|it is awesome it works perfect. it is so fun it never freezes luv it so much it does everything i want it to
B003ZSJ212|3.0|If you're a die hard fan who has the Star Wars saga released on every media thus far, then naturally you'll want to pick this up for the extra material discs and to see the scene changes that were made.  The Good:  - BluRay looks and sounds amazing if you have a decent sound system and High def TV.  - The artwork on the packaging is awesome.  - Lots of unreleased bonus material.  The Bad:  - The packaging looks great but is impracticable, the discs don't slide onto the normal spindles, they just sit in a cardboard sleeve. It's a project to get them out without touching the business side of the disc. (I'll be buying some BluRay cases to sidestep this.)  - No theatrical versions, if these versions were somewhere in the 40 hours of extra material, it would instantly be worth the money, but its not, so hang on to your VHS copies.
B0019UGYK0|5.0|The order was processed fast and accuartly the dvd arrived in good conditon. I would buy again I thought it worked well & hassle free.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|This is an excellent film.  Couldn't wait to get home from work to watch it. Hope there is a Season 3.
B003L77GG0|4.0|I just ordered Smallville season 10 and Thought is was a good deal at $20.99, however i realized after I ordered that best buy has it for $14.99 with free shipping this week. I wish I would have checked out their site first, I could have saved 6.00. Amazon usually has the best price. Would be great if they refunded me the difference but I doubt they will. I loved Smallville and the whole series was entertaining. Season 10 was a decent ending to a great show. Too bad they wouldn't come up with a Justice League series with all the super heroes that were on Smallville.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Thank you very much. I wanted this album so bad. Now I got it! The item is in great conditions. It feels like brand new. lol  :)

B001FB4W0W|5.0|I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and we watched it togerher before she had to go back to college. I am hooked ! I am a True Blood fan ! I loved it and I loved the soap opera drama with the serious playing vampires.  It was in a good many places a laugh a minute, but it is graphic nudity if you are thinking of buying it for your kids or some other young people. It is just fun but you will not have gained any intelligence from spending time watching these movies.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love Evernote simply for the reason that you have your notes accessible from anywhere : kindle,  phone, or PC. Also love the check box option for my to do lists! :)
B002VHI8FE|3.0|I have been reading reviews for other books, and the names Patrick Rothfuss and Joe Abercrombie kept coming up, so I decided to go ahead and buy the First Law trilogy. It's a decent enough story I guess, but I don't see why people keep talking this guy up. It has a lot of filler that doesn't really contribute very much to the story. It seems like there should be a mild climax during the second book, but it just kind of drags on. the action sequences are very special, except when he talks about the Bloody Nine, but even then it descends into a drone. People also talked about how gritty Abercrombie writes, but I don't see it. I guess if you mean he used the f-bomb alot, then you have that. If you like a story with a lot of meaningless jabber, then help yourself. The meat of meat of the story is good enough, but you could cut a whole book out of the trilogy and it would be more interesting.
B005HSL626|2.0|the game it self is... eh alright bit all you do is chop up fruits and avoid bombs its not the best app game ever. but other than that its good
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I was thouroughly impressed with this game quickly after I got it. It has both one and two player options. On one player you play against a computer of varying difficulty. Before you start the match, you can use the difficulty slider to change up the level of challenge. You can customize your name in the game and change the computer's. On two player mode you can change the names of both your players, and you can change the color that you each play. Whether it's playing against the computer or passing your device back and forth to a friend, I highly recommend this app.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|all you do is shoot birds at pigs but its an AWSOME game! it needs NO internet connection and is not a Good  game....... its a great game!
B006O5XYWG|5.0|It is on of the best movies I ever saw!! I mean by what right humans allowed to deal with as animals like they do in the movie and for real... never torment an animal as a joke because it feels like you the pain.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I like this version a lot better than the desktop and web versions. I only wish it had an auto-save feature and went into edit mode automatically.
0439023513|3.0|I really enjoyed the storyline of The Hunger Games trilogy but I have to say that this book wasn't nearly as much fun as the first two in this series.  The plot of this book seemed more contrived and drawn out than the plot of the other two, and I found myself skipping pages, just skimming them so that I could make it to the end of the book to find out what happens to the characters.  Still, if you're hooked on this series, this book is a must-read because the ending ties everything up pretty neatly and seems like a fitting conclusion to tale told in The Hunger Games books.
0553386794|5.0|really enjoyed this book.  might have even teared up once.  I was however dissapointed when it just... stopped! I would have liked more closure.
B00003CXDD|2.0|Our family saw the movie when it came out.  Our son loved it.  Grown up now, he wanted it for Christmas this year and I think he liked it as well now.  I was reminded of my disappointment in it.<br /><br />Lucas is no Tolkien or L. Frank Baum.  The first part leading up to Willow giving Madmartigan the baby is an example of terrible dialogue.  Inane and inanely acted, there is no life or sincerity in it.  The dialogue is straight out of a student's first attempt at playwriting.  The encounter with the caged Madmartigan isn't believable dialogue, and I don't think Val Kilmer believes it either.  Warwick Davis is out of his depth for much of the film.  He was better as an Ewok and the Brownies are no C3PO or R2D2 and exhibit a wide spectrum of wit from none to some.  The plot slogs through rehashed, even literally done, western mythology from Hebrew through Celtic and Medieval.  Not much invention there.  There are even genuine Celtic words mixed into the magic spells which are otherwise not very interesting gobbledygook.  (Examples: Tuatha and Avagddu (sic) - so both Gaelic Celtic and British Celtic are \\"covered.\\") Tolkien at least created languages with inner consistency and reality while basing them on real languages.<br /><br />The action scenes, when they arrive, are pretty well done and the slide down the snow on a shield is fun.  The special effects are Lucas' bread and butter and reflect where his real genius probably truly lies.<br /><br />Anyone with any knowledge of Western mythology and lore would find the whole film derivative and unoriginal.<br /><br />This movie is more like the subsequent Star Wars trilogy, especially Part I, than the original IV, V, and VI. The second maybe 2/3 of the film has redeeming qualities, so I give it 2 stars.
B000CNFC76|5.0|Bill Paxton has taken the true story of the 1913 US golf open and made a film that is about much more than an extra-ordinary game of golf. The film also deals directly with the class tensions of the early twentieth century and touches upon the profound anti-Catholic prejudices of both the British and American establishments. But at heart the film is about that perennial favourite of triumph against the odds.<br /><br />The acting is exemplary throughout. Stephen Dillane is excellent as usual. But the revelation of the movie is Shia LaBoeuf: After a career which to that point had been principally marked by his slap-stick performances in the children's programme \\"Even Stevens\\", LaBoeuf delivers a disciplined, dignified and highly sympathetic performance as a working class Franco-Irish kid fighting his way through the prejudices of the New England WASP establishment. And Josh Flitter as the ten year old caddy steals every scene in which he appears.<br /><br />A old fashioned movie in the best sense of the word: fine acting, clear directing and a great story that grips to the end - the final scene an affectionate nod to Casablanca is just one of the many pleasures that fill a great movie.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|Great DVD set. These movies were great to begin with. The Blu-Ray format really enhances that. The extras help too.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Downloaded for my Kindle Fire and my Droid X2. Does more than i expected, love that my account lists notes I make on both.
B004WGGQPQ|2.0|After really playing with this app for a few hours, I can recommend it for children up to about age 13 but for anyone with even a little creativity, this will surely frustrate you quickly. There are only 2 kinds of paint brush, there is no kind of blending feature and the stickers cannot be resized.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I have played this on the ipod and hated it.Now on a bigger screen I love it its the most used app on my kindle fire and I got my stepfather hooked on it too! we love this game I recommend it!
B00650SSWG|2.0|I was prepared to like this movie but I didn't get 10 minutes in until I turned it off. I'm not a prude but filthy language is never necessary if a movie is good on it's own merit and it instantly reduces the class of the movie and the actors. I would have expected better from Justin & Mila. I was disappointed.
157421327X|3.0|Zentangles are new to me and while I needed some direction on what they are and what to do with them, this book is really elementary.  I would suggest that prospective buyers go to on-line Zentangle sites and get free and varied patterns.
B005HSL626|5.0|The game is amazing. On my iPod, the free version is limited. Here, it's just ad supported, and having to press &quot;skip&quot; a few times doesn't make the game any worse!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|If you're a fan of GRRM and the Song of Ice and Fire series, this book will not disappoint.  Is it slow (as reviewers prior to me have stated)?  Yes, at times.  Does it focus on several characters for most of the book?  Yes, it does.  I believe GRRM knows where he's going, and the reduction in characters and narrowing of focus is on purpose.  Things are starting to come together, plot-wise.  This book reminded me of how Sanderson brought focus to the Wheel of Time series after it slowed down and the plot became too multi-threaded.  If you think you knew Tyrion and Danaerys and Jon before this book, well... you will get to know them even better.  To sum it up, I enjoyed the book very much.  It's not as fast-paced as previous installments and there aren't as many \\"momentous\\" events in the book but true fans of the series will think the investment well worth your time and $.
B005K17RU0|4.0|it is a great app. comprehensive contents and easy to use. but I cannot remove a location selected by accident .

I especially liked the facial expressions of Caesar and his body movements in many scenes (Caesar's body movements told you that he was in control).  I don't really watch movies over and over again, but this is one of those movies I will watch again.  I really wish I could give this movie 10 stars! GO CAESAR!!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Excellent cover, just as advertised. What I like the most about it, is that it is small and light and does not make the Fire bulkier, which was a concern.     I have the leather cover (for the older Keyboard Kindle) and honestly I prefer this cover. Its lighter, less obstructive, yet protective.   And the stand works fine.
B005HI7NP0|5.0|This CD is nothing short of superb.  The lyrics are mature, smart and original.  The production quality is stellar and Betty Wright is an incredible talent.  If you are looking for real music, then look no further and buy this CD.  She should get a grammy for it.  I love it.
B004BSFC46|5.0|Oh sooo perfect for long car rides and just very stimulating for the babies! Helps them explore their world. High contrasting colors are better for them to see.
0060566108|5.0|This work from team Collins/Porras is a fine book and  a must read for any business savy person or executive  interested in tuning in to some basic and yet essential  precepts on keeping ahead of the inevitable changes  and cycles that consume so many companies and industries.  History both recent and a little more distant examine  what ideologies allowed for companies to flourish  innovate, and prosper as well as as those mindsets  that lead to stasis , complancency , and ultimate  ruin.  This book is serves simply a repository for fresh idea  and as a warning to this who will not be disposed  to learn.
B004BSFC6Y|5.0|My older grandchilds mom had these for her baby and my son just loves them for his son?  Good for helping kids find their world!
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Purchased for my love for Christmas along with other items. This is by far her favorite. She loves Buble, took her to his concert this summer for our anniversary and after seeing him live I have come to enjoy his music.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Very clear and useful presentation of weather conditions on Kindle. GPS data on Kindle Fire would make it a bit bandied, but as long as you know where you are, this is a good tool.
B003L77GH4|5.0|This was a great deal! I was so mad because walmart ran out so quick on black Friday but I got it for almost the same price on amazon. I got it quick and have already watched the whole season. I will definitely be using amazon again for future purchases!
B005ETA5K2|1.0|I received this item about a month and a half ago and it worked great. Now for some reason it doesn't pick up the same network that it's been ON since receiving this item--it just fell flat and doesn't work anymore. I CAN access the network with my built in wireless card on my laptop, SO I know its not a problem with the router--its with the ALFA adapter. I would NOT recommend this item if you needed an adapter to work more than a month or two, or one that works at all .Please only buy this item if you're ready to be disappointed.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I liked this app very much in the beginning but then after about 40 levels it just got really boring and I stopped playing it. But overall great app.
B0000CABJ1|5.0|Pulled out this CD today and it made me want to write a review on it. Some many great memories I have with Donna Summer. A great voice, a great singer and the diva of dance...bar none. This CD is full of classic memories and pop radio smash hits. Cannot recommend it enough. There were great divas like Roberta Kelly, Linda Clifford and France Joli that are highly recommend too. Check these out.  [[ASIN:B003TXAGG8 Witch Of Love]]  [[ASIN:B000005DM5 France Joli - Greatest Hits]]  [[ASIN:B005E31CXW I'll Keep On Loving You]]  [[ASIN:B004N3NFLQ Trouble Maker]]
B0064T6LV8|5.0|This game is the perfect game to play almost anywhere. I loved it so much that I bought the game myself. You are golng to LOVE it.
B004SC8XHI|5.0|good driving music.  in the background and not overpowering.  if you like booker t, this is a good cd to buy.
B005V20JKI|1.0|the games not even downloading on my device and its really making me POed so ill write another review if u fix that.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|i finished the trilogy in less than 2 weeks. the books kept you so entertained! it will make you gasp, laugh, and even cry. i would definitely recommend this book.
0345505387|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. I found it quite entertaining, but the problem I had was that they introduced a character that needed a bit more explanation then what was provided. All in all, I liked seeing what my favorite characters could look like, even I have a slightly different image of Jamie. I found the book a good change from the series and different point of view is always well worth a good read. Definitely read this book, even if you borrow it from the library!
B006FS22Y8|3.0|I grew up listening to quite a bit of 1950's & 1960's R&B & Soul (my parents' record collection), and aside from a few of the lyrics, this album would rank as average when I compare it to standard soul music. Don't get me wrong, it is worth the current special price of $4.99 for the download, and her voice is very good.<br />If anything, the magic of it is that she reminds us of the importance of quality singing (rather an overproduced auto-tuned pop songs).<br />I hope that younger listeners realize the tragedy of her young life, and don't just find it funny because of the jokes they hear on TV.
0307155102|5.0|MY CHILDREN HAD THIS BOOK WHEN THEY WERE LITTLE AND ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT NOW THAT I HAVE GRANDCHILDREN I DECIDED TO BUY THE BOOKS FOR THEM FOR CHRISTMAS,.....I KNOW THEY WILL LOVE THE BOOK JUST AS MUCH
B002VPE1WK|5.0|very nice item,i used to have a lowepro bag but it got stolen , i got this item that is almost 1/3 of the price,but doesnt compromise quality and function, i just love it!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|The complete set is perfect gift! It came in a wonderful hard case not the normal paper cover but had all 8 discs in one hard case.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Easy to use. Works just like the real card game. I do enjoy playing the game, especially when waiting in long lines.
B003L20IJM|5.0|We saw this Nanny McPhee movie and then saw the first one.  This one is soooooo much better!!  We now own it and are glad to be able to watch it whenever we want!!  Lots of laughs and a great wholesome movie!!
B005TBN3EU|1.0|I had great hopes for this movie, but was seriously disappointed. It's hard to believe that you can take the cast from the original Hangover, one of the funniest movies of all time, place them in a similar scenario and produce a movie so awful that fully one-half of all viewers give it a ONE STAR rating.<br /><br />WARNING: ADULT SUBJECT MATTER....I place the majority of the blame on a thoroughly lousy \\"plot\\" and dialog that contains numerous wince-inducing, downright revolting scenes which are completely devoid of any real humor. For example: One of the main characters is the drunken (but willing) recipient of anal sex by a female impersonator and then, to make matters even worse, we are treated to several shots of the offending \\"equipment\\" and a graphic discussion of the exchange of fluids that occurred. Are there really people in the world who consider this to be hysterically funny? There weren't any around when I saw the movie, unless groans of disgust and asking for refunds are a new type of laughter.<br /><br />Such humorless sensory shocks are delivered repeatedly, until you are almost (mercifully) numb, and then, just when you thought your suffering might be over, Mike Tyson shows up to deliver the single worst, most off-key, god-awful rap performance in the history of recorded sound. If this movie were shown in a prison, it would be considered cruel and unusual punishment. Instead, it is foisted on the public by a group of people who HAD to realize just how awful it was, and yet released it anyway....for money.<br /><br />As my other reviews will indicate, I am no prude and love a good gross-out if it is hysterically funny, but disgusting, juvenile dialog and behavior without any redeeming humor are simply disgusting....and definitely not worth your time and money. BOTTOM LINE: When half the viewers give a movie a one-star rating, you really should heed their warning.
B004WGGQPQ|3.0|hmm its ok and stuff but its not the best thing.. I would recommend getting it though.also its just really entertaining
B005TBN04S|2.0|I'm assuming anyone who watched Hangover II has watched the first Hangover movie, which I found hilarious.  The second installment of the Hangover, is so bad it can't even be classified as a comedy, and I mean that sincerely.  This movie could be a second rate action movie, but to classify it as a comedy is false advertising.<br /><br />The boys are back, Bradley Cooper(Phil), Ed Helms(Stu), Doug(Justin Bartha) and last, and with the worse acting gig in the history of acting, Alan(Zach Galifianakis), but the all the good scriptwriters seem to have taken a vacation.<br /><br />I found Alan to be so repulsive as to be unbelievable, and the fact that Phil, Stu trust him again, is beyond the pale.  Of course they get in trouble again by way of Alan, or there wouldn't be a movie, but maybe that's the point, there shouldn't have been another movie, or maybe it should have been from the ladies point of view this time, anything other than what happened in this movie.<br /><br />In the first movie, Alan's pranks were charming, in this second movie, he is so out there, that all I could think is that he should be put in a mental institution for the criminally insane.  Zach's character is so toxic, that it was all I could do to watch him on the screen.  Didn't he read the script?  Isn't part of being talented, being able to imagine how your character will turn out?  I don't know if I'll ever be able to watch this man in a movie again.<br /><br />---spoiler alert-----<br /><br />The addition of Stu's finance's brilliant little brother might have been a nice touch, except that they had him lose a finger and that allowed this brilliant musician, and aspiring surgeon to bond with the 'wolf pack' idiots, allowing him to smile for the first time in his life.  What????<br /><br />Then there's the ending, Stu's finance's father hates him, as well the man should.  Stu is the coward he's accused of being, and when he finally stands up to his future father-in-law, the man accepts him, as if being and a** makes a person more noble.  Why Stu's fiance even considered dating him in the first place, is unbelievable to the extreme.<br /><br />Save your money, and the valuable time you'll never get back by watching something other than this 'made-for-money' sequel of a truly funny movie.<br /><br />I wish I would have downloaded a photo of Bradley Cooper and just stared at it for 2 hours instead . . .if being and a** makes a person more noble.  Why Stu's fiance even considered dating him in the first place, is unbelievable to the extreme.<br /><br />Save your money, and the valuable time you'll never get back by watching something other than this 'made-for-money' sequel of a truly funny movie.<br /><br />I wish I would have downloaded a photo of Bradley Cooper and just stared at it for 2 hours instead . . .
B000I5XOVY|5.0|Wow! Hard to believe this movie was shot 10 years ago. Looks amazing in blu-ray! 5 stars because the plot and cast were great.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|it was great
0316098329|5.0|This book was not what I expected, but in a good way.  I loved that the book is narrated from the point of view of the little boy.  Most of the terrifying details were left to the reader's imagination, and the story was told in an unexpected way.  I really enjoyed the story, and it was a very quick and easy read.  I couldn't put it down.
B005974CNA|5.0|Any true fan of DreaM TheateR would know that MP did not write DT music...helped. His drums are second to none but MM plays with his own fervor adding a challenge to drummers young and old. Something MP hasn't done in a while. The fact that John Myung and JL composed a lot of these songs tells us that Dream Theater has been held back for quite sometime. I miss MP but I have to admit this album rocks. It is a true Master Piece and destined to become a classic. Truly 5 Star worthy.
B005HSL626|2.0|I think this game was ok but it crashed on my kindle fire so I say just buy the full version! its ono a dollar for goodness sake!
B004RJMUJO|5.0|My sister introduced me to Fruit Ninja and I've played it non-stop since I bought it. The controls are foolproof,  you just drag your finger to slice. The app itself hasn't given me any problems. It's very responsive and quick and there have been no crashes. Overall, it's a very smooth little game. It's definitely worth a dollar, and if you're like me, you'll get a lot of use out of it.
B005N1E8A4|4.0|I loved the dancing, the singing and Kylie herself. I could not watch the 3-D but it's as close as you will get to that.... seeing it in blu-ray.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This is an excellent 3 disc set that captures John Adam's life and the history that was unfolding at that time. It keeps you entertained, you can't put the next disc in fast enough to continue. Through the photography and costumes you get a spellbinding historical drama that draws you in, and when you come to the last disc you want the story to continue!
0062024329|1.0|i've read the alchemist before (and would rate it 5* any day) but I wanted to download the graphic novel version (the illustrated comic book edition). The link did not download the graphic novel version but gave me the original alchemist instead! Why show a kindle edition link when you dont have the kindle edition for the comic version amazon? just ate up my $9.99!
B0058VW36U|5.0|Awesome game. its simple, and easy to learn. the game is consistantly adding new twists, just enough it keep it fun. it has about 250 lvls, so it'll last for a while. Have fun!
B001IYCMNA|1.0|Device would not stay online long enough to program. Network connection dropped after being plugged in for 5-666 seconds. Sent to Cisco for replacement.
B003Z2LAAO|1.0|It was the worst movie I have ever seen. I was getting so bored every second. I wish i haven't bought this movie. i would not recommend anyone to buy.
B005TQAI6G|5.0|Yeah!! I went to the femme fatale tour! and I was still waiting 4 this DVD I saw this DVD on a TV from 42\\", I thought that I was here again!! I love Britney!! I'm ur biggest fan!! I'm a collector! XOXO
B000E5N62U|2.0|When did Donal Fagin become a lounge act? From the fury and brilliance of Kid Charlemagne, to the wit and poetry of Nightfly to THIS? You can count on the following; lazy bass line, some muffled horns, laid back guitar, etc. etc. etc.....ZZZZZZZZZZ. This was a phone in of an album, no difference among the songs and a major disappointment. Fagin has been heading in this direction for a while but this is a major drop in quality. If he's not interested in exploring musically anymore he should just quit and find a beach. I kept measuring these songs against Any Major Dude, or the entire album of Aja for Gods sake, and wanted to pinch myself. Yes, I think it's that bad.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|faster with your fingers and love the boards I'm addicted in just one level I'll probably not sleep much tonight
B005I6EVUG|2.0|It is a great item, however, it smells really bad.  I have tried to 'air' it out but to no avail.  I will call customer service tomorrow and ask for a replacement.
B005EN779A|5.0|As a drummer, and artist, this movie is pure genius.<br /><br />The very beginning will instantly grab you with creative brilliance. I enjoyed it so much I don't want to give anything away. Bottom line, if you are a drummer, watch this.
B004LWZW4C|3.0|It was interesting to learn how they all came about if you were not the type of person who read all the comics. However there was many parts that seemed slow and the amount of action in the movie was sort of lacking and corny. Some of the other X-men movies set the bar much higher and even though this was a decent movie, just didn't measure up in my opinion.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Great price for the entire set of Harry Potter in Blu Ray! I popped in the earlier movies to see the quality and it was great. The additional features were great to watch as well.
0857680986|5.0|Even after over 60 years, no one has fashioned a better book on figure drawing for the illustrator than this one. The methods are practical and easy to follow, and even though it was written generations ago, most of the advice to aspiring and working professionals is as useful today as it was then.  You simply can't go wrong with this book!
0439023521|5.0|Suzanne Collins creates an incredible world in which young people (age 13 - 18) each year must celebrate the salavation of their communities by offering up a boy and a girl from each to participate in a game to the death with but one survivor each year. The competition is broadcast on television outlets to each community. The trilogy of books are violent (not recommended for the very young although included in the Youth Section for books)but they also tell a story of courage, perserverance and empathy as Katness Everdeen, the central character, seeks to survive not once or twice but three times.  Once started, it was nearly impossible to stop reading any of the three books until the conclusion of the final installment and then I still wanted more. Ms. Collins has created a modern day classic, broad in its scope but intimate in its detail.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Books 4 and 5 of this series became somewhat tedious reading, this being Book 5 (as indicated by the author, books 4 and 5 was originally one book but divided into two due to its length).  George R. R. Martin strayed a little too far from the original characters, fleshing out peripheral characters introduced in books 1 through 3.  In doing so he made the story difficult to follow and quite honestly not all that entertaining.  The portions of the books that pay attention to the remaining Starks, the Lannisters and the Dragon Queen are interesting but the others should have remained in the background.  I really enjoy his unpredictability with what happens to the characters but he leaves the development of those stories for far too long, making it extremely difficult to remember what was happening to them when last heard from. Martin's efforts to create this magical world became far too ambitious with a disappointing result. I am still looking forward to future books but hope he returns to the formula that made books 1 through 3 so successful.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|this is a great game but it doesn't work on my phone.  please fix this and I will fix my review.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|It is okay but I wish they started you out with more games. But its okay in the end. :/
B006O66EFE|5.0|I have been waiting to see the movie since it came out in the movies. After watching this film again I must say this is the best movie of 2011. Watch it now.
B0063IH60K|5.0|The perfect time waster! Woooooooo! Many options and loads of fun for everyone in the family and including any other relatives!
B004EPZ03O|5.0|This movie was Amazing!! For a moment in time I was taken back to my childhood. I laughed, I cried, I sang along and still find myself singing the ending song driving my kids crazy! Having seen EVERY Muppet movie, cartoon and even the TV show put out there I sometimes find myself disappointed with post Jim Henson Death movies where they just don't capture the true Muppets but Jason Segel hit it right on the nose and I was transformed back in time to my childhood.<br /><br />Side Note: My children loved this movie too so I highly recommend it for all ages! If you don't lie this movie there is something seriously wrong with you!
B004T32SOK|1.0|I have dropbox on my iphone and 2 computers. this is does not sync with the other app. cant we all just get along? it would be so much more efficient...
B000P5K6BS|5.0|The original B'Day is perfect but the deluxe has more tracks. I love the Spanish stuff and the cut of \\"Get Me Bodied [Extended Mix]\\" so those alone makes this purchase worth it.
B0000844M8|5.0|\\"Born Free\\" is a true classic!  The interested reader can refer to the many reviews for details about the movie!  It is excellent viewing for families, children, etc.  There are a few moments in which the movie drags along - making it boring at those moments for children of 2011.  that's when adults can engage children with questions about the film, characters, lions, savannah, etc., until it picks back up.  films were a bit longer back in 1970 than 2011.  it is made well.  it is not like many of current movies - 15 second longer camera shots per viewing, fine film, smooth transitions ... that's part of what makes it great.  everyone who knows me knows that i assign a grade to everything which i review.  this film, in my opinion, merits a grade of \\"A-\\".  I recommend this film for families, children, students of cinematography, etc.
B001IFZL50|5.0|Nice addition to my Blu-Ray collection.  This is one of the best series of the past decade.  I also recommend the book of this same title.
B005MIYI3K|5.0|Brilliant arrangements and great musicianship combined with an interesting thyme. Anette's voice fits the material and seems more of an integral part of the band on this release.  This one has some incredible dynamics and the material really varies.  My favorites are \\"I want my Tears Back\\" which feels like a progression from \\"Wish I had an Angel\\"  and \\"Imaginaerum\\" which seems to be a summary of everything covered in this deep, wide ranging effort.  The materials ranges from the epic to some songs which have a baroque feel to them.  There are even a few songs that sound like the type of sea chanty you would hear in a Pirates of the Caribbean movie.  The second instrumental disc really illustrates the beauty and depth of the arrangements. If he was born in a different era Tuomas would have been another Wagner or Beethoven.   This album seems to show that they are completely over Tarja's departure.  Anybody who likes Symphonic Metal or Symphonic Rock will be overjoyed with this awesome effort.
B004WR125O|4.0|I purchased this Onkyo wireless dongle for my Onkyo TX-NR609 receiver.  So far it works great, the reception is pretty good (average of 60-70% reception of my wireless signal from a wireless router in another room), and no hiccups in streaming music play over the wireless.  Be sure to run the receiver update process before installing the adapter.  If you're wireless network uses MAC address filtering, use the receiver's MAC address.  The adapter does not have a MAC address, bizarrely enough.  It works fine using the receiver's MAC address in my filtering setup.
B004W89LS8|5.0|I'm not sure wether I reviewed an album by the Foofighters before....why should I ? It seems that everything which get touched by Dave turns into gold. He does what he likes and makes what he likes with whom he likes. In my opinion that is what rock 'n'roll stands for. He isn't afraid of making a track with Norah Jonas in a catchy Bossanova style or working with Juliette Lewis ( doing what he does behind his drum kit ) I don't have to mention his collaboration with QOTSA. All I'm saying is that he doesn't particulairy have to be in the spotlight. He just loves making music which makes all of his work GREAT. Don't just get this album...get 'm all. And while you're at it get the singles too which contain a lot of gems ( B-sides, extra tracks )  p.s. I saw him perform twice and had the luck of listening to his debut tour performing his first album. This was in \\"Paradiso Amsterdam \\" I don't expect to see the Foofighters perform there again....They're just too big for that.
1401233066|2.0|I'm a big fan of this series, but after all the build up, the conclusion to this storyline was a complete let down.  I hate to say it, but this series is getting a little long in the tooth.  Time to start thinking about a concluding storyline.
B004EPZ06Q|2.0|I saw the first one and liked it. But, after watching this one, I feel as stupid as that Allen character. The scenes with the Monkey are worth watching, hence two stars. The Monkey was the only intelligent being in this film -- on and behind the scenes. Save your time and money and skip this movie.
B0059XTUMC|5.0|I almost didn't see this movie, and THAT would have been a blunder !! The reviews are correct. It is marvelous.  Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo are perfection. The idea of shooting the film in black and white without spoken dialog ( except for the surprises) is a master stroke.  The soundtrack is splendid. I can see at least 5 Oscar nominations coming out of this and would not be surprised to see either Dujardin and/or Bejo win. If you have not seen this yet, do so before it leaves the theatres. The moment this movie goes to DVD, I'm buying it.  NOTE:  Since I wrote this review, the movie has gone on to win numerour awards ( including a near clean-sweep of BAFTA) and 10 Oscar nominations. Not the five I predicted earlier.  Since this my first review, Dujardin has become more known to U.S. audiences and has absolutely captured them through his charm, politeness, and humor.  While I generally agree that Clooney should win Best Actor at the Oscars,  The Artist should win Best Picture, soundtrack, and several other technical type awards.  And all this for a movie that cost only $15 million to make !! Less than the price of a Viagra commercial for the Super Bowl.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Look, this book starts out a little crazy. If you're looking for a series to get into for the long haul then read this. I see some reviews calling it barbaric and disgusting. But look, this plot couldn't be worse than sending 18-21 year olds out to war like we do on a regular basis. These books are powerful and remind you of what it is like to lose someone you love or your innocence. You fall in love with the main character and stick it through for her powerful journey. If you aren't into gorey scenes or you don't like much violence don't read this.<br /><br />But if you are a lover of books and a great story, finish them!! And quickly!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|best game I have ever played truly amazing plus it free. so u have to buy this game. if u are a real gamer
B000MGB6M8|5.0|I have the DVD, HD copy, and now bluray. Simply one of my favorite. I find AJ to be at her most beautiful self on this film and I'm glad I finally got a FullHD copy. Packaging is normal, not the collector's type or limited edition. For about 10 bucks what I can complain for. Great buy!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Well, first off, only start with 10 games. you get coons by playing games. You can by coins or download apps to get more. so really it is gtting u to like it, want coins and download other ones, so it addvertises all the time. if u like arcade games, its worth it but if not it is not worth the time and space.
B005V2EVBQ|2.0|I ended up throwing this cover in my dresser drawer and bought a leather Belking brand cover from BestBuy. I wish I had paid attention to the reviews that said this case doesn't stand up on it's own. Like so many others I discovered that the slot that's supposed to hold the case in place just doesn't work. I would've returned it but had already thrown out the packaging slip. Save yourself some money and frustration and buy the Belking. Or something else that actually works as advertised.

B006G2NVCA|5.0|Always nice to have some new Trent Reznor inspired music show up at your door on Christmas Eve!  This soundtrack may not be as good as \\"The Social Network was, but it is pretty damn close!  Also includes some new tracks by Karen O (Yeah Yeah Yeahs) and Reznor's side-project with his wife, How To Destroy Angels.  By clocking in at almost 3 hours, this is a must for all you NIN fans out there!
B004P98QZ8|3.0|On behalf of our son who is an expert 8-year-old lego builder.  He's built the Grand Emporium, the Police Station, Earth Defense HQ and many more all without major problems.  The Ninjago Fire Temple has been very frustrating.  Every time you try to add a new piece, other pieces fall off.  When you slide open the temple like you are supposed to, one of the walls falls off and breaks in pieces.  It is a fun toy, but it looks crooked when built.  It is not like the usual Lego sets, which go together very well and seem well thought out.  This set is extremely fragile and it is very easy to knock off parts you've already built while trying to add on new pieces.  Just keep in mind when buying it that it is much more difficult and frustrating than the usual Lego set.
B005NKIQ26|5.0|I bought this for my daughter.  I think this cd is alot better than the other ones he has out.  Nice songs.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|great game I love it have it on almost all of My touch screen electronics.its so addicting I cant stop playing when I do
B004EBZX6W|5.0|I wish ther were more real-time apps like this designed for IT use on the Kindle FIre. I really like this app and the graphics make the Kindle look like some kind of High-tech IT device. I use this to see which wireless channels are being used the most in my area so I can mannually set my wireless trafic to something else. Great App!
B0063GORYU|4.0|have a great time playing  fun and simple game but a great way to kill some time and make you think a little bit
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Keeps my CPU Phenom II x4 980 BE very cool!  It came bulk package so which was fine, no packaging to mess with.  It works great
B0063IH60K|5.0|the adverts are minimal. not a ton of options but its solitaire - do you really need 50 different deck styles?
B005OCFHHK|3.0|The set arrived intime. When i play the movie on my LG Blue ray player, the movie  pauses ,buffers and plays which is irritating.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I love the Harry Potter films and haven't purchased any of the movies, so this was a great way to get every movie in a compact box set as an Xmas present to myself for an unbelievable low price $39. The complete film set has 8 DVDs in its individual DVD digi-tray but not in individual jewel cases which makes it compact, slim, and easy to store. This complete collection even has \\"The Deathly Hallows, Part 2\\" which I have not seen yet. Great product, great price, and complete set. I would highly recommend this film collection.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is an excellent tool for reading and learning from many different versions. And since it is free for the Fire, go ahead and download it!
B002ZG981E|5.0|I love this movie, bought this on Black Friday, I'm from Brazil and came as expected, everything in order, no scratch on cover and received package in time for Xmas \o/  About the product, this is one of my favourites, it has action, great writing (it's a shame it didn't won Academy Awards for this one) and nice visual effects.
B006C1DH92|5.0|The challenges in this version of Fruit Ninja give this one extra life. Especially for free, this is a lot of fun! :-) Puss' little comments are cute.   Runs great on Fascinate with Gingerbread. My only real complaint is that it's slow to load.
B006C1DH92|4.0|But still a very fun game and doesn't look horrible on my Xoom. Stretch mode looks decent. Nice free app Amazon

B001AQR3JY|5.0|My daughter is 16 and never saw the movie..  Santa brought her the DVD and she loved it!  FAST SHIPPING and a great deal.  Thank you
B004XWMXX8|5.0|I love her music,and when I heard about this album I knew i HAD to buy it! In this album all the songs have really catchy tunes,I usually find myself singing these songs in the middle of the day!She is such a talented artist and writes great songs. This is defenitly a great album to buy youll love almost all the songs!
0307716988|5.0|Only MJ could have written such a true book about himself.You will have a better understanding of the KING of POP as you dive into his life.Many great things about his life and family.I love the KING....
0061438294|5.0|For many years all the books on Body Language really sucked and were filled with bad information.  This book is such a pleasant exception.  I love how Joe explains how the limbic system plays into the study of nonverbal behavior.  You can tell form this book that Joe knows his stuff.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone that wants to improve their ability to read people.  I would also recommend anything by Paul Ekman and Desmond Morris.  You almost can't go wrong with their work either.<br /><br />I will say this though for those of you that hope to get good at reading people it requires constant practice and takes time so please be patient with yourselves.  At some point it becomes more about training yourself to notice than anything.  Anyhow enjoy!
B00656C6KK|1.0|Doris Day spent decades as the most likable and lovable star on Earth.  She made terrific pop-jazz recordings with Les Brown and great orchestra leaders.  She made terrific movies with legendary directors and leading men.  She always had the sweetest voice and the sweetest smile and the sweetest disposition.  That, however, was long ago.  This album is saccharine.  Sounds like the entertainment in a small-town Holiday Inn lounge.  The song choices are suspect, cheesy and haphazard.  The performances are insincere and bland.  The arrangements are dated.  If I didn't know better, I would think this album was recorded in 1979.  So sad to hear this one.  Wish Ms. Day would have stayed faded away.
0876304420|5.0|This should be the text book for Ericksonian Hypnosis.  This book is amazing!  Other than reading Erickson's work itself this is the closest that you will ever come to what Erickson actually did when he hypnotized people.  The cooperation principle is not something that people really talk about but if you look at Erickson's work closely it was never something that he was doing to something so much as it was something he was doing with them.<br /><br />I remember one well known NLP Trainer saying that when the met Milton Erickson that they could hear his embedded commands when he spoke to them and that in fact they thought that perhaps David Gordon or John Grinder were better at them than Erickson was but then they went on to say them when they heard them they could have disobeyed them but didn't want to because their rapport was so deep that they were afraid of breaking it by not carrying them out.  That's the cooperation principle at it's finest.<br /><br />Absolutely amazing book I would recommend it to anyone that wants to know from someone other than Erickson's work itself how he operated!
B006C1DH92|2.0|Uninstalling. The game works well enough on my evo 4g, but it killed my battery super fast. The graphics are good, but it's a simple reflex game and gets old  quickly. If it used 1 meg or so, and didn't eat the battery like it does, I might leave it installed. At 25 meg + drain it's just not worth keeping.
B0058P7KUA|3.0|Same old game as the rest. Its still fun to play to pass the time away. But not worth paying for.
B006C1DH92|1.0|I have to give it 1 star because it won't open on my Samsung Continuum. Why make it available if it doesn't work?
B0056BU3I2|5.0|Great product at an excellent buy. The product was exactly as described with all the different avenues of viewing. For all these car fans it's a great fast paced movie that helps to capitalize on the fast and furious past of the original movies.
B001GZ6QBU|5.0|This movie is phenomenal! The actors are fantastic and this is definitely one of Heath Ledger's finest performances. It's no doubt going to be tough to top this installment of Batman.
B0054JELS4|5.0|I used to think our fav. 'whodunit/spy' tv shows were BONES, CASTLE and CHUCK. Boy, I was so wrong. Hv never seen an episode of NCIS before. Was googling the reviews on the top tv shows and found alot of positive reviews on NCIS.  We thought it was a military series and did not paid too much attention until we drop our interests on BONES. and needed to find another outlet of 'whodunit/spy' while waiting for the coming out new season of CASTLE and CHUCK. After reading reviews on NCIS, I bought the the box set of 1-8 and started watching after Thanksgiving hols. I was totally hooked after the 1st season! Now my husband is addicted too! Each of the main characters have endured themselves to us ... so well played ... the comaradrie and chemistry are undeniable. Gibbs, DeNozzo, Ziva, McGee, Kate (1st to 3rd season), Abby, Ducky, even Palmer .....each of them are fabulous!. Almost finished Season 8. Never, have we been so addicted to a tv series before. Is like watching a never-ending 'Jason Bourne' series. Just could not wait till Season 9 comes out. Fantastic writing and plots. OORAH for sure!
B005DCJ1J6|5.0|This has been a favorite film of mine for the past 12 years. It's well done and extremely moving. So happy to have it on blu-ray and thank you Amazon for the killer price tag!
B005ZUR724|4.0|server news stated an update was coming.  guessing they have yet to finish as stated. in server news.  great app, but when system is down on tuesday mornings (wow fans are acquainted with that), should have a better process than having people think a phantom upgrade is needed.  guessing problem will be fixed when maintenance is over.......or at least I hope.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I purchase a Christmas DVD every December to add to my holiday collection. I had no problem choosing The Muppet Christmas Carol. I hadn't seen it in ages and loved it so much as a child. Kermit has always stolen my heart! I was thrilled to realize I enjoy it just as much now as an adult as I did then. Even my finicky husband enjoyed it! Can't wait to share this classic with my children someday.
B004IFYMWK|5.0|Good product. Good price. I'd recommend this seller to family and friends.
B0042J6VUS|1.0|First off, too small for the Samsung Galaxy Sii.  Secondly, could not get the nut to tighten so that it would stay in place.  Flops around regardless of the orientation, actually, the only orientation you can set it as is with phone upright (vertical, even then it's flopping around.  Since you cannot tighten it, it won't stay horizonal at all. There's a reason it's so cheap, it's garbage.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great game.  Easy to use.  Simple to play.  I like playing solitare for relaxation. Try it, it's real easy.
032147404X|5.0|I bought this for my wife as a Christmas present along with a new camera...it is simple straight forward and easy to read...she loves it
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It's a fun, addicting game! Although the graphics seem a tad dated, they are still fun, challenging games for all ages! You get 10 games to start with, and have to play to earn coins to unlock the others. I think this is a great addition, because otherwise I would get bored from being able to play any game. (But that's just me!) Having to unlock the other games poses as a challenge for me that makes me want to keep playing!
B0052GACNM|5.0|Once again Tony Bennett proves to be Master at working with a great variety of Artists from the 25 year old Lady Gaga to late 70's Willie Nelson. They all give a very good representation of the American song book.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This gift was said to be the \\"Best Present\\" ever. He placed this item in the top of his Christmas list.
B005ZUR724|1.0|we cannot.play his game it says update but there is no update on market.y'all gotta fix this mess up or u losing.customers! update now!!!
1439192812|4.0|the book is really aimed at someone in high-school, perhaps slightly beyond. The structure utilized is very logical and smooth - eg. addressing the question of 'Who was the first person?' and then explaining there was no such individual. The first humans slowly evolved from other life. Then it's on to \\"Why are there so many kinds of animals?\\" etc.<br /><br />The 'bad news' is that many parents may not appreciate Dawkins' anti-religious tone throughout the material. (Others would see this as a positive.)
1451627289|5.0|I've read most of Stephen King's books- this was by far, in my opinion  the very best!!!!!!  Whether you love history, science fiction or even romance- This fill all bills  Bravo!

B00542USJW|5.0|Okay, if you are a Jordan fan or just want to relive your childhood, this is the movie to WATCH!!! We are talking about a movie that is funny and never get old. Its a must have for your Blu-ray collection. Get on it son !!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|LOVE THIS GAME.  I JUST CANNOT PUT IT DOWN. THE GAME JUST KEEPS YOU GOING.  THERE IS ALWAYS A NEW CHALLENGE TO CONQUER THANK YOU R&M
B004SKJTY6|1.0|This is described as the movie The King's Speech. It's really a trailer. I find this very misleading. Why have a catalog item for a trailer I can see on Rotten Tomatoes?
B005JLN9ZI|4.0|i work with teenage boys and they are huge Drake fans. So I bought this album to accompany our therapeutic groups and it   was a joy to see how happy it made them.  Drake is a smart and intuitive guy and people of all ages can relate to his spirit and his lyrics.   His voice has really improved and he's not afraid to say what he means, doesn't worry about being macho, just lets it all out....
0446573019|2.0|Baldacci is still a good writer and there are only a limited number of characters (???), but this book was disappointing in that it was basically about a Lee Child's character, Reacher, with a different name.   If it was based on an original character, I would have given the story a 4.
0385523912|5.0|This book is amazing.  I found it very enlightening and insightful.  I had no idea what was happening in this part of the world in this day an age.  I learned so much.  You are really invested in the characters. I often had to remind myself that these are real people telling they real life stories. It is not fiction. Loved it !
B002RL7W9W|5.0|Lego products are always a hit in our household.  The kit was complete and fit the age range suggested on the box.  My youngest is very proud of his first Lego solo build. I suspect I will be stumbling over Lego bricks for a long time.
B004TTZHBK|2.0|It is pretty and instructive, and I love Jamie Oliver, but I'm missing out on some conent, because of the rotate issues.  Also, regards content, for 20 minute meals the ingredient lists seem quite long.  But, I have not tried one, yet.  I hope to see an update that addresses the technical issues, but it is too large an issue to over look on a paid for / not free app.
B005D51II0|5.0|If there's one good thing that's happened in Classical music over the last few years, it's been the plethora of bargain priced box sets. Such is the case with The Decca Sound, a retrospective of some of that label's most famous recordings from the early stereo era onward.<br /><br />Space doesn't permit me to go into detail on the individual performances here, and I refer the reader to Stephen Worth's review for the full contents of the set.  Suffice it to say that there isn't a bad performance to be heard in the set, although a few are less than stellar.  The repertoire and performers have been carefully selected so that the individual discs add up to an uncommonly well balanced collection - truly the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.  The collection is organized alphabetically by primary artist.  Some performers appear on more than one disc.  For example, Vladimir Ashkenazy appears as pianist (in the Rachmaninoff Third Concerto and Second Sonata) on one disc, then as conductor (in Sibelius's First Symphony and Ashkenazy's own orchestration of Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition), and Andras Schiff appears as both accompanist and solo pianist.<br /><br />The original front album covers are reproduced for each disc, and most discs are filled out with bonus tracks.  The original liner notes are not included here.  In their place is an illustrated hard-bound booklet which goes into detail how the Decca Sound was achieved - essentially it amounted to the selection of the proper microphones and a simple but carefully placed setup.  The sound of these recordings, some over 50 years old, holds up really well, particularly the orchestral recordings.  I would describe the Decca Sound as warm without being fuzzy, clear without being clinical, all frequencies audible with a deep, resonant bass that doesn't call attention to itself.<br /><br />Highest recommendation.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this solitaire! it's really easy to use and the ads are pretty minimum. The only thing is sometimes it does like force close out of nowhere.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|This case has been awesome to use with my Kindle Fire.  I am very pleased with both its look and its functionality.  I highly recommend it to other Kindle Fire owners.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|this game is so addicting love it you have to buy it and once you buy ot you will never stop playing it
B0055SWM08|5.0|Well worth the measly .99 cents it costs. I also recommend Quell reflect as a purchase. Sotthing music and very pleasing aesthetic.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|Great app! I play it frequently. You can change the difficulty of the computer- mine stays on a low difficulty but is still hard to beat!
B001UV4XIS|2.0|I should have read the reviews before purchasing, the digital copy is a joke.  I would would not recommend this version.
B006C1DH92|2.0|well, the normal version is better. has more play options. this one had 2 modes. first the normal nods which was fine like the original and free versions. but then the second play option was a bomb. it might have just been me not seeing it, but I coulndt get back to the menu on my kindle fire. DONT BUY THIS APP!!!
0007288387|5.0|I can't tell you enough, how much I enjoyed this book and little Ms. Jenny from the block. I love the characters and can't wait to read the next two books.
B006C1DH92|4.0|it just like fruit ninja that's why it is a good game I love fruit ninja you should really get this game
B003C0IGRE|5.0|Received quickly.  In perfect condition. It was a pleasure doing business with you. Thank you so much!!  Cost was very reasonable.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I had been watching this collection for a few days and they had it at $49.99, but saw it on Thanksgiving Day for $39.99, I had to buy it.  For all 8 movies this was a steal. Sure it doesn't have a fancy box and an included cape and wand but do I really need that stuff if they were to offer it in a box set.  Rumor has it they are going to lock the series away and bring it back out in like 10 years or so similar to what Disney does.   Otherwise, excellent transaction.
B005K17RU0|5.0|After you enter your location make sure you tap it or it will do nothing. it took me three attempts before I figured it out.
1936041111|4.0|There is a reason that the classic books are referred to as classics. People should read them at least once in their lives and this is one that falls under that classification. I am a teacher and had never read the book, but my AP students do so I wanted to be able to talk to them about it. I am glad that I did. There is a lot in this story that is not talked about in the movie remakes.
B005ELZKWS|4.0|Sammy Hagar has been writing the same lyrics since the 80's....Ok OK ...we get it...you hate religion and like having sex!! We get it! Why not try moving onto some other subject matter? HOWEVER...... Its not enough to ruin the album though. I can gladly ignore Hagar's lack of lyrical depth in favor of a solidly enjoyable listening experience. I like it MUCH better than the first outing for sure. It's more solid. The band seems to be locked in as a band rather than sort of a Satch side project with vocals etc...As for Satch...what can you say? His tones and notes are always fun and exciting. This time though, he really plays to the song giving great air to the vocals and outstanding phrasing and textures. It's a good straight forward rock album that you simply do not hear anymore. It's not over produced,not pretentious, catchy and most importantly...ITS FUN!SOOOOOO it's  It's official, Chickenfoot is a band effort and it shows! A welcomed album in spite of Hagar's lack of lyrical creativity, perhaps he should call upon the aliens for enlightenment...HA! If you are a fan of good ole 70's/80's party rock...This is YOUR album...It will not disappoint!
B006C1DH92|4.0|wouldnt work at first on my optimus so i resarted and tried again, still no go. so i moved it to sd card and tried... nope. finally i cleared app data as a last resort and the game now runs, and runs well.
B000I0QL82|5.0|As great as it ever was; classic holiday magic, worth watching every year!  Nothing brings the memories of Christmas rushing back like Bing.
B004QK5N5W|5.0|Of course this type of product isn't the ideal solution (i.e. integrated HDMI connection in iPad) but it works great!  I can connect to projectors for business and TVs when I travel.
B0064J6OMO|4.0|The movie started out funny, fizzled for about 20 minutes but ended up being pretty funny.<br /><br />Both actors are believable in the portrayal of two guys who switched bodies. This isn't a raunchy comedy it's more of a chick flick. Overall several laughs were had. This movie is much funnier than \\"Horrible Bosses\\". Not as funny as Cedar Rapids though.<br /><br />I would recommend watching it.
B000V5Y23U|3.0|If you have not seen DS9, and have never seen this episode, then see it (All Trek is worth watching once).  We meet Garak in this episode, and there's a small guest appearance by The Klingon Duras sisters: Lursa and B'Etor.  The episode is about Kira's loyalty, yadda, yadda.  A character-building episode that is inconsequential to the overall story of the series.  OK to Skip.  2.9/5 Stars.  ~Keep On Trekkin
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I git as kinflefire and thus works amazingly on it!!!! I love this and you can earn points fir free and you dnt have to buy it! best free app ever
B000V5ZIBU|5.0|If You're gonna watch \\"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\\" (I know, winded title, and to he honest, so is the original opening credits sequence), You have to See this Episode.  It's the pilot, and sets the whole thing going.  I must admit that there will be some bad episodes in Season 1, but this one is a Must.  This is the beginning of the journey of Ben Sisko. And the introduction to a cast that will stick together for years.  5/5 stars not just cause it's good Trek, but because it's good TV (Especially for the early 1990s)  ~Keep On Trekkin!
B00457WZEI|5.0|I bought this book for my 12 year old. He loves it. I decided to read it and I fell in Love with Joey... it is a great book for readers of all ages.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|I had no problems manipulating the screen to see the objects or to find them. It was a bit chatty, but that's a minor issue. Overall, great game!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is definetly five stars! I use it everywhere I go.. church,in bed, or when I'm bored at work.

B0009P5YXO|4.0|Not much to say about this toy. I enjoy it. The inivisible ink included with it is neat. I may use it for my costume at one of the sci fi conventions.
B000008LOU|5.0|This is a great CD. I also purchased Traveling Wilburys, Vol. 1.  Heard the music on Pandora and found the best deal for it on Amazon.  This came from England but arrived within a week.

B005H0IW6W|5.0|Typically Buble. Smooth, easy, engaging voice, lyrics appropriately played with in places.    I love Christmas music, and all it's corniness.  Buble has selected a good mix of carols and traditional Christmas ... White Christmas is amazing and Santa Baby is great fun.  This CD covers the range that you need to feel Christmassy.  I must have for any collection.
B005IZLPMY|4.0|All in all this is a fun movie. It is fairly respectful and true to the original Captain America comics and is a good set up for the upcoming Avengers movie. The bonus features are entertaining, particularly the short film \\"A funny thing happened on the way to Thor's Hammer\\".
B000J159N8|5.0|When the 7th Cavalry battled North Vietnamese regulars on Nov. 14-15-16, 1965, I was in Vietnam, too. The 1st Infantry Division was my outfit -- I was not involved in the battle or anywhere in the area. But I remember hearing about it at the time. So I could not wait to view this film.  I was not disappointed. Mel Gibson, in his pre-\\"The Passion of the Christ\\" days, when he fell afoul of the Jewish establishment in Hollywood, did a superb job in this war movie which shows us not only what the men on the front lines experience and suffer, but also depicts the anguish their wives and families face, back home, waiting, hoping, and dreading, what they will hear about their loved ones in combat. Gibson stars as Lt. Col. Hal Moore, commander of the companies which become involved in the fierce battle.  The Ia Drang Valley was the first major clash between main-line U.S. troops and North Vietnamese army regulars in the Vietnam War, and it is shown here in all its convincing, bloody awfulness. A friend of mine said she watched this movie before I did, and that she broke down crying before the battle scenes even started, because she was thinking, \\"This one's gonna die; that one's gonna die ...\\" That's pretty much the way it is. War is like that; it takes the good, the bad and the indifferent. Bullets and artillery shells play no favorites.  And the deaths of U.S. soldiers reverbate back in the U.S., where a stream of taxicab-delivered telegrams from the Army inform wives and children that their men have paid the ultimate sacrifice. The scenes of the young wives of the young men of the 7th Cavalry, first receiving the tragic news, are heart-rending, and are extremely well played.  The final stage of the battle -- when the elements of the 7th Cavalry, overwhelmed and trapped by superior numbers of Vietnamese, radio a \\"Broken Arrow\\" plea to headquarters -- meaning, \\"We are in desperate straits; send all available combat aircraft at once\\" -- may be a little too much for those with tender sensibilities. American fighters, bombers and helicopters hem-stitch whole rows of attacking North Vietnamese soldiers with bombs, machine-gun fire and napalm, wiping out hundreds with each new attack. The screams and the sight of very realistic depictions of men on fire and burning to death would shake anyone. In a couple of places, the blood from fatal wounds of men near the camera actually splatters onto the lens itself -- \\"cinema verite\\" which may not have been planned, but which the director chose to leave in. And plenty of American combat deaths are depicted, too. A young Japanese-American soldier has just finished proudly telling an American reporter on the scene that his son was born that day, when he is hit and burned horribly by napalm.  After the fighting is over, Gibson as Moore tells another officer that he feels \\"so ashamed of myself\\" because he survived the battle and so many of his men didn't. It's that kind of war movie. It shows how close men can become when they have \\"each other's backs\\" in armed combat. The survivors can actually feel ashamed, embarrassed, that their buddies died, and they didn't.  This is an excellent war movie. The fact that it includes significant material about the wives and children back home, puts it a notch or two above many others. I highly recommend it.

B005ZUR724|1.0|don't bother. one star till update is released. was really into the game till I could no longer loving without the phantom required update
B001UV4XHY|5.0|this movie is wonderful! the main 3 actors shown lots of growth, and it shows; more in depth acting, the last 2 movies are very dark, and more adult like, but worth every penny & every moment to watch! Highly reccommend to any one! ¢¾ sad to see these come to an end
B000HT3PPG|5.0|Having grown up watching this movie in the 1950's, I exposed our children to it during their childhood. It became a \\"must see\\" during the holiday season. Now our third generation is sharing this family tradition. It is enjoyed by all.This year,our oldest grandchild, 14, put in a personal request to have her own copy. Her future Christmases will be filled now with many family memories.

This app and my Fire let's me take my music and my old radio shows with me when I'm out of range of the station.   I do wish there were not so many stations that restricted streaming their programming. But since I can get my favorite, I'm happy.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|This is such a fun game easily worth the money if the graphics didnt look so fuzzy on a tablet.  5 stars if they upgrade to decent graphics.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|being a lifelong rush fan, and metallica fan, i thought maybe we would have a melding of the two (lyrically, not musically of course)with lou reed's help...i was sorely mistaken. reed being known for masterful lyrics as are rush, and the possibility of the boys from metallica steppin up there game musically to match those lyrics, maybe we could have a real masterpiece on our hands. first of all, the songs are basically unlistenable; but many rock and metal songs are, even songs from bands i admire. it happens. there are rush songs i don't listen to, there are metallica songs i don't listen to, and hundreds of bands and songs in between. but when i say this is unlistenable, that's putting it mildly. this puts the 'un-listen' in unlistenable, meaning this album actually makes you wish you had never listened to it. lou is on drugs, or actually dead, i'm not sure which, as the lyrics are so pathetic, it may be a drug addled zombie on the mic. either way, lou reed should be stripped of any music awards he has received in his career for this, as a lifetime un-achievement award. and what, exactly, were the guys from metallica thinking?? i imagine they started the project with lofty intentions, and in their hearts, knew it had become a disaster, but hoped for the best upon it's release. simply put, their hopes were severely dashed. however, every band makes the dreaded 'concept' album during their careers, if they last long enough, and metallica just made theirs. rush gave up their concept albums 30 years ago, when they knew it was time to get out when the gettin was good. let that be a lesson to the boys from the bay. will i abandon metallica? no, i still think there is hope, as death magnetic was a decent release. should lou reed continue with his music career? i'd say no, but 'no' is too gentle of a word. i guess melding lyrics from a band like rush and musicianship of metallica together was like making pink floyd into a speed metal band....kind of.
B006PAZMMK|5.0|No Soph Slump here.  Skrillex shows growth and finds new ideas to make this album worth your $6.99.  Don't try to put a label on what he's doing.  Just listen.  If you like it, then it's good.  As for me, it's good.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Absolutely love this keyboard, It looks great, has theme to choose from and accurate to type on.   the best keyboard out there!! hands down
B003Y5H53S|3.0|I do not think this is a good idea for kids to watch as there is cursing in this movie as such I would not allow a child to watch as they hear enough through contacts,ect.. and I would not have ordered this if I had known. Thanks. Thelma
B005G02RIC|4.0|This is a recording from a live performance in \\"Arena di Verona\\", in Verona (where else) Italy.  It is an excellent performance all around.  First of all the music: All three leading stars were very good.  Ironically, Scarpia (sung by Ruggero Raimondi) was the best despite the fact that he is the clear number-3 singer in Tosca.  All three sung nearly flawlessly, but the singing was somewhat emotionless by Tosca (sung by Fiorenza Cedolins).  The orchestra was listless at times, but maybe that was a reflection of the fact that this was an outdoor performance.  OK, for singing, this performance is probably not in the same class as the very best I have heard in the past (sung by Domingo, Freni, and Ramey), but it is darn good. I was delighted the whole time I was watching it.  Next the peripherals: the acting, the set design, the costumes, all that stuff that is secondary to the music (for me), but still makes the experience so much richer, if well done.  In that sense, this was one of the best Tosca performance I have ever seen.  The set design was a cross between ancient Roman and ultramodern.  It worked surprisingly well.  The costumes were beautiful (more on that later.)  Acting was pretty good, but don't expect \\"Masterpiece Theatre\\" performances from Opera singers. For an opera, this was much better than average acting.  Next the Blu-Ray: it was fantastic. The cinematography was nothing short of exceptional. When you get a close shot of the singers with their ornamental clothing, you can see every minute detail on the screen (on a 48\\" HDTV on 1080p).  This stuff is typically so small and intricate, that it gets blurred when played from a DVD.  (On the negative side, you can also see the tiny specks of perspiration on the singers' faces as well.  You cannot hide anything in a well made Blu-Ray.)  Subtitles were very good and their timing were perfectly synchronized with the music.  Time to retire my DVD collection.  From now on, I am buying Operas only on Blue Ray.Finally the price: it is a steal!!!  You can't buy many excellent Opera performances on Blu-Ray for less than $10. Grab this one, and you won't regret it.
0880794968|5.0|I used to use the Enchanted Tarot deck, and as beautiful as it was, it didn't work for me. The cards were big and hard to handle, and the pictures themselves were a little too decorated for a beginner. The Universal Waite Deck is gorgeous and simple (and i love the starry back). Unlike the enchanted tarot, I can actually sense the mood of each card. The cards are nice and glossy, but also really slippery, but I'm guessing that'll get better with practice. I know some people didn't like this deck because it was \\"washed out\\" but I think the colors are nice and bright. I can see each picture clearly. Being a beginner, I think this deck is a great starter deck. I look forward to using it.
1594744769|5.0|A really great story! Provides a wonderfully insightful side-ways commentary on the Holocaust with a surprising mix of Dr. Who and Big Fish.
0316154687|2.0|I bought this book because I read that some celebrity was currently reading it and had said it was a laugh a minute.  As a person who loves to laugh and enjoys good live comedy as well, I took a leap of faith and purchased the book.  It was somewhat funny in places but I could have written an identical book about my own funny experiences.  In other words, it wasn't anything special, or memorable.  It wasn't even as if the writing was spectacular.  I typically prefer a good crime novel, but I'll give anything a chance and this was just boring.  I feel like I wasted my time reading this versus a ton of other great books in the world just waiting to be read.
B001FB55L2|2.0|cliche story, predictable end. Is people expected to be surprised by the fact that he came back a different person after war? anyone who knows what war is wont be surprised with movie. Besides, they are a weird family: nobody (wife and kids, parents and brother) really cries when they are told he is dead, nobody really cries when they welcome him home again... The wife and kids seem to be happy all the time, they accepted it all very easily...
B0063IH60K|5.0|Works great on my Kindle Fire! No problems with the application. Works flawlessly. I love that they have a &quot;winning hand option&quot;.  I win more often than not. Very enjoyable.
0061564893|5.0|Very thought provoking, eye-opening perspective on American/Chinese history.  Personally, I found the author's \\"1434\\" an equally, if not more forceful argument as to how the Chinese have influenced our Western heritage. Several of my friends who haven't read either \\"1491\\" and/or \\"1434\\" poo poo the idea that the Chinese may have been such avid explorers... I urge that they cast away their eurocentric (note that \\"eurocentric\\" is capitalized here because I don't believe it should be) perception of the world and give the author a chance to state his case. Unfortunately, for most of us Americans, our knowledge of history stops two feet short of our noses... we need to take a risk and look a little further out.

B005ZUR724|1.0|This game is a great addition to the app store. It has great graphics and lots of quests. But just today, it started to not work. When I logged in it said there was an update, but there was no way to get it. I hope things turn around because I really like this app. Once things change, I will change my rating.
0061537934|3.0|Got this book for Xmas - two days ago -- and breezed through it in a day and a half. Nice read, light read, simple story - dog as guardian angel - a page turner but it blew right through me like wind. If your preference is meatier or deeper tales, this isn't the book for you. But if you're looking for a lighter fare - and/or are a dog person - you could do worse. There's a tear-jerker element too. I feel like I've just read a Sandra Bullock movie.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|So much fun! Some is hard but its very addicting and fun!!! I give this 100% 5 stars!!! I recommend this game todally!!
B006FLGBGA|4.0|This movie is a great prequel and much more than I expected.  The change in point of view and the telling of Caesar's story made this a much more interesting film.  It was a bit over the top towards the end, but by then I'd bought into the story, so it really didn't matter.  I'd love to see a sequel to this film.
B004P2CQM4|1.0|The only thing I can say is don't buy it. First, it was very expensive. By the time I paid for the fish and the helium tank (sold separately) I was out about $90. Then it was a major pain to put together. The fish is a cheap helium balloon (think Happy Birthday or Get Well Soon). All the pieces are held onto the balloon with very flimsy celophane tape that started to come off after a few minutes. Once it was put together it was another pain trying to add and then take away weight so it would hover and not go up to the ceiling or down to the floor. When I finally go it up and functioning by daughter tried to play with her cousin (who also got one) but they couldn't because the radio controllers controlled each others fish. After about 10 minutes of not very exiting play, the fish just inexplicably popped leaving a giant hole that could not be patched.
B004L0NGEC|5.0|Absolutely the best app if you use picasa.  I finally have my pictures on my Fire, I can even download them and upload to Facebook.
0385344325|3.0|If you have read any of Lee Child's Reacher series, then Jack Reacher's narrative voice is so distinctive that from the first paragraph its like visiting an old friend. THE AFFAIR is the explanation of how Reacher left the Army to go out on his own. It works for the most part, but for some reason the stupidity level was very high on some major plot points. And, for the first time that I can remember, Reacher's code of justice seemed out of place. A fun read, but perhaps a sign that even re-booting the series from an origin's standpoint is not enough to breath fresh life into it.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|Unit works well I don't use the advanced features.  Requires 4 AA batteries to use has its' own on/off swich and other settings.  My Nikon D5100 recognizes it and automatically uses it.  Seems to be extremely well made to me.
B0063IH60K|5.0|love this game,plays great. on my fire.  fast card movement ,very addictive,simple yet. challenging enough to keep you playing. just one more time.  /
B006C1DH92|4.0|Better than the original. I particularly enjoyed the soundtrack and commentary. It's a fun little time waster. I recommend it.
B006C1DH92|5.0|I have the original Fruit Ninja game, and this one plays just as well. I get a giggle out of Puss's comments, too. Nice FAOTD Amazon, Thanks!
B0040UAYI4|5.0|Take the time to fine tune the calibration for each game.  It takes ~5 min for each game (make sure you connect it to a computer to save the settings for each game too).  Once you get it right, it's as close as you're going to get to PC controls on a PS3 (Unless Sony takes steps to natively support proper mouse control, which isn't going to happen).  There is more than enough cable for my setup, but I can see where someone with a large room might need to get a USB extension.  Not a con to me though - it should be plenty for most people.
0443069522|5.0|Bought this for my high school aged son, whom has great interest in the medical field, hoping to one day be a doctor. Looks like a good survey of the body as I expected, since I see the local medical students carrying the same around the school hospital.

LLLOOOLLLL!!!!!
B0060AY6FO|4.0|I'm puzzled by some of the negative reviews I've seen, and can only attribute it to unreasonably high expectations. And it's true -- this is not Jane Austen come to life again. But why would anyone think that was even possible?  PD James does not attempt to pretend to be Austen -- which I think has upset some reviewers here. She's too wise for that. She makes many, many Austen references -- anyone who's read Pride & Prejudice to the point of having much of it memorized (as I have) will recognize tongue-half-in-cheek linguistic references on almost every page. (\\"Elizabeth knew rather than felt she was happy.\\" \\"He was once again her dear Wickham.\\" \\"Polluted shades of Pemberly\\" etc.) But James writes as if she's telling a story about real people, which is her usual style, NOT as if she's Jane Austen.  This is a fun, intelligent book, in which it seems James is as interested in fleshing out the stories of the original characters, and answering some mysteries she felt remained from P&P, as she is in the murder. (E.g. Why did Darcy, a loving and conscientious brother, send his only sister to live with a woman whose references he hadn't even thoroughly checked? What is the relationship between Wickham and Mrs. Younge? Would E have married D if D was poor? etc) You may not agree with James's choices, but to my mind they do make sense and are in keeping with the original characters. And of course, she writes English so well that even Austen would not blush -- more than can be said for the authors of most other Austenobilia I've seen.   I, too, hoped that somehow we'd seen Jane Austen come to life again; I hoped for brilliance. And that is not to be, and that is why I gave this book only 4 stars. But \\"Death Comes to Pemberly\\" is the only piece of Austenobilia that I've found I've been able to read through and enjoy, the only one I've found to be fun, smart, elegantly written, and true to the spirit of Austen.   I only wished it was longer.
B006C1DH92|3.0|My galaxy tab 10.1 can see up to ten touches at once.  But in this game it would miss some of my slashes.  Never saw that problem in the original.  Also if you are mid game there is no way to exit or get back to a menu, you can only pause.  And the original has more modes and seems more polished.  If you love the first and still play, this is worth a shot.  If you love the first but got bored, then you will soon bore of this one also.  As this is more fruit slicing.
B005ZUR724|4.0|I have this game for the kindle fire it was working until last night now eveytime I sign in it takes forever and say newer version available. so I uninstall and reinstall it downloaded th update. Great!  unfortunately it doesn't install it or really download.  FIX THIS GAMELOFT I HAVE TBESE GAMES FOR IOS WITH NI PROBLEMS.  stop being lazy
B0006GVJEE|4.0|Leon is one of my favorite films.  It is a two person play in which one character saves the other and in the process is redeemed himself.  It is about violent lives in which there seems to be no way out or up.  Regardless, by the end of the story, they find love and hope.    Far from a standard love story, and far from the standard story of redemption, Leon ends at what is possibly the best point for each.
1612931103|3.0|This is good information for the use of grammar in the English language, however, sometimes the auhtor talks about dos and donts without giving concrete examples. This make it hard at times to see how a rule is applied.
B006C1DH92|5.0|Very addicting like itbetter then the original fruit ninja.  Works  great on the galaxy s 2.  highly recommend this app
B006C1DH92|5.0|Simple, cute and very addictive game. I don't have the first one but this ones great. Looks and runs 100% on Htc TB  can't complain and for free. Thanks Amazon.
B000VZR6HE|5.0|If you asked me which of the early KISS records I absolutely love, I could name you 2 specific titles...Rock And Roll Over and Hotter Than Hell. Where their first batch of songs didn't receive a fair representation on \\"KISS\\", HTH was logjammed with orgies of powerchord goodness, great hooks, excellent sense of melody and an untainted hungry band hard at work. I love this record especially because of Goin' Blind, which features stellar melodic arrangements and one of Ace Frehley's FINEST guitar solos ever immortalized on tape. There's a pervasive dark vibe as well with Parasite, Strange Ways and Watching You. The brooding moments also share time with more upbeat tunes like Mainline and Comin' Home, and the awesome title cut among others. A recommended release!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love being able to keep up with the speaker when they are referencing a lot of different addresses.  The only thing that would make it better is if there could be some footnotes explaining in more detail, like a study bible would.
B006CLTFP2|4.0|Although I've probably seen every episode of the show I couldn't match many of the songs with the event.  Doesn't matter, songs were all good listening.  One problem though, was disappointed the song listed as #16 'House of the Rising Sun' was NOT included on the CD.  That dude's voice is awesome and was looking forward to it. Otherwise, all were great.
042524489X|3.0|This is my second Nalini Singh novel - I've read \\"Archangel's Blade\\" - and my first in her psy-changeling series. Although this book is part of a sequence, I did not get too lost or confused, just one part about the way the psynet functioned left me a bit baffled, but not distractingly so.<br /><br />I was going to say that \\"Kiss of Snow\\" was not a paranormal romance. In fact, until I hit page three hundred and something when we FINALLY get some \\"romance action,\\" I was ready to label it as a Sci-Fi novel. But, alas the anticipated sex scene appeared on page, so the book retains the paranormal romance tag.<br /><br />The reader finds herself in a world occupied by changelings - some from human to wolf, others to leopards, or rats - and Psy, people with supernatural psychic powers. The changelings are allies and \\"the good\\"; the Psy are, for the most part, \\"the bad.\\" And, of course, war is brewing - the Psy want to rule! And in these troublesome times, a love story, that faces just as many difficulties, blooms - could I get any more clich&eacute; ;)?<br /><br />Hawke - alpha wolf to his pack - exact age not given, finds himself resisting his attraction to nineteen-year-old Sienna Lauren - an X-Psy, basically a very unpredictable, unstable weapon in human form, unless she learns to control her power. Hawke is an emotionally scarred man, having lost his \\"mate\\" at a very young age (as a child actually) and is unwilling to subject himself to such vulnerability again - loving, and risking the chance to lose that love; he also detests the Psy, as they experimented on and destroyed not only his father, but a majority of his pack many years ago. Sienna is also a much damaged character - she has been raised in isolation, has almost killed her own mother as a toddler because she couldn't control her X power, and is in general a rather aloof sort of person. She is also stubborn, determined, and at times childish - she is only nineteen after all. And all these characteristics make for a rather tumultuous and this-is-not-a-light-escapist-read love story.<br /><br />Now, I find that there are a number of things about Nalini Singh's style that don't appeal to me. Don't get me wrong, the woman knows how to write, in fact is a very good writer, it is just that in both of her works that I have read she does the following - she spends too much time developing the action and/or the crime solving aspect of her work, using that to drive the plot; her protagonists, as I already said, have deep emotional scars that create a predictable conflict between the couple (lost love/mate/not willing to commit again); although the tone of her works is dark, the actual sexual attraction is not felt and that is because she writes a very prolonged \\"prelude\\" to the love story, using not the attraction but the action and the characters' internal struggles to drive the romance; and, she takes forever to open the bedroom door, writing too many innocuous kissing and touching scenes, and once she does open the door, the sex scenes are too close to one another, that after the first one, I find myself skimming through them.<br /><br />Overall this is not a bad book - it has a well-written setting, well-developed primary and secondary characters (even a secondary love story), good dialogue that is more serious, tactical than witty, a believable resolution to the internal struggles, basically all the characteristics of a good novel; it is simply not a light/escapist read and does not possess the sexual chemistry I expect in a paranormal romance. If you are looking for something light, this is not for you. If you want something more serious, then pick this up.<br />original on romancecritics-not-a-light-escapist-read love story.

If you have an idea for making a change hiding away in the back of your mind because you don't think it's good enough to work or you don't know where to begin, I would highly recommend this book.  I have a vision or two of my own and I find myself encouraged that I might actually be able to do something that matters.  I think this book will be an invaluable resource for many an entrepreneur.  I will be hosting a giveaway on my blog for the second copy of this book. [...]
B003ZSJ212|5.0|First, I need to preface this with the fact that I have been using Amazon since they started and this is only the second review I have ever done.  I don't usually like to take the time, but here I felt I had to.<br /><br />I received this for Christmas and have finished half of it now.  I LOVE this!!  I've waited years for all of these together.  I don't know what is wrong with all the people who hate this.  From what I have read, it seems they are all stuck back in 1977 and don't want anything to change.  I bet they all still wear polyester suits also.  So Lucas decided to update some elements.  In case you don't remember, these are his movies, he wrote them and they are his vision.  He can do as he pleases.  How many artists throughout history have painted completely over something they did previously?  He doesn't do that, he only uses the time, money and technology he has now to add to or correct areas that bothered him.  Sure there are little nit-picky things I would personally like changed, but I am not the creator of this, so it's not my place to say.  Art is not a democracy.  Overall, this is a fabulous set, I love the packaging and all the extras.  Lots of little trivia and details I would never have known otherwise.  Especially areas like costuming, where you can watch the movie and say that the dress looks cool, but when you get a zoom of the detailed embroidery you just got WOW.  And then to know that a set that took eight weeks to build was used for less than a day and then destroyed.  Since I am not in the movie biz, these details are fascinating.  And then the personal piece that Ewan McGregor tells about his uncle and his personal recollection of the first movie.  That kind of stuff takes it to the next level.  So stop your fussing, take a Prozac, throw away the polyester, sit back and enjoy.

B005ZUR724|1.0|started out fun and excellent, but last night it stopped working, saying I need to update.  problem is, there is no available update.  the game itself is packed with things to do and other people.  as an mmorpg goes, its top notch in almost all categories, especially for a mobile game.  I will change my star rating when this gets fixed, as it truly is a wonderful game.
B00110K62U|5.0|Absolutely superb........!!!!!  After all these years, this continues to be riveting: subject, writing, presentation, perfect talent selection and execution of performances.

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Bottom Line Up Front: Yes, you could creat a better case to protect it from hard hits, drops and waterproof, but you would be making your Kindle the size of a laptop or as heavy as a desktop.  This cover keeps your device decently protected without the sacrifice of bulking up your device.  Pros's: The design of the product provides the consumer with an enclosed case, a device to stand for hands-free viewing and a low-profile open face protection cover.    - Closed...The face cover is not metal, true, but it really doesnt have to be unless you are jumping up and down on the cover or stabbing it with a heel.  It creates enough surface pressure distibution that you can put books on top or even smaller heavy items pressed agains it (as it would be in a purse or a back pack).  The best part is that where are no bulky corners (as most leather covers have) and no exess edges like a standard flip open book style cover would have.  - Standing...not the sturdies device but does the job.  The elastic strap is designed to secure the 1/2 folded cover locked in the back so it provides a reliable stand.  A big unsturdy in the standing position, but not something I worry about as I don't use it in this position unless it's on a table.  - Open...tuck the cover into the elastic strap in the back and you barely notice.  I personally like slim and minimal.  Unlike other protection products like \\"Otter Box\\", it doesn't completely change the profile of the item you wanted, a small slim device.  Con's: The only con I have is in the \\"standing\\" position when the device is folded up mid way on the back to stand the device up horizontally for viewing.  You can use it without securing the strap but it's easy falls down if bumped.  If you use the strap, it looks like it's either going to wear out the strap or that the cover will tear.  I haven't done either but does concern me enough to be cautious.  Overall...BUY IT!  If you want a slim cover for your device for travel, you don't plan on cavediving or taking it to Afghanistan for heavy combat use this does the job.  Take care of your device, I found that when I use covers like \\"Otter Box\\", I drop my devices more...because I'm not concerned about it breaking (testimonial to that company), however I rarely use those cases because they bulk up the item significantly.  Pop your Kindle in, put in in your handbag, backpack, throw it in a pile of other books and papers and don't worry.  This cover does the job!
B0063IH60K|4.0|good app. I laughed at the deal choices at the beginning, but love the option to auto finish. very good app if you like playing solitaire.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Best solitaire out there!  well thought out. It has all the features I was looking for. keep up the good work.
B006C1DH92|4.0|I never really got into fruit ninja but had to leave a review after reading the first review...ah-hahaha &quot;Why would it even be in a boot?&quot; hahaha its the name of the cat...that cat even has his own movie plus he has been around since Shrek 2. some people wanna complain about everything.  &quot;Merry Christmas&quot;, &quot;you mean happy holidays right?&quot;
B0055SWM08|5.0|this is one of the best puzzle games I have ever played. It is a lot like the sliding ice puzzles in Pokemon.  It also has calming music. Well worth the money.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I stopped reading Stephen King after Pet Semetary. As others have said, he stopped ending his books and simply stopped them when he got tired of writing, and I got tired of waiting for an ending that never came. But the premise of this book was too good to pass up. First, I'm a sucker for time-travel stories. Second, the JFK assassination was one of the seminal events of my life, though I was very young when it happened. Third, while I had become totally disenchanted with King's work, I had been told by others whose opinions I trust that his more recent work was getting back to his original promise. So, I picked it up.  I am so glad I did. The book is excellent, beginning to end. Even King's heavy-handed attempts at foreshadowing didn't get in the way of my enjoyment. King creates wonderful characters and makes you care what happens to them, and this book is no exception. Jake and Sadie and Miz Ellie and Deke are like old friends now. The plot's twists and turns were like being on the best kind of roller coaster. And the ending - and there is an ending to this one - was perfect.   Another review called this book \\"mature.\\" I would have to agree. The closest to supernatural this book comes is in the basic trope of time-travel, but the book is about so much more. If you love Stephen King, read this book. If you used to love Stephen King but became disenchanted, read this book. If you have never read Stephen King or think you hate his writing, read this book. You'll be glad you did.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|Great movie for the whole family. Great lesson about what is really important in life. Great cast. Would recommend this purchase.
B001UV4XJ2|2.0|Brought this movie as a christmas gift, loved the idea of digital copy. I didnt know that you had to do all this nonesense just to watch the dvd on anything else but a dvd/blu ray player. Ultraviolet is crap, i thought it would make the movie more enhanced but instead it made me not want to watch it at all! The movie is great, enjoyed it with my family. I just wish I could have watched it on my I touch without needing wifi or any of this other stuff. In my opinion, this is not worth the money!
B0056BU3I2|5.0|This was the best movie of this series. Brought back all the original characters to wrap it up. Best car chase ever! Would recommend this purchase.
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|I did not read the book, so I can't comment on whether the film was faithful to the original. I watched the DVD with my best friend, who had gotten it for Christmas. It seems to be pitched as a \\"feel good\\" movie, but I didn't feel all that good after seeing it.  Don't get me wrong, as story it did what story is supposed to do: emotionally engage, entertain, and portray a world of its own creation. But once the curtain came down, it left me feeling unsettled and chagrined.  The positives are that the time and place are vividly envoked--so much so that I was almost surprised when I looked out my window and saw December in Pennsylvania and not Jackson in the summertime. The plot certainly does grab and hold your attention, and the acting is terrific throughout.  Things that were a bit out of kilter: as someone who grew up in the sixties, I knew right away that Skeeter's hair was way wrong. Everyone, but EVERYONE in 1962 had helmet hair. No way would a girl from an upper-class Southern family be allowed to leave the house with that cloud of spirals floating around her face. Also, the women are too thin. It was the norm for a woman, even a young one, to have a little pot below her waist. Check out period clothing, and you will see that the skirts are actually cut for that type of figure.  I enjoyed the story and portrayal of the maids finally opening up and telling Skeeter their stories, but I was uncomfortable with the idea that blacks could only improve their lot when a benevolent white benefactor swooped down from the sky to lift them up. However, on further reflection I think that is to a certain extent true. This was a period in which blacks were automatically completely discounted as not intelligent enough to lift themselves up, so that it did take a white person becoming involved before most whites would even notice enough to disagree. Not because blacks are by nature stupid and ineffective; but because they were simply invisible to the white world.  I also was hoping Skeeter would stay in Jackson and work for Civil Rights there, but again thinking further, I realized that a woman in her position most likely would've chosen to go to New York. She would probably have believed she could do more good getting her information out to a wider--and white Northern (and therefore more influential) audience, and she would have known there was no future for her as an individual in Mississippi.  So although the film ended as it probably should have, as the denoument to a story it wasn't quite satisfying. But, the film is well put together, the narrative is strong, and the portrayals are excellent. I certainly recommend it, not only as a story but as a launching pad for discussion and real thought about the past and its role in shaping a better future.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|Looking for a 1095 high carbon steel knife that will withstand a lot of abuse & still keep going but not cost you two months wages? Look no further, you've found it. It's 1/4 inch thick full tang Teflon coated steel, with kraton-type handle scales and comes with a fairly decent sheath too. The palm swells in both scales make it little too bulky for my tastes and would be difficult for someone with small hands to use. The scales are soft enough to provide a very good grip but not so soft that they easily pull away from the tang. Personally I'd love to see this knife come with micarta scales instead.<br /><br />The sheath is made of medium weight nylon, has a reverse-able (remove the rivet & replace with another rivet or Chicago screw) plastic insert to accommodate both right & left handed users, and the retention strap is adjustable for tension. It (the sheath) also comes with a removable pocket that is large enough to hold a magnesium bar, small led flashlight, whistle, with a film canister of tinder quik on top.<br /><br />Summary:<br />Since Schrade knives are now produced by Taylor Cutlery in China I was expecting much less quality, especially when it came to the sheath but I have to admit that I am pleasantly surprised at the quality of this knife and would not hesitate to take it to the field as my primary cutting tool. While not quite on par with a Becker BK2 it is very, very close and worthy of the same respect. If you need a good go-to knife and are on a budget you can't go wrong with this one. Definitely 5 stars!
B004SUWR2C|5.0|As a child, Uno was one of my favorite games. Our deck had seen a lot of abuse - cards were bent, stained red from cherry koolaid, corners were torn away. I miss that deck - the cards were soft from use and felt great to handle.  This is a fun version of the classic card game. All of your cards and clustered at the bottom of the screen, and you'll need to tap on them to have them enlarged enough to view. It goes on sale for 99 cents regularly, so I'd suggest waiting and saving a couple of bucks if you're interested in it. The rules are displayed at the beginning and some pop up between rounds. The graphics are pretty good, very smooth actions.  In the games I have played, I have found that the AIs frequently do not call UNO when they are down to one card. If you are quick enough, you can challenge it and make them draw 2 extra cards. You can also challenge when they play a Wild/Draw 4 card. Again, in the modes I've played, the AIs are frequently bluffing and then get saddled with 6 cards. They will also almost always challenge you when you play one, rather than thinking things through a bit logically. I'm not sure if that is deliberate or not.  It's definitely worth $1, I'm not sure if I'd pay the full list price. I might - it's a fun app and I've already spent a few hours playing it in the car.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|This is the pinnacle of the Vacation series.  All of the improbable situations seem so probable in this well-written, well-acted farce that you almost believe it could happen to you.

B000XR4OC0|5.0|I love my Tom's! I am normally a size 6, and found they run true to size. They're comfortable, provide arch support (something that none of my flats do) and support a great company. I bought the ash, which matches nicely with everything. I'm definitely going to buy the red ones next. I've owned them for more than 6 months, and while they've faded a little, they have lasted remarkably well. They're not worn out, and are well made shoes. I would highly recommend these, both because of the company's admirable goals and also because the shoes are so comfortable!
074322454X|5.0|The book looked like new, mailed out promptly, and was as described. I have not read this book yet, so cannot tell you much about it. I wanted it because of the Author, as he is a wonderful writer. I know without a doubt that I will enjoy this book. Thanks to Amazon for having such wonderful sellers.
B006C1DH92|5.0|it is just like fruit ninja but has better features. you can get extra lives on this game where on fruit ninja you can't. I really enjoy this game!
0792844890|5.0|I love \\"Spaceballs\\"!  I had it on VHS tape for years and just upgraded to the DVD.  I can watch this again and again--great cast, great script, and great performances, and on this DVD--great Special Features too.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|We love watching this movie every year.  It is a great tradition.  Get the DVD to avoid the extra 40 minutes of commercials.  Be aware that there is adult language in this movie that is muted in the TV version.  Modern Classic!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|What a gift this is!  It made my father really happy, but you should have seen everyone else who wanted to borrow it!  The price is right and the delivery was fast :)
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This is a funny movie and the kids love it.  There is plenty of adult humor to make it enjoyable for all.  Good one to have in the library.

B004GYNPL2|5.0|I used this app and another pw manager and I like this one the best. The options of backing up the database won me over. The devs are very responsive. I had an odd issue, we did a bit of emailing, and seems with a fresh install, the issue has been fixed. Very professional! Thanks!
B001LF2WCC|5.0|Great movie, got it for my husband.  He did like/read through the book in the front.  Not sure we will use the BD live feature.  Great price from Amazon.
B006C1DH92|2.0|\\"Not compatible with some Samsung devices\\" is a little vague.  For others looking for more detail here (or the devs), it looks like it crashes every time on startup on my Galaxy S Vibrant (SGH-T959, running FROYO.UVKB5).  Shame, was looking forward to this...maybe they'll fix in a future update (in which case I'll update this).
B004HO6I2O|5.0|very funning movies about two different people and ther misfortune and the funny things that life can throught at you,very interesting movie to see how there change can be very interesting and  the things that can happen

B00005Y7KX|5.0|The audio is very strong and definitive, you would think you were actually there.  The story is old, but the richness of the scenes, acting and singing is warm and brilliant.  I wanted this last year, but the price was prohibitive, this year's price was right in my target zone!  We will enjoy it many, many times.

B000VDDES6|1.0|When I bought this there was no product alert like there is now stating that it was for HD dvd players only. Now it's a bust for me to return it as I'll only get 4 bucks back from a refund after paying shipping. It's a great movie but the seller should have made it more clear that you can't play this on a dvd or blu ray player.

1439102813|3.0|This is a scarily detailed, first-person portrait of what it is like to experience early onset Alzheimer's. The author set the characters up quite high, presumably to better contrast with the fall (and also somewhat paralleling her own life), but--fair or not--I have a hard time relating to a famous psychology professor at Harvard who has a great marriage with a husband who is also a Harvard professor and three extremely attractive and for the most part highly successful children. They're too perfect, basically caricatures of themselves. I frequently found the writing awkward, but I can't deny the power of the story. I cried at the end. It hits hard. It could be you; it could be me. It really brings home how frightening and disorienting the experience is and how it can sneak up so subtly and insidiously. Also, don't read it following any extended period of stress, because you'll find yourself wondering about your own actions and mental capabilities. (a la \\"Oh my god, grad school gave me Alzheimer's!\\")
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great app its addicting but fun it may be a little hard but you feel so much better when you complete a mini game its awesome I love it and its free
1402217722|3.0|This is a Georgian (the 1700s), so imagining the men in full dress attire is always amusing. Think powder and wigs and fake moles/facial decorations and just sheer colorful dandyism and ridiculousness. This book also introduced me to the proper meaning behind the line in Yankee Doodle Dandy about sticking feathers in hats and calling them Macaroni.  The heroine, who is plain and has a stutter (and really does stutter through all her dialogue in the book) but is quite outgoing and charming, proposes to marry a handsome and wealthy earl so that her sister does not have to marry him. The characters start with the marriage and then have to figure out how to make it work as they go along. There's a vast age and maturity difference between the leads (our heroine is very young and foolish, and I think I would have found her annoying in person), but it is interesting to watch them come to understand and genuinely care for one another.   I feel for the poor mistress though who had the audacity to aspire above her station due to the earl's seeming affections. There is definitely classicism in the book, as well as mockery of male fashionists.
B004G600A4|4.0|I purchased this dvd for our 5 year old daughter.  She really liked it and we've watched it as a family several times.  I thought it seemed age appropriate for her and also for girls/boys older than her.  The animation is suberb, as always, with any Disney movie, and it contains some catchy tunes that my daughter loves to dance to.
0060853972|5.0|I have been very remiss in waiting until this late age to read this book. It's everything I ever heard people say it would be.   Imagine that there was a bit of a mix-up when the Antichrist was born and he was subsequently off the radar of the Powers That Be and raised as a normal boy. Add to that one slick devil who's got his orders but isn't actually quite sure he wants to bring about Armageddon; a gentle, awkward, bibliophile angel; the adorable and wonderful dynamic between said devil and angel, who've only known each other since forever; the horsemen of the apocalypse in their fashionable 20th century incarnations; a book of absolutely true but hard to decipher prophecies; and a host of minor but entertaining characters. The end of the world's never been this fun! I loved it!
B004U52VPS|1.0|When I shelled out $28 for this product from Amazon, I pretty much knew I was overpaying, but my 8-year-old son wanted this badly for Christmas. When we played it Christmas morning, I realized I overpaid by $28. This game is total junk. The catapult is so useless it makes the game pointless. There seems to be no way to accurately aim the birds. After playing for 30 minutes, almost none of the birds hit the structures. Most of our shots simply dribbled a few inches. Did anyone test this product before it was manufactured? The only way we got it to work was to place the catapult 5-6 inches from the stacks. My son got quickly bored with the game and hasn't played it since. Save your money with this one. If you must have it, buy it at a yard sale. I'm sure there will be plenty of them available this spring.

0521675421|5.0|It's an excellent material if you wanna practice grammar. I was looking for book which could help me to improve my grammar and to learn new common expressions. It has a lot of very good excercises from the real life. I can recommend it. I bought all the series.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|\\"SANTA\\" delivered this to my son for Christmas, he's 6 and a big Lego fan. He has serveral Star Wars kits but nothing this large. As for the cost, the price on this kit ($400) didn't deter me because it being a collector series, the value will remain high. Plus, it's large and full of fun features so he'll get plenty of play time. That's probably one of the best things about this kit is that any child who loves imaginitive play will get alot of playtime with this kit. The makers of this kit were so creative in incorporating several of the movie scenes into the build and several have moving parts. If your child loves creative play and legos, you can't go wrong with this kit. The size of it is approximately beach-ball size, so you're going to need a fairly big space to display it, like the top of a dresser. If you're worried about dust, I'd recommend keeping it covered because over time it will get dirty and is difficult to clean, being so intricate. The packaging is great. Inside the massive box, comes 4 seperate boxes and an instruction manual that rivals the bible in size. :) The stickers are in box #1 so be careful not to toss it as I almost did. As far as build time, it can be done in a couple long days but if you're not the type to sit down for 10 hours at a time, be prepared for it to take a week. I base that on the facdt that we're about half way done after a day of building. Little did \\"SANTA\\" know that this was about as much fun for me and a present for myself for Christmas as much as it was for my son. I can find nothing bad to say about this kit. Simply AWESOME!!!
0521689392|5.0|It's an excellent material if you wanna practice British pronunciation.

It could be intesresting!
B001HN69AY|1.0|Watching this movie was like being trapped in bumper car hell, buffeted all around by outpourings of chaotic acting energy, plotless action, and computer graphics best left to \\"The Revenge of Roger Rabbit\\". How can so many fine actors produce such a scrambled rotten egg?<br /><br />Long before this movie mercifully ends, we can guess that the devil will lose the bet, and the hero (not the villain) will get the girl. A predictable plot ending is an aspect of many movies, the fun is in seeing how the protagonists pull it off. Not so here. I couldn't care what happened to these characters, just that it happened quickly to end this viewing torture.

Hope they make more games like this (or port over myst for the fire)

0142414999|4.0|4/5<br />This is probably my favorite Christmas story that I've read. At least, when it comes to young adult books. (But, to be fair, I haven't read or watched all that many Christmas stories.)<br />It's an anthology of three short stories by three different authors, all taking place near Christmas in the same town during a snow storm (blizzard?).<br />The first story is by Maureen Johnson, who I am a fan of. I haven't reviewed any of her other books, but I have read most of them (all but Devilish and her newest), so I was expecting to like her story. And I did. It's about Jubilee, who dislikes her name (because it comes from a piece in this Flobie Santa Village thing that her parents are obsessed with, which is awesome, not only because her name is neat, but also because I liked seeing the Christmas Village thing mentioned and about how people go crazy over it). She's taking the train to her grandparents (right?) when it gets stuck from the snow, and then she meets Stuart and has to stay with him (and his mother, who are both Jewish). This story was cute, and fun (as is all of Johnson's books, like her), and Stuart was sweet.<br />The second one is John Green's. I've read his other books as well (and watch him on Youtube), so I knew what to expect from it. It's about a boy and his two friends (one a girl and one a boy) who decide to take an adventure to a restaurant in town during the storm. This one was fun, and it has the whole best friends to more thing going for it as well. It was fun, and had Green's normal humor to it as well.<br />The last one was by Lauren Myracle, and I didn't know what to expect because I hadn't read any of her other stuff. It was actually better than I'd though it would be. It was about a girl, who's a bit selfish but works to overcome it. She's supposed to get a little tea cup pig for her friend, and she's missing her boyfriend who she's having problems with but still likes and doesn't know how feels. It was actually a bit fun, and I liked the boy.<br />I enjoyed all of the stories, they were fun and very entertaining. I also liked all of the connections, since most of the characters know each other (as they live in the same town and go to the same school) and we see glimpses of them in each story, as well as a good ending with them all in the last story. And there's just enough romance for each story, but it was mostly a (really) good, funny, Christmas read.yed all of the stories, they were fun and very entertaining.

0545123291|4.0|4.5/5<br />I love this series. I love Maggie Stiefvater, actually. She is amazing.<br />This book was even better than the first. I was kind of wary going into it, because I didn't know what was going to happen, what she was going to do with the characters, and when I saw that she added two more point of views, I was like, 'what?'. I only saw Cole's at first, though, and had only heard of him being a new character, so I thought there was going to be a love triangle thing going on, and I wasn't excited for that to happen. I was very happy to find out that it didn't.<br />The minor characters didn't really stick in my mind from the first one, so I wasn't sure who Isabel was, until I started reading her, then I remembered.<br />Now, I'm really glad that she added them, because I really like them. I almost want to say more than Grace and Sam, but that's not true. I liked all of their chapters. I've already talked about Grace and Sam in the first review, but I'm gonna talk about them some more. I got more of a feel for them in this book, and liked them even more because of it. Cole bothered me at some points, because of his self-destruction thing he was doing, because I'm not a fan of those things, but at other times, especially when he was with Isabel, I really liked him. Isabel I liked all of the time, I think. She was so interesting and very different from Grace, that I might have liked her chapters more than the others.<br />I still love Grace and Sam together, and that love has gotten bigger in this book. I'm hoping that something more happens with Isabel and Cole, because there is obviously something there, and I love them together.<br />All of the plot was interesting, and I liked all of the family things that happened, even if it was bothersome for the characters. I was really happy with what happened with the wolf thing, because I was hoping there was going to be some explanation, and I was happy with the one that it gave.<br />But, that ending. That ending was terrible, such a cliffhanger, and I want to find out what happened so bad. (Obviously not bad enough, or maybe I have been avoiding it for the thought of a bad ending, because I still haven't read it.)<br />Her writing was pretty much the same from the first book, although possibly better; very lyrical and pretty., and I want to find out what happened so bad.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|Watching these altered versions of Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi is like listening to a performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony where several bars of music have been changed randomly throughout.  It's that disconcerting. The recent changes for this Bluray set are absolutely hideous.  Was Lucas freaking high when he ok'd this garbage?    Why not change FLAWS.  Maybe get rid of matte lines, make it so you can't see Dave Prowse's eyes through the Vader mask.  I can live with that.  But these changes?  Dear God.  Lucas actually ruined possibly one of the greatest scenes of the entire series:  when Vader throws the Emperor into the shaft.  Or how about the way the music is made to artificially repeat in the added dewback footage?  Utterly shameful.  Not only do you offend us fans with this crap, but you offend the original artists who worked on these films.   You're not getting another red cent from me, Lucas.  I'm not funding your addiction to destroying three of the greatest movies ever made.
0545259088|4.0|4.5/5<br />The prologue of this book was misleading. It's in Shelby's point of view and it made me think that she was adding even more character chapters. I was confused at first, but glad when I realized that this isn't true. After that chapter, it's Grace's point of view. And we find out that she's been a wolf for a while, and Stiefvater is practically teasing us as we wait for her and Sam to get to see each other. And then in Isabel's chapter how long it's been since the end of the last book, and that apparently she hasn't been talking to Cole either. And we find out that Cole has been leaving her messages that are funny and sad. And Sam has been dealing with Cole and with trying to find out how to fix and find Grace while missing her.<br />I love all of these characters even more now. They are all so different from each other, with their own voices and problems.<br />Isabel is harsh at nature, and she's trying to resist Cole and deal with her family. We see her get closer to her family some, mostly her mother, while staying away from her father until she decides to stick up for the wolves. And I love seeing her fall for Cole, and get emotional over him as she tries not to. I like also that she doesn't put up some huge wall between them or do some big denial thing, she just tries to stay away from him and reverts to being harsh.<br />Cole is still dealing with Victor's death and his family, and slowly finding that he doesn't want to lose himself completely. It's nice seeing him become not so self-destructive as he finds that he prefers being Cole to being Wolf. And his attraction to Isabel is nice. He doesn't seem to think about it a lot, and instead we get all the scenes in her point of view, but it's obvious how he feels by what he does around her, and he's always the first one to make a move.<br />Sam is such a sweetheart. He has to deal with Beck and how he might not know him as well as he thought, and with Grace. We get most of the romantic moments in his point of view, which is just so cute. He thinks about her so much, missing her and wanting her, and it's so obvious how much he loves her. And he gets so embarrassed around her, it is so cute.<br />Grace is dealing with her parents and friends and being a wolf. I like that her parents take a role in the series, because parents don't as much as they should sometimes, but they are just so unreasonable sometimes. Mostly her dad. It's good that she's standing up for herself, it's nice to see how she's grown up from running away from them.<br />I just love the romantic aspect of the book. It's obvious how much Sam and Grace love each other, and it's so sweet and true. There isn't a lot of actual kissing, at least, not enough of it for me, but with how Sam and Grace are affected by each other and how much they think of each other, definitely ups the swoon for me. They're just so cute together.<br />There's some swoon between Isabel and Cole, but they're kind of a side story to Sam and Grace. There's still definitely an attraction, and obviously something growing between them even more than the last book. There's also a bit of kissing, which is cute, and also not enough to sate me. There's seemed more of a relationship still growing, whereas Sam and Grace's was already there and obvious.<br />I'm a little skeptical to how the scientific parts were explained, and how the supposed mostly-cure works, but I'll live with it. And the ending is a little open. It doesn't give as much closure to everything as I'd have liked. I'm going to forever believe that it worked for Grace and her and Sam live happily ever after, or at least mostly. And that Cole followed Isabel, if maybe after a while as they talk long distance, because I don't want them to separate and believe they wouldn't be for too long. I do believe, though, that the relocation would have worked.<br />Despite it being open, I do think it's a pretty good ending and I rather enjoyed the book. Even if I'd have liked some morekissing scenes, or just more scenes between them all later. Because I love the characters so much.ween them all later. Because I love the characters so much.
B00000JMQC|5.0|Most children do not realize that 'Oz' is actually a series of books, each taking you to a different locale, with different characters.  This movie brings to life some of the more memorable characters from Dorothys travels outside of the Emerald City.  My nephews are familiar with the other books in the series, and very much enjoyed seeing them come to life.  On another note, the seller described the product very well, it arrived shortly after ordering it, and it was packaged securely.
0545123275|4.0|4/5<br />I read this a while ago, so I am probably forgetting some things. Plus, I've read the second books, so that one's more clear in my head than the first.<br />I did really like it, though. It was the first book of Maggie's that I read, and I was caught from the beginning. I was intrigued by the synopsis on the back and that didn't lessen any when I started reading it. I love her writing style. It's very lyrical and pretty, calm and exciting. I've read more of her books now, and it just gets better, prettier. Her characters are very different. I usually like reading from different points of view, and she does it very well. And she creates such interesting worlds in her books, and I love how she created her wolves in this one.<br />I like how her wolves are actual wolves when in that form and actual people when human. It kind of bothers me that they supposedly turn into wolves in the winter and are affected by weather. It is kind of believable, and it bothers me as it should because of how it doesn't work for Grace and Sam. Mostly, as I usually do with books, I accepted it and moved on. The end, though, didn't make much sense to me. It seemed like a cheesy, cop out type of ending. I hadn't really processed that there was going to be a second book, though, when I first read it. I thought of that as the actual ending. Now that I've read the second book, I realize and understand that there's more to the story and am very happy about it.<br />I didn't get much of a feel for Grace or Sam in this book, actually. Not that I can remember, at least. I enjoyed reading them, and I'm pretty sure that I wasn't paying enough attention and not that the author didn't write them out very well. I remember that Grace was interesting, and I did like what I read of her. And Sam I might have actually enjoyed more, because how he thinks and with his wolf problem on his mind, I know that I liked his chapters. I don't particularly remember any of the side characters, none of them stuck out, and they got mixed up in my mind.<br />I did feel their connection even from the beginning of the book. I felt why Grace was attracted to Sam, was pulled to him and wanted to be close to him. It made sense to me and I liked it. I never got the creepy feeling that other people apparently did. It seemed very sweet and natural to me.<br />Even with it a little blurry in my mind, I really enjoyed it and it got me sucked into reading more. My review of the second book, Linger, will be up soon. Probably later in the week.ot mixed up in my mind.  I did feel their connection even from the beginning of the book.

B003X5UFWW|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when watching this movie. I initially was thinking, \\"OK, I'll give it 20 minutes if it doesn't capture my attention I'll watch something else.\\" Wow was I surprised! The acting in this movie is excellent, the cinematographer is great and most importantly the story is engaging and well told. Hands down a great movie to catch even if you don't like marital arts films. I typically am not attracted to this genera but this is certainly one to catch, you will do yourself a favor by giving this movie a chance.
0142418471|4.0|4/5<br />I've read John Green's other books, but only David Levithans books with Rachel Cohn. I've enjoyed them all, and was looking forward to reading more. I should have read this a while ago, but I kept putting it off. I'm glad I finally got to it, though.<br />The book is mostly about two boys by the same name meeting. But it's about more than that. They are both having problems with themselves and love. And the book is also about Tiny Cooper.<br />I didn't particularly feel a big connection to either Will Grayson, but I did really like them both. John Green's Will Grayson has problems accepting love, and he's conflicted about things, and emotional with everything. But in the second half of the book, some good stuff happens with Jane, and then he talks with Tiny, and I liked him even more. Especially because of his talk with Tiny. David Levithan's will grayson has depression, so he's also emotional, but he has a hard time dealing with emotions, and people. So really, Will Grayson is emotional and conflicted and will grayson is moody, and they are both a bit self-centered. But they are also both entertaining.<br />Will Grayson has John Greens interest if things, so it has lots of Will Grayson thinking about things and realizing things. And will grayson is very funny while also a bit harsh.<br />Will Grayson has Tiny Cooper, and then Nick and Gary and Jane. They're all good. I like Jane for him, she was fun and works with him. And will grayson has Tiny Cooper and Maura and Gideon, and Simon and Derek. Simon and Derek are entertaining, but we don't see them a lot. Maura I didn't like, because of what she did to will grayson, but I spent most of the book thinking that we were going to get some insight into her and see that will was wrong about her, so I wasn't trying to not not like her. Now I'm still a bit conflicted, because I feel there's something more there, and that we didn't enough closure with her, but I still don't particularly like her. And Gideon, even though we didn't get a whole lot of him, I did like. And he's good for will grayson.<br />Now, Tiny Cooper. Tiny Cooper is gay and big and energetic. He has had way too many boyfriends that have lasted way too short, and he writes a musical about himself which he changes to be about love. He wants appreciation and he wants to do something good for other people. He tries to set up Will Grayson with Jane, and he tries to be good to will grayson. And he's also the main reason that the rating is as high as it is. Because of the musical, which is brilliant (I wish my school did plays that good and the people were that enthusiastic about it,) and because of what the will grayons' do for him. It was infinitely sweet and also funny. It was awesome.<br />I did quite enjoy this book, and I'm looking forward to reading more of theirs, as John Green's will be out in a couple of months and David Levithan already has several out.whole lot of him, I did like.

0671027344|4.0|4/5<br />I was hoping I would enjoy this, and I did. It looked like it would be entertaining because of the way it was written, with the letters and what not, and Charlie, the main character, sounded like the type of character that I enjoy reading about. And he was.<br />First of all, I love Charlie. He is so sweet and sad, such a contradiction, really. He's so innocent while still being sad. He's wistful, and angst-full, and eccentric in a way. And so honest, and modest. His friends are awesome, and he needed to meet them when he did. He needed them to teach him the things he did, and to experience the things he did with them, even if there was also all that anguish that he felt because of them at times.<br />It talks about several issues very well, like what his sister goes through, and what Patrick goes through with being gay, and suicide. He thinks of so many things that made me think about it. I related to him at certain parts, and he just made my chest hurt because of how sad he is.<br />Once I started this book, I wanted to keep reading. But I also wanted to stop several times, because I knew something was going to happen, something that I didn't want to know about yet, or at all. Because Charlie is so full of sadness while still being uplifting. When I got to the end of it, though, and I found out what had happened to him... I can't really decide how I feel about it. Because it's sad, and I understand some of what he was going through. It explains some. But I feel like it wasn't a good enough explanation. It just doesn't seem like that's all that was wrong; like he had some other kind of problem or disorder. Maybe I'm wrong, though; I've never been through what he has.<br />That's the only real problem I had with the book. Besides that, it bothers me how Charlie and Sam were in the end. Generally how all of the characters were in the end, but it makes sense. It can't all be happily ever after. I still love Charlie completely.

1416955070|3.0|~3/5<br />Now, this is a very tentative 3 stars. Tentative as in it could be lower. I'm in a book club, and this was our book for the last few weeks. I was interested, and it sounded pretty good. I'd heard about it before, seen it before, and had almost read it before. I hadn't read it because of the length, (about 485 pages,) and I've found that in longer books, there's a bigger chance of the story being dragged on. And in this case, that's kind of true.<br />I'm going to start with what I actually liked about the book, which is the characters. I don't mind Clary, and I like Jace and Alec and Isabelle, among the others. They're all done very well, and I have a pretty good idea of who they are. And they've got my interest, almost enough to read the next book on my own. I would like to know what happens to them next.<br />And the plot is interesting. The world that it's set in is very interesting, and somewhat different from what I've read before, with the Shadowhunters and how all the other things work. Most of them, at least. There were a couple of twists, mainly the one near the end, that surprised me. And makes me wonder, a lot. I did like this quite a bit.<br />Now, with that out of the way, the writing. It's very simple, in a way that bothers me. And I didn't like how the plot played out. It's not that I think the information was given too quickly, but that there was always a problem, something going wrong. I understand that stuff has to happen in order for a book to be interesting, and one thing that bothers me with how she did it, is that I can't really think of how she would have done it differently. Something always went wrong, but they all had a point, and were foreshadowing to something. But it seemed kind of Disney-like, with the almost exaggerated writing and problems occurring one after another. This is the main reason that I had such a hard time reading this book. It bothered and annoyed me so much.<br />I will be reading the next book, because we are reading it in book club. But I will probably not enjoyed it any or much more than I did this one. I hope that I do, but I doubt it.club. But I will probably not enjoyed it any or much more than I did this one. I hope that I do, but I doubt it.

014241543X|4.0|4/5<br />I read this a while ago, a little before the second book came out. I'd heard a lot about it from other authors and reviewers, most saying how good it was, how much they enjoyed it. (Kiersten White especially.) I was a little wary, because it didn't sound as good, but I didn't like it as much as most people seemed to.<br />I did still really like it. I mostly liked the authors take on moving on, and how Mia was like a ghost while her body was in a coma. I've always found these kinds of things interesting, and wonder about them like most people do.<br />I probably liked this book as much as I did because of her take on that. I liked how Mia walked around and watched her family and friends. I liked most things about the book, really, except for a few things in the plot.<br />I liked her writing. It flowed very smoothly, and it was simple but still pretty. It kept me reading, and I didn't want to put it down. I finished it in a day, I think.<br />I didn't particularly feel for Mia, but I did like her enough. I did like her thoughts on all of the things she saw and what she was doing. I liked going through her memories especially. I liked how Forman did that, too. Put the book together like she did, with going back into memories as she's doing things. It was done very nicely. I did get a feel for why Mia was doing and feeling how she was, even if I didn't feel like she should be having such a problem choosing to stay or not. It didn't feel like there was much question as to whether she would stay or not, but that might have been because I already knew how it was going to end.<br />I definitely did feel her connection with Adam, and her friendship with Kim, and how close she was with her family. I liked all of her memories with them, and I genuinely liked all of them. Because of how well all of that was done probably also made it seem like there was no question as to whether she was going to stay or not, even with her parents and brother gone. Which, by the way, sucked. That was probably the saddest part of the book, aside from seeing her friends and family grieving for them and her.<br />The ending was open, but I didn't have much doubt on how I thought it had ended. But because there's a sequel, or companion if you rather, I figured that obviously something had gone wrong... I'm not going to get too into that, actually. Because I've already read it and will be writing the review of it soon, so I will talk about that in there.<br />Anyway. So, I actually did really like this book. Almost everything about it, really. I would probably even recommend it.y the saddest part of the book, aside from seeing her friends and family grieving for them and her.

0525422943|4.0|4-4.5/5<br />I don't know what I was expecting when I started this book. Because there was a sequel, I know that there wasn't a happy ending and I was afraid that it was just going to get worse. So I was happy to find that I liked this book even more than the first one.<br />I didn't feel a big connection to Mia in the first book, but I felt more for Adam in this one. He's still upset over her and depressed, and I didn't think it was too much. I mean, sure, the part of me that's all for self-love and all that, thinks that he should have moved on a little bit, dealt with it better, but it mostly fits and it was done very well. He didn't seem whiny or anything to me. He was a bit depressing, but I liked it. I like those kinds of characters, though.<br />When I heard about this book, I imagined something more along the lines of Adam and Mia stumbling upon each other in a subway or something and having one night to try to work out their problems, and I imagined that they would fight and talk and all those things, but I was unsure if it would have a happy ending or not. I was really happy to find that this wasn't the case.<br />Instead, Mia is successfully being a musician and Adam is not successfully being in the band anymore because of how depressed he's been. It's sad how badly losing Mia hurt him. And Adam finds out that Mia is playing near him, and despite his promise, he goes to watch her play. I hadn't realized that his promise at the end of the first book was going to be taken seriously. To me it didn't seem like either one of them should take it seriously, that either of them would want to fulfill it, so that bothered me. But I see why it was important, and things played out like they did partly because of it. Then there are some awkward moments and painful moments as they try to talk and find themselves unsure how to do it.<br />Their relationship, as they start talking and start moving on from it, is so sweet. They're much more mature in this book, and they need t move on from some things and they do. They're so very sweet to each other and cute together. They belong together, and they know it. I loved seeing them together in the present in this book. There should be more couples like this in books.<br />The writing was pretty much the same from before. It flows easily and it keeps me compelled to read more.<br />The ending is very fitting to the story. It's showing that they are going to work things out and are going to stay together no matter what happens. And Adam does a bit of growing, as well. I liked that he went to go talk to his band with Mia, and that it shows us that he did work that out, instead of leaving it open to our interpretation.<br />This book was fantastic.

0385535139|4.0|I've been very critical of John Grisham's more recent books and, in fact, I didn't even finish some of them.  He either lost the fire that resulted in books like A Time To Kill and The Firm or maybe he got so caught up in delivering a political message that he didn't focus on the quality of the writing itself.  He drove me away with stories that had more to do with presenting a social message and less to do with providing an enjoyable read.    This is the first Grisham book in a long time that was truly enjoyable from start to finish.  The characters, likeable and not, were always interesting and the story line wasn't telegraphed to the point where you could write the ending yourself.  It's a quick read that will have you empathizing at the plight of some and smiling at the actions of others.  If you've given up on Grisham (as I had) take a shot at this book.  While it's not up there with his best works it's clearly his best novel in years.  I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
B001G1ACVY|5.0|My husband bought this for me several years ago when \\"I'm Yours\\" was just becoming popular. It is by far the most often-listened to cd in my entire collection - and I do listen to the whole cd. Sometimes you buy a cd based on one song and just hope you like the others, but \\"I'm Yours\\" is probably my least favorite of these incredible songs. \\"Make It Mine\\" and \\"Butterfly\\" are now ringtones on my phone - never get tired of hearing them:) As a special bonus, the DVD is wonderful. Great performances by Jason and the band - I constantly listen to it in my van through the dvd player and he sounds just as good live as on any of his cds. You will not be disappointed in anything this package offers.

We were introduced to some new artists and now we certainly want to hear more from them.  We sang along, clapped and I even shed a few tears over the beauty of some of the music.  I definitely recommend this!!
B005MW8CUG|5.0|The sheer amount of smashing pumpkins stuff you get with this deluxe album is amazing. You get 31 songs, a DVD, lyrics, post cards, and a code for downloadable content. All of that and then on top it is one of the greatest alternative albums ever released (In my opinion).<br /><br />The remastered album is great and the unreleased songs (yes you could find most of them if you are a die hard fan) are just icing on the cake. If you already own Siamese Dream it is worth it just for the bonus stuff.
B000065V41|5.0|I absolutely love this movie.  It is, to me, a modern classic, and I cannot wait for the Christmas season every year to watch it.  This version was completely worth the extra money because it contains the complete \\"When Love Is Gone\\" sequence, which is missing from the newer edition.  It also has a number of interesting special features.
0307891372|5.0|This was a gift for Christmas. I have already been playing Skyrim for over 35+ hours prior to getting the guide and getting this makes me want to spend triple that time in the game.<br /><br />The guide is very, very detailed. It goes over every nook and cranny in the game. Every location has a section in the book and the maps are very well detailed. I would suggest getting post-it notes to use for bookmarks in the guide for all the different sections so you can easily turn to them.<br /><br />Prima really outdid themselves with this one.
B003WTE886|5.0|Wow, Taylor Swift is amazingly talented.  This album is one of my favorite.  The lyrics and melodies are good and so is her voice.
B005ZUR724|3.0|how do I update the game? need help???? Olly ready call costumer service .need some advice!?!!!!! greate game anyway ....... helppp
1904994679|5.0|Santa brought this for our son for Christmas... he loves it, and so does his brother and all his cousins (younger and older). Just sort of a bizarro way to introduce the concepts of the breadth of the human condition, I suppose. Generally well done with lots of photos and small, interesting factoids.
B006C1DH92|5.0|Let me start by saying this game is just like the original. It adds a few little twist that give each level a different objective/goal which is great if you dont like repetitive games. Puss adds comments to which are kinda funny and add to the fun. Overall this game is a great improvement over the original. DOWNLOAD ThiS APP NOW!
0767903862|5.0|This is a wonderful overview of a fascinating country. Witty, informative, always drawing you further into the outback of the history of this island/country/continent. I would like to have seen him have more contact with the aboriginal people. He called them the invisible people, treated as something less than human. At one point in the story he even mentions that is was condoned to shoot them if they gathered in groups of more than 6, and it was a state policy to take away their children without any humane, moral or logical reason. They became invisible to him and his travel companions. This seems a shame, because an author of such talent could have shone a big, blaring spotlight on these poor people, instead he just lit a match and blew it out quickly.  I will be reading all of Bill Bryson's books and hope to also find an author who can take up the cause of native, invisible people.
0446573019|4.0|Baldacci is one of my favorite writers, I can always count on a coherent storyline, well drawn characters, and a story that makes one think. I would reccomend this book to any fan of a good intelligent read. take the time to savor the ins and outs of the plot, and the moral dilemmas posed by the story.
B005N95JA4|4.0|What else is there to say about SOME GIRLS?  Almost every critic and the vast majority of fans recognize this album as one of the essential Stones albums; certainly SOME GIRLS is one of the top three Stones records of all time, and it's definitely my second favorite (the criminally underrated VOODOO LOUNGE is first in my affections).  My ears aren't fine-tuned sufficiently to tell much difference between this version's sound quality and the previous one--they both sound good to me.  The key difference, obviously, can be found in the new version's second disc:  the bonus tracks, many of which have been widely available as bootlegs for decades.  I must say that the majority of these previously unreleased tracks are pretty forgettable:  it's pretty clear why Mick and the Boys opted not to include most of these tunes on SOME GIRLS or even EMOTIONAL RESCUE.  Having said that, I must make mention of four wonderful tracks that well deserve your attention:  \\"Claudine,\\" one of the most biting satires in the Stones songbook, making its legit debut have more than 30 years of legal skirmishing; and the three amazing covers included, among them Keith's take on the late, lamented Dobie Grey's country classic \\"We Had It All.\\"  I'm glad that track is finally getting the love it deserves, but I was also blown away by the Stones' takes on the Hank Williams classic \\"You Win Again\\" (just tongue-in-cheek enough to be incredible) and even more impressed with \\"Tallahassee Lassie\\" (with handclaps by John Fogerty!).  So should you buy this release?  Chances are you already have a copy of SOME GIRLS somewhere if you're at all a Stones fan or at least the kind of rock fan who collects all the key records in the genre.  If you don't already have the album, by all means buy this release; if you do already have it, the issue becomes whether or not you want to part with the money for four great extra tracks and eight mediocre ones.  For this Stones nut, there's no question I had to have the \\"official\\" releases of the gems discussed above.  Determine your personal commitment to the band and decide from there.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|some games I don't care for, but others I lose hours playing. I don't like that if ur listening to music, which I normally do, it stops it for a few sec when u enter the app and some games. but its a great time killer and my kids love it. I did have issues with it on my ipod and I had to reload it because it wouldn't start but I still enjoy it very much!
B00063EMJ6|5.0|I bought this CD for my 14 year old Godson who is very into music.  He's an 'old soul' and very into songs and lyrics.  I knew this would be the perfect CD to introduce my Godson to the beauty of Neil Young's music AND lyrics.  It was a hit!  :)
B003Y5H5FQ|5.0|This was a really good movie, and it was fun to watch. The visual effects were great, and the 3d was magnificent. What I love about this movie is that despite the fact that it's another vampire movie (and a remake at that) the story was unique and original. The acting was great too. There is only one instance that I thought seemed unlikely even if vampires were real. After their house exploded, the next morning there still were no cops there? Anyways, I don't think it took away from the movie. The movie wasn't exactly scary, but it was a fright fest, and there were several scenes that had my heart racing.  The movie really was more than great. I thought it was one of the best I've seen in a while.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great game fun to play. Haven't had any bugs. Wish the auto complete was faster so I can get going with my next game but other than that great app.
0345472322|5.0|Monday, 26 December 2011<br />Do you consider yourself work in progress?<br />Do you consider yourself a work in progress or a finished product?How does  your belief on such issues as IQ and innate talents, affect you in different areas of your life?Professor Carol S. Dweck , Ph .D. of Stanford university  analyses this in her  246 pages long book called \\"Mindset:The new psychology of success\\" published  in 2006.I read it recently and found it simply written but very profound .You  can call it a self help book , because it helps us to understand the meaning and  importance of mindset and  what needs to be done to succeed in life .It is a book on psychology and success.But it does not talk about positive or negative attitudes or thinking.The book has eight chapters , three on what mindset is , and four chapters on the role of mindset in sports,business, relationships and parenting/education .The last chapter is on changing the mindsets.Key words are growth , mindset, belief , effort and ability.<br />The book has changed my thinking on mindsets , and has succeeded in convincing me that in all areas of life , the role and contribution of effort , persistence and resilience is far more important than those of ability and talent.It has helped me to understand the most direct way to succeed in  any chosen area of life.I do believe now that growth mindset leads to success in most areas of life.I also believe that mindset can be changed.<br />  Mindset is a belief about our qualities and abilities.Mindset is also a belief about what makes us successful .Carol divides mindsets into two types.Fixed mindset is a belief that our qualities , abilities and talents are in our genes and cannot be changed .Growth mindset is a belief that our qualities , abilities and talents can be cultivated ad changed by efforts, perseverance and resilience.Then there is a belief that success is mainly determined by our abilities.The opposite belief is that success is 99% hard work and innate talent contributes very little to it .You may win once with ability but to win over and over , you need character which comes out of growth mindset.Carol quotes John Wooden:\\"I believe , ability can get you to the top but it takes character to keep you there.\\"In fixed mindset , you can win games .But to win championships , you need growth mindset.It is the growth mindset which changes life.<br /><br />Our traditional belief is that Intelligence Quotient(IQ) is innate and hardwired .It broadly remains unchanged  in our life.But Carol quotes Alfred Binet, the inventor of IQ as below:\\"With practice , training , and above all , method , we manage to increase our attention , our memory, our judgment and literally to become more intelligent than we were before.\\"Our IQ is not fixed , it can be changed .The same is true of other abilities or talents .We need to change our belief that our abilities are fixed .We need to develop a growth mindset  ,or the belief that we can acquire any ability , including the artistic ability with training.In other words , we can become \\"smart\\"with hard work.There are no short cuts in life.Then success becomes a function of having a growth mindset.Mindset  affects all areas of life from sports , business, leadership , education , parenting to  relationships.<br /> It is not necessary that we automatically  have a growth mindset in all areas of life .We may have fixed mindset in certain areas of life and growth mindset in the remaining areas of life. We need to know  and analyze our mindset.Then we must change our mindset to growth mindset in those areas of life , where for the present it is fixed mindset.<br />This premise of the book comes up against the widely prevalent American  culture which values effortless accomplishment higher than achievement with efforts.Malcolm Gladwell , the author and New Yorker writer, \\"has suggested that as a society we value natural , effortless accomplishment over achievement through effort.\\"The book says that youshould be hardworking , even if you are smart /talented.\\"The story of the tortoise and the hare, in trying to put forward the power of effort , gave effort a bad name.It reinforced the image that effort is for the plodders and suggested that in rare instances, when talented people dropped the ball , the plodder could sneak through\\"<br />I think , Asian  culture also(?) prefers effortless accomplishments , though I am not aware of any studies which might have been done in this regard , in any country of Asia.<br />The self-esteem movement also presupposes a fixed mindset .Carol's advocacy of  growth mindset , to some extent goes against self-esteem movement .<br />What is more important , brilliance /smartness/ability or effort/hard work/perseverance/resilience?Carol comes fully in favour of the latter(Growth mindset). There are no natural geniuses.Creativity is not magic. Becoming is better than being.It prefers\\" Doing the best \\"over \\"Being the best\\"Taking charge of process brings success.It accepts and embraces  challenges. Growth mindset promotes team work , persistence in the face of setbacks.It attacks elitism, and credits fixed mindset with being a loner .Growth mindset implies full and open discussion of all information, culture of self examination, open communication and team work.It produces perseverance and resilience , which are number one ingredient in creative achievement.A growth mindset person must address every criticism and learn from it.It finds lessons and inspiration in the success of others.In the event of failure, growth minded people take the blame on themselves while the fixed mindset people blame others.\\"As you become a more growth minded person, you are amazed at how people start to help you, support you.they no longer seem like adversaries, out to deny you what you deserve.\\"<br />We need to believe in growth mindset .Train our mentee in this mindset .Fulfill our own mission and the growth of our mentees.Mentoring and learning needs perseverance.<br />One important corollary of growth mindset is that when we recruit people to man important positions , we should select people with growth mindsets , and reject people with fixed mindset , however talented that may be .<br />One drawback of the book is that it does not tell how to switch over from a fixed mindset to a growth mindset .But Carol does suggest us to ask ourselves a few questions and try to find answers to these.What are the opportunities for learning and growth today, for yourself as well as for the people around you?Make a plan or a project to change your mindset and to grow, and act on these.Take steps to maintain and continue the growth.Develop or attend a workshop to change mindset from fixed to growth.Develop study skills , study strategies and new learning styles.<br />  I have been a student of motivation and have frequently delivered talks on motivation .When we discuss the role of praise as a motivator , we praise the ability and very rarely , we praise the effort .Carol says that we must praise the effort and the achievement , and not the ability .This may sound radical , but Carol backs it up with her research findings.It is an important and profound insight.I tend to agree with the author.<br />The role of ability or talent in success is over rated .A one time winning of Gold Medal , in a university or school , is not important  in the long term success in life.<br />Mindset plays an equally important role in relationships and love.Is chemistry more important than relationship skills , or the other way round? .A fixed mindset blames character flaw in the partner while a growth mindset tries to understand and encourages forgiveness.A fixed mindset , when it sees character flaws in the partner , becomes contemptuous of partner and dissatisfied with the whole relationship.Growth mindset sees conflict as a problem to be solved.However , Carol does not answer all questions in this area.Fixed mindset requires or expects a partner to have total or uncritical acceptance .Growth mindset requires /expects the partner to learn new things and become a better person .I am not sure , if expecting a change in partner really makes a relationship better .I feel , in the area of relationship , the growth mindset raises more questions than answers.What if one partner has a fixed mindset and the other a growth mindset?Perhaps a more thorough analysis is called for .But Carol is at her best when it comes to learning and education .She gives very inspiring examples of Marva Collins and Esquith.<br />About Marva Collins and Esquith  , Carol says;\\"Collin's students read and discussed every line of Macbeth in class.Esquith spent hours planning what chapters they would read in class.It takes enormous energy to plan a passage for each youngster.Esquith's class often met before school, after school and on school vacations to master the fundamentals of English and maths.His motto:\\"there are no short cuts'.'<br />Marva Collins has no doubt about the role of effort:\\"There is no magic here.I do not walk on water.I just love children and work harder than a lot of people, and so will you\\"Growth mindset motivates us to learn and improve, and make efforts.<br />In Seven Habits of highly effective People , Covey  also talks about responsibility .Responsibility comes with growth mindset only .<br />The book describes three model leaders with growth mindset;Jack Welch , Lou Gerstner,and Anne Mulcahy.All leaders need to have a growth mindset.There is a relationship between leadership and our capacity to grow and develop.<br /><br />This book has been able to break many of my beliefs on some very important but obvious things .I have begun to see and admire people more on the basis of their efforts,achievements and honesty and less on the basis of their talents.I have begun to have more faith in intelligent hard work .I have stopped living under the shadows of trophies, gold  medals , awards that I happened to have won in the past .<br />Read it and see what this book does to you.t is that when we recruit people to man important positions , we should select people with growth mindsets , and reject people with fixed mindset , however talented that may be .

B0055SWM08|4.0|my only complaint is its like way easy amd it goes by too fast but other then that its pretty good not ganna lie pretty good
B004LWZW42|3.0|This movie is not as good as the first x-men movie, maybe slightly better than the 2nd x-men movie, better than the 3rd in that trilogy (not saying much really considering the 3rd). The pacing of this movie was its biggest problem, it felt more like a music video or a clift-notes version of an actual movie than an actual movie. best part of the movie would be magneto and professor x's relationship, not in the least because they are the only two characters developed enough to be legit characters. there are worse ways to waste part of an afternoon *shrug*

0385344325|5.0|I have read all the Lee Childs books with Jack Reacher as the main character and each one just gets better. this new one The Affair is certainly one of his best. I read it on my new Kindle Fire ,which I just got for my birthday.
B006JPS1OM|4.0|It was a great, fun game. I could play it all day. I recommend this game to anyone who is into mystery or detective work.
0385535139|5.0|Loved the book, but wished it didn't end.  The story was certainly not great literature, but it was very, very enjoyable.  Following the exploits of a down and out, ambulance chasing law firm was interesting and somewhat funny.  When a new, young lawyer joins the firm, things start to happen.  It was interesting to follow the high points, as well as the low points in each of the characters lives.  The reader will actually like the characters.  I know that I would have liked it to go on.  I could actually see a tv series or a movie made from this story.  I would definitely recommend this book to all.
B005ZUR724|5.0|Since the newest update this game has begun to work FABULOUS for me!!! YAY! Gameloft Should keep up on the updates to make sure all bugs are not buzzing around ;-)  Thanks
B005OGYH90|5.0|First I thought that this was a DVD with CD bonus...but it's ok...I should have read the intire description of the item...  The album captures the feeling of the Live concert...there's a lot of great songs...Slash is a GREAT guitar player...and Myles Kennedy is a very good singer!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is a very addicting game.  The free version has ads, but they are hidden in the corner and are very small, so it is not something to mind.  The game works well on the Kindle Fire and it is very enjoyable
B005ZUR724|1.0|This game has its ups &amp; its downs. The ups... it is full of fantasy and adventure. But this game should have more races and classes and curtain races shouldn't be allowed to be curtain classes. This game also needs a bigger and better story line. THE BIG THING THAT I NOTICED is that there are no mounts. I have two major sources for you. Sony's Vanguard and ncsoft guild wars trilogy. That's all.
B006C1DH92|5.0|Its an awesome game. Its like fruit ninja except with a few more features. Its one of my favorite games I downloaded on my kindle fire so far.
B005FVA63A|3.0|The content in this box is fantastic. Yes, for the more die hard fans some of it is redundant but it's packaged nicely. The only downfall with this boxset is the construction of the actual box itself. The bottom tray is extremely difficult to pull out. I pulled the bottom tray out completely and discovered that the upper tray is tilted at an angle which puts a lot of pressure on the tray when you're trying to slide it out. Which also caused the front of the bottom tray to rip already. For the price I would have expected a higher quality and a better quality check.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is a good time waster. it makes you competitive and want to get more points. I would definantly recommend this game to someone else if they are looking around for great games.
B00457WZEI|5.0|This was an amazing book. Makes you realize that humans were not just fighting the war. I read the book before I went to see the movie
B005ZUR724|1.0|beyond pissed I spent money and the app tells me I need to update too a newer version. there is no newer version and yes. I'm using a kindle fire. so please. don't buy this game
B005ZUR724|1.0|I didn't even wanna give it 1 star. Same mysterious and unavailable update. Spend your money more wisely than we did.
B00457WZEI|5.0|I normally do not read youth books, but with the release of the movie, I decided to read the book before taking my grandson to see the movie. I purchased it at Amazon for the new Kindle I received for Christmas. It is enjoyable reading for all ages, especially those who have a fondness for horses.
B005OCFGTO|4.0|I bought this on Black Friday, I think, so I got all 8 movies for $40.  Incredible price to get all 8 movies, including HP 7 part 2.  However, when I got it, they do not have individual covers, and there is a broken plastic piece.  Providing the other piece doesnt break, it will be ok.  But for the regular price of like $80...I'd rather buy them all separately , which you can do for less than $50. I purposely didnt buy any of them over the years because I knew there would be a box set, but I didnt know it would be so bare bones.
B004SRNH10|1.0|my devic has Android 2.2 and i still cant install it. plz make available for Cruz T301 since its for all &quot;Android&quot; devices.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|had me laughing out loud on pretty much every page.  everything you'd expect from tina fey.  kind of makes me wish palin was running again in 2012 so we could see tina again on SNL (but not really).
B004SBQGHS|1.0|shud be available for Cruz T301, it has android software. Clearly something is wrong, just dont understand why I cant install on my &quot;Android&quot; tablet? :( plz fix
B0063IH60K|5.0|Overall a very great card game and great app, a must have. I enjoy playing this in my spare time at work. Or when I'm just sitting around the house
B0002BO05S|4.0|This movie is close to fifty years old but retains a current feeling. A must see for all Christians. It is not the passion but it tells the complete story of Jesus on earth
B004UFEJS0|4.0|When I found out one of my former high school classmates was the voice of the rat, I had to get it.  It turned out to be a pretty good movie and my 2 year old daughter loved it.  All I hear is \\"I wanna watch rat movie.\\"  Family friendly.  Would recommend if you have kids and still have not seen it.
B004LWZW4C|3.0|The movie itself was great!  One of the better super hero movies to come out in the last several years.  HOWEVER, I could not get the blu-ray disk to play on my Vizio blu-ray player.  Every time I put the disk in, it would just freeze the player.  I was able to watch it on my laptop, but not on my big screen like I would have liked to.
B002SJKWZ4|4.0|A very creative and cool gift. I got this for my loved one for Christmas and he loves it. The wand is a universal remote that works with all domestic electronics. Unfortunately, the company did jack up the price to $90 when I ordered for Christmas but it was well worth it. An amazing conversation piece and a great gift for Harry Potter lovers alike.
B006C1DH92|5.0|Puss in Boots is finally here for our Android devices. I've been waiting for this since Black Friday and we finally have it :D
B003L77TZI|4.0|This was purchased for my daughter for Xmas and it's been in her cd player since, she loves it. I don't think it's too bad either.
B003YGSLDA|3.0|I bought this for my adult child and got the blu-ray version.  He said the quality is not that of the current blu-ray movies.  I guess now we know not to buy an older movie on blu-ray.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|The weather forecast is great but it doesn't have any maps or radar for the Kindle Fire.  My ipod and htc have maps and radar but the kindle does not.  Would be 5 stars if it did.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|Wonderful DVD.  I received the DVD within a week and and kids love it - perfect for Christmas - thank you!
B006C1DH92|4.0|A great game! nice to know halfbrick. didn't forget us. But there is one bug, the touch is too slow...
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I love this game solo much I have on my ipod touch, my droid, and my kindle fire and I play it every time I have the chance
B0054DFIIM|5.0|...of their craft, whether songwriting or playing or singing is where you choose to go rummaging to get to the bottom of their endless genius......make no mistake, my friends, this latest release is only further proof that when a band's got it, they got it, and we get it......sure i have favorite tracks, but the whole damn album flows perfectly......been listening OVER and OVER to catch little things with the keyboard (or drums, or vocals, guitars, etc. etc.) because the more you listen the more you hear these guys packing so much unbelievable stuff into every song..... have followed many great bands over time, and am as excited to see KC in Chicago on their 2012 US Tour as any concert EVER!......Oh yes, this is what it's all about.
B003L77GGU|5.0|This season of Supernatural is great! I love the actors and the plot. The season has alot of twist and turns. The Blu-ray quality is increadible.
B005WFUZTE|4.0|Sudden Death alone is worth the price of admission. I dare say that it has a Hangar 18 and Polaris feel and sound to it. The album as a whole doesn't come close to RIP but it is excellent none the less. I think it's heavier and faster than Endgame. Stand out tracks for me are Sudden Death, 13 (great lyrics), Never Dead (awesome intro) and Deadly Nightshade. Can't wait to see them perform some of these songs in the flesh.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I love my iPhone and have been an admirer of Apple products for quite some time so I was anxious to read the Jobs biography. I'd heard how Steve Jobs could be a real SOB and this book certainly revealed that because it has quotes from friends and foes. Early on I found myself telling people I didn't like Steve Jobs at all as a person. I thought that might change as he matured and went through the cancer but it didn't. Even at the end of the book, despite admiring what Pixar and Apple have accomplished I could not bring myself to like Steve Jobs. I understand he was passionate but I'm a believer that you can accomplish great things without abusing and alienating so many people. I can understand that behavior in the military where life and death decisions are made but not in American business in the 21st century. Kudos to those who were able to put up with him. Having said all that, it's still a fascinating read with one exception. The author constantly writes about Jobs's \\"reality distortion field\\" as if it were some magical power he possessed that other people don't. Jobs was simply a visionary with a strong will to succeed. Like many entrepreneurs he was able to get a great team and inspire them to carry out his vision. Whether or not you are an Apple lover, this is a very good read.

B002KAOSEW|1.0|This is the twelfth installment of Lee Child's mystery/suspense series featuring Jack Reacher, an ex-Army MP, who is now a drifter carrying only a passport, an ATM card and a folding toothbrush. Reacher is making his way diagonally across the country from Maine to San Diego by hitching rides and walking. After being dropped off in Hope, Colorado, he decides to visit the Despair, which is the next town to the west. He is then arrested for vagrancy, kicked out of town and warned not to return.  Obviously, there's something going on in Despair and, of course, Reacher ignores the warning and goes back to Despair. He fights with eight deputies, putting them in the hospital, burns down the police station, wreaks a few police cars, breaks into a recycling plant, destroys property, threatens a judge and commits other acts of mayhem and violence. All this gets a little repetitious and somewhat boring since Reacher never even gets a scratch and the police, after easily arresting him in the beginning of the book, are now inept and incapable of stopping him. Finally, without going into a lot of detail, the overall mystery is ridiculous and the 'villain' is just a inept caricature.  If you're reading the Reacher series, skip \\"Nothing to Lose\\" so that you don't lose any time reading this very disappointing book.
B0027DK206|5.0|I was a little reluctant about purchasing the film back because of some of the negative reviews. Specifically the film jambing after the 3rd exposure. But I used it on Christmas to take pics of relatives and used 3 packs of film and it has worked flawlessly. Not to mention it's alot of fun. It was surprisingly easy to install on the camera and to load the film. It's really helpful for someone learning how to use one of these cameras too. My sister bought a Diana last year but quickly was intimidated by the 120 format film and the limited stores selling the film and processing it too. So I thought the Instant back would be a great way for her to take the training wheels off and finally use the camera. In theory, I thought it would be a great way for her to instantly see how the pictures will come out. So far, it has worked and she is using the camera again. In short, I had high expectations for the instant back and it's delivering. Use the flash indoors, set the camera to \\"N\\" and \\"Cloudy\\", select your distance on the lens, and snap away. It's a blast.
B0059XTUMC|4.0|THE ARTIST is a delightful, engaging an inventive film.  Its own artifice and cleverness cause the ending of the film to be a slight emotional letdown...but that being said, the journey is so pleasurable.  If you haven't heard, THE ARTIST is a silent (at least, 99% silent) film, shot in gorgeous black and white.  It's film about the time in film history when silent film was giving way to \\"talkies.\\"  Writer/director Michel Hazanavicius has crafted a loving tribute to that era, chiefly by fully embracing the over-acting (required for silent film), the camera angles and the pacing of those films.  Even his \\"special effects\\" hearken to that era.  It is, simply, a marvelous exercise in what I can old call \\"old-fashionness.\\"  Best of all are the two sparkling lead performances, both garnering deserved awards consideration.  Ridiculously handsome Jean Dujardin plays George Valentin.  He's a big silent movie star, churning out light-hearted action-adventure films (yes, he seems like a combination of Douglas Fairbanks and Rudolph Valentino).  His signature hero is adept at narrow escapes, hand-to-hand combat and charming the ladies.  His smile is mischievous and adorable.  You can instantly see why he's a star.  In real life, he's equally charming...in what seems to be a genuine way.  He's a likeable guy.  He's enamored; first and foremost, with himself...there are several funny shots of him adoring his own image in the mirror.    One day, while being interviewed after a premiere, he literally bumps into Peppy Miller (a radiant Berenice Bejo), a fan of the star and also a wannabe actress.  The two share a bit of light banter, and the press captures it all.  This helps her secure a walk-on in George's next film.  It is during their incredibly brief scene together, which we see being filmed through several takes, that the two fall in love.  These few moments of filmmaking are among the most purely romantic, mostly startlingly detailed and yet endlessly light-hearted bits of cinema I've seen in years.  Each time they must reshoot the brief dance sequence we see their fondness for each other grow.  It sounds utterly implausible...but it's dazzling to behold.  And you know it's a good scene, because later in the film, when we see part of it again for about 5 seconds, it's hard to fight back a tear.  Shortly after the two dance together, the studio decides to stop making silent movies.  George refuses to believe talking films are the future, whereas Peppy quickly emerges as a rising star.  I won't go into details, but not surprisingly, the paths of the two almost-lovers head in opposite directions.  George's marriage falls apart (and it is in his lousy relationship with wife that we see George isn't just a nice guy, but is capable of selfishness and even cruelty).  And he begins to fall apart too.  I don't want to say more...because while the plot of the film is actually relatively predictable, it is also told so sweetly as to seem new and fresh.  Dujardin and Bejo have chemistry to spare, and give heartfelt performances.  Bejo has a fragility that we scarcely see in film anymore, and Dujardin is a revelation.  The two stars are ably assisted by a variety of familiar American faces, such as John Goodman and James Cromwell...but this is their film and they utterly own it.  I feel that the final scenes of the film are pretty predictable (in fact, afterwards, my family and I agreed that we sort of saw it all coming about midway through the film), and thus the emotional build that we've been going through does not get a strong pay-off.  I smiled at the end, but with perhaps a little more care and creativity, I could also have been wrenched pretty well emotionally.  The final scene is CLEVER...but it is calculated.  All of THE ARTIST is clever and calculated...but it's imbued with an enthusiasm and love of film that makes it work so very well.  There are a few moments when we perhaps linger on a close-up of George a bit too long, or when the scenes of his films are shown just a bit too much...but otherwise the film moves along at a brisk pace.  And the musical soundtrack is virtually perfect.  The film MUST win an Oscar for best score...the film literally would not work without the brilliant music of Ludovic Bource.  THE ARTIST is a film of nearly unbridled passion for movies and movie-making, with a deeply romantic heart.  If a black and white, silent film doesn't sound like your cup of tea...you are wrong.  In about 5 minutes, you'll forget both.  Treat yourself to one of the year's true movie pleasures.

B005FITIK0|3.0|Your enjoyment of YOUNG ADULT will depend pretty much on how able you are to enjoy a well-acted, well-written movie that also features a thoroughly unlikeable and irredeemable lead character engaging in fairly trivial and uninteresting activities.  The excellent (at least in this film) Charlize Theron plays the lead character, a modestly successful ghost-writer of young adult novels who is nonetheless  deeply unhappy because her high school love (Patrick Wilson) is happily married to someone else (Elizabeth Reaser).  Although decades have gone by since high school, Theron is unable to shake the idea that she and Wilson belong together.  So she returns to her home town with the express purpose of seducing Wilson into realizing his mistake in marrying and to return to her.  To say that Theron is delusional is not a stretch.  I think the film wants us to see her as \\"trapped in adolescence and unable to move on.\\"  I see her as crazy, unlikeable and unsympathetic.  She's a drunk (I'm not sure I've seen a female character more addicted to the booze since the days when Liz Taylor slung her whiskey around in VIRGINIA WOOLF) of the first order.  She's incapable of seeing true emotion in others...yet she's also almost completely non-self-aware at the same time.    During her time in town, she shares a few drinks with Patton Oswalt, a former classmate who was a victim of some SERIOUS bullying back in the day.  Oswalt is now a self-conscious nerd, with a serious limp due to a beating he received...a disability he seems to use as an excuse to hide himself from the world.  He, too, is scarred and changed by his adolescence...but he's the pitiful character, because he IS self-aware.  He's also oddly drawn to Theron, and the two develop an interesting and surprising relationship that is the best part of the film, BY FAR.  Oswalt, always a solid actor, really takes a big leap in vulnerability.  The hints of real acting chops he showed in UNITED STATES OF TARA come into full realization here.  Wilson does his patented \\"handsome, slightly boring but generally agreeable guy\\" character.  (See anything from LITTLE CHILDREN to LAKEVIEW TERRACE.)  He is NOT an exciting actor, and is often actively annoying (see PHANTOM OF THE OPERA...or not).  Often, he is cast opposite far more exciting performers (whether Kate Winslet or Samuel Jackson) and never comes out ahead.  It's much the same here...but his natural blankness works better, because we can never quite tell if he's interested in Theron still or just being a tolerant nice-guy.  Reaser shows some nice levels in the fairly thankless role of Wilson's wife, and it reminded me of how truly terrific she was in SWEETLAND.  The film is written by Diablo Cody (JUNO) and directed by the extremely talented Jason Reitman.  The screenplay is witty and less \\"cutesy clever\\" than JUNO.  Cody is a super sharp observer of mundane details...and Reitman (THANK YOU FOR SMOKING, JUNO, UP IN THE AIR) is fantastic at taking dialogue heavy movies and making them pop, move and sizzle.  Cody & Reitman make a great team.  The problem is...YOUNG ADULT is ultimately not an engaging story, and Theron's character is reprehensible in her self-delusion.  At first we laugh at her, then gasp in horror and finally are simply glad to be out of her company.  Everyone has done a really first rate job of bringing the movie to life...but there really is no point to having put in this effort.    Therefore, I say again...you'll enjoy this film as much as you are able to simply enjoy the writing and performances for what they are, and ignore the awful character and story they're all working on so hard.

1451627289|1.0|This is the second book I have read by Stephen King and it solidified my view that he is a mediocre writer. The only reason I bought this book is become I am a JFK assassination addict. I thought maybe King would have an interesting take on the event. What a hokey novel. A worm hole in the back of a diner transports the hero to the \\"Land of Ago\\". Then King sticks in three or four ancillary situations to fatten up the novel. Silly circumstances abound. A long long drawn out boring read.

B005LAJ16I|2.0|Here's a recurring red flag that I always ignore, to my detriment.  When a piece of entertainment is described as a thriller, particularly like this one, a political thriller, and then all the reviews discuss primarily how it's all about 'characters', their development, depth, etc, then I should always know the plot is either underdeveloped, written as they go with no direction, or is otherwise hackneyed.    So in general, we should have known that this was not going to live up to our hopes.  Here are a handful of the warning signs we should have spotted early on:  1. \\"From the creators of 24!\\" I know, right? 24 was super stupid with thin plots stretched over 24 dragged out 40-minute blocks.  Entertaining as hell for brief stretches until you realize they're writing it on thr fly.  Here they have a narrative arc, but it sure would have been much better as a 2, 4, even 6 hour block with a resolution.  2. Evil mastermind!: (SPOILERS) Abu Nazir sure managed a clockwork plot here, eh? He knew Brody would be back in town for just a few weeks and would be in a locked room with the VP, the SecDef, the joint chiefs! Fascinating.  Figured he'd be asked to run for Congress! Sure good fortune that the old lady with the apartment overlooking the VP site happened to head to a bingo game in the hinterlands the night before the announcement too!    3. The daughter!: From the creators of Kim Bauer.  God she was omnipresent and you just knew down the stretch she'd be present in every key juncture of Brody's evil plan.  Pickin' up my bomb vest? Hey Dad, what's that!? Praying on my prayer mat? Hey Dad, here I am! Puttin' on my bomby vest! Hey Dad, why's the door locked? Pullin' the trigger on my bomby plot! Hey Dad, PROMISE ME YOU'RE COMING HOME! IT WAS SUPER EASY TO REACH YOU IN THE BUNKER THERE WITH EXACTLY ONE SECOND TO SPARE.  Dumb-da-dumb-dumb.  If I were the CIA head I would hire the daughter cause she's super stealthy and everywhere!  Speaking of the CIA....  4. Cut rate DennisHaysbert! Anyone belive this guy as head of the CIA? Anyone shocked he was in league with:  5. Nefarious Vice President! In fairness, this came up later in the run.  Bad actor plus totally implausible VIDEO OF HIM ORDERING SCHOOLCHILDREN'S DEATH?! REALLY?!    6. Claire Danes is Bipolar! So you knew the scenery chewing was coming! Every time she took the pill, you knew she was eventually not going to have her pills, huh?  I MUST HAVE A GREEN HIGHLIGHTER!  She's perfectly good in this, and will probably win an Emmy and that's probably fine.  It's about characters mind you.  7. Mike! The new dude who was all over the place for half the eps and then got beat up and disappeared! By the way, what happened to that dumb couple who were setting up the sniper house? They sure subverted stereotypes there, eh?   8. The whole Brody family! See here again, I should know.  When my taut political thriller is going to involve lots and lots of family-home-life I no longer care.  I have Mad Men for that.  So when we got to the end and Brody chickens out and tells Abu Nazir some new crappy plan and Nazir's like: yeah, PERFECT, shoot my other guy there and let's totally change gears even though my SUPER TRICKY PLAN SHOULD HAVE GONE DOWN, but I'm cool, I'm cool, that wasn't HARD OR ANYTHING GETTING YOU ALL BRAINWASHY AND INTO A ROOM WITH HALF THE POWER IN D.C. AND COORDINATING WITH A MARINE SNIPER ALSO ON THE PAYROLL, GO AHEAD AND JUST SCRAP THAT, WE'LL DO THIS ON THE FLY.  Stupid, stupid plot.  I see all critics are giving it a pass becuase Claire Danes and whoever played Brody are just so deep and 'broken' and ... whatever.  This show is perfectly fine and probably worth your time, sort of , let's just not rush to call it such extraordinary fare.  It's better than 24 or that dumb movie where Tim Robbins is a home-grown terrorist BUT NOT MUCH.

1451627289|4.0|I read pretty much everything Stephen King wrote for the better part of a decade. Even then, there were some misses along with the hits. For every The Stand, there was a Christine; for every It, there was a Firestarter. But then, some time in the early 90s, the hits started becoming more few & far between (Delores Clairborne; Gerald's Game; Rose Madder). I know some love the Gunslinger series, but that never resonated with me. While his short stories & novellas could consistently be counted on to producer at least some good enjoyable tales, the body of work was just not as good, especially with the full length novels.   I really enjoyed 11/22/63, though. Few characters in the King library of works are as fully drawn as Jake. The depictions of Derry & Dallas are equally vivid. Long time King fans will love the cross-overs to some earlier works, notably It.   Does it go on too long? Yes. There are about 200 pages of \\"today I watched Oswald brush his teeth... then he went to the store... he yelled at his wife when he came back\\". Even at his best, King could have benefited from an editor with the will to stand up to him & say, \\"hey, this can be trimmed down.\\" The ending actually is the one part that feels a little rushed. I never did get the \\"Yellow Card Man\\" completely, nor the \\"Jimla\\" references - I kept waiting for something much bigger & profound, but it never materialized. In spite of those critiques, it still felt like a satisfying conclusion, emotionally.   King has an incredible ability to cause me to keep turning the pages. When he locks into a compelling story, as he does here, it is a joy to get in the backseat & let him drive... even if that drive meanders some. Solid 4 stars.

B003NFM3JK|4.0|After reading other reviews, I was reluctant to purchase this DVD, but my husband really wanted it so I did.  I certainly understand the sensitivity to scary scenes for small children - but the same would be true for the original and most other versions of \\"Christmas Carol\\".  It is a somewhat dark story - with a redemptive ending.  The dialogue is very close to the book, often quoting and even showing the illustrations.  The special effects are extremely well done and I found little to criticize.

0307593312|4.0|I'm sure whole books could be written on what this book \\"means\\".  But in this review, I just want to lay out the major characters and plot because it seems like readers will find all kinds of meaning (or not meaning) in it.  The book seems to emphasize, to quote, \\"balance itself is the good\\".  Story slowly reveals itself until you reach about the middle of the book; the pieces start to come together at this point, so it can seem confusing in the beginning.  Until then, you are given little bits at a time and you have to construct the larger picture. This is done quite adeptly, however, and it isn't as if you are lost until this time, but more like you are following a trail and you can see the trail itself and you can see little clues to where the trail is going but you cannot see nor do you know the destination of the trail itself. But the trail is going somewhere and it does get there.  The book is slow paced, if you are looking for action, but the characters and the ambiguity about what is happening pulls you along.  The potential problem, depending on what you are reading for, is that much of this ambiguity is never resolved. Having said that, it is a love story and the love story has closure. So, if you read for closure, read for the love story and don't focus on the context within which it occurs.  Brief plot synopsis (as much as there is a plot): girl and boy meet when quite young and maintain their feelings of love for 15 years.  Girl becomes assassin, boy a math cram teacher. They both get involved with a cult: Girl is asked to assassinate the leader; boy re-write s a book that one of the cult members writes that reveals the cult's secrets.  The cult sends an investigator to find the girl who is now hiding out and has miraculously gotten pregnant. The girl has her own suppoters who want to hide her and keep her safe but she insists on finding the boy and won't stay hidden.  The boy, meanwhile, is following his own meandering path to find the girl.      The main characters:  Aomame (Green Peas) a massage therapist who assassinates men who abuse women. She moves from 1984 to 1Q84 (where the Q stands for question) at the beginning of the novel, setting the stage for the rest of the novel. Provides the energy for the novel. Aggressive and stubborn in seeking out what she wants.  Tengo: rewrites FuKa-Eri's novel, Air Chrysalis (don't worry too much about what this is: it's never really revealed), teaches at a math cram school and is a writer himself.  He and Aomame were once classmates in the 4th and 5th grade and are still seeking to find one another. Tengo is a plodder and lacks much imagination or spark. But, he is truly, a nice guy.  Fuka-Eri: the author of Air Chrysalis but also the medium for the \\"little people\\". As she puts it, they need a receiver and a perceiver.  She is the  perceiver. Her father is the receiver.   The leader: Fuka Eri's father and the receiver for the Little People  The dowager: older, wealthy woman who has hired Aomame to assassinate bad guys.  Tamaru, body guard for the dowager.  Sakigake: a cult for which Fuka Eri and her father are the major leaders  Ushikawa: deformed \\"bad\\" guy, hired by Sakigake to find Aomame. Not really a bad guy though, or at least not in the traditional sense.  There are several other tangential characters, but these are the main ones that we follow through the whole book. The Little people could be argued are a main character, but they really play only a minor role in the novel itself.  Context: novel begins in 1984, moves to a revised version of 1984 and then back. In the revised version, reality has ghosts, Little People and immaculate conceptions.

B002JWD6AS|3.0|This is another teen/young adult paranormal romance involving werewolves. Like most of these in this genre this book does have a different take on the whole werewolf thing. The werewolves shift into wolf form in the cold/winter and are human when it warms up during the summer. At first I thought that the chapter titles (which include the temperature at the time of the chapter) were weird but I did get used to them, I think they are meant to make you bite your nails as the temperature drops. Was this book a bit predictable, yes, but it was interesting. Unfortunately with the book world so inundated with werewolf/vampire folklore some books can be overlooked or can be uncannily similar in nature. I haven't really seen a book that goes the direction that this one goes in the whole lore, in the teen angsty \\"I LOVE YOU\\" thing, yeah that's typical, but the lore is pretty cool. There are a lot of things that really should have been cleaned up with the plot, but there are at least 2 more books in this series to do that. I enjoyed the writing, most of the characters were well done and it entertain me. I just don't like that in a lot of these books the parents are kind of absentee parents, but maybe that's more common than I am privy to. I would say you should check this out from the library, borrow it from a friend or wait for a good sale to pick this one up.
B001GCUO16|5.0|I have been an X-Men fan since I was a child. Wolverine was always the toughest one around and he carried an attitude to match. Hugh Jackman plays the role to perfection and this movie is a great synopsis of the origins of one of the X-Men and one of my personal favorite characters.<br /><br />Wolverine and his brother are invincible warriors and their amazing healing powers make these mutants able to heal quickly, stay in the fight and maybe even immortal! The US government uses them and modifies them to enhance their fighting capabilities and the result is scary. Wolverine is out for vengeance and no one had better stand in his way.<br /><br />Wolverine's brother is played by Liev Schreiber who does a wonderful job fulfilling the role as a real bad dude without many moral ethics of doing whatever he wants to win. He makes a good villain to Wolverine's vision quest to regain his lost past. In the end Sabertooth, (Liev Schreiber) does just enough to help his brother against a common foe!<br /><br />I love this movie for the storyline and the great special effects. It helps you to understand Wolverine's personality, special skills and his amnesia about his past. I hope the X-Men saga continues in more movie releases. They are great!

1848566190|2.0|The Art of Drew Struzan is unfortunately a let down.  I have always admired Drew's work and enjoyed studying the great detail and unique style his paintings exemplify.  There is no question that Drew Struzan is an amazing artist. The reproductions in the book are of good quality, and I enjoy the work selected, though it could have been more versatile.  The reason for this three star review is simply due to the writing.  The forward sets the tone for the entire text of the book.  It was a rant.  A poorly written, and often immature rant of a dying art.  I agree with the idea Mr. Darabont was projecting, I just didn't agree with the way it was written.  Forward aside, the majority of the content was also voiced frustrations and complaining by David Schow and Drew himself.  Perhaps my expectations were high for a book titled \\"The art of Drew Struzan\\"  I don't believe this artist is limited to just phenomenal movie posters. There's more, and I wanted to see it and here about it in a professional way.  Unfortunately, The writing lessens the art.  Simply put, for an artist who made great movies even better, his book read like bad television.

B00005JLWN|1.0|Maybe this film just wasn't my cup of tea but I didn't like it at all. The only thing good about it was how good looking the actors were. Christian Bale and Taye Diggs were as handsome as ever and Emily Watson has never looked this beautiful in any film before but that still didn't make this movie good.  Basically you have Preston (Bale) who is a cop (or something) in a future world where feeling emotion is against the law. Yawn. This movie wasn't anything but Preston being confronted with emotions and doing his best to figure out what they meant. The only thing different about this film was it was in a Sci-Fi setting other than that, it's like a million other movies where people have to confront their emotions. Mainly you get a lot of slow, mundane scenes mostly with Bale alone in a scene looking at objects and getting flashbacks now and then. He spends his time staring at walls, examining photos and wondering what it all means. If it sounds boring, it is.  I won't even try to go into what happened during the film because I didn't understand most of it. This movie is a ball of confusion, bad direction and tacky writing. One thing they didn't do was rely on special effects which I appreciated. There weren't any special effects in this movie I can remember except maybe the setting but nothing huge. It allowed you to focus on the writing and characters but not so sure that's a good thing.  This movie was discouraging and sickening. It wasn't the least bit entertaining which was sad seeing the talent involved. This movie was so boring and slow it made two hours seem like seven. I kept going, \\"When is this going off?\\" Just when I thought something exciting would happen it dragged even more. Don't be fooled by the movie cover! They wanna make it seem like The Matrix or something interesting and it's not anything close. This movie is BORING. I don't understand why in the world Emily Watson was even in this movie. She was shown TEN minutes if that! I could not believe she'd have such a bit role. I would've rather seen more of her character and Bale's interact than anything else.  I admit I'm not a big Sci-Fi buff but even I know good Sci-Fi when I see it. This is definitely not it. Skip it. There are many films in this genre that are better. If you wanna watch a decent Sci-Fi movie then watch Supernova. It might not be perfect but at least you will stay awake.   If you gotta watch this, fine but beware. I wouldn't watch it too many times in a row. You might end up in a coma.

B001R0XNSI|3.0|I bought one of these sort of on a whim; I did not read in careful detail about how large it is.  Its a great sturdy Koga/Yawara stick however you can't carry it around in a pants pocket without getting the is-that-a-koga-in-your-pocket-or-are-you-just-happy-to-see-me look.  If you carry in a breast pocket its also too large to not get noticed.  The pen inside is pretty worthless; I ended up pulling it out with a pair of pliers and with a little work managed to retro fit it with a real sharpie.  I keep it in my car usually and carry it in a jacket pocket on occasion.  I suppose one could keep it in a drawer at work without drawing attention either.  All in all for the price its kind of cool just to have or give to a friend.
B006C1DH92|4.0|Familiar game with new scenarios, fun &amp; entertaining although nothing new or amazing, big file requires Wi-Fi download but worth it.
1845761502|5.0|Our son is very much into the art of movie production and the evolution of special effects.  Stan Winston was an icon in the art of entertainment and developing cutting edge processes. While I am not an expert in the field, nor as passionate as our son, the look on his face when his gift arrived was memorable. He has been engrossed in this book as only an afficionado of the art could be. To me, it is stunning in its presentation; to him, historic. If you have the passion to learn the art, this may be for you.

B003Y5H5AG|5.0|I loved this movie I got it for Christmas and I've already watched it three times. Everyone is complaining about the jokes it a kid movie the jokes arent supposed to be soooooo halerious. The complaining in the movie is from GRUMY because thats what he does hes GRUMPY. They made this movie to help the younger generation have what we had when we were younger little blue smurfs. Its an amazing movie and I wouldnt change a thing, deffinately recommended! (:
B004EPYZSK|3.0|The title of this review pretty much says it all.  The special effects are great, the acting is okay, but the plot isn't really that original and the dialogue is simply adequate.  I do like that the Harrison Ford character starts off as a mean SOB but you later learn that he's not such a bad guy.<br /><br />I haven't read the original comic so I don't know how it compares.<br /><br />The version I have has the following special features:<br /><br />Finding the Story- a five-and-a-half-minute clip explaining why the movie is so great (uh-huh).<br />Outer-Space Icon- a ten minute clip about the aliens (very realisitic looking).<br />A commentary track by the director<br />A couple of previews
B005TPCQ5I|5.0|This movie is great. The ending is amazingly sad and I cried the whole night but I cried because you start to love the characters in the movie so anything happening to the is unbelievale. I'm not gonna spoil but deffinately watch this its soo romantic (:

It was soooo good, that since buying both books in October, I have read them THREE TIMES. The story is amazing and the love between the two main characters is palatable. Please read these books at least once in your lifetime and you won't be sorry. I can't wait for the third one to come out--I wait anxiously.
B005ZUR724|5.0|Ok, my review for this has changed and the game is really great, especially for a mobile/ tablet device.  The user interface is awesome and very simple to use.  Also the type of detail you get with the game, closely matches (doesn't make it all the way) to WoW, just give or take a few things.   Ok so for those of you that are still having problems, saying that there is an update...  If you already bought the game.  Uninstall the game, and redownload it from the apps store on your kindle fire.  Play and enjoy your game, be happy.

0307959856|2.0|As a longtime \\"Jane-ite\\", I have always considered Jane Austen's work to be sacrosanct and not to be touched by other, lesser writers. I've stayed away from modern attempts to bring Austen's characters and stories - particularly those of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" - to life in sequels. No one, I thought, had the literary \\"chops\\" to take Austen's characters and write a competent sequel. Then I heard that PD James, a mystery writer I had long admired, had taken a stab at writing a sequel.<br /><br />The resulting novel - \\"Death Comes to Pemberly\\" - is an awkward combination of mystery and comedy-of-manners and doesn't quite come off. The two genres don't quite come together, even in Ms James' deft hands. Maybe it was the choice of centering the story on George Wickham and a murder he is being tried for having committed. Wickham has never been a particularly interesting character in the original novel; he was the center around which events took place, but I never wanted to know more about what happened to him after the novel ended. And, in fact, that raises a particular question in my mind. Who ARE the characters in \\"P&P\\" I would want to read about? I can't think of a single one, actually.<br /><br />Maybe that's because I figured a long time ago that \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" was a completed story. There's a reason an author doesn't write sequels; maybe everything that can be said about a cast of characters has already been said. That's what Margaret Mitchell always felt about \\"Gone With The Wind\\". And Jane Austen certainly didn't return to any of her older books when writing new ones. (In this book, James writes a little about the \\"Eliot family\\").<br /><br />So what about PD James' book? It seemed like an \\"adequate\\" mystery and an \\"adequate\\" comedy-of-manners. I've read most of James' back list and I wouldn't put this book near the top of the list. But, on the other hand, sometimes \\"adequate\\" can be a good read, which this book is. I'm not sure anyone who isn't familiar with Jane Austen would bother reading it, but for Austen fans, it's a suitable read for a rainy day.ng it, but for Austen fans, it's a suitable read for a rainy day.

B006AN78XS|5.0|I loved [[ASIN:B005Q5WJVC The Purple Rose of Cairo]] and I loved this film.  If you are appreciative of Woody Allen's work, you will certainly enjoy this.  It probably requires a bit of suspension of disbelief, as did Cairo, but it is certainly a lovely story. Thanks, Woody.  I do have a question, why isn't Hadley Hemingway in this film?  [[ASIN:B004DEPELY The Paris Wife: A Novel]] From what I recall of Ernest, he pretty much went directly from one marriage to the next?  The depiction of Hemingway was pretty darn perfect, as I think of him.

B000001ESF|4.0|This album launched Rush as premier Progressive Rock masters. It also established a string of gold and platinum successes that has not been broken yet. This album rocks out with a very melodic and catchy songwriting ethic that is maintained throughout the album. There are some lulls here and there, but for the most part this is art-rock at its most grand and accessible best. The 20 minute-plus 2112 suite is a deservedly classic piece in the group's repertoire. The band dressed in ceremonial robes during the 2112 tour and played while Geddy Lee would snarl \\"We are the priests of the temples of Syrinx\\"!! That must've been an awesome concert! We also have A Passage To Bangkok, an ode to all the variations of pot that one can sample if you travel around the world looking for it. The production on this album is second only to MOVING PICTURES. Both albums sound crisp, clean and poundingly heavy. It's not only one of Rush's best albums, but a seminal album in progressive rock as a whole. Many a musician would list this as an influence since its release. HIGHLY recommended.<br /><br />The best version of this album to get is in the new Sector remaster series. This album always had a great sound, but that version proves itself on headphones to be the clearest that this humble reviewer has heard. Great album to start a Rush collection.<br /><br />My favorite Rush albums follow in order from best to least:<br /><br />MOVING PICTURES<br />PERMANENT WAVES<br />COUNTERPARTS<br />2112<br /><br />The rest of their albums vary greatly in both style and quality. They all have great moments but can all easily take 5th place. HOLD YOUR FIRE and PRESTO are probably the worst of the bunch and are best saved for last if you want to explore this great band. I would rank the rest of the albums as follows, but this list changes often with my mood:<br /><br />4 stars<br />GRACE UNDER PRESSURE<br />SIGNALS<br />ROLL THE BONES<br />TEST FOR ECHO<br />POWER WINDOWS<br /><br />3 1/2 stars<br />VAPOR TRAILS<br />A FAREWELL TO KINGS<br />HEMISPHERES<br />FLY BY NIGHT<br />CARESS OF STEEL<br />SNAKES AND ARROWS<br /><br />3 stars<br />RUSH<br />HOLD YOUR FIRE<br />PRESTO<br /><br />Happy hunting!
B000002P74|5.0|Got this for my son (Big Fan. As always great songs and music. A must forr any fan to add to their collection.
B0002NRQTI|4.0|This 1993 release from Rush is a mixed bag for some. Many long time fans were shocked by the alternative wallop of Stick It Out. I for one was surprised. The first time I heard this album was in 1997. I bought it on cassette and I was not impressed. I had certain expectations that were not met. I expected the proggy, ambient Rush of the late 70's and the 80's. Instead, this album has mostly straight ahead rockers and the most love songs of any Rush album ever. Because my expectations were not met I did not warm up to the album and instead wrote off the band as being out of touch with their fan base. I couldn't have been more wrong. This album not only rocks more than anything released since MOVING PICTURES, it is also the most consistent, the most artsy and has the most solid themes/album concepts of ANY album since MP (up to and including SNAKES AND ARROWS).   The album opens with Animate. This appears to be a straight rocker without too many twists and turns, but it has some of Rush's most solid instrumental harmonies and a very catchy melody. The subject matter is the heart of man which is, you guessed it, the counterpart to his logic, or brain. This counterpart, called the anima by Carl Jung, (eminent psychologist and one of the architects of analytical psychology)is explored in a wonderful play on words by lyricist Neil Peart. Repeated listens reveal a complex instrumentation and superb interplay between the instruments. The rest of the songs follow a similar vein of subtleties veiled in deceptively simple music that grows on you more with each listen. The album is simply accessible and eloquently written, both lyrically and compositional-wise.   Most of the songs on the album deal with these kinds of dichotomies and therefore we have the \\"love\\" theme reappearing throughout the album. Never have Rush sounded so in tune with each other and the subjects of the songs. Animate, Double Agent and Leave That Thing Alone are the only \\"traditionally\\" progressive-sounding songs. The rest sound like rock tunes with deep lyrics. Only one song, Everyday Glory, was a total loss for me. I just can't get into that one. The rest are all winners and as mentioned previously, will grow on you with each listen. HIGHLY recommended.   As a side note, the new Rush Sector remasters are excellent. There are some production flaws that are being dealt with, with both the packaging and some of the mixes, but other than that the sound is simply incredible! I vote for requesting that the rest of their catalog be released in a similar format and I especially hope that COUNTERPARTS will be released in a remastered, blue-ray high definition 5.1 surround version.  My favorite Rush albums follow in order from best to least:  MOVING PICTURES  PERMANENT WAVES  COUNTERPARTS  2112  The rest of their albums vary greatly in both style and quality. They all have great moments but can all easily take 6th place. HOLD YOUR FIRE and PRESTO are probably the worst of the bunch and are best saved for last if you want to explore this great band. I would rank the rest of the albums as follows, but this list changes often with my mood:  4 stars  GRACE UNDER PRESSURE  SIGNALS  ROLL THE BONES  TEST FOR ECHO  POWER WINDOWS  3 1/2 stars  VAPOR TRAILS  A FAREWELL TO KINGS  HEMISPHERES  FLY BY NIGHT  CARESS OF STEEL  SNAKES AND ARROWS  3 stars  RUSH  HOLD YOUR FIRE  PRESTO  Happy hunting!
B006C1DH92|4.0|I know this game is fun (have reg version) and they said may not work with some Samsung phones (thanks for the warning.. yes I read the descriptions :) ), though I was hoping the Captivate with Froyo would be an exception.  Oh well, I got it and secured for future updates or a new phone :)  3 stars since the original works just fine on my phone and I know it's a quality game, 4 stars if they can update and get it to work like the original.<br /><br />Please take this review for what it is.  This rating it what I consider for a \\"good\\" game, not to be scaled with other reviews. If you have a Samsung and figure it won't work, you may as well dl and just delete so you have it for later.<br /><br />Update: Upgraded to Gingerbread (official) and the game now works on my Captivate.  Still fun as I remember it but just gets boring after a while.  Good solid game that I would like to rate 3.5 out of 5.  Upgrading my prev review from 3 to 4 though.
B001NBEWN6|5.0|This is a 'Booker prize' winner book. The writing is simply too good. Unlike other novels, the way of writing is a bit different. It is not continuously telling one story, instead telling different part of the same story at different time. But still giving a very good and clear picture about what is going on. You will live with the story...

031603441X|3.0|I think Richards should have used J.R. Moehringer to edit and write his story. (He did Andre Agassi's Open which was riviting!) The book is very hard to get though. It uses a lot of slang which is either some sort of English street dialect, or Richards own invention, either way its not easily readable. Each story is interesting but is not expressed clearly.  I was so excited to read about his life and found myself skipping thru the book because I was frustrated with the context and unknown vocabulary usage. Secondly, his fragmented thought processes confused me. Within each paragraph and (even within sentences) ideas ramble so that the reader doesn't get a clear idea of what he is trying to tell us. He mixes musical theory and R&B icons with drug abuse, poverty, womanizing and whatever, all in one sentence! Each group of ideas are dijointed and don't necessarly relate to the paragraph.  To be fair, this is probably how his thought processes work, but for me,  I couldn't understand what the heck he was trying to tell me.  I am glad I read it but it wasn't as fun as I thought it would be.
B005ZUR724|1.0|so I sign on... GREAT GAME! SUCH A STEAL FORR 99 cents! then in less than 24 hours the game crashes and asks me to update... it brings me to the store and the update is nowhere to ne found..... dont waste your time......

0307946711|2.0|Get ready for a long story that will make you fall asleep. The story follows two people, Emma and Dexter, along their trip down friendship lane. They meet in college, become best friends, love each other, hate each other, sleep with each other, all the things you can do with another basically.   I was honestly surprised at how little I cared about the story or the characters in it. Technically speaking, the writing was great. I have no complaints about the writing style, the grammer or word usage, that was all great. It was the story itself that didn't impress me. I didn't feel anything when reading it. I mean, it's a tragic love story, I should have felt something. A story about divorces, family deaths, mistresses and fame should stir up some kind of excitement or sadness or ... anything. Without that strong connection to the characters or the story I found it incredibly difficult to keep reading and almost stopped several times. Everyone convinced me that the magic twist ending would make the story worth reading, but I wasn't impressed. I will say that the last couple of chapters finally brought a tad bit of feeling into the mix with Dexter's downfall, but it wasn't worth having spent the time reading the rest of the story.   (This is why I shouldn't read romance books :-P )

B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I am not a huge fan of alternative rock (90's through today).  But this goes to show you even a alt album presented to a non alternative fan can indeed love the record anyway!  The songs are just fabulous, the landscape of the album is dreamy and moody!  These are great songs and great lyrics, and Maynard James Keenan delivers the vocals perfectly!  I heard this shortly after it was released at a record Exchange.  They played the entire CD while I looked around the store and I knew I had to have it and that was 8 years ago and I still like the album as much today!  The songs just have a perfect delivery to them, very catchy and they create a mood, an atmosphere!  Ironically I did not like APC earlier album or their followup Emotive.  But I am still hoping for another gem like this someday!  The album is smoother and mellower than most alternative rock albums which is probably the reason I like it so well.  But the compositions are just brilliant and the production likewise.  I do like a few alternative bands and a handful of albums I consider to be classics (but not that many overall).  Coldplay's first two albums are included on that list.  But they are few and far in between and unfortunately this kind of music doesnt seem to have much staying power in music history the way classic rock does.  But once in a while an exception like this comes along, 5 stars!

B005IZLPKQ|4.0|Captain America is one of the best movies of its genre.  The story tries to remain true to the Jack Kirby story of WW II's best Super-Hero and then bringing him forward to today's story lines. The script is well written and the special effects make for an engaging, non-boring movie. The nicest part is that it never insults the viewers intelligence. The film is \\"story centered\\" and it works on most levels to satisfy fans and non-fans, and justifies the cost of the ticket. This is a movie that brings people into theaters and then sends them home with a smile and a feel-good feeling.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love this game it is very relaxing.  I could play this game all day.  I am 10. and I understand this game perfectly. and I like the historical aspect.
B005KTZ05G|5.0|WOW. No other words can aptly describe this action figure, period. NECA has been making Assassin's Creed action figures for a while now, starting with their Altair figure released all the way back in 2007, to last year's Assassin's Creed 2 figures. And while both of them featured great sculpting and (albeit a bit too ambitious) paint apps, their successor effectively trumps them in not only both those categories, but also throws in a spectacular amount of articulation, leading to what is quite possibly the best 6-7\\" action figure this year.  Ezio is dressed in his outfit from Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood; last year's entry into the now annual Assassin's Creed games release. The look is certainly well captured here, from the all white master assassin robes, to Ezio's peculiarly signature half-cape, all the way down into the buckles and heels of his boots. One thing to note, however, is that much like his predecessors, the figure varies in minute details from the in-game sprite, this being due to the source of the figure being not the in-game model, but rather the concept art/digital renders of Ezio released before the game. This means he has matching vambraces on his forearms, and a single metal spaulder on his left shoulder. In all honesty, this is all for the better, as the silver/metal complements the white much better than the in-game brown/leather does, adding to the aesthetic appeal of the figure. Lastly, Ezio features sculpted stubble around his goatee, which is also sculpted accurately to the character. Any other company would've cheaped out here and simply painted a weird gray/brown shadow on the figure's lower face, but NECA's sculptors went the extra mile and actually etched the details in. Applaud-able.  Owners of previous AC (and NECA, in general) figures will testify to the hit-and-miss nature of their figures' paint apps, which more often than not detract from the excellent sculpting of the figure. Rest assured, however, that Ezio is a definite improvement. Whereas Altair and the younger Ezio suffered from slop greatly, this figure right here has almost no slop. There are a few specks of darker paint on the white of his robes, yes, but none of it is entirely noticeable. Furthermore, the figure is primarily cast in a very, very light gray, with a nice, white dry brushing added all over to create perfect shadows and bring out all of the patterns and (sculpted) embroidery on Ezio's robes. The reds are nice and crisp as well, and the silvers look and even feel almost like real metal. A similar combination of cast color and dry brushing is used on Ezio's boots; this time with the base being black and a gray/black/brown dry brushing added to accentuate their leather-like texture. Definitely one of NECA's best paint jobs.   Certain parts of the figure (lower robes. upper chest/collar/hood) are cast in a very soft, pliable rubber rather than plastic, and not only does this not detract from the sculpt in any way, but also adds to what makes this figure truly great; Articulation! The packaging claims Ezio has 38 points of articulation, and he does indeed! The breakdown is as follows:  Ball-jointed head (2)  Ball-jointed neck (1)  Marvel Legends style forward/back hinged shoulders (2)  Ball-jointed shoulders (4)  Swivel biceps (2)  ball-jointed elbows (4)  ball-jointed wrists (4)  Hinged abdomen (1)  Swivel waist (1)  Ball jointed hips ( 2)  Swivel thighs (2)  Double hinged knees (4)  Swivel shins/boot tops (2)  Hinged ankles (2)  Side-to-side/\\"rocker\\" ankles (2)  Hinged toes (2)  I don't think anymore needs to be said here, apart from that all previous problems of limited range in the joints has been fixed, and that the construction is quite sturdy.   Ezio comes with 8 accessories; two removable hidden blades (that attach into his inner vambraces/forearms), and 3 sets of hands; a pair of fists, a pair of \\"blade thrusting\\" open palms, and a \\"sword-wielding\\" set with a gripping right hand and a semi-relaxed left hand. The hands feature the same great sculpting, looking nothing short of scaled replicas of the human hand. He even has finely carved wrinkles in his palms! The blades are nice and long as they should be, and, despite being near identical, feature a neat little \\"R\\" and \\"L\\" sculpted into the hilts of the right and left blades, respectively, just in case you need to know which goes where. While it would've been nice if they'd thrown in a sword or a crossbow with the figure, it certainly isn't something the figure lacks, and you'll still be able to have plenty of fun with this guy without his weapons of mass destruction.  I've had this figure in hand for a little over 24 hours, and i have not put him down. He's just a FUN toy to pick up and fiddle around with. He features great detail across the board, and the articulation just carries all that forward into an action figure that is just perfect. Kids, adults, collectors, fans of AC looking for a neat little collectible; this is it right here.
0307593312|4.0|1Q84 is that vast epic read that has both the power to spellbind while at the same time make you scratch your head.  This was my first Murakami book, and it won't be my last.  Murakami is a master of language creating beautiful imagery while at the same time presenting the mundane, but making it beautiful.  Some have argued that the book is heavy on repetition which it is, but I think it's connected to the larger picture.  I think when an author repeats himself it's his way of saying \\"hey, remember this!\\"  That being said I think it is sometimes forgotten that this massive 900+ page book is actually three books rolled into one.  In Japan it was released separately, but in America it was presented as one novel.  So the heavy repetetion is also a reminder to the reader about what happened in the other book.  One thing I really love about Murakami is his inclusion of both classic and contemporary literature.  This serves as both a nod to their work while revealing Murakami's influence.  Everyone from Orwell, Dickens, and Shakespeare to Chekhov and Jung.  When viewed through the prism of these authors 1Q84 is a little more easy to understand as each of these authors touches are felt.  That being said you don't need a firm knowledge of these other writers to appreciate the work.  Yes the work is not perfect, hence my four stars, but it was definetely worth the time and the patience.  Unlike some of the other reviewers I grew to care for Tengo and Aomame, even the despciable Ushikawa.  I found the first two books to be the strongest, while the third one lost some of its steam.  Tengo seemed to dissipate towards the end while the last few chapters seemed to slog on a bit.  While these are detractions, I found alot to marvel at.  Murakami creates a world much like our own, but at the same time markedly different.  It almost seemed like a grown up fairy tale at first.  It's as if Aomame went down that ladder at the train station and was transported into a surreal Oz like place.  L. Frank Baum, Murakami is not, but the atmosphere takes on an almost fairy tale landscape.  While I agree the ending didn't live up to the beginning, and the reader was left with more questions than answers, I thought back to Chekhov where he said that the author's role is not to answer questions, but to ask them.  Murakami does this with finesse uncovering difficult beliefs and mores like sexuality, ethics, and death.  1Q84 was a monumental read, and one I won't soon forget!
B002T9H2LA|4.0|Without ruining anything, all I can say is that \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" is a tremendous movie, with not only a compelling story but phenomenal attention to cinematic detail. As are most Tarantino films, the movie is beautifully shot, which only helps to augment the narrative. It's hard not to root for the main characters, as they fight against the Nazis. Add an Oscar-winning opening hook performance by Christoph Waltz, and you have a more than worthwhile viewing experience.

B0040UAYI4|4.0|When I bought this I was aware that there was going to be lag because it only makes sense. I was pleased to find out that the lag basically doesn't exist on the keyboard end and on the mouse it is so very slight that it really doesn't take too much from the product. It was very simple to set up and the key manager system that allows you to bind whatever PS3 controls as whatever keyboard keys works amazingly.  P.S. I'm using it with the Nostromo game pad from Razer and a G500 (and interchanging with a G400) Logitech mouse. I have tried some of my other objects and have found that only items without drivers will work. This product definitely gives you an edge on other console gamers!

0307891372|5.0|I haven't read the entire book, but for about $17 it was a great deal.  Very detailed, and very big.  It's almost like an almanac for Skyrim.  A definite must for those who play Skyrim and want some help.  Plus, Amazon was kind enough to re-send me another one, when the 1st one(I believe it may have gotten stolen) was resent to me.  Thanks Amazon!  I will reiterate a better review when I've read more of it.
B002LMOAZQ|5.0|I loved this CD ever since hearing the single \\"Bad Girlfriend\\" the music style was unique in that it had a rock sound but in parts it had a slight country influence. The lyrics could be considered offensive at parts but I would say that they are more comical or can remind of a part of life we might have forgotten about, overlooked, or not known about. I loved it, but I would suggest listening to preview clips of the songs before deciding to purchase.
B005TZFZJC|5.0|I am so glad I purchased this CD. I love  \\"You da one\\" \\"Talk that Talk\\" With Jay Z, \\"Birthday Cake\\" \\"Watch n Learn\\" \\"Do Ya Thang\\" and \\"Fool in Love\\"   The entire album is listenable. I did not Ff one track. Best purchase I made this entire year.
B005LW5J9O|5.0|In 1417 Poggio Bracciolini, a papal official, found an old manuscript of a work by a Roman poet and philosopher named Lucretius in a remote German monastery.  The manuscript had probably been lying around for hundreds of years, and itself was probably several copies removed from the original.  Lucretius lived in the first century BC.  His work was influenced by earlier philosophers, particularly the Greek Epicurus, who lived in the third century BC.  The work, entitled \\"On the Nature of Things\\", had been lost until Poggio rediscovered it.  Poggio made of copy of it and it was then re-copied and then printed and eventually disseminated throughout Europe.    Lucretius' ideas are astonishingly modern.  Here is a summary of what Lucretius thought (I have borrowed Greenblatt's phrases): matter is composed of invisible particles, and these \\"atoms\\" endlessly recombine in random ways; the universe has no creator or designer, there is no end or purpose to existence, nature ceaselessly experiments, creatures whose combinations of organs enables them to adapt will succeed in establishing themselves until changing circumstances make it impossible for them to survive, the universe was not created for or about humans, there is no reason to believe that human beings as a species will last forever, there are no souls which survive after death, and no afterlife, all religions are superstitious delusions, there are no angels, demons or ghosts, and the highest goal of human life is the pursuit of happiness (thus the famous phrase in our Declaration of Independence).  But this pursuit of happiness is not hedonism, the greatest obstacle to pleasure is not pain, but delusion about what leads to happiness.  The poem is an attempt to show how to lead a good life in the face of an indifferent universe.  The Latin verse is apparently very beautiful.   These ideas were dangerous when Poggio discovered the manuscript and continued to be so all the way through to the Enlightenment.  But Greenblatt shows how Lucretius, once reintroduced into European thought, changed it forever, by influencing European humanists.  The chain of influence leads through Montaigne, touches Shakespeare, and ultimately permeates the Enlightenment.  Jefferson owned five copies of Lucretius in Latin and others in other languages.   One of Lucretius' ideas was that sometimes in the random recombination of atoms there is a \\"swerve\\", a chance variation which leads to unexpected results.  Hence the title of Greenblatt's book.   Greenblatt writes lucidly and is endlessly entertaining.  My favorite part was the description of how books were copied before the invention of the printing press.  As many as fifty monks would sit for hours in a well-lighted room, each at his desk, copying texts.  They were not allowed to talk, and were discourged from trying to understand the texts.  I especially enjoyed reading about this on my Kindle.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Woody Allen's 2011 endeavor, Midnight in Paris begins similarly to what you would expect of a Woody Allen picture. Shots of Paris in the morning, quirky music, shots of Paris in the afternoon, music continues, shots of Paris in the evening... I think you can assume the rest. However with Paris in the spotlight instead of Allen's beloved New York, you might expect an obvious loss of affection or romanticism, however there is none at all which is first and foremost a fantastic breath of fresh air.<br /><br />Our hero is Gil, that prototype Woody Allen, self-effacing and neurotic character we've come to know, lovingly played by a surprisingly well-suited Owen Wilson. As the story opens, we find Gil and his fiance Inez (Rachel McAdams) in Paris, along with his less than enthusiastic future in-laws quite openly butting heads in the city he adores and she loathes. Gil is a Hollywood writer who longs to write something more meaningful and has begun on a novel about a man working in a nostalgia shop, selling relics of a more beautiful time past that Gil has yet to find the nerve to let another soul read.<br /><br />Walking back from a wine tasting alone, it is than that magic happens to Gil when the clock strikes midnight and on the windy Parisian street ahead of him appears a gorgeous old car, that opens it's door for him and begins a trip to Paris in the 1920's that has Gil rubbing shoulders with the periods most beloved artists.<br /><br />It is easy to say that this film is formulaic, however I beg to differ. I found this film to be without a doubt my favorite of this year, and possibly my new favorite Woody Allen film. (And I mean that Annie Hall!)<br /><br />Owen Wilson is magnetic and enjoyable in a way I personally have never thought him to be, supported by a brilliant cast including the gorgeous Marion Cotillard, always brilliant Michael Sheen and Corey Stoll as Ernest Hemingway in a performance that absolutely elevated the entire film.<br /><br />It might not be everyone's cup of tea, but Midnight in Paris does something few other films have done by soloing out the true nature of everyone's desire to yearn to live in another time, to fantasize that we'd be happier and more well-suited there instead of where we happen to be. To see such a subject tackled without a shred of existential angst, instead that glimmer of understanding the need for escapism when we're afraid to face our own reality is nothing short of beautiful.something few other films have done by soloing out the true nature of everyone's desire to yearn to live in another time, to fantasize that we'd be happier and more well-suited there instead of where we happen to be.

B005OCFGTO|3.0|This simple disc collection is just what I wanted, simple with no extra \\"stuff\\" for big bucks. The only thing that the box is very flimsy, the inside of the box came with broken parts so that dvds don't hold inside very well..
B001HN690O|4.0|My and my wife's 2 year-old son got this for Christmas and all of us enjoyed it a lot.  It is your typical Jack Black style humor with an interesting story about the potential death of Kung Fu.  I would definitely recommend this movie to any family or anyone else who just loves watching funny computer animation movies.

0439023513|5.0|This series is no doubt my favorite of all time.   I see how people are saying that she \\"did not stay true to the characters\\" and such, but I think that there was a reason for that. She was trying to show how war changes people. They had all been through a lot, so they all had changed in one way or another. It's not that she didn't know how to write the book-she knows how to write better than most of you who are saying that she doesn't-she was putting a twist on the story. No, it didn't have the fairytale ending. I like it like that. Yes, it was heart breaking, but that's life. Everything doesn't turn out perfect in the real world.
B000JSI7AI|5.0|What a great film.  After I saw this, I never wanted to see another one-dimensional stereotype gay character again.    This is a heavy drama.  There are just a few moments of levity, and they're appreciated.  As just about everyone who saw this will tell you, it's visually stunning.  The gorgeous, rugged terrain made me want to pick up and move to Wyoming.    Ultimately, I think the story is a cautionary tale.  It's a reminder that life is short, and that fear can ruin it, leaving us full of regret.  See it.
B005ZUR724|3.0|Wonderful game, everything is great EXCEPT for the missing update. The game will not allow you to play with out the update, where is it?

B005Y423ZC|5.0|I got this BLU RAY version as a Christmas gift from my hubby. He knew I liked Adele, and we haven't been to a concert or seen one in years since having two kids.... so he brought the concert to me.  I haven't seen such a great performance since Justin TImberlake Lovestoned.  But golly, This show is captivating from start to finish. After the first few songs, I already began to tear up.  Adele sings with such passion, and you can feel her every pain in her lyrics.   This is a MUST see/own.  I love to just pop it in and listen to her sing while I cook or do housechores.  It is a bit explicit, so not advised around toddlers/or young kids, but since she has a heavy British accent, doesn't seem to sound as bad =).   Great concert, great performer, very charismatic, EXCELLENT live performer.  Get it! watch it! love it!

B001UHOWXI|5.0|Like others have mentioned, it would be nice to sort reviews of movie media by type - in other words separate the Blu-Rays from the DVD, VHS (puhleez..) & yes, the streaming \\"cloud\\" versions. Don't get me wrong, I also like the movie critiques but this is not one of them. This is just to say, yes the Blu-Ray is worth the extra money or even an upgrade purchase - give the old one away. The B&W is that awesome in clarity and though I'm not a fan of colorized, this one can almost convert you. My only critical observation on the colorization is that as natural as most of the colors seem, the skin tones vary little, or not at all, from one person to another.

There is such humanity and love in this film, and about the kindness of strangers. Anne Bancroft and Anthony Hopkins are both charming and touching in this film about caring and sharing with ones who share your common interest. I only wish I could find the humanity and caring shown in this film in today's world. The mark left on me by this film...to be an even better person. None of us knows what's around the next corner of our lives so share, live and LOVE. Please do it now.
030788743X|5.0|Really excellent read, nerdy, intelligent and heavily nostalgic for classic 80's pop culture.  Would definitely recommend it. Anyone who didn't grow up in the 80's might not get all of the references but won't miss out on the storyline.
B003E8P9G0|2.0|After reading the Percy Jackson books, i was very excited about reading this book. I was very disappointed. There was alot of information and seemed to drag on. also it switched from greek gods to egyptian gods, which really threw me off. I think that if i had read them either before Percy Jaskson or waited awhile after, i would have had a different liking for them. If you have just finished reading the Jackson series, i would def wait awile before embarking on this series. just because the gods and the information about the gods are so different that it really throws you off. otherwise it is ok

0891419063|5.0|Dr. Sledge's memoir of the fanatical resistance of the Imperial Japanese Army at Peleliu and Okinawa is awe-inspiring and humbling.  His writing is very easy to understand and left me more deeply indebted to our nations Greatest Generation.  His reminicenses focus on the terror of war and how he and his fellow Marines prevailed in conditions that were more horrible than my imagination can comprehend.  Historical writings like this should be mandatory reading in high school so that our present and future generations may better understand the freedom we enjoy was paid for with the blood of the bravest of Americans.

B005EZJ3MW|5.0|I love Demi. She has an amazing voice and real talent. I've been a fan since the beginning. I fell in love with her rocker style and great vocals. This album is really great but I do miss the more band like sound she used to have. I don't enjoy the \\"instrumentals\\" at all. It's dumb. Same with a couple tracks I could really do without. All that aside I still love this album. I really feel her emotions and see that she is growing as an artist. I think if she moved away from that pop/mainstream sound but still kept her amazing vocals and emotions, this album would've been flawless.  Best tracks: For the Love of a Daughter, Skyscraper, Fix a Heart, Lightweight

B006INDMEE|1.0|I really was looking forward to seeing this. I wanted to like it, but just couldn't. This movie has a story that should take about 30 min to tell. This movie is beyond uneventful, its like watching paint dry. Boring and painful to watch & thats why I fell asleep - twice. Unfortunately, I woke up to see the end (would have been nice to have slept through the remainder of the film) and I didnt need to be caught as the movie hadn't progressed. Easily one of the worst I've ever seen. Very sorry I saw any of this. Acting was amazingly good, story was beyond boring.

B005UKJZ10|1.0|With the actors listed, and the description of the storyline, you'd think this would be a very special, well done movie. However, when the scenes kept switching out to very weird lava flows, dinosaurs and views of the cosmos, we actually thought the stream was malfunctioning. Think cross between a National Geographic special and a Hallmark channel movie. Separately, it works - together, not so much.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|My husband loves this movie and I'm  glad to have gotten it in perfect timing. He was so happy to have it. His was lost a few months ago.  The movie plays fantastic. Thank you

We are enjoying it greatly at our house!

B000QCUB8I|4.0|I get recommendations from the Amazon computer as to what CDs I might like. I guess it's derived from what I buy and, perhaps, what I look at. The \\"Cross\\" album by Justice appeared several times. Well, that's probably because I have bought up a bunch of Deadmau5 and Daft Punk recordings which are lumped into the same Electrohouse microgenre. But that's OK. If someone has put it into that same category, I might indeed like it and after several appearances on my list I broke down and bought it.<br /><br />First, I don't understand all the religious stuff. Why the Cross symbol and song titles like Genesis, Let There Be Light and Waters of Nazareth? Things like this slowed my purchase down by at least three or four months in that I'm not looking for religious music. However, I can't see anything in the music or the lyrics (what there is of them) that is overtly Christian in any way. Why the religious symbolism?<br /><br />In any case, the music is rather interesting but the quality, from my listening point of view, is quite uneven. Some of the tunes catch me up in a hurry and others have me waiting around for them to finally end. Perhaps this unevenness is just an artifact of their first recording and the later CDs will improve. Certainly some of the individual songs are good enough to win or be nominated for awards. I'm going to wait a while for a judgement on this electronica duo. Right now, I'd say their music is interesting and enjoyable, but uneven.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

B004U7MQXS|4.0|It was around 1964 and I was a popular music fan and I was just as thrilled with the appearance of the Beatles on the music scene as anyone else. My friend Nate loved classical music and always carried around with him a little portable radio so he could listen to the local classical station. I'd chide Nate a bit and tell him he ought to listen to pop music more and he'd laugh about it. I always used the Beatles as an example of popular music, but he'd never heard them or heard of them (almost hard to believe at the time). One night we were in a tavern enjoying a pitcher of beer and I kept playing Beatles' music for him on the juke box. Much to my amazement, he liked it. Well, A Hard Day's Night had just started a first-run playing at the local theaters and I convinced Nate we ought to go see it. So there were Nate and I sitting in a theater packed with screaming teenagers (we were late 20s) and watching A Hard Day's Night.<br /><br />The movie was highly spoken of by a great majority of movie critics, but everything the Beatles did or said was highly praised in those days. Personally, I didn't enjoy the movie all that much, although it was fun to see the reactions of those days and to see the Beatles perform their songs. The reaction in  the theater we were in could only be described as ecstatic enthusiasm. Actually, the movie was hard to understand because of all the screaming.<br /><br />Well, it's been a long time but I've remembered it well and not too long ago I commemorated the event by buying the \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" CD. I watched it and the accompanying \\"extra\\" materials over the last two nights. My reaction to the movie was just about the same as with my original viewing. It was interesting to see the events of those long ago days as they were documented. Surely, the Beatles reaction was a form of mass hysteria. Just amazing! It was also good to see the Beatles performing in their youth, and I've always loved their music, without question. The movie itself was a hodge-podge of home movies, TV spots, photographs, acted scenes, and what not all. It seemed to have little organization. The sound on my stereo system was poor, at best. The video quality was generally poor. The acting would be bad for a B movie. The joking was stale and unfunny. The \\"clean old man\\" joke grew evermore wearysome. A lot of the Beatles performances looked as if they were lip synced. I fail to see how the critics rated it so highly, perhaps this to was also a form of mass hysteria. In any case, I enjoyed re-watching it, but it seemed long and drawn out and I was glad when it was finally over. Evidently, the entire movie was produced in a couple month's time and. quite frankly, that's what it looks like.<br /><br />A second disc was included and carried commentary from those who were associated with the movie in one way or another. I found some of the comments interesting, but after watching for over an hour, I just couldn't go on to the finish. It's hard to advise potential viewers on this matter. If you're really, really a Beatles fan, then, of course, you must have it. If you're buying it to watch a good movie, well, I think you're going to be disappointed. Perhaps not. Personally, I like Beatles' music and I have many discs. Would I buy this disc over again given the chance? I think not.<br /><br />Gary Petersonhome movies, TV spots, photographs, acted scenes, and what not all. It seemed to have little organization. The sound on my stereo system was poor, at best.

B004P2CQM4|4.0|My experience was a bit more positive than many of the other reviewers, but it was only with a serious amount of effort.  I bought this for my brother, as he wanted it for an office toy.  I started off quite worried, as while it was labeled \\"Green Box\\" on the order, it certainly didn't come in the box it was supposed to.  Thus, the best we could hope for was that, even though it may have been a knockoff, it would still work...  The first check was the inflation.  My brother took it off to the grocery store, and they were unable to inflate it.  The little plastic doohicky for the inflation tore off and fell out, and they couldn't get any gas in.  After a bit of extremely careful effort, I was able to open up the inlet with a mechanical pencil, gradually working my way past the seal.  It then inflated fine at the store, which didn't even charge us (although they had said $3 over the phone for a large balloon).  The seal even held up fine, with no leaks for at least a day.  Assembly was a bear, and this is one of those toys that you really have to study the instructions carefully and make no mistakes.  The fins and spots on the balloon are all mislabeled (as another reviewer pointed out), but by studying the logic of the thing you can figure it out.  All the tape seemed to stick, and to stick well, so it doesn't look like it will fall apart as other reviewers have found.  It is easy to fly, but it certainly doesn't get a 50 foot range, more like around 15 (not too bad for indoor travel).  It is relatively straightforward to get it neutrally buoyant with the clay.  It is certainly delicate, and the tail fin tends to want to wag only in one direction (a bit stuck going the other way), so it is hard not to get it to go around in circles.  Still, it made for quite a splash at the Christmas party...  On balance, I was glad that I got it, as my brother is a bit hard to find a present for, and he really enjoyed the thing.  I would view this as a one-off office toy/novelty foradults more than a toy for kids to play with over a prolonged period (I doubt it would survive).  If you aren't mechanically inclined (or are not particularly motivated), I really can't recommend it: I found it rather dicey, and I teach engineering...
0439023513|3.0|About halfway through the book, I knew that the author wanted to pointedly end the story with the futility of all wars, not just select ones, but each rebellion and fight all somehow end up being similarly destructive, thus creating a strangely pessimistic conclusion. Sure there's always great danger in ending up just like the enemy, but you can't expect people to put up with authoritative governments.  However, what I disliked about the book was not its message but the protagonist, Katniss. In the first book, she's a survivor, albeit an oblivious one. In the second and third books, she's just a puppet who rarely thinks for herself. For a protagonist in a dystopian novel about war, Katniss seriously lacks leadership skills and fighting spirit. Her grief, confusion and devastation are understandable but she lacks any personality growth that can make her her own person. Though she sees great tragedy around her, her acquiescent personality lacks the capability to do something about it or at least attempt to make the best of a situation. She's thrust into the shoes of a rebel, but she doesn't have an ounce of rebellious spirit in her in books two and three. It reminded me of this HP on the \\"difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high....that there was all the difference in the world.\\" Katniss is definitely being dragged into arena. The short fallings of plotting and character development that plagues the entire trilogy only enhances this.   Also, the message of the trilogy is jumbled into the last couple of pages of the book. It's not something that gradually becomes  obvious to the reader (Although, I have to admit that many \\"surprises\\" in the book become obvious to the reader way before they become obvious to Katniss, and a keen reader will be able to easily pick up on plot \\"twists and turns\\" in advance.) In addition, the message seems speedy and sketchy because the story does not explore the reasons behind rebellion and resistance. There's anger and hatred after years of oppression, and you can't expect people to easily forgive their oppressors. That in mind, certain actions taken by people in the end seems out of character, inserted into the plot last minute. Of course, the author's dislike for deep character exploration does not help.   I picked up this trilogy despite my great hatred for love triangles and oblivious protagonists. However, I did enjoy reading the trilogy, even tolerating the subpar writing. The love triangle is annoying but bearable up to a point and its conclusion isn't all that surprising.  It does stand out as a unique YA novel. Just don't expect Katniss to be like Buffy because it's a story about fighting and war.
B005OOSPZO|5.0|Hm... I was surprised that there are 2 versions on the Disc: the theatrical and the approx. 3 minutes longer Japanese Version which contains a scene with two cooks debating about the time frontier.<br /><br />Never seen before the movie but was interesting to see. Its like the movie \\"Pearl Harbor\\" but without a love story!!! The special effects and action scenes are amazing (without any computer effects!!!) and any stunts looks dangerous.<br /><br />Also great the wounderful score of Jerry Goldsmith!!<br /><br />The picture quality looks good. Only in few scenes on the beginning are any few scenes a little bit corny. The Color are wonderful.<br /><br />The Bonus-Features are very interesting and contains Fox News from 1941 about the Attack.<br /><br />The release is a digibooklet with infos about making the movie and the planes.<br /><br />Fazit: ok... for younger viewer it could be a little bit boring but its a good movie to learn about history.

B002ZG98FU|1.0|I can safely say that this is one of the worst movies I have seen for a long time. It was boring, unintelligent, drawn out, predictable and the actors had next to zero chemistry between them. Rachel McAdams is super cute of course but painfully perky and other than being super cute and perky, she doesnt seem to have much else to offer. The movie itself just doesnt get going either and remains flat throughout. I actually had to finish this in two sittings because it was soooo boring.   There are many lows in this movie but the worst part is the total embarrassment Harrison Ford and Diane Keaton have become. I mean these are two of Hollywood's finest in terms of acting skill and knowing their craft; yet their roles have been reduced to that of bickering, nagging harpies. Especially Harrison Ford, who's always been this sharp, classy and together man, appeared frail, tired, and his hands were trembling. He looked like he really didn't want to do this and as a result delivered an unbelievable performance. To see this legendary actor be reduced to playing a one dimensional, tired and full of stereotypes sidekick to Rachel McAdams and Patrick Wilson, because they are younger and he is older, was very sad. It was a role unworthy of Harrison Ford.   Anyway, said Ford's character is a walking clichee. He plays the typical untouchable, revered star (veteran news anchor) whose track record of issues with historic significance covered puts every newscaster and journalist in CNN to shame. He is a man with a stern look and principles. Principles he likes ot shove into everyone's face. He has a disdain for the materialism and consumerism of our times and wants no part in it. In fact, he looks down on everyone, including the network that hired him and stuffed his pocket with lots of money, as having sold out the art of journalism for sponsorship and ratings. Of course he doesnt have a problem lowering those sacred standards and work for daytime tv himself. A fact conveniently glossed over by the writers. Oh well. At some point he felt like one of those guys who want to uphold principles for the sake of upholding them.   I dont know what's happened to Harrison Ford, if it is the script or him or what, but he did a lousy job if you ask me. He had already done a pretty bad job doing the last installment of Indiana Jones too. Anyway, here he plays a man who's covered significant historic events and who is supposed to be a legend in his field and passionate about his work. This passion is supposed to create tension and be a real challenge for Rachel McAdams' character who not only has a lot to learn from this man she so admires but who, as a producer, also has to worry about ratings and money - the two things Ford hates; yet, instead of working from that angle and thoughtfully laying out how Ford and Adams work that out, all we get is a fizzled out, flat performance portraying a silly, old man reminiscing about the past and holding on to that \\"sixteen-millimeter shrine\\" of his glory days. Ford was not believable as a deep intellectual who lost his bearings (which is what they like us to think). He was dispassionate and boring and just seemed grumpy and tired. His heart wasnt in this performance and that shone through. At some point he was so excited playing this role I thought he would break down and yawn. And let's not even talk about the truly monotonous manner with which he delivers the news. There is no way he can pull off a news anchor with that slow stumble. It just sounded too rehearsed and fake and somehow the producers thought we wouldnt catch it since it is Harrison Ford and who'd criticize Ford.   The movie went downhill from the moment Ford entered and he and Diane Keaton barked at each other like grumpy old people that have fallen victim to juvenile behavior do and extended into comatose lengths.   The love story between McAdams and Patrick Wilson was laughable and totally unbelievable. Patrick Wilson appears to just have been a stand-in, a nameless, faceless hunk to fit the plot element as the handsome dream-man she clearly deserves and who, as a result, doesnt need to be given much of a character other than looking good and being there to move the story along. The specifics of how and why they fall in love are not explored; they have a couple of exchanges and then he becomes the love of her life. Consequently when she says \\"you are the first person I thought about wanting to share this with\\" or something, it looks ridiculous and insincere, because how could she love him, she hasnt exchanged more than 3 sentences with him. After she says that, there is a cut (i.e. we dont get ot see his reaction and what he says) and the next frame opens right in the middle of a conversation between them after she \\"told him\\", where he asks her about her JOB. So to recap, this is how the scene went down (not in so many words):  She: \\"I love you, you are my soul mate. You are the first person I had to tell about this\\"   He: \\"Uh-huh. That's great. So, tell me about your JOB and promotion\\".   Suffice it so say, the love story was totally superfluous in addition to really not adding anything to the movie other than being an all too familiar plot device. In order for the main character to be successful in her career, it is imperative that the obligatory love interest be there too else the formula is incomplete.   One of the issues with this movie was that it wasnt clear what this was trying to be. A love story? No, because that wasnt worked out. Was it supposed to be about TV Shows and the hard world of TV production? No, because that wasnt worked out either and the TV setting just seemed to be the incidental backdrop. Was it supposed to be about disillusionment in journalism? No, because - as mentioned above - Ford just did not deliver anything worthwhile and thought provoking in that regard but clichees and banalities. So it is really unclear what they wanted this to be. Drama, rom-com, comedy, comedy-drama, romance, journalism, hard work, working with legends whose glory days are behind them? To me, it seemed a bit like a neurotic mess.   So all in all this was a boring, plain movie with flat characters and unintelligent dialogues. It was also very unworthy of the actors. Of course after writing this review I found that JJ Abrams produced it so it doesnt surprise me at all that this has turned out to be such a vacuous, empty and boring star-studded piece of garbage.

But when it came up on sale, I decided to give it a shot since it had gotten such great reviews and I had enjoyed their previous albums. The first listen-through I was still a little on the fence about it, but a couple listens later and I was hooked. I don't know what it is, but this album just grows on you with each listen. \\"Just a Kiss,\\" \\"Singing Me Home,\\" and \\"Cold As Stone\\" are the standout tracks for me.

Of the four extra songs on the deluxe version, two are good (\\"Maybe We're Already Gone\\" and \\"Everything But Me\\"), one is 'meh' (\\"Who's They\\") and the fourth, \\"Lullaby,\\" just doesn't do it for me.

1451627289|2.0|Stephen King is a gifted writer with a great ear for dialogue that rings true and an extraordinary, albeit more than a little twisted, imagination.  His rare gifts make the basic flaw in this book all the more tragic:  how, in 2011, can a man of Mr. King's erudition state boldly that he thinks that there is a 98% chance that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in assassinating JFK?  It boggles the mind that a man who obviously was fascinated by the Oswald saga was so limited in his intellectual analysis of the possibility, or probability (for anyone thinking straight), that Oswald was only a small piece of a much larger conspiracy, or was exactly what he said he was -- a patsy. In his epilogue, Mr. King cites Gerald Posner's Case Closed as his primary authority for his lone nut version of events.  That is all one needs to know about the intellectual and logical limits of both of their analyses.  The Warren Commission was on the money.  All these conspiracy theorists are unbalanced and flat wrong.  It hurts my brain to hear such a ridiculous, unimaginative, and poorly informed, pronouncement.  Please, Mr. King, next time try to think outside the box just a little bit. This book, from a talented and creative novelist, no less, was far less than it should have been.  Oswald as lone nut as a central premise. With certitude. Please!!!!!

0060873086|3.0|Read by John Bedford Lloyd<br />Duration: 14 hours<br /><br />Michael Crichton died in 2008 and left 'Micro' as an unfinished manuscript. I have no idea how much of this book is actually Crichton's and how much belongs to Richard Preston. To me it felt like a typical Crichton novel.<br /><br />A typical Crichton novel for me is a mixed bag. It has grand themes - truly big, big ideas with foundations in real science. Grand themes about the dangers of too much innovation without enough ethical considerations, lots of Gee Whiz stuff (think of the movie 'Jurassic Park' where the paleontologists are mesmerized when they first see the dinosaurs) and laughable plot lines with sketch characters (the worst for me was 'State of Fear' in which the big menacing bad guys were wedging themselves into Toyota Priuses as they stalked their opponents - yes, the Prius, the ultimate pursuit car!).<br /><br />This book has all of that in spades.<br /><br />The plot revolves around NanoGen, a Hawaiian start up company that has figured out (or stolen) how to shrink full-sized objects down to a very, very small size. People are about one half of an inch tall when they are shrunk. NanoGen claims to be using the technology to thoroughly search the Hawaiian rain forest for biological discoveries that  could be used to help create medicines. Their plan is to search the micro-world bit by bit (literally square foot by square foot) in tiny detail so that even creatures that cannot be seen with the naked eye can be harvested and investigated for possible uses in a bio-technology laboratory.<br /><br />But, the bad guy in charge of the project also wants to use these tiny robots as weapons and has made plans to corrupt the original vision of NanoGen's founders. So, murder and mayhem result and soon enough we are following a group of college graduate students who have been shrunken and dumped into the rain forest in an attempt to get rid of even more witnesses (why weren't they immediately squished and flushed down the toilet? The bad guy is so over-the-top in his sadism that he wants to prolong their punishment, which of course eventually backfires.).<br /><br />So, when our seven college graduate students are dumped in the rain forest (in the micro world as Crichton/Preston usually refer to it) we have several scenes that are reminiscent of Jurassic Park, except we don't have T. Rex and Velociraptors. Rather, we have centipedes, spiders, wasps and ants - all armored and all very dangerous to very tiny people. This part of the book is by far the best - the descriptions of the bugs, their habits, their defenses and their weapons are all fascinating. If it weren't for these details I would have to rate this novel poorly, but the descriptions are entertaining in and of themselves.<br /><br />John Bedford Lloyd's narration of the book was solid but really did little to enhance or detract from the book.  His voices were solid. To be fair, most of the plot was inane, so it was not like he was working with a literary classic. His deep voice did add a lot to the menacing descriptions of the bugs.he-top in his sadism that he wants to prolong their punishment, which of course eventually backfires.).

Loud was ok and fun, but it wasn't anything special in my opinion.  Talk That Talk is a really fun album that I listen to all the time. I love every single track. I used to be just a casual Rihanna fan, but I really love her now. It reminds me of Rated R a lot and is a solid pop album.  Some of my favorite tracks are You Da One, Where Have You Been, We Found Love, Talk that Talk, Birthday Cake and Drunk on Love.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I haven't read a book that kept me awake long into the night in some time. I couldn't put this down and when I had to, all I wanted to do was pick it back up and finish. I know this is a young adult book but I'm 35 and was hooked!
0062101897|5.0|This book is seriously epic. It includes everything you could possibly want to know about the HP movies in one book. It can seem overwhelming at some times just because there is SO much to have, but it's so great.  Any Harry Potter fan would be glad to have it.
B004XWLN20|5.0|I've only seen the first few hours of extras so far that come with this set but so far it's been amazing.  It's so much fun to learn all about the fun and challenges they had the behind the scenes during those ten years.  Smallville is one of the best series ever made and absolutely my favorite \\"Superman\\" series on TV.  Of course, it had its seasons that were less than perfect.  However, the wonderful character development and sheer cinematic beauty of this series always remained consistent.  Michael Rosenbaum is the perfect Lex Luthor.  Allison Mack took Chloe from a one-dimensional \\"Lois Lane\\" replacement to a complicated, intelligent, witty foil for Clark's serious nature.  Plus, there's nothing more fun that watching Tom Welling and Erica Durance portray Clark and Lois as they slowly fall in love with each other.  A perfect series!
B001OGWY1W|5.0|The Dark Knight quickly became one of my favorite movies of all-time.  The person that stole the show for me was Heath Ledger. During the movie I sometimes forgot it was even Heath. He put himself so much into the role that he was barely recognizable. Truly an incredible performance. He wasn't the only incredible performance of course, everyone was able to hold their own.  TDK has all the right amounts of action in it. It's such a great and fun movie to watch. Definitely recommended.
0756405890|5.0|I read this book about a year ago, and i fell in love with the way Patrick Rothfuss writes his novels. The book captured my attention immediately and i felt very attached to the Kvothe, almost as if he was my best friend. I really got sucked into this book and was ecstatic when the sequel came out i bought it the day it released and read the 1000 page book in 3 days. I am anxiously waiting for more from Rothfuss.   READ THIS BOOK AND READ THE SECOND BOOK. YOU WILL LIKE IT NO MATTER WHAT KIND OF READER YOU ARE.
B005HSL626|4.0|A classic game, but the rounds are a tiny bit too random. Some rounds you get 10 powerups, others you get none.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|amazing movie,must have BD . defeinitely do get it if you are a fan of the x men franchise. amazon was swift as usual in delivering the bds
B0063IH60K|4.0|Really nice background color choices and large size cards easy to read. Fun and hints are there when you need them.
B004UOCF3W|5.0|That's the ROCK music I am talking about. Not much, or none of those useless electronic effects, but pure rock. Now we're talking.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|Had been watching the first two (scratched) seasons from the library for quite a while and was so excited to get the whole thing at a] a reasonable price and b] unscratched disks!  Introducing our kids to the show now and they are really enjoying it.
B005ZUR724|1.0|this is one of the best apps ive ever played on a mobile, and so far only the second MMO ive played on a mobile. works great and is for anyone who likes wow or wow like games, BUT gameloft does not handle updates well, the android market got an update which killed the amazon game because we have to wait for amazon to test and release the update. be warned this is not the first time it has happened and judging by gamelofts nonresponsiveness it wont be the last.
B005ZUR724|1.0|installed a week ago, great game... but logged in today and unable to play because missing update. when working 5 star game. I expect more from a game with a subscription fee.
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|I thought the first half of the movie was a bit slow and thought to myself that it needed to \\"get to the point\\" a bit sooner.  I liked this movie for the antics the women did.  I like how the director showed what it was like for a black person during the segregation era.  I understand that it was one woman's point of view, but unless everyone lived everyone else's lives, you couldn't REALLY know what it was like back then as each individual has their own feelings on the situation.  That being said, I enjoyed all the 'comedy' of the movie and thought the story was well written.  It was nice to see that 'revenge' on the poor behavior of the white women that were not only abusive to the black maids but other white women.  I was able to 'connect' with all the women and it helped me to sympathies with black people of that time period.  And now want to read the book!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game was really good and I really like it  I prefer the winning deal. its by far the best deal of the game
B0059XTUB8|3.0|It has a certain surface charm to it, particularly if you're interested in old movies and movie stars. But like Marilyn Monroe herself, My Week With Marilyn isn't that deep or that interesting. Nor is Michelle Williams's performance something to write home about. She's not embarrassing or inept, just unaffecting. She merely rustles up images of the real thing, who, we're reminded, was actually dull. Her inner circle may have sucked up to her like she was a brilliantly innovative and intellectual devotee to the craft of acting, but the bottom line is that people were fascinated with Monroe because they wanted to have sex with her or because they wanted to be like her, and that was why she was famous and adored (and hated, too, I imagine). The film offers up the classic \\"I'm-beautiful-so-no-one-thinks-I-can-act\\" portrait of Marilyn but declines to comment on it. This movie tries to make an awards grab without any fingers...

B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This is a great Kindle Fire app! I like all of the different tools, and there are a lot of colors. I also like all of the different backgrounds and borders. It's a lot of fun doodling with this app! :)
B005HSG3VK|4.0|Like the way this cover fits and looks. Protects the device well. Does not work very well as a stand. Groove in the black front cover is not very deep and doesn't hold well. Not that big a deal, I don't think it's used on a flat surface that much. Mostly hand held.
B005ZUR724|2.0|i know how to update apps... but this is rediculous. i have had this for 1 day and it says i need to update, yet there is no update available! its a fantastic game but for as long as this update situation lasts, i want an extra, free membership day for however many days this is going in... its the least you guys can do
B0063IH60K|5.0|plays well on the kindle fire. many different levels. never a boring flight again.  download it only if you want some fun
B005ZUR724|1.0|I down loaded this game and played for 45 min to an hour and then i got of when i got on it said i needed an update. there was no update! i even tryed buying a month. don't get unless you want to risk your money.
B005KDWUFA|4.0|I recently purchased the album. I have all of their albums. I  first thought it a bit disappointing, but the more I listen, the more I feel it is a work showing the group to be maturing. Simple as that. Music is personal, so some have been disappointed. I love all of their albums. This is a very good album that can grow on you. On tour in the USA in 2012. I have not purchased tickets, but hope to attend. The album is fine, with minor criticisms. I love title song \\"Wicked Game\\" and \\"Don't Cry For Me Argentina\\" This is a mature work.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game is very entertaining and well worth a dollar. As far as this type of game goes, you can do no better. A lot of fun and the replay value is fairly high. Even after it's over, you can go back and try to best your score and open up new levels. Highly recommended.
B006NXIO7O|3.0|That Luc Bessson (the TRANSPORTER  series, LA FEMME NIKITA, etc)  wrote this sprawling blood bath (with Robert Mark Kamen) is a bit of a surprise.  Usually Beeson's scripts are smart, clever, and witty despite the gore. This time the cake fell. Perhaps the sludge is due to director Olivier Megaton's obsession with jumping out of windows and gory assassinations that prevents this film from taking flight because he certainly has a cast that could have given him much more.<br /><br />!0 year old Cataleya (Amandla Stenberg) witnesses her parents deaths by the ruling mob in Bogata Colombia in 1992 and is aided in escape to the USA by unique means where she is adopted by the Restrepos (Cliff Curtis). Instead of school Cataleya wants to become a killer to avenge her patents murder: Restrepo bargains with her - school first then he will teach her how to kill.  Jump 15 years and Cataleya (Zoe Saldana) is a full blown assassin, working as a hitwoman as a day job and seeking out her parents killers by night.  Through a series of +/- creative disguises and escapes Cataleya continues to murder, falls in love with and artist (MIchael Vartan), fools the police (Lennie James), avoids the complicit FBI ( Callum Blue) and continues her struggle to kill the persons of interest - Jodri Moll&agrave;, Beto Benites and Jesse Borrego.  Is it all resolved after the bad guys are all dead?  No, because there is the suggestion of a sequel!<br /><br />Good actors, sloppy script, redundant violence, noise, and lots of blood - if that is what lights your fire, this is a movie for you. Grady Harp, December 11
B005H0IW6W|4.0|Michael Buble is in fine voice and spirit for his full-length Christmas album.  He has unexpected support from his guests and really sounds like he really enjoys the holiday.  The \\"Felix Navidad\\" tribute to his wife is a nice surprise. Some find his \\"Santa Buddy\\" a little weird, since it's not usually a song guys sing and the arrangements are a bit generic for some of the selections, but it's a great addition to anyone's Christmas song mix.
B004HO6I4W|5.0|This product has a digital copy as well which I have it in my iPod touch and iPhone as well so we can watch anytime we want. Its a great deal of price for the DVD/Blu ray and digital copy.
B003Y5H5AQ|1.0|this was let down. my kids watch movies in their room etc on their ipads. sooooo we always pay extra to get the digital copy version. the \\"ultra violet\\" thing is a scam. don't bother buying this for the so called digital copy. i feel ripped off. just doesn't work like it should. that and they will not let you download it if you don't agree to let them share your info with their \\"partners\\"?
B006C1DH92|5.0|At first I thought this was a generic knockoff but come to find out its really fruit ninjas game but with the addition of a popular character who likes slicing things himself Lol. great free app of the day and just awesome overall, but does someone know how to see ur achievements? : 
B005FVNJTS|4.0|As you would expect with a biography, there are many insights into the \\"Rafa Organisation\\". It makes you appreciate his game even more. Quite early, 24 of age, to bring out this book, but it covers his story from the start to the top.   again, Rafa's insights are the best, and that is what one wants in a biography.  There is nothing like this on Federer, so we will wait for his.
1439107955|4.0|This is a very interesting study of the history of cancer treatment and research.  But, I have been reading and reading and reading and am still only 25% of the way through the book.  Would love to have a shorter version, without all the meandering.  The material is overall great, but there is a bit too much of it for my preference.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this DVD in September 2011, and it was today, Dec.26th 2011 that I finally did the whole series in a row. I started, of course, in level 1, followed to 2 and 3. Then I did 1 & 2, then 2 & 3, and today I finally completed the whole series. The way I did it though was 2-3-1, because I figured I would be too exhausted by the time I´d get to 3, that I might as well do level 1 last. I have to say this has been a real challenge, but I am sore and feel great. I was in very bad shape during the summer, that´s why I went step by step until I made it. I have always worked out, whether at the gym or at home, so I kind of know what the right postures are and what not do when working out with weights. So I also knew that when Jillian said these workouts are to be done every day she was not right. Until these days, I still don´t understand why she recommends that. I´ve read some reviews that say people hurt their knees doing this exercises, and it´s probably due to those two factors: bad posture and over exercising. For older people or people not used to workout hard it is definitely not a good choice. Other than that, if you do them every other day, or 3 times a week,like I´ve been doing them, this exercises are the best.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I really like playing this game. It gets harder as you play it and never gets boring. The graphics are awesome and the music is great.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|We received this toy as a gift for Christmas and it has been played with for 3 days straight! Between the kids 8 and up and all the grown ups, it's been a constant challenge to see who can get further in the maze.  We love it!
B005QBKXOQ|5.0|I ordered this and Nickelback new CD at the same time.  In my opinion, this album is better than Nickelback's.  It is his best album.
B006JPS1OM|4.0|Fun game that is free. Will play a few times. Game is fast and not too hard. I really enjoyed.
B0063IH60K|5.0|lots of fun easy to use easy go win. I like that there are so many different options to make ignore fun. there's an undo button and hint button
B005ZUR724|1.0|Got this game on Christmas for my new kindle fire, like many people. It played flawlessly and enjoyably for a whole two days before it became unplayable due to some phantom update. Kindle fire users are booted from the game after being told there is a new update, and are directed towards the app store, where no update is listed. I'll change my rating after it's fixed, as it's a surprisingly polished mobile mmo that I enjoyed quite a bit for 48 hours.  My guess is the insane number of kindle fires distributed over the holidays coupled with the fact that this game was on sale caused problems. Either way, frustrating.
B005ZUR724|1.0|Game is fun . . . gameloft sucks.  Ive had problems since the date of purchase.  Save your money.  await for World of Midgard.
B005ZUR724|1.0|there is no update to install. b/c they have not made it for the kindle fire only for other devices.<br />call gameloft to tell them that there is no update to install for the kindle fire version.
B004SBX112|5.0|No adds on mine dunno what others are whining about. Game plays much smoother without the adds too. If u like the game buy it its a whole dollar u could drop on the ground and not miss
B000NV55RY|1.0|I read the reviews prior to renting this movie and think overall they are inaccurate.  The movie has a few laughable moments; however, overall it is not funny.  I wish I had not wasted my money.

0307593312|2.0|Rather bland and pointless book. The main female character is unbelievable; a beautiful, intelligent, young Japanese woman with an avid interest in guns, sex with strangers and middle-aged, balding men (in your dreams Mr. Murakami!). Insipid male character Tengo has no desire to improve his dreary life. Fixation on breasts, sex with minors, and more breasts. I read the book right through to the end assuming that all the loose ends would be tied up and the questions left hanging would be answered but, unfortunately, that was not the case. I still have no idea what the book was about.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|No adds on mine dunno what others are whining about. Game plays much smoother without the adds too. If u like the game buy it its a whole dollar u could drop on the ground and not miss
B005HSG3VK|5.0|For the price this is an awesome cover! It protects my Fire, Luckily I have not dropped it to test it, but I just feel better knowing it is on it just in case. I also love that it sits up by itself when watching movies.
0811879542|5.0|The book was great.  It was in great condition and arrived ahead of schedule.  We were very pleased with the service.
B001NPDCFQ|2.0|While looking for a movie gift to give to my mother for Christmas I was excited to see this oldie offered in Blu Ray. I even bought her a Blu Ray Player to watch it on.   I don't need to tell you how disappointed and angry I was to find out it is only done in a 4:3 aspect ratio. The ad says \\"widescreen\\" but the black bars placed vertically on each side beg to differ. It is so aggravating after carefully scrutinizing every last detail only to find one huge one omitted.   Why include the fancy book, the features disc, and all the vintage hoopla but neglect to provide the biggest asset of quality transfer.....a theater-like widescreen picture!   It's sad when my mother says the version she recorded off of the TCM network a few months ago is widescreen, but the $26 movie I purchased with all its trivia and trimmings is \\"made for TV\\".
B005URRCUY|5.0|I recently bought The Black Keys album El Camino and I do like it.  However, I like their old blues-rock style more.  I'm all for bands trying new things because that's what true artists of any craft should do, but creative energy has a carrying capacity as well.  I'm not sure The Black Keys would have the ability to carry this new style for another few albums, because their original fan base might not like that.  If they mixed this current style with their old blues-rock original soul, then that would be a nice transition.  Becoming more pop-rock doesn't really suit The Black Keys in my opinion.  It's a nice departure for them, and because it is them, I do find this album appealing, but I'm looking for more soul....which was what attracted me to them in the first place.  Still love them, and I would recommend this album for all true fans, but if you expected to hear their old soulful sound, it's not on this album.  Danger Mouse needs to stick to doing Danger Mouse music.  The Black Keys need no alteration! Don't change Black Keys, true fans love you for who you are! :-)
B006C1DH92|1.0|this app is a joke boring game waste of a FAOTD. save yourself the time and energy dont bother downloading this nonsense.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|I recently bought this album and everyone who has heard it loves it!  Even if they are not a big fan of Christmas music, they still love Buble's version of the classics.  He is a modern day Frank Sinatra and will hopefully have a long and vibrant career.  After the exposure he will get with this Christmas album, I have a feeling he will become even more popular and bring back this style of music.  Keep making great music Buble!
145551389X|5.0|When people think of Gaga, they instantly think \\"outrageous.\\" She's known for great dance tunes & fashion. But if you're a fan, you know there's SO much more! Unlike the average pop star, she isn't surface only. She can belt out a ballad, jam on the piano, sing jazz accapela... all while fighting for what she believes in. As for fashion, she isn't afraid to be REAL. As glam as she is, she is cool with being naked, and not just physically. She can show you what she looks like 1st thing in the morning and not get all freaked out about it, as most celebs would. It's just one more thing I love about her. She's just as real as she is unreal. That's what you're getting if you get this book. Pure Gaga, with no frills, just gorgeous, candid photos, even when she's not her most gorgeous (but then again, that what makes her gorgeous).
B001F6ZIXC|4.0|It was originally the title of the show that made me avoid it and today years after it first aired I just finished watching the first season. The series was consistently intelligent and the characters tend to grow on you. The show, despite it's violent nature, seems to keep growing on you with every passing episode. This is the story of Jax Teller, vice president of the gang called SOA. He is one of the more encrypted slow-burner characters that I have come across. It is the effortless nature of the show to portray characters and storylines effectively to the audience that makes me a fan.<br /><br />I've often jumped off my chair waving my hands in the air, I've always often just been dumbstruck and at times I've been over eager for the show to be done with because all hell will break lose in just one episode. There are some women in this show but they take a back seat but don't be mistaken there is a queen bee played magnificentally by Katey Seagal who plays Jax's mom \\"Gemma\\"<br /><br />It would be not incorrect to assume that the show is very inspiring and seems to somehow always have a couple of tricks up it's sleeve. My hats of to the creators. I can't even believe I have three seasons left to be watched. I tell you I feel lucky.<br /><br />PS - Some very solid rock tunes that I have never heard before often play in this show. I also wonder if the next seasons will be even more ruthless.
1594630844|5.0|30 Lessons for Living is a book to be savored.  Written by Karl Pillemer, gerontologist and researcher at Cornell University, it is a product of the author's Legacy Project, a series of surveys and interviews conducted of those over 65, the \\"experts\\" on living to whom the book is dedicated.  The purpose of the research is to identify the keys to the good life that those of a certain age have managed to uncover.    The book is broken down into several major themes having to do with such things as marriage, parenting, careers, health, and most generally how to achieve happiness.  The lessons presented, with some exceptions--it's normal to have a favorite child--are not exactly earth-shattering.  But the beauty of the book comes from the diversity of voices and individual expression that refract and enrich the observations from people who are remarkably aware and self-reflective.  Unfortunately, for stylistic reasons and because--at their age they know better--the thoughts and advice given here will be lost on youth.  But for those who, like this writer, are on the cusp of seniorhood, the insights on lives well-lived are both instructive and heartening.  This is a very good book for an individual reader contemplating life's \\"golden\\" years, even better if it can be shared across generations.
B006C1DH92|5.0|It take a great game like fruit ninja and adds the puss in boots theme.  The new additions make it better.
B002S0OBMS|5.0|I love the story and the originality of the charachters in this story. Relationships and people can change that much...it has for me in my real life. I just wish the live production would come to the states! The Phantom & Christine on this recording are GREAT vocally and have so much expression to their voices!
B006C1DH92|5.0|It has been a long time that Amazon has given us a good  free app and yesterday's app was the worst yet. I'm glad they've pulled themselves out of the pit of corporate greed if just for a moment to give us an app worth the button click.
B0052VUNHC|3.0|This was an easy quick read for me.  I did not find the book terribly realistic, but I did finish it and was curious how it would end.  I do have some of the same concerns other readers did about the amount of violence and blatant co-dependency the book seemed to almost glorify.  I would be horrified, absolutely horrified if my husband beat the crap out of people he thought were flirting with me.   *****SPOILERS AHEAD******************  Also what bothered me was the big build up to Abby's secret past and terrible father - only for him to appear once, and just by showing up and asking - he somehow convinces her to not only use all her saved money to help him, but to go to Vegas and illegally gamble to get him out of his debt.  Then the father disappears and that's the end of that?  Also, when they do go to Vegas, she goes to ONE casino to gamble, and her old boyfriend works there - gives her some time to gamble illegally before telling her she has to go. She has not yet won enough money, but they don't simply go to another casino?  It's VEGAS - there are literally dozens of casinos.  The characters are clearly immature - I mean they are college students - but I was a college student too and have never know such impulsive and selfish people.   It's a bit ridiculous.  The whole book is a bit ridiculous and yes, it is fiction and yes, I found parts of it entertaining, but it's not SCIENCE fiction, so I have to buy into the fact that these people could exist and in the end, I didn't believe it.
B005N1E8A4|5.0|WOW!!  I witnessed first hand the power of Kylie when she toured the states in 2009 and was gobbsmacked then.  2011 saw Aprodite Live come to the USA.  You will enter to a greek themed concert, Kylie herself entering the stage standing on a golden clam shell - costumes by Dolce & Gabbana - her dancers are HOT - more muscular than other dancers.    I cannot begin to say enough about Kylie, I've been a fan since Light Years and my love has grown and grown. Like others, I have noted the discs are mislabeled, but BluRay is the best way to watch this concert.   Long Live Kylie!
0553288105|1.0|This book has about three plots, tenuously connected, with some clever concepts of alien beings, with pseudosexual innuendoes, dragging-on ad nauseum in inadequately developing a few good guys, and an arch-bad guy, never coming to grips with a real story. Its abrupt end leaves several strings, and lots of subplots dangling and mystifyingly unclosed.<br />Proof that even a \\"Grand Master\\" of Science Fiction can, if he types long enough, write a dud.<br />Highly un-recommended. Pulp.
B003VANOFY|5.0|This headset sounds amazing, even with the surround sound effects off. It has a good amount of bass, and the wireless is stable. I've tested the microphone, and it is clear.

B00164KYV4|2.0|After an hour or so into He's Just Not That Into You and I found that I was not that into it because it was boring, pretentious, clich&eacute;d ad nauseam and insulting to both female and male audiences.  The movie is populated with the pathetic women who just talk and talk about their relationships or the lack of them, and are needy, desperate, and super-annoying. Infantile men, scary of commitments or those who are in the relationship but could not remember why they actually wanted to be in one. Plus, it has nothing to do with the comedies. It is totally not funny and anti-romantic. Just imagine Sex and the City with no sex, Love, actually with NO Love at all, actually, and When Harry Met Sally with the main characters absolutely unlikable and lifeless. I finished watching the whole thing hoping that it would improve and give me something to like in it. The only story that I found a notch better than the rest was that of Neil and Beth (Jennifer Anniston and Ben Affleck), who have been together for seven years, love each other but are not married because Neil does not believe in marriage. Both actors were convincing in the story that was not as annoying as the rest of them.<br /><br />But for the most of the time, I was not into the movie's characters at all. I read the plot of the movie in Wiki and in writing it does not look as irritating and boring as the film. Then I found out that the film was based on the bestselling book by two Sex and the City scribes (that explains the similarities between two), Greg Behrendt and Liz Tuccillo. I read some of it and liked it a lot.  So, what went wrong with the movie?  Were the actors trying too much) or 2+ hours running time was way too long? As the result, the movie is simply lifeless and plain with no sparks or romance, and, sadly, even the all-stars cast could not save it.

B000MGB6M8|2.0|Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />Both the 2.40:1 (or 2.35:1) video and DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio are excellent in this Blu-Ray movie.  I have not complaints about the audio or video quality.<br /><br />The movie is full of action, but I found it boring anyway.  Some movies I wish would never end, but I thought the end of this movie couldn't come soon enough.
B005LJK3AC|1.0|typical of trash Hollywood is now passing off as comedy.  Crude and tasteless and not the least bit funny.  This is without a doubt the worst so called comedy in many years.  Amazing how far the studios feel they must push the envelope to appeal to a younger audience.  Sadly, most of the target demographic audience think this is real comedy.
030788743X|2.0|UPDATE: 6/5/2012 -<br /><br />Goodreads has a HUGE banner ad for this book and the new cover for the paperback edition, which prompted me to update my review.<br /><br />This is a classic do-not-judge-a-book-by-its-cover warning: If you think the cover, and the world it portrays, looks interesting, please be aware that the cover represents about 5% of the book. This 5% is the most (and really, the only) interesting aspect of the book: the author's view of the future real world. It's a well-done dystopia inspired by the original Donkey Kong, Hard Hat Mack, and other 80s video games. The other 95% of the book is set in a boring, predictable, digital world, and unless you're wearing neon leg warmers, a side ponytail, and carrying a boom box RIGHT NOW, there is nothing of interest in much of this story.<br /><br />---<br /><br />I don't know why I finished this book. The plot was fun, I guess, but entirely predictable.<br /><br />The plot of the book is this: a crazy old man who invented this insanely realistic (and therefore completely unbelievable) MMO video game loved the 80s. He wants everyone to share his infatuation with music, movies, TV shows and video games of the 80s, so he creates a contest before dies. In order to win his multi-billion-dollar fortune and control of OASIS (the aforementioned MMO), people have to study all sorts of not-so-obscure 80s pop culture references. The real world is kind of interesting and post-apocalyptic, but under-utilized.<br /><br />OASIS is too detailed to be believable. Yes, this is sci-fi, but it takes place in this world, a world in which the 80s happened. It name drops many MMOs, suspiciously neglecting the thing OASIS most resembles: Second Life. A physics engine as comprehensive and detailed as OASIS's is unbelievable. So is the way all the players play the game as though it's a real world. Most people don't play games as though they're real life.<br /><br />The whole point of the book seems to be that the author really liked the 80s. You should too! If you don't get any of the references, don't worry: he'll explain every one of them in intricate detail, taking the fun out of the \\"Oh, I get that!\\" point of pop culture references. And... that's it. The novel never says much of substance. I wanted more. In the end, the only statement the novel makes is that reality is better than virtual reality, pretty much negating everything you've just read.<br /><br />I was born in 1983, so I don't possess the 80s nostalgia that so many people have. The retro factor only works if you were there in the first place. I played a lot of video games, but if I never have to watch another John Cusack movie, it'll be too soon. I would like to give it an extra star for pop culture references, but I personally didn't care for any of them. Plus, the author does nothing to convince you the 80s were cool if you don't already think so.<br /><br />The only reason this book isn't marketing toward young adults is because today's young adults weren't born in the 80s and unlike the hero of this book, Wade Watts, they couldn't care less about the 80s. Smart kids. As I said, the author does nothing to convince you otherwise.ked the 80s. You should too!

0307454541|3.0|I read this two years ago but never reviewed it. I work in a bookstore and have had lots of customers ask me about the book now that the David Fincher movie is coming out. \\"Would I like it?\\" they ask, as though I know their reading preferences. My stock answer: \\"It depends on how you feel about serial killers and magazine publishing.\\" The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is about a 70-20 mix of the two, with literary sensation Lisbeth Salander on the side.<br /><br />Old women love this book. I know this because back when the Swedish movie came out, I went to see it and it was me and the Red Hat Society in the theater. If I hadn't sold the book to multiple AARP members, I would have thought I was in the wrong screening room.<br /><br />Perhaps the senior citizens are having violent revenge fantasies about men who done them wrong. That's a big part of the book, and the most compelling to read. Lisbeth Salander is independent and diabolical. There's also intriguing family drama in the frozen Swedish countryside. Oh, and a few hundred pages about magazine publishing, finances, and blackmail. Feel free to skip those, although the polyamorous editor, Erika Berger, is an interesting side character.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the book gets bogged down in details. No one ever opens a laptop without giving you a full run-down of its specs, down to processing speed and amount of RAM. The rest of the writing is dry and basic. As with all translated books, it's hard to tell if the translator left out the spice or if the original writing was a dull concoction to begin with.<br /><br />Dragon Tattoo is a stand-alone book. Yes, there are two more, but they merely function as a sequel, not a must-read trilogy. Plus, they succeed in demolishing any and all of Lisbeth Salander's independence and credibility, turning her from vigilante to a lonely man's wet dream. That's something else that drags down this series: Larsson's Gary Stu-ing of the whole thing. Mikael Blomqust, homely coffee-chugging journalist beds practically every woman he stumbles across. Even the woman can't figure out why they're drawn to him. What starts as a competent serial-killer mystery quickly devolves into Larsson's fantasy: solving mysteries, taking down the Swedish crime syndicate, and converting lesbians in bed.woman he stumbles across.

B003ZMF26W|3.0|I have been using a trusty Logitech mx-518 for years and decided it might be time for an upgrade. While shopping at a CompUSA, I noticed this mouse, the CM Storm Inferno on a really good sale for $39.99 and decided to give it a try! I was actually quite impressed with what the mouse has to offer. I can't say I agree with some of the negative reviews here as I had a good experience with the mouse (except for two things I will explain later). Some of the jokers here don't understand that WOW does not allow the use of macro buttons, so any MMO mouse will not work. I felt the software was great,allowing full programmability and custom profiles. The sensor seemed very solid and the mouse had some nice additional features too. It definitely has a cool look and a bit of bling with all of the lighting and LED options on the mouse. I particularly like the vented front with the red emanating out of the front whenever you click. The additional buttons on the mouse were nice and I particularly liked the macro button on the top right, setting it to take screen shots while in game.<br /><br />One of my complaints is that the browser \\"forward\\" button on the left side is just too far up for where I hold a mouse. I had to reach waaay up to hit it. Also, the \\"Storm Tactics\\" button on the left is exactly where the browser \\"backward\\" button should be. I kept hitting that for the back button on accident. They really should have put that one somewhere else altogether! My main complaint with the mouse is the ergonomics though. I prefer the claw grip mouse style (fingertip) and found this mouse completely unusable with that method. The sides are a smooth contour upward and there is just nothing there to grip if you are a claw grip user. If I were a palm user im sure it would be fine, although I tried the palm method and it still didn't quite feel right. Unfortunately, even with all of the cool features and functionality of this mouse, I had to return it because it just wasn't comfortable for me to use. Trust me people, if you are a claw or fingertip style gamer, DO NOT buy this mouse. If you're a palm gripper, give it a shot because it seems like a great value for the solid features you get. I was considering giving it 4 stars, but given the shortfalls of the misplaced buttons and the ergonomics I feel it would be a solid 3.5 stars at best.use.

B006C1DH92|5.0|absolutely phenomenal.   If you like FN, you'll love this version just as much, if not more.   the new \\"bandito\\" challenge is awesome. random selection. never the same 4 challenges and it gets harder each stage. very well done.  Love the original but was getting a little bored with it due to lack of variety. this version just raised it up a notch... or two.  I think the bandito stages, due to random selection, will keep it fresh for players for sometime.  love the new blades as well.   at first I was a bit hesitant to download due to the Children theme(puss in boots) but so glad I did.  definitely worth the retail price but for free, it's a must download.   Thanks Amazon!

Apart from some deficiencies in the quality of the DVD, her use of profanity and the level and tone of her banter detracts from her amazing musical ability.  She is still young and will no doubt realize that her musical appeal transcends age groups and that she has style and charisma.   She does not need to seek sensation because her music speaks for itself.

B004A8ZWVK|4.0|Every once in a while I get thrown off by a film. No, not the usual disappointment of a hyped movie that goes flat. Or films that come out of nowhere to attract my attention against all reason like the Swedish Girl With The Dragon Tattoo series. Here my dilemma is of a different sort. And, perhaps, I have only myself to blame. See, I saw the film under review, The Help, under \\"false pretenses.\\" As a short-cut for not having to read the book, a book about the trials and tribulations of black maids and their junior league jim crow employers having their stories publicized, once someone told me that the film pretty well followed the lines of the book. Of course not reading the book before-hand meant that while I was vaguely familiar with the theme I was not prepared for what was to come.       And this is where taking a short-cut, while not always fatal, played me false this time. Not that there was anything particularly wrong with the film as a piece of feel good, moral uplift, pseudo-post racial society fluff. At that level it did what one reading the novel would have expected (according to my source who had read the book and seen the film). See the time frame of the film, in the cauldron of the black civil rights movement down South in Mississippi burning in 1963 or so is all wrong for the light-hearted treatment. So it is very hard, very, very hard for a man of the \\"generation of `68\\" to take in a \\"fluff\\" film about those very maids, gardeners, janitors, steelworker, laundresses, and seamstresses who, along with the SNCC students, formed the core of the civil rights struggle back then. So maybe, just maybe in another fifty or one hundred years when we are meaningfully closer to that post-racial society that some benighted politicians and academic keep heralding this film might seem  appropriate look at a primitive time well past. Until then just enjoy this one as after dinner entertainment.

B00009NHC5|4.0|If anybody touches a hair on the head of Audrey Hepburn they have to answer to me. Okay? Except in this little psychological thriller of a film, Wait Until Dark, from the late 1960s Ms. Hepburn seems to be doing just fine, just fine in her newly sightless world and therefore I will only need to provide back-up. And I am ready, more than ready to provide such service if that main villain here, played by Alan Arkin, comes anyway near the neighborhood. He may not be pure evil in the Faustian literary sense but on the streets of New York (or name the city) he is as close as one needs to get. And live.   Needless to say given the times, then or now, criminals, especially low-life master criminals like Arkin looking to move up the drug cartel food chain are a blight on society. And a terror to those without sight who stand in the way of, in the case, a drug-filled doll from foreign parts unknown brought in by a \\"mule\\" who decided to turn pro and run her own operation who passes off her ill-gotten bounty to Hepburn's unsuspecting husband (played by Zimbalist) when the heat is on (and Arkin is hip to her plans). But here is where the dramatic tension comes in with the life and death duel between Arkin (and his confederates) balanced against the blind Ms. Hepburn's fear-driven efforts to foil the bad guys which is a great sign for our side. But it still goes. Keep your mitts off Ms. H. Get it.

B003MZ0I84|3.0|This album does not come in a standard jewel case, or even a thin one. the packaging is little more than a paper sleeve that folds in half to cover the disk.
B005MIYI3K|5.0|This is Nightwish's seventh album.  Here, the band has taken their sound deeper and they experiment with scenery in such sound.  The singer feels more relaxed and she fits with the unique style that Nightwish offers.  For those who seek something similar to past albums, they will obviously not find it here.  This album is beautiful and energetic, sometimes strange due to the fact that it's a concept album.  For those who support the band 100%, this album is a must.  For those who don't know about Nightwish yet, they should listen to clips first and give them some thought, but still, it will be a good start.  The list of songs are the following (with a description), I hope it helps:  1) Taikatalvi - beautiful and haunting intro, the singer really creates such winter-like feel, thus giving the title meaning.  Soft, tender and sad melody prepares the listener for the fantasy or metaphorical world about to be born.  I really love piano in this intro, so chilling and touching.   2) Storytime - nice way to formally begin things up.  It's evident that the singer has evolved within the band after Dark Passion Play - she seems more confident and adapted to the great sound of the band.  Powerful melody here and cute chorus, yes, it seems as a story is revealed before the listener - the very first pages that cause curiosity.  The orchestra is just getting better and better by the second.  There's some mixture of joy with mysterious adventure. 5/5  3) Ghost River - really awesome guitar work in this song.  The opening is spectacular, it quickly introduces vocals that are sensual and sweet followed by sinister and fierce vocals - the contrast is sweet, giving the song such intense attitude.  The children echoing their choir is chilling.  This song is one of my favorites for it features the band at their darkest and psychotic best.  It ends the way it began, epic and strong. 5/5  4) Slow, Love, Slow - this song really caught me off guard.  This song is jazz, in a sensual and darkway.  It really takes the listener back to the 1930's ambience.  The singer's vocals are killer in this one, she shows perfection giving life to nostalgic, shadowy and lustful moods.  The song is full of vintage atmosphere, it may take a couple of listens to get the hang of it, but it's worth it.  Nightwish surely can experiment with this area more.  The ending is sudden and creepy.  There's even a brief metal piece that grants suspense. 4/5  5) I Want My Tears Back - this song blends nicely Irish melody, pop and metal.  The chorus is very catchy and the rhythm never lets go, it's uplifting and a bit nostalgic.  There's a cool Irish fest section during the middle part of the song that's captivating and emotional, it gives the song more edge.  The guitar work is decent.  The ending continues with the chorus. 5/5  6) Scaretale - another favorite track of mine.  This one goes into experimentation as it pays tribute to Danny Elfman and Tim Burton.  The orchestra is splendid, very theatric and ghostlike.  The singer goes crazy in this song, her voice is menacing, teasing and harsh.  It becomes fantasy and gothic at the same time when the guy sings, the listener can feel trapped in that colorful nightmare.  After that scene, the song returns to its drama and horror - it then ends with a good fade. 5/5  7) Arabesque - the listener is given an instrumental.  It really captures the exotic beauty and charm of the East (especially Arabia, India, etc.).  It's intense, classic, action-adventure driven and thought provoking.  The instruments are managed with such precision and care, making it a genuine piece.  It can easily transport the listener to deserts and lost temples.  8) Turn Loose The Mermaids - here the listener is introduced to a gentle Celtic melody, very full of mysticism, almost dreamlike.  The singer's vocals are soft and crystal clear, she gives this song that needed enchanting touch.  Everything seems soothing, yes, the chorus and the simplistic, but gorgeous sound.  There's even a western melody in the song.  The ending is really elegant. 5/5  9) Rest Calm - this song introduces some influences of Doom Metal, so it's evident there will be some attitude and nostalgia involved.  The first minutes are awesome - the guy's vocals are full of passion and pain, thus giving the proper ambience of lament.  The singer's vocals offer a good contrast as always - she's the redeeming side to the torment.  I really enjoyed the first half, but I think that the second half kind of lost force and focus. 3/5  10) The Crow, The Owl and The Dove - here the listener can enjoy a melancholic and soft, but rhythmic song.  The lyrics are heavily metaphorical than the others.  Both singers perform splendidly here - it's interesting, it's as if they were born from the melody itself.  The chorus is quite catchy and sad, it seems so alive. 5/5  11) Last Ride Of The Day - my absolute favorite song.  The opening is intense and grand, the listener will surely know that a rollercoaster shall start.  The singer's vocals are full of attitude and beauty.  The chorus is catchy and powerful.  The orchestra here is just killer, it gives a haunting and thrilling ambience.  There is very solid guitar work here as well.  The piano is constant and it evokes passionate greatness. 5/5  12) Song Of Myself - this is the band's epic song.  The opening is epic and full of wonder, it lets the listener know that it's the dramatic conclusion.  The singer's vocals at the first minutes are appealing and full of strength, then they become nostalgic and mystic.  The rhythm flows with her in this song, the transitions are swift and perfect.  The song then closes with the narration of a poem - it expresses the final emotions and state of mind.  The poem is beautiful, sad and very mature. 4/5  13) Imaginaerum - here, the listener has an instrumental ending.  It's basically like a synopsis of rhythms heard throughout the album, but merged nicely and elegantly.  It's pure fantasy atits best.  The listener can consider this as the \\"credits\\" to a great movie.   Great album!
B006C1DH92|5.0|If you're a fan of the original Fruit Ninja, you'll love the new features of FN:PiB  You have your classic mode, but it seems to be a mash-up of the original classic mode with arcade mode (except that you have magic beans instead of the special bananas). Still a fun mode to play.   The Desperado mode is a quasi-Adventure mode style of play, where you have three acts with four levels each. Each level is a different type of mini game, that consists of slicing fruits being thrown at you in specific patterns, following a line of growing fruits, or even slicing bombs once they transform into a fruit. It starts out easy, and becomes more challenging as you progress. The final act is a \\"boss battle\\" with the meanest bad guy in a while, I won't ruin the surprise ;)  I want to give this app 4 out of 5 stars, because it drains the battery fast on my Kindle Fire. I also dislike the fact that they don't include a Zen mode or Arcade mode, but I'm glad to see that you can still customize your blades/backgrounds and you get to read fun facts about fairy tales. I am giving this app 5 stars, however, because of the several stupid reviews that are giving it 1 star for no reason, and are not even verified purchases.   Seriously, if battery life is not a big issue (you can play it while your phone charges) then get this application.

I adore this album; I think it's absolutely right to describe it as Bjork's \\"Night of Hunters.\\"  It's definitely a departure from her earlier work, and I think that, for that reason, it needs to be taken on its own, without the expectation that it'll resemble her albums from the nineties.    Highlight tracks for me include \\"Thunderbolt,\\" \\"Crystalline,\\" \\"Sacrifice,\\" and \\"Nattura.\\"    This album is magic ghost music.

B0032FPVKE|5.0|Let me get the caveat out of the way. Be careful to look carefully at the dimension numbers. The pictures are deceiving. That said, this is just right for what I am storing: the JVC Everio camcorder fits snugly. It would obviously do fine for about any still camera short of an SLR. I also store a miniature tripod, extra SD-HC cards, charger, battery, data cable (USB). The wires are in a tiny Amazon Basics point 'n' shoot camera sack to keep them tidy. This fits on the inside, right next to the camcorder.  The other important factor is the quality of construction. The material is heavy duty. The lining is soft and scratch free. Stitching is strong and straight. Pockets are well planned. There's even an extra protective flap secured with velcro. Zipper pulls are sturdy and easy to grip. Loops for carrying on belt. Handle is nicely padded. Internal compartment partition moveable. Padded with thick and dense tight-cell foam all around. Shoulder strap is a little light but plenty strong enough, with decent swiveling snap hooks. Whole product exudes well made. My bag is packed now, and I am happy to be able to grab and go.

B004EPYZUS|1.0|Today, the ruling ideology could be found in the realm of the popular culture, first and foremost the movies. It is easy to dismiss this movie as an innocent light entertainment, but I think it is not that simple. What we are consuming is ideology of a specific kind, an ideology of caricaturing the other cultures, while asserting a dominance of the Western norms. I think \\"Ghost Protocol\\" incites fear, loathing, and ridicule vis-a-vis the \\"Orient\\" in a jokey kind of manner.<br /><br />\\"Orient\\" is not a geographical term, but a cultural one. It is a gap that separated \\"the West\\" form \\"the Rest\\". The hallmarks are: a reflexive cultural contempt and even mild racism, expressed in patronizing superiority vis-&agrave;-vis other cultures. It has become, with few exceptions, a common thing in the Hollywood today.  For me, as a Russian-American, it looks like Russia has been placed firmly by the Hollywood in the realm of cultural \\"Orient\\". In this particular film, Russia was portrayed as a backward, dangerous, Byzantine country once more. Starting with the music -- they chose a grim, ominous music for the beginning of the \\"Moscow\\" scene.<br /><br />A group of likable American spies sent to take down a world-threatening baddie, sort of a \\"Consigliery\\" to the Russian government. The plot in brief: the crazed Russian wants to incite nuclear war so that the planet may be cleansed and born anew, and he's doing the \\"pit two nuclear powers against each other\\" gimmick to make it happen. After the spies are implicated in a terrorist attack in Moscow, which destroyed the Kremlin, they went first to Dubai and then to Mumbai to clear their names by catching this guy \\"red-handed\\".<br /><br />The music, the military uniforms, and all other intangibles - all this suggest to us a militaristic, aggressive, and anti-Western nature of Russia. The crazed Russian politician - curiously -- has a Germanic name \\"Kurt\\". Thus, the remorseful scriptwriters Nemec and Appelbaum have fused the pre-supposed \\"Prussian militarism\\", and perhaps quasi-Nazi ideas with the Russian \\"Oriental Despotism\\" and the ostensible technological backwardness of Russia.<br /><br />That the Russians are backward is emphasized by the clich&eacute; that ostensibly nothing in Russia works (for example, the \\"pay-phone\\" scene). They also can be easily fooled by Ethan Hunt, could pretend to be a Russian without them noticing it. The ethnic divisions have been exploited once more (why not?) -- between the Russians and Ukrainians, between Serbs and Croats. The spies' helper is Bogdan, which in Russia is considered a Ukrainian name. Tom Cruise was thrown into Moscow prison for, supposedly, shooting six Serbs who ostensibly had been involved in the \\"ethnic cleansing\\".<br /><br />In my view, there have been three slurring \\"shots\\" at the Russians: 1] for putting innocent people in prison (the rule of law is absent), 2] for having the nukes which are not secure enough (backwardness), 3] for not having the brains to come up with the devilish scheme themselves (unsophistication). Thus, we are presented with Swedish-German \\"Kurt\\" who came up with the crypto-fascist idea to clean the Earth form the \\"rabble\\" using the Russian nuclear weapon. He pulls the strings in Kremlin, not even a native Russian guy.<br /><br />As usual with the Hollywood, all \\"Russian\\" scenes have been filmed in the Czech Republic. The producers didn't even bother to pick the native Russian speakers. Russian wasn't a native language of the \\"Russians\\" in prison scene and other \\"Moscow\\" scenes, except a single person - Vladimir Mashkov who played a Russian secret agent. All this looks and sounds really idiotic and incredibly patronizing. The movie is a collection of disconnected action \\"packages\\", TV series stitched together with white threads (Moscow-Dubai-Mumbai episodes). Appelbaum and Nemec's script are too jokey without being genuinely funny.

B00447L4KA|3.0|High school. Some of us remember it with fond memories, but the rest look on it as some of the worst years of our lives.  Every boy in the school believes Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) is the girl to date. Pretty, popular, and currently single due to her father's no-dating standards, she is desired by most of the guys that walk the halls of the local high school. Her latest pining admirer is Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), who is turned down flat when he asks for a date because her uptight father will not allow it, unless her older sister Kat (Julia Stiles) also starts dating.  One of the most troubled girls in the school, Kat's ultra feminism and outspoken nature has made her unpopular with not only the entire male population but most of her teachers as well. The only student even capable of potentially handling her is the rebel of the class, Patrick (Heath Ledger). But he's not willing to do something for nothing, so Cameron and his friend Michael (David Krumholtz) trick money-stuffed jock Joey (Andrew Keegan) into financing this venture, convincing him it would be in his best interest if he intends to ever date Bianca. Patrick has an uphill battle, since Bianca has never looked on any man without disgust, and he has to win her over before the prom.   It took a bit of adjustment before I got to where I enjoyed this film but it is a clever modern adaptation of Shakespeare and the leads have wonderful chemistry with one another. Witty and intelligent but also just plain fun in places, it lingers with you long after you have finished it, returning months and even years later to your mind to entice you to rediscover its joys once again. It's well worth seeing once or if you're anything like me, more than once.  Parental Concerns: quite a lot of sex-related dialogue, some nude artwork, and teen drinking.

B004P8JPS6|4.0|Reading The Affair provided good backstory about Reacher and his separation from the U.S. Army, although I didn't buy the reason he had to leave the service. A good commander would have covered his butt and not allowed him to take the fall. In any case, there was excellent suspense and plenty of Reacher machismo in The Affair. It was an entertaining read, as always with Lee Child's books.
B005FITIGO|3.0|I can't imagine how much money they must have spent on getting this cast together, but investing in a script and a story would have been worth it.    It almost feels like some guys got together and made a bet on making a movie with the shortest script possible. Maybe they were trying to break a world record? For a movie trying to 'capitalize' on the 2008 meltdown (oh the irony), it sure doesn't say much about what actually happened and it doesn't bother dramatizing it with fiction either.   This has to be the one of the most lightweight movies I've ever seen. Probably the Wall Street version of '2012'.   If you are interested in a film about the meltdown, check out the 'Inside Job', a documentary with Matt Damon providing the voiceover. Yes, a documentary is more exciting than a Hollywood drama these days. *sigh*
B005OCFGTO|5.0|If you are a fan of Harry Potter books or movies then this is the set for you. All the movies in one place. The quality is great only Blu ray could make it better. Well worth the money!
B0034G4P9E|4.0|I liked the movie, Edgerton and Nolte were great, Hardy's character was kinda zoned out all the time and it was hard to relate to him, but nonetheless, good performance.   The 'who-fights-who' and 'who-wins' aspect was predictable but I'm glad for this because it let the film address the issue each fight represented. The background music was well done, the fighting was choreographed well and this movie shows that blood and gore aren't required in an action film if the story and cinematography are right.   So, it's a nice, light (at least not as heavy as the other reviews would have you think by referring to the family issues) and entertaining movie. Enjoy.

B004A8ZWXS|4.0|Okay, I'll admit that War Horse tries too hard to make you cry over and over again, but it reminds me of an old fashioned epic. The acting is good all around, the locations are a sight to behold, there is some good action mixed in, and boy oh boy is that a well trained horse. Joey (the horse) has a personality all his own and I began really caring for this guy more and more throughout each of his adventures. It might be too violent for the really young ones, but this is the type of film that families can see together. Steven Spielberg has added another gem to his historic directing career. I can't wait to see what he and the great Daniel Day-Lewis do with Lincoln.

030726999X|5.0|After being shot in the head and having various wounds on her body, Salander, our odd but brilliant heroine from the previous books,  is placed in isolation in a hospital. Slowly recovering from her ordeal, she develops a positive relationship with the attending physician who secures a cell phone with a Palm browser. Accessing a hidden server connection and as she is awaiting trial, Salander is able to hack into local law enforcement computers, attorney computers, and communicate with Mikael Blomkvist. In spite of her injuries, she is once again at her intellectual best with remarkable computer skills and a photographic memory. With her evil, terrorist father two rooms away, Salander stays alert, aware that he wants to finish the murder her tried earlier. Her defense attorney, Blomkvist's very able sister, convinces Salander to write an autobiographical account of the social abuses, the rape from her guardian, and the events that led to the bullet in her head.<br /><br />Blomkvist and staff at the Millenium begin working to uncover a secret organization within the state security force. Finding a plot that includes a massive coverup of a defector and the abuses and terror he launched on Sweden many years before, Blomkvist writes a book to blow the top off the secret organization. Sadly, owner and editor Erika Berger leaves the Millenium for a better position with a larger newspaper. Almost immediately she encounters harrassment and threats from an unknown source followed by an awareness of corruption at a higher level. Knowing she has walked into a serious conflict of interest, she is torn over her loyalties to her former paper and her current employers. Resolving the problem aggressively, Erika becomes the victim of defamation and a whitewashing of the corruption.<br /><br />The organization that has operated for years apart from any kind of oversight and making its own rules slowly gets unraveled by the amazing computer skills of Salander and the tenacity of Blomkvist. Salander's group of defenders that includes her physician, her former guardian, Milton security, and the employees at Millenium join together to help Salander's attorney reveal the truth. The trial is a stunning reversal for Salander and we finally see justice served to those who desired to see Salander's life destroyed.<br /><br />With non-stop cerebral and physical action, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets Nest is a fantastic conclusion to the series. Lots of coffee, violence, sex, confusion, corruption, fear, brilliance, medicine, and social abuses accompany this high octane legal and political thriller. Salander herself is a new hero for the modern age with her genius and courage finding fruition in computer investigations and a creative approach to life. In a kind of social tug of war with obvious antagonists and protagonists, readers find plenty of people to love and to hate, and a wide variety of emotions between. Cheering for her success but despising the causes of her predicaments, we share in her suspicions and empathize with her distrust of authority. Her own desire for indepence and isolation is admirable but impossible as she slowly comes to terms with the need to trust certain people by providing a clear and candid account of her experiences.<br /><br />The women are strong in this novel and Mikael Blomkvist is a little too good to be true at times...does he have any flaws? The book suffers at times from excessive descriptions and interruptions that do not seem to develop into integrated events. The author, now deceased, obviously had a great story to tell and the skill to present it, but occasionally got bogged down in demonstrating the stupidity and inanity of particular kinds of male leadership. Sometimes we are set up for a situation that never really happens, such as Monica's physical prowess never was used for anything in particular, almost like a runway built that is never used. It makes the story feel a little uneven at times with jagged edges that are unresolved.<br /><br />Those things aside, there are many lessons within these pages, but they are masked by an exciting plot that is turbo-charged to hold the reader's attention. Well-written and containing many sideline stories of political war, terror, corruption, and social misgivings, this story along with the other two books are page-turning adventures for modern times. Readers need to know that some rough scenes, language, and sex help paint a realistic picture of a young lady who was shaped by her DNA and environment. But rather than becoming a social commentary on how power can corrupt leaders and how often we turn a blind eye to the truth or how often we assume and inflict judgment on those who are different, we find a walloping good story rich in description and muscular in emotion. This book is highly recommended and reminds us of the kinds of abuses to which many children and teens are subjected. It also reminds us that there are times we must learn to trust the ones who do not mean harm. Good and evil, light and dark work congruently and independently to form one of the most exciting books currently in print.ings aside, there are many lessons within these pages, but they are masked by an exciting plot that is turbo-charged to hold the reader's attention.

B00001OH7M|5.0|This album basically hints at David Bowie's progressive nature to come with a variety of songs that are wonderful. They are hybrids of folk rock and progressive music that he would later become known for.<br />There really isn't a bad thing to say about this album other than you might have to listen to it a couple times to actually wrap your head around it.<br />Otherwise, there's no reason you shouldn't buy this.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|This album is wonderful. Traditional, but never redundant. It is fresh and has mass appeal.

B004EPYZXU|4.0|There are all sorts of historical and scientific facts you have to be willing to disregard to enjoy this movie, but its obviously earnest attempt at atmospheric authenticity is charming, and really, how many historical and scientific facts did you have to disregard to enjoy Armageddon, or Mission To Mars, or Sunshine, or Moon, or any sci-fi flick where there's sound in space or gravity on spaceships?  The filmmakers set themselves boundaries as regarded what a moon mission would be like in the early to mid-70s, and never once nudged their way past to score a cheap scare or thrill.  That kind of integrity shouldn't be overlooked, and it made for a few chilling scenes that would not have been possible if they had succumbed to the temptation to, say, introduce some new, ultra-secret technology we've never heard of, or given the actors more room to breathe, pun intended.  For examples that either aren't spoilers or were in the official trailer:  The sense of menace accomplished through context and posture of a space-suited American astronaut standing there and all you're hearing is his radio-carried voice; a climactic scare that comes to us directly from the laws of physics; a constant sense of claustrophobia when inside the spacecraft (particularly the orbiting Command Module); the hair-standing-on-end statement \\"the flag is gone.\\"    If you're an Apollo nut, like I am, there are as I mentioned several things that are simply inconsistent with history or science, and you can easily choose to be aggravated by them, but honestly, they're easy to ignore in the story and setting and atmosphere (pun not intended).  There are a few just as troubling things about the alien monsters.  Again, to the extent you give the film demerits for these, please do grade it on a curve considering just about any other horror or science fiction movie, and I think you'll find it does ok.  I don't get the sense you're meant to leave this film convinced of the possibility of a worldwide government coverup of a nearby alien menace, and if you don't consider it a failure that it doesn't so convince you, you're apt to be entertained in the way quick little 1:20 scary stories are supposed to entertain.  It makes you chuckle, jump, try and will the characters to do and not do things, smile and wince, and darned if it doesn't feel more authentically like the moon than almost any other picture set there.

B002S0OBMS|4.0|Yes, I enjoyed this album, and eagerly awaited the second production here in Melbourne, Australia. As it turned out, ALW wasn't totally happy with the way the show \\"worked\\" on stage. When plans were underway for the second production, the Australian director (who has an international reputation, and is highly respected by ALW), told ALW exactly what was wrong with the production, and ALW completely agreed. He gave the show over to the Australian production team to do with it as they will - he had nothing to do with the revisions until he saw it in final rehearsal. He was totally elated, and the Australian production is the one that will go on Broadway. He is considering closing the London production, and re-opening with this new version, which is absolutely stunning. Act one is among the most spectacular things I have seen on a stage, and the music, of course, id wonderful, superbly sung and acted. The DVD/Blu-ray, coming out mid 2012, is of the Melbourne production. Musically, there have not been many changes, although the opening is quite different. The more I hear of ALW's music, the higher is my respect for his musicianship. The score, like most of his, has melodic songs, as you might find in the earlier forms of musical comedy. But now, in this day of musical drama, many of the songs are dramatic, more operatic, to push the dramatic elements of the story along. At one time, I felt that ALW lacked a style of his own. But I have since realised that he turns his style to match the story. When he has a serious story, like Sunset Boulevard and Woman in White (which failed more because it was above what the average theatre goer wants, rather than any of its weaknesses), he includes more dramatic, rather opera-like material to enhance the drama. And these days, he can afford to have flops, as he is worth more than Stephen Spielberg). It takes a while to get accustomed, especially if you don't like classical music, to some of the songs, but I believe he is one of the greatest composers we have seen for musical theatre, and this may be his best work. I don't think it will succeed as well as the original Phantom for several reason's, but the significant one is that there is a lower content of \\"general audience appeal\\" songs. This show has so much to offer, especially in its reworked form, that it wont be a flop - but I doubt it will be his most commercially successful work, even if it is possibly his musical peak.reatest composers we have seen for musical theatre, and this may be his best work.

0156027321|5.0|What can I say? The storyline and events of this novel are quite addictive and more importantly, fluid. Young Piscine, \\"Pi\\", Patel details the shortcomings of his own name and his childhood in India with numerous curiosities and triumphs that set his childhood apart from the average kid. His father runs and owns a zoo which becomes a critical piece in Pi's growth and later survival while stranded at sea for over half a year with only a few surviving zoo animals as companions on a small rescue boat.  I found myself continually bemused and emotionally attached to Pi's antics and cleverness in survival which speaks especially to Mr. Martel's ingenuity and creativity in the development of this fantasy adventure. I was, and readers most likely feel the same, continuously considering how well Mr. Martel was able to relay and inspire feelings.   My best example of this comes towards the end of the second portion of the book when Pi has become blind with hunger and suddenly another castaway appears who is French and blind as well. I found myself utterly bewildered attempting to ascertain what was going on. However, this confusion is likely due to Martel's hand and displays the confusion and blindness that Pi himself must have felt being blind and suddenly meeting another person after tens of days with no companion but a Bengal tiger. It was almost kafka-esque.  I would be detracting from my duty and obligation if I did not mention the spiritual undertones and discussion in this novel. Pi is a practicing Hindu, Christian, and Muslim who makes compelling arguments and points about loyalty to one religion and ultimately the larger picture of what belief and piety truly is.  I was, overall, very impressed with \\"Life of Pi\\" and consider it something that should be put on anyone's list to read if your interests lay in adventure, survival, and the new. My only criticism lay in wanting to know the true occurrences and events that surround the plot!  ~Kaptica
B000FQJAIM|5.0|I had to buy this movie for my little boy because he didn't believe that the Star Wars characters were any more than lego video game characters and toys.  Then I spent a good half hour trying to explain the relationships and background of all the Star Wars people.  Luke is Darth Vader's son.  Darth was a little guy and was trained by Obi Wan.  Luke was trained by Yoda.  Darth doesn't know Luke is his son.  It was hilarious - him asking me questions and me digging through my memory banks for the answers.  He loved the movie, and now knows why I think Han Solo is the coolest character ever.  He thinks Princess Lea is beautiful, Chewbaka is funny and R2D2 is neat.  Just like I did when I was a kid.  Pretty cool.

B003NWS5AO|4.0|A few of thoughts to ponder...  1)  If you're waiting for Robert Plant to return to Led Zeppelin style of hard rock, then forget you ever heard about this CD.      2)  If you like albums that grab you on the first listen, then this CD will probably never play this a second time.  Big mistake!     3)  If on the other hand you think this is CD is worth two Grammy nominations, I'm not sure that you and I are in the same universe.         I put this CD on my Christmas list after seeing Plant and the band (which includes Patti Griffin and Buddy Miller) on a PBS concert.  Though the album and the PBS concert share very little material, I like them both equally, but for different reasons.  The concert seemed to be more of a group effort, but Plant is center stage on the CD.        On first play, I was rather lukewarm toward the disk.  It wasn't at all what I expected.  But the next few listens grew increasingly rewarding.  There are many highlights along the way, from the infectious, percussive rhythms  of `Angel Dance' to the haunting and eerie `Monkey' to the Beatlesque `Can't Buy My Love' to the doo-woppish accompaniment of `Falling in Love Again'.  There is a lot to like here.  The only song that doesn't \\"do it for me\\" is the second track, 'House of Cards'.  Though it's not horrible, I think it is by far the weakest cut on the CD.         But, as far as ex-rockers go, this CD is nowhere near as satisfying as Bruce Springsteen's \\"Seeger Sessions\\" set from a few years back.  That set had a more unpolished raunchy sound that came about because a majority of the songs were recorded `live' in Springsteen's place.  That live feel is sorely missing from Plant's CD.  But, by another comparison, Band of Joy is far superior to Rod Stewart's stoic, lifeless visits to the Great American Songbook.         I haven't heard any of these songs previously, so I can't really tell that they're better than or worse than the originals.  Plant sounds like he has a genuine affinity for the material, and seems to be having fun recording it, and the rest of the band also seems to be enjoying the ride - not to mention the listener.  I can tell you that this is definitely worthy of more than a few spins in your player.
B003L77FYS|5.0|Well even though I'm going to do a quick review of season 3 it's probably worth just talking about the first 2 seasons as well. I came across Castle by accident and saw it had Nathan Fillion in it, who I liked from Firefly and a few films so that was the main reason I bought the show. And while i'm not that into crime shows I have to admit Castle is really good. The chemistry between the two leads is fun and flirty, okay I'm  not quite sure how many seasons they can do without something happening, but overall it's just a very funny show (with the odd more serious moment as well). And season 3 is no exception like the first two seasons it follows the same formula a murder happens and then our detective and writer get on the case and during the episodes the plot will twist and turn. Most of the time you don't know who the killer is until virtually the end of an episode which is down to some very good script writing. Overall I've enjoyed all 3 seasons of Castle and I'm looking forward to season 4.

B003Y5H5FG|5.0|Before I start I just want to say I love the original Fright Night and while it's a bit dated it still is a film I enjoy and will watch. On the whole I try and stay away from remakes as I think what's the point in remaking something that was really good in the first place and when I heard about them remaking Fright Night I was \\"OMG you're kidding me right.\\"  Then I heard Colin Farrell was the vampire and I despaired even more, while I like him as an actor, in the original the vampire was sophisticated and no disrespect to Mister Farrell but he's more of a action actor. So I had no intention of seeing the remake until I heard David Tennant was in it (As the Peter Vicent character) and I became intrigued. Firstly how they we going to use him and secondly if they were going for a younger cast how it would work. And to be honest it works brilliantly, the new film is nothing like the original. I think there's only a few scenes where it even makes a small nod to the original, but the whole cast really do put on a great show. It's funny, okay not really scary and a bit gory. More gory than the original but hey no bad thing right?   Colin plays the new Jerry as a more muscular, working man vampire and David Tennant plays the Peter Vincent character almost like if Russell Brand was a magician and it does work pretty well. There's even a cameo to look out for by the original Jerry (Chris Saraddon, but overall it works because unlike other remakes I've seen it's not trying to be the original, it's been changed for a more modern audience and it's nice to see a few more dangerous vampires around that don't sparkle :)
B00005LELD|4.0|I bought this for my Nikkor AF 50mm f/1.8D.<br />The screw is made of metal while the rest is rubber.<br /><br />PROS:<br />It fits pretty well in the lens and it feels solid.<br />I tested it and it does its job pretty good.<br />It even helps me find the lens in my bag.<br /><br />CONS:<br />The only downside I can find about it is that while it protects the lens and does its job, it covers most of the focus ring, which is already pretty small, so if you are trying to focus manually, it will take some practice and skill.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br />Overall great quality and built for the price.
B006C1DH92|3.0|It's a cute game and I'm sure I'll spend some quality time with it, but it has one bug and one programing choice that make it hard to play. The first is that if you hit the home button to leave the game instead of the back button, the music does not stop. This is irritating and can cause you problems if you are playing somewhere you shouldn't be and need to quickly leave the game. The second problem is that the programmers did not choose to enable the permission to turn on the phone screen while the game is playing. Thus, if your screen lit time is very short, you will be fighting the game to keep the screen alive. It's not such a big deal while slicing, but it is a hassle while in menus.
B005HSL626|3.0|This is fun for a on the go time waster, but not at all a good application to the kindle for a long trip or meeting, whatever. I would recommend it for younger children who need entertained. Three stars.
B001HN6922|3.0|Was disappointed. I liked it but wasn't as great as the first one. Wouldn't have bought it if I knew that
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game its fun I am addicted to playing... I played for two straight hours last night I love that you get point for even just. trying
1599218011|5.0|The personality of Kris Carr shines from every word.  It is a joy to delve into a fun-filled book on how to be healthy not only in one's personal body but for the wider world.  I love the journey Kris made--and how earnestly she experimented and researched the options.  I see myself as a fellow-traveler, one who has benefitted from her wisdom.  Her recipes are delicious, especially the green smoothie with the fresh coconut base.  Wonderful!
B003UESJ9M|5.0|I purchased this movie with HIGH hopes from Amazon.com. The buying process has always been smooth and I wished for an excellent product. Needless to say, Amazon fulfilled their part. This fabulous movie arrived within a week, and in mint condition. I will definitely be buying more movies on here as opposed to buying them in a store!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the game.is interesting, some of.the mini -games were.made somewhat poorly though. hopefully I can get further when I'm not playing a 6 in the morning...
B006C1DH92|5.0|This game looks and plays great on my Samsung galaxy s 2 skyrocket! which is awesome cause the original fruit ninja looked all pixely which made the game look extremely ugly. but this game looks awesome. way better than the original! Great job devs! :-)
B005HSL626|3.0|I love this game at first then update that SUCKED I had everything then update messed everything up deleted all my stuff
1440503257|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when I added this to my wishlist for Christmas. I am a huge Harry Potter fan and I also LOVE cooking. I am always looking for something new or a spin on an old dish. This book hits the spot! While it cites recipes mentioned in the Harry Potter series, its really more a cookbook full of traditional and popular recipes from England. It also has notes as to the difficulty, and replacements for ingredients not easily found in the States. It also includes side notes on the history of the dishes or an interesting fact surrounding it. There's a few simple things like how to properly roast beef or how to make a proper cup of English Tea, but there are a lot of recipes or preparations that you rarely see in the States. The instructions are very easy to follow. This is a wonderful cookbook, even if you left out any mention of the Harry Potter Series. I recommend this to anyone who likes to cook who is looking for something yummie for dinner beyond meatloaf or spaghetti!
B0063IH60K|5.0|My daughter loves this game she can not get her eye off of it. even my hus band cant. so if any one likes card games and has a kindle fire get this app for them
B002ZG97M4|5.0|At first when I read about Footloose being remade, I wasn't very happy about it because I grew up watching Kevin Bacon in the original one. I thought he did a very good job. I looked into it more and more on the internet and found out about it more. I found out that it was going to be country and not rock like the first one. it was going to be a little different but still have the same characters and the same plot. I saw previews and thought, why not give it a try since the main star, Kenny Wormald, looked pretty good in it. I took my eight year old son to it when it first came out to theaters and had a blast watching it. A couple weeks later, I took the whole family to it because I liked it so much. There are some remakes that they shouldn't touch but this one, was a good one because you cant really say remake to this...its just a country version of it. Some people dont like rock so if you are one of those country types, a Kenny Wormald fan(like me) or just a movie lover, this movie is for you.
B005ZUR724|5.0|I can't freakin' update it, and that pisses me off. It doesn't help that there's NO existing source of information to try and find out why. Looks like we're SOL until Gameloft decides to have mercy.
B004GJYROG|5.0|I am very happy with how quickly I received this product. It is also in great condition and plays well. Very happy!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This app is loads of fun and great for any age.I Love this app and recommend it to any one looking for fun!!
B005HSL626|5.0|I play this game a lot and its very fun. It is very addicting and I strongly recommend this game!
B005HXGE9G|5.0|Nice, brings you a little back to some good music. I Like it. worth the price. got it for a gift
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have had this on my iphone and love it! Now I have it on my kindle fire and love it more!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|there was no hesitation when i saw this on amazon! the price was better than any retail, or on-line place i looked. my daughter has wanted the whole collection since the series first came out. i always knew amazon had great prices, i have the kindle and buy alot of books on amazon.com. the images are stunning, and the narration by richard attenborough, i think, is more enjoyable than sigourney weaver. if you have ANY interest in nature please add this collection to your video library!
B005FITIK0|4.0|I grew up in a small town where your fate as a teenager absolutely rests on your social status. Since I had the opportunity to be one of the people who had friends from all across the spectrum of cool to uncool, I had that alienating privilege of feeling as though I never fully belonged to one group. Every year, I got to watch a new batch of the \\"supercools\\" graduate and go out into a world that was much bigger than their senior-class superlative only to be dashed on the rocks of having to become a normal person. And a lot of them didn't even make it as that.   It is incredible to see a film that portrays that passage of time with such vivid clarity. Haunting scene after haunting scene of a broken person in this situation gives us a realistic portrayal of how someone can so easily avoid reality to live in a dreamworld. You will see someone that you know on the screen when you're watching this film. For some of us, it might be bitterness or anger at a person who embodied what you wanted to be. For others, it will bring sadness because the person in this film is you.   *****___(Perfection)  The highest degree of enjoyment / fulfillment I've personally experienced with film  ****½___(Excellent)  Only lower than five stars due to falling short on any number of \\"subjective\\" categories  ****____(Influential)  A very satisfying experience and has me looking for more from this director/genre   ***½____(Good)  Keeps me engaged but unlikely to look for more by this director unless recommended   ***_____(Average)  Could take it or leave it and will not be looking for more by the same director   **______(Poor)  Constantly asking myself, \\"How much worse can this get?\\" every few minutes  *_______(Terrible)  Belongs in the dumpster...
B005HV6Y84|5.0|I love this album! its got great music on it! and I love that they used music from the first movie in this one! :) definite must buy for twihards
B005MIYI3K|5.0|I was first introduced to nightwish from the \\"dark passion play\\" album. I didnt know about tarja before. After listening to DPP and then buying all the other nightwish albums, I did agree with the other people saying that Anette Doesnt belong in nightwish.<br /><br />However after hearing this album, i feel that tarja could not have sung in this album. Anette fits this album perfectly. Her voice sounds perfect in a few of the songs. Take the song \\"scaretale\\". The song itself reminds me of those \\"circus nightmares\\" that they show in some horror movies. What anette does with her singing is perfect.<br /><br />The song \\"ghost river\\" is also one of my other favorites on the album. I dont really know what to say to describe it, i just like the rhythm.<br /><br />So if there are any people who say that Nightwish sucks without tarja. Listen to this album and then re-consider. Like i said earlier, i dont feel that traja could have worked with this album.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I really love this app. I downloaded it for my kindle fire and it's super User friendly and very engaging. it's a great thinking game, and the music and graphics both are awesome. I highly recommend this game.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|[...]    The CEO himself posted and their TOS does not give them rights to data mine you or \\"own\\" your data beyond the requirements to actually back it up etc. Standard functions, not spyware.   The other comments appear to be either misinformed or FUD.   I don't work for evernote, but I do like the app and I did read the TOS.   Don't appreciate the misrepresentation.
0439023521|5.0|My daughter requested this for Christmas. She spend the entire day reading it then passed it to me. I spent the entire day reading it myself and couldn't put it down. I would give this book a 4.5
1451627289|5.0|Wow!  I have read King's books since Salem's Lot (skipped Carrie).  The characters in this book are more realistic, human, believable than his other books.  I wasn't sure I would like the story, especially as long as it is, but unlike some of his others, the story was compelling throughout and I quickly finished it.  It was a perfect ending.
B005ZTFPFQ|3.0|I didn't enjoy it as much as I hoped. I wished it would of had more free games I was thinking it had all of them free but no it didn't. BOOO to this game.
B0062NAVXA|1.0|Wow. Saw this with my bf just to hoping to see Kirk Cameron with his shirt off and hes not even in it! Not only that but all of these cops are completely clothed for the entire movie. Save yourself some pain and just get left behind. Plenty of \\"touching\\" moments in that one if you know what I mean.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|A very awesome app.  I have totally switched from using my leather bound bible to now using this app!  Easy to navigate and function
B0055SWM08|5.0|Very well made and hard to put down.  It's almost like it's teasing me to complete the stages as efficiently as possible.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Enjoyable. Game ass exactly as expected and we have not had any problems with it. It made the long hours sitting at the hospital more tolerable.
B000R9J3XE|5.0|I'm not a big fan of any music that has come out in the last 10-15 years but I love Garbage.  Love the Bond song \\"The World is not Enough\\"; what a great voice!
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I first start watching TBBT 9/2011.  Once I started watching, I couldn't stop.    This show keeps you laughing.  Warning!  Don't eat or drink while watching.    This is the funniest show I have seen since Roseann.  I love all the characters (Leonard, Sheldon, Raj, Penny & Howard)but especially Howard W.  Howard is so...crazy, hilaious, and a horny little man with \\"Balls\\".  He comes up with outrageous ideas to meet women. Howard and his relationship wih his mother is also funny. Just watch it on WB11, TBS you will get hooked to. I just bought both the First and Second season on DVD, I keep watching episodes as though I never seen them before and always seem to find something esle to laugh about.
B000002MUW|5.0|Not a big fan of Madonna's but I do love this CD.  A mixture of sexy love songs and tunes.
B003OOVVH0|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this episode.  It was a very refreshing change of pace compared to the normal dark undertones presented.  I loved Eugene's narration, and would love if we somehow got to see him in future episodes. ( Highly unlikely, but I can dream.)  I liked that Owen was only in about 5 minutes of this episode. :P
0061841935|5.0|Listening to Craig Ferguson tell his tales from his youth and later in Hollywood will make you laugh out loud or shake your head in disbelief.  This is a great story of a guy who crawled from the bottle to become one of the funniest guys on late night TV.  You'll throughly enjoy this from beginning to end.
B006ANJ4BW|4.0|This was actually a refreshingly honest Conan that harkens back to the books that made him great.  This isn't the A'hnold muscle-bound version, but rather, like the books, features a \\"pantherish\\" Conan equally believable as a slayer or thief. The story did try to accomplish a little too much and did not allow for enough pauses in action to build suspense the way Robert Howard (the original author of Conan in the 1920s), but it got the flavor of the world just right. I am hoping that the sequel, if one is made, will offer more character development and a richer story line that is not afraid to pause.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I have the sketchbook pro app and this one is easier and more enjoyable and intuitive to use. Sure, it probably has less features, but when I compare the ease of use the other one doesn't come close. This is well worth buying even at more than the asking price and will keep little ones entertained as well.
B005F9TQ2Y|5.0|What's not to like!  Bob Dylan's lyrics are almost always an accurate and prophetically insightful look into everything that is both wrong and right about this generation.  He put's into words what most people feel, but cannot articulate. In my mind he has been given a gift from God.
B005ZUR724|1.0|1.0.7 wont work, needs update to 1.0.8 to connect to Gameloft servers, or you'll just receive notification that an update is required when you try to connect. Android market has 1.0.8, but Amazon apps needs updating.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Excellent clean new in packaging copy of WALL-E, one of the great films. Shipped promptly, arrived slightly flattened but totally NIB. Thanks!
B000HKYA1I|4.0|Having been born in  Eastern Europe I could like this movie just for the irony poked at the youth culture portrayed by Alex, the young translator and the very early post-communist look of Ukraine. But there's a lot more to be liked besides the packaging. The movie digs deeper and faces us with existential questions about life and faith. What will you do when the final test comes. Will you be ready to lose your life for what you believe in, like Lista's father or if you have a second chance will you be willing to change your faith in order to survive, like grandfather?
B001ANYDAO|5.0|This book goes deeper inside the nature vs. nurture, predestination vs free will argument more comprehensibly than any other book or scholar I have ever come into contact with. Malcolm Gladwell shows that success is a combination of luck and fate as well as development of skill and practice. If one is born into dire circumstances, will they succeed? Is fostering a talent more important that taking a abnormal interest in a subject the key to success? This book is a must have for a western civilization preoccupied with what the deserve over what they should work for.
B005ZUR724|1.0|just purchased the game but it wont let me log in. tried to contact gameloft on several fronts to no avail. worthless
B006C1DH92|5.0|I am a huge Fruit Ninjas fan, so I was hesitant to download this version because I thought it would be kiddies...I was wrong. I love the gauntlet mode,.it is challenging and fun!
B0034G4P94|5.0|I haven't seen a lot of 2011 movies that have impacted me as much as \\"Warrior\\" has. The story is about two estranged brothers one in the military that went AWOL returning to his hometown and the other one a physics teacher trying to meet ends meet with a family whose house is about to be foreclosed. Both brothers are very different in both goals and emotions, Tommy (played by Tom Hardy) an aggressive man who is quiet to himself and only speaks when furious. Brendan (played by Joel Edgerton) is a family man trying his best to support his family and pay off his home before the bank takes it away. Both brothers, while different, have a common relationship with their father (played by Nick Nolte) who was a former military man and alcoholic and neither brother wants anything to do with him. The whole story is composed around MMA (Mixed Martial Arts), which is the only way both brothers can understand and find answers in.<br /><br />While the movie has very well choreagraphed fighting and a good introduction to t<br />he sport of MMA, the fighting in the movie is only but a subsidiary to the films main central theme. The movie is primarily about family and unconditional love for your family. Tommy and Brendan have a complex relationship, Tommy's beef toward Brendan is solely based on him eloping with his wife and leaving the family behind and most importantly leaving the mother who died without her other son around. The departure of his older brother and father made Tommy the bitter man he is while it is hard to feel his pain, he shows his warm human side when he talks to a close friend on the phone later in the movie. Brendan is a more straightforward character who lays out his goal out on the floor: win the MMA tournament, get the money, live a happy life; in contrast to Tommy whose goal is unknown until about halfway through the movie. There are key scenes in the film where the viewers can get a full perspective of the relationships between the chracters, and these intimate moments whether it be Brendan and the dad, Tommy and the dad, or Brendan and Tommy, it's those scenes between the family that carries the film to making it the near classic it is.<br /><br />When watching the film you realize that rarely do films nowadays really contain complicated family relationships such as these, sure Warrior has it's cliches, but it really is an uplifting story. From the great fights displayed on screen, to the climactic battle between brothers and the great all around performances especially Nick Nolte for his portrayal of the trying-immense father, this is easily one of the best movies of 2011 and now officially my favorite MMA movie =)whether it be Brendan and the dad, Tommy and the dad, or Brendan and Tommy, it's those scenes between the family that carries the film to making it the near classic it is.  When watching the film you realize that rarely do films nowadays really contain complicated family relationships such as these, sure Warrior has it's cliches, but it really is an uplifting story.

B005ZUR724|4.0|I just got back on because the server was just down and when I got back on it said that I needed an update. It took me back to the Android app store to the screen where I bought this. There isn't any way to update this at all on this screen, I looked everywhere. If anyone knows how to update it or somehow fix it so I can play could u tell me?
B004QPOVF0|5.0|I've been a fan of AC/DC now for the past 30+ years, and I know the band in and out. This concert shows them in their purest form with their original line up when Brian Johnson joined the band in 1980.   A few minor flaws in this concert are the 5.1 mix makes you sound farther away from the stage. I prefer to leave it in default 2.0 PCM.  Also the setlist should have included \\"If you want Blood\\" instead of \\"Shot Down in Flames\\". And should have included some songs from the \\"Stiff Upper Lip\\" CD.  And it is obvious this was filmed over 3 days. In one song, Phil has a cigarette in his mouth, then the next shot he doesn't, then he does in the next shot. Then he doesn't.  But overall, this is a must have DVD if you are a big fan like me.
0307959856|5.0|I have read every one of P.D. James books. I bought Death Comes to Pemberley the moment I heard,(on NPR)of its publication. Upon its arrival on Kindle a few seconds later, I settled into my favorite chair and read and read from the first page to the last. Every line is so exquisitely composed, so delicately phrased, so totally brilliant, my only regret is having arrived at the end. Add yet another award to this glorious writer.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Breaking Bad is the best show on TV.  I got hooked on it instantly, and watched the entire 3rd season in 3 days.  Must watch!
076115678X|5.0|At nearly 40 years old, I am finally learning how to take care of my curly hair.  After fighting with it for years, I have learned to embrace it and now know how to care for it.  Great book with LOTS of great information!
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Breaking Bad is an amazing show!  Highly recommended.  Tell your friends.  I recommend the entire series, not only season 1.
B004EPYZUI|1.0|PROS: Great CGI, beautiful women, OK music (but not great).... CONS: Too much CGI (yawn...), very very very stupid women, boring story, paced like a video game intro, DVD/BluRay way over-priced at $14.00.... MORAL: wait until it comes to Netflix for free.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Breaking Bad is the best show on TV.  Great writing, great acting.  If you have not watched it, start with season 1!  Highly recommended.
B000JML7EC|1.0|This book is extremly confusing and i found myself thrusted into a world i had no idea about. I respect the authors writing style but as a person knowing nearly nothing about the world of pirates, i found myself not wanting to read any further  than the first  10 pages. This is truly sad, as i am a fan of classic novels.
B00003CXDD|5.0|Marvelously cast, well scripted, witty and surprising, this fantasy preceded the Ring cycle and included a host of mythic and magical motives excellently. Since fantasy must always contain some grim aspects of the reality it is trying to delineate and the evil it is trying to overcome, there are some horrible things here, some difficult to absorb, such as Sorsha taking part in the destruction of her own mother. But the heart in it is so good, the good wins out delightfully. A great film of its kind, one of the best.
B003ZHQVJ4|4.0|I bought this LP today locally & am happy with the LP itself. It's a very well done package; including a gatefold cover & full color liner sleeves for both LP's.  Both records were in separate white sleeves as well (a nice touch!).  Soundwise, the vinyl is superior to the CD in that there is more dynamic range to it that makes the music come alive & sounds pretty good. The pressings were very quiet too. On a decent turntable, you'll want to crank it up like you're supposed to.  The only complaint is that the bonus CD is the same compressed version as the regular one & it is truly unlistenable. This \\"make it louder\\" mentality has got to stop! (the number one reason I simply don't buy CD's anymore) I was hoping that the bonus CD would have been the same mix as the LP was mastered from, but it is not. Tom Petty did it the right way a couple years ago by including the audiophile mix on CD along with the LP.  The LP alone deserves 4 1/2 stars. The CD deserves zero.
1451648537|5.0|Wow...Apple is dead in 10 yrs. One can read this book and be entertained, impressed, and disgusted with the behavior of Steve Jobs, but read between the lines and realize that Apple is in big trouble. Innovation alone did not make apple great. Steve Jobs had innovation round 1 prior to Sculley firing him. That didn't help Apple because the board and management believed he was a) wrong about his ideas and b) intolerable. So, he returned and then made Apple great in round 2. So what did it take to make Apple great? A) Innovation and vision like that of Steve Jobs and B) insurmountable paranoia of Steve Jobs leaving again. So, when the rest of the world is giving the customer what they want, Steve Jobs is fighting his board and telling them that he alone will tell the customer what they want...and this time they HAD to listen or risk another potential failure should Steve Jobs leave. What otherwise would be grounds for termination due to insubordination, Steve Jobs simply did what he wanted against his board's directions. And he was right! His long list of greatest money making ideas were considered poorly conceived, incapable of succeeding, and even horrible by his board and experts in the tech world. This includes Apple Retail Stores, iPod, iPad, Mac, iTunes, Pixar, etc. So, read between the lines: who at Apple (or even in corporate America) has a) the innovation that Jobs did (there may be several), but ALSO b) the individual authority, job security, and arrogance to make snap, unilateral decisions to spend billions of dollars at will on what he or she personally thinks will succeed against all disagreement...no one else...and thus sell your Apple stock today!
B0056BU3I2|5.0|This was such a great movie.  My husband and I really enjoyed it and I am sure it will be one we watch often.

B006IGZWB2|5.0|I must say being a child from a diverse family of black and white....This was a great movie. My Great grandmother on my mother's side had a maid and my mom would always tell us that she couldn't have really been racist because she treated her made better than some of her friends. :) Oh and she loved my dad... Mind you my parents were dealing with the tail end of the whites and blacks not mixing generation. We should all see each other for who we are NOT what we look like because if you cut anyone of us we ALL bleed the same color!<br /><br />I am thankful for my mother going against the odds and for the world embracing the changes prior to my existence and for continuing to do so each day forward.
B003UESJH4|5.0|I would say that this movie is not for those who wish to go watch something mindless and trite.  If you do care to watch something that you must think about not only what is happening, but the historical implications as well, this movie is a fantastic one.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|Good movie, nothing new.  Did not understand everything that was going on.  Not a lot of heart.  Would like to have seen more of Mary.
B001F290E4|3.0|I like the CD, however the CD case was broken and damaged when I recieved the item.  Other than that this item is great!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I bought this on my kindle fire...it is awesome. my kids really like the original angry birds...but my 2 yr olds fav movie is Rio now so this one is definitely worth the dollar I paid for it. no problems installing or playing and the graphics are fantastic.
B00005K9LN|5.0|First of all, my favorite Judas Priest albums are Stained Class, Sad Wings of Destiny, Sin After Sin and Defenders Of the Faith. Those are all real masterpieces but I don't get all of the hype for British Steel. It's a classic but it's very commercial and straightforward. The guitar riffs and solos aren't as memorable as they were before on Stained Class or even Hellbent For Leather. British Steel is still solid throughout but not as good as their mid-late '70s discography. A lot of people that don't like British Steel say that their music went downhill on Hellbent For Leather but that album's a lot better in my opinion and Judas Priest find their way again on Screaming For Vengeance.
B003F3NDOO|5.0|I, like a lot of the other reviewers, was not a huge fan of the first few episodes of Cougar Town. I stuck with it though and at some point it became must see TV.  I think it was right around the time they ditched the stupid Courteney Cox as a cougar plot line and started focusing on the crazy exploits of the Cul de Sac Crew.  This show is both hilarious and heart felt. It has the ability to bring the viewer in so you feel like you are part of this crazy group each week. The writers reward long time viewers with inside jokes and references that casual viewers might not catch. It is, in my opinion, one of the best comedies out there right now.  The characters form a tight group that could be any group of friends of any age. If you liked the comedy of Scrubs then check this show out! If you watch Community (which judging by the ratings you probably don't) then you know these two shows have a mutual affection for one another so if you like Community, I think you'll like Cougar Town. If you like Parks and Rec I think you will LOVE Cougar Town because it has the same mix of eccentric comedy joined with genuine heartfelt love amongst the characters that makes Parks & Rec so loveable.  So give Cougar Town a try! Don't be discouraged if the first few episodes are kind of blah, it gets better. Much better!
B00004U8P9|4.0|Who doesn't love this old classic funny movie? Tim Curry still makes me laugh yet he's one of the best villians of all time. Of course, the picture quality is not quite what we're used to these days with HD and all the other acronyms you can come up with, but this is truly a classic that put these actors on the map with off the wall entertainment!
B002IFT1ZA|3.0|Note: I just saw the first episode with XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />The pilot episode of this series is said to be based on a series of books, which I've honestly never read and probably won't have time to read ever. What I find interesting is that it looks like its set in the Middle Ages, which has always intrigued me. And what's that made-up language? Dothraaki? Just what kind of a name is that? So, being as I've never read the source material, the characters and overall plot is somewhat hard to follow.
B006C1DH92|5.0|I definitely recommend. There are cool new mini games to play, very creative. Get this if you liked the original.
B002H3F7F6|5.0|I have found the music to be a reflection of time gone bye.  Brings memories of Christmas concerts that were performed at Dicken's of a Christmas event in my home town.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I bought this game for my fire and I loved it! if the cards are to small for you, just turn your kindle sideways! I would recommend this to others! I do not like the adds though.
B006C1DH92|2.0|Force closes each time when I try to run the app. Hopefully there is going to be a fix for this app. Samsung Captivate.
0811879542|5.0|We ran across this book first at the library and it fast became a household favorite.  If you have a hesitant reader in your house I guarentee this book will get their attention! It's really the only book of it's kind, it requires direct interaction with the reader and is almost magical in nature.  The kids are delighted at the power this book gives them and entices them to read it again and again.  It is also very easy to read with few words for beginner readers to have great success.  If you like this book I would definitely recommend the Elephant and Piggie Books by Mo Willems.  They don't offer the same kind of interactivity but they do offer some interactivity and conversation with the books and are easy (and funny!) for younger readers to start out with!  Press here is definitely a favorite in our house and is one book that never gets old, but continues to delight!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This app is fun, challenging, and addicting.  It is a good app considering that it is offered free.  I recommend this game for family fun!
B0061JPYX2|5.0|If you love Amy, you have to get this..Fantastic music, even though she is gone she will live on in her music.
B004L3AR0K|4.0|Based on a non fiction novel titled HARD SELL by Jamie Reidy. Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaall were both nominated by the Golden Globes for their roles. First off, let me get this out of the way. Yes, there is a ton of nudity in this film as well as sexual moves that adds a great deal of sensitivity and authenticity to this tale about two lovers who had no plans to become lovers. The main character is a sales guy type who decides to makes something of himself (partly to impress his family) by becoming a drug rep and it's right around this time that Viagra is released which leads to new sexual experiences for a lot of people, including older doctor clients of the main character. But it's really about love being the ultimate drug and puts a great deal of focus upon why these two people fall in love with some nice humorous scenes to boot. The main character's brother is an awesome sidekick who walks in on them doing you know what and even steals a sex tape they made together. But on a deeper level the fun all sobers up as the main character sees the ugly side of the early disease stages of his lover, Parkinson's Disease. What will he do? Well, this is Hollywood so you know it's probably going to be the safe ending but then again maybe not as I'm not telling entirely. The budget for this film was $30M and it made over $120M at the Box Office. STORY/PLOTTING: B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: A minus; LOVE TALE: B to B plus; OVERALL GRADE: B plus; WHEN WATCHED: mid December 2011.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Dexter: The First Season. Excellent crime drama. The characters in the story keep you coming back for more. I highly recommend this show to crime buffs as it is different from anything I've seen.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|There are a handful of films that never get old for me: Gone With the Wind, Wizard of Oz and It's A Wonderful Life are a few.  I am getting pretty tired of replacing each with a \\"new and improved version\\" every couple of years, but darn it - they got me again!  Although not a usual fan of colorization, the other reviews left me very intrigued.  Since the price was right, I had to get this version - and I am glad I did.  The colorization is subtle, believable and most of all, does not detract.  It enhances the experience.  I watched it on Christmas night and it STILL makes me shed a tear or two at the end.  Choices are always good and now I have TWO versions (and four or five other dvd's) of this Frank Capra classic.<br /><br />And hey, how can one ever get tired of the real Bert and Ernie?
B000HC2LI0|5.0|The West Wing series is awesome. I really admire the character development and the rapid action in each of the shows. I was very impressed with the speed with which I received the complete series from Amazon. Thanks for helping make my Christmas very enjoyable. El Bandido
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I had hoped that this movie would be good; so pleasantly surprised to find it great! I appreciate the how they dealt with the sensitive subject of Fatherhood.  The beginning scenes were a little stereotypical, and to be honest, it turned me off; but, as the story unfolded--I loved it.  Everyone should see/own a copy of this movie. Great life lessons.  I must also do a shout-out for Flywheel & Facing the Gaints.  Also, outstanding movies.
B006G2ZEV6|2.0|crashes afterlevel 5 every time.  need to get it fixed because it is a good game, would have given 4 stars if it didn't freeze up.
B005G4TJI4|5.0|Unfortunately I had to return  this movie. It was also a Christmas gift. Already had one.. My kids have one or I would have kept it..
B0036TGT3E|5.0|This movie brought back old memories of seeing it for the first time in theaters.  Seeing it remastered was amazing an made it all the more enjoyable.  I recommend this to any disney fan as it has plenty of features in addition to an amazing movie.
B004EPZ07U|5.0|I purchased two for my kids for Christmas gifts. & they were so happy. I put it on my IPAD & my daughter on her IPOD. they take it with them & watch it when we're on the road..
B006C1DH92|5.0|this game is a ton of fun. its much more addicting and fun then you would think it would be. thanks for the free app of the day. now playing it, I would say its worth the .99 cents it normally is. no problems what so ever on my kindle fire.
B001UV4XIS|1.0|Its sad that a space reserved for reviews of a fantastic movie instead gets taken over by complaints about the crime that is Ultraviolet Digital Copy.  UVDC is totally unacceptable.  Warner Brothers should really offer customers some sort of recourse.  It really should't be difficult.  You buy a personal license when you buy a movie.  You load the digital copy in iTunes.  You then load the movie on your devices for personal use.  That is the way it should be done.  Its not difficult.  Thanks so much for totally destroying whats supposed to be a very easy process.  There is absolutely no excuse for UVDC.
0307346617|5.0|I love zombie novels. Well, everything zombie. This is a must read to all zombie fanatics. While I read the low star reviews of this novel I understand the complaint was the style it is written in...the interview/short story setup. This book is beautifully captured in this style. It makes it all the better. This is my absolute favorite book to date.
B005ZUR724|1.0|I will change. my rating once I can play the game please hurry and fix it. hurry before you get a 1 star
B0056BU3I2|5.0|Fast Five is the best of the series - so far! Action packed & lots of emotion. Definitely a winner!
B005ZUR724|4.0|whats up with the inability to update game. haven't been able to play all day. when it works its a solid game
B0068TJLSY|2.0|The movie had all the childhood charm of most typical Stephen king movies but the actual plot was a little far fetched and lacked a good story. Not one of his best performances by far but worth watching at least once in life. Any more than that I wouldn't reccomend.
B0039O8AQK|1.0|This film does not do justice to Orwell's novel whatsoever.  The acting performances are mediocre and passionless, there is no emotional connection, and the way the movie handled scenes from the book seemed curiously amateurish. This feels like a dated and cheap made for TV movie, a total waste of time.  Maybe someday in the future a film adaptation of the novel will be done right, here's hoping for that day!
B005ZUR724|2.0|When I downloaded this app, it worked without a hitch. It was an excellent way to play an MMO without monthly fees; however, recently Gameloft has updated the game and offered no way for the Kindle Fire users to update along with it. It has rendered this app virtually useless. Do not buy this game until an update is made available to KindleF users.
B0031ES8P6|4.0|My daughter loves Hello Kitty so she was very excited to receive this plush; however, since it's just a stuffed toy she doesn't learn anything from it at all, which is why I gave only 1 star for educational value. She is limited with what she can do with it, so I rated it 3 for fun, and the durability seems very good. It also looks very nice, the quality is good.  That being said, overall my 3 yr. old loves it and that is all that matters!
B00000F5KH|1.0|I had heard that this was an exceptionally fine film and was anxious to see it. When it arrived I set it aside because I wanted to watch it after Christmas with my son who was visiting for the holidays. The packaging looked just like any other DVD . When I put it on, I clicked on play movie and the voice over started and it never stopped. It was the director and the producer and the star, talking, talking, talking.The movie was playing underneath all this. I tried everything I could think of . I took the disc out and started over I don`t know how many times. There was absolutely nothing written  on the disc that would make you suspect it was different than any other DVD. I thought, this has had to happen to someone else and so I read the reviews on Amazon and sure enough there were two reviews that had had the same problem . Apparently, Amazon must be aware of this and yet no one apparently has made any effort to inform the customer purchasing this movie. If there is a way of watching this movie I wish someone would let me know ---if not why are they selling this under false pretenses. To say I`m disappointed is the understatement of the year.
0439023513|5.0|ABSOLUTELY AMAZING SERIES!!!!!!!!!!! I was up till' 3 am reading because I couldn't stop- I was constantly in a dramatic/good part!!!!!! The best series I've ever read in my life!!!!!!!!!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I run this on every device I own.  works for both work and personal.  the first app I always recommend.
B005OCFGTO|3.0|Would like some extras, director's views etc., with these dvds.  Nice packaging for these 8 dvds.  Grandkids loved this product. No need to watch on line movies with commercials.
B005URRCUY|1.0|That's a 1990s-or-earlier Chrysler Town & Country minivan on the cover, not an El Camino. An El Camino is a pre-1970s Chevy wagon chopped to become a phony pickup.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game works really well on kindle fire!  It is one of the best apes ever released.  The touch controls work really well.
B004DK5CW4|4.0|This is a above average movie that anyone can watch with no violence and sex. A good family film centered around a great race horse and the trials and tribulations a less than rich owner faces to make it in a tough game.
B005K2XM94|5.0|This cover works great,easy to slip the kindle in, better than one with a zipper Cus the zipper could possibly scratch the screen
0385535139|4.0|Just finished the Audible version of \\"The Litigators\\" and was sorry to hear it end.  This is certainly the most fun I've had with a Grisham novel in a long time and I would enjoy seeing the characters from this novel make the leap to the movie screen and possibly a sequel.  Great read, I believe, to kick back and relax over the holidays!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|After reading all three books i was sad this story has come to an end. Suzanne Collins came up with memorable characters and an intense and oustanding story plot with vivid details and descriptions of events. The Hunger Games is a story that would make you hungry for more and urge you to keep on reading and wonder what will happen next. Although The Mockingjay has a different plot ,compared to the first two books, it connects to the whole purpose of the story-freedom. Many people expected the third book to continue its romance and discover whom Katniss will choose but only later, with disappointment, discovered the plot has slightly changed. However I was not disappointed, the characters, the sacrifice, feelings of compassion and revenge, and Katniss maturing and growing stronger made the trilogy an oustanding story. The whole purpose of this story is to convey us that we all have the ability to stand up for whats right and wrong and that we have the capability to achieve and surpass anything, although there can be conflicts and obstacles in the way, we will eventually surpass them. Suzanne Collins' trilogy also informs us to never let anyone or anything control us. I praise her for writing such a brlilliant book, it was one of the best i have ever read for a long time, especially the characters, she made them so real i felt like i knew them and felt compassion for them. Well done and keep up the good work :) . Last of all, I highly recommend this book/trilogy to anyone who is looking for a good book to read and cant put down.
B002MW50KY|5.0|I bought this album almost two years ago - just after Christmas, my first Christmas as a Bob Dylan listener actually.  Pretty rough sounding voice, but I like his voice, and I've long been fascinated with his belief in Jesus and God, and so I heard quite a bit of sincerity in his raspy voice as he sought to sing (ahem) these songs.  A coworker of mine, a music aficionado respectful of Dylan but not one who likes his voice, thought Christmas in the Heart was just too horrible to listen to.  Apparently she bought the album around the same time as I (n.b., I think I loaned her mine for a listen and she forgot and thought it was hers), and she later traded it in at a local used book & CD megastore.  Horrible, awful sounding it was.  Every Christmas now, a couple of us Dylan fans in the office bring the matter up as if it's one of the truly great Christmas albums (she loves Christmas music and knows a lot of it) and then listen to her mild cursing of it.  Office banter and fun.  I e-mail her reviews of the album that I think she'll like.  She liked the one in which the author - who personally found a lot of good stuff in the album- acknowledged that it's not for everyone, and he concluded by saying one could use it as a sort of music fruitcake; that is, bring it out and put in on when you want your party guests to start leaving.  So, over at my parents (who are in their 70s) this Christmas, after I hooked up their stereo so it could stream music from the web, I set up a few Pandora radio stations with Christmas music.  Like, Christmas general, classical, and Louis Armstrong Holiday, Jimmy Durante and so forth.  That was the music.  Until my brother arrived and at the dinner table decided to override the Pandora stream with his own Rhapsody stream - just to see if he could do it, which he did.  It irritated me, 'cause I'd worked pretty hard to set up genres my parents liked.  Oh no, he had the gall to find Dylan's Christmas in the Heart and started the album from the beginning.  Oh gosh, how long 'til the complaints shut it down.  Well, indeed, my niece (age 16, also a music lover) commented, \\"his voice always sounds bad, but this is especially bad.\\"  But to my surprise, my mom (the more musically savvy of my parents) enjoyed the songs quite a bit.  Jimmy Durante, Louis Armstrong, Bob Dylan I guess.  Wow, miracles do happen...I found somebody new who likes the Dylan Christmas in the Heart.  You never know, you just might like it.  He works so hard (well it sounds like it) to sing some of the most meaningful lines - meaningful in the sense of the essential worship of Christmas - that I gotta believe he is, as he said in a related interview, a true believer.  Thanks, Bob, for your music.  And to those reading, give this album a try if you can stand a gravelly, raspy sounding voice, and then wonder at the miracle of the Christ in the heart of a man.
B003O86CJS|3.0|This was not the explicit CD, but I thought some of the lyrics were too racy for my ears. However, I love Katy's voice and there are 3 or 4 songs I enjoy.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|We just wanted the movies- and are happy to get this complete set. (No need for any extras at my house).
B006C45MRE|3.0|I didn't go into this movie with great expectations. It was okay but the plot was just redone in a western setting. I give them credit for such big name actors being on board this project. It could have been much  better, but at least my kid thought it was great.
B0057R5XRG|2.0|I do NOT remember the first Jurassic Park looking like this in theaters, it is so distracting watching this movie on BluRay, scenes of grain throughout so distracting.  Those saying it looks like intentional grain added like the effect in 300 and like a transfer of a grainy VHS movie to BluRay are 100% correct.  I've never watched a BluRay as distracting to try and watch as this one.  It keeps flip flopping from very sharp and clean to extreme grainy scene then back to sharp/clean then grainy and on and on.  I'm watching on a 108\\" diagonal front projection setup so it isn't forgiving at all.  Those saying it looks fine must be watching on the 5\\" TVs because the grain is overwhelming when it occurs.  I'd like to see those saying the picture quality is good take a screen shot of some of the bad scenes like the DNA explanation sequences.  The audio on the other hand is A+ IMO, really, really good.  I have a very good 7.1 setup and the sound was phenomenal, making the poor picture quality all the more difficult to ignore.  Haven't watched parts 2 and 3 yet.
B005ZUR724|1.0|i downloaded the game, but it wont let me sign in because i have to download the latest update that is not available in the appstore.  so, one star for you order &amp; chaos for this kind of stuff that i certainly don't expect in a game I'm paying for.
B0060AY6FO|3.0|Jane Austen lovers may be disappointed (as I was) with this glimpse into life at Pemberly, Darcy's estate and Elizabeth Bennett's home following her marriage to Darcy. It supposedly picks up a few years after Pride and Prejudice left off, with the Darcys enjoying their lovely life until a murder on the property \\"pollutes the shades of Pemberly\\" (to borrow from Ms. Austen herself).   It starts off promisingly enough, in Austen's tone and style, and with events as you would have envisaged them. But the murder itself is without much drama and indeed, I knew whodunit long before the conclusion. This author deserves props for an ambitious undertaking but it's no more than a mild diversion, like a game of whist with a glass of sherry.
B00007BH3Y|5.0|This music perfectly fits to the scenario of the film. In this time I liked more film then a book. The music add value to this:-)
B005XY67WI|5.0|This magnificent video capturing the night of \\"Sale El Sol \\" tour in Paris, will definitely be the career savior for Shakira from the verge of falling down. From the album \\" She Wolf \\", shaki was going down in sales, even though the World Cup Theme song \\" Waka Waka \\" was huge sucess all over the world. But let's admit that \\" Without USA, No Queen Of Pop \\" just like Abba did almost 40 years ago. So gone are the days of Queen Shaki? Just in time, this super entertaining blu-ray released. Long Live The Queen Shaki.
B0019HQIGS|5.0|This was a great DVD and gave me a totally new appreciation for John Mayer.  I knew him for his voice, but I never understood how talented he was as a musician.  He put on a great show
B005ZUR724|1.0|Good app. Bad Gameloft... this app is great but gameloft isn't being so good at keeping the few players it had
1934030198|5.0|Great book, very useful. It contains everything you need to start training and further more. I can´t stop reading it.
B005HSL626|5.0|this game is way better then the iphone way. you can get everything the knifes and background its a way goodbdeal
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I was a little apprehensive about purchasing this after reading some of the reviews, but I took a chance and decided to buy directly through Amazon. None of the discs are missing- all ten seasons are there, they're just in six sleeves (one for each character). The quality of the DVDs is exactly like it is on television- it is a 1990's TV show, and these discs are NOT in high definition. If that is what you are aiming for, look elsewhere or wait until Amazon offers them in HD (if they ever do). You can tell these DVDS are not bootlegged- they come in an awesome copyrighted box with factory sealed packaging. I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas, and he loved it. I highly recommend this awesome set for all Friends fans.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|I purchased thsi movie for my grandson as a Christmas gift so that another generation of movie viewers can enjoy this classic.
B004H4XLR4|4.0|Siddeley the Spy Jet is a great addition to my sons \\"Cars\\" collection.  He loves it.  The only down side is the tail wing comes of with very little pressure.  At least it can be easily re-attached by a 5 year old. It would also be cool if it were die cast like all the cars he has, but that might make it a bit to heavy so I understand.  I think I enjoy adding to his collection more than he does.
B003L77G06|5.0|This was a great deal. Happy with purchase and is excellent. Was new in box and sealed. I would reccommend this for the whole fammily.
B005TBN3EU|5.0|I actually enjoyed it as much as the first. I heard a lot of bad reviews about this movie, but I actually caught myself laughing out loud through out the movie. It was very funny...Just let it ride and enjoy.
B0011UF79C|5.0|Great quality, good reproduction, just perfect. Glad to have it. Only the cover seems to be altered, but who cares.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|I always look for the Blu-Ray & DVD & Digital Copy. And I'm always happy...pull out the card inside the package, and either just redeem it from iTunes, or put in a disc and redeem it the same way. Movies show up in iTunes, and I'm all set.   But beware - everything just changed: this new Digital Copy process BLOWS. It's called Ultraviolet, and it's JUNK.  Here's why. Now, you have to create an account with BOTH Flixster and Ultraviolet, and...no, really, I'm not kidding....you have to PROMISE to share your viewing habits with them. WTF?  And believe it or not, it gets worse.  Then, to watch the movie, you have to add a Flixster app to your iPad or iPhone, or even to your flippin' PC! Seriously - you can't just download then to iTunes. You have to use this annoying app that looks like a popcorn box.   So, forget it. I will not create these accounts. I will not add their apps. I will not do any of it. Instead, I will return my purchase to Amazon, with a big, bad complaint attached.
B00005JKG9|1.0|Quick synopsis: These 4 or 5 guys sit around their real estate office for 2 hours talking about not getting good leads....PERIOD.   This is SO boriing! I made it through 30 minutes and then I fell asleep. After I woke up I fast forwarded through to get to the GOOD PART, but there is no good part!!!!!!!!!!!!  Who wrote the 'good reviews' for this waste of film? Amazon, are you hiring people to do this? Say it isn't so.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|it is fantastic for amazing artists such as me I did not put my name for a reason it is amazing I regimens it get it get get get get
B003498SDA|3.0|I got my copy on sale at a very low price. Luckily. I can't tell the difference from the DVD version I already own. Both sound and picture quality are the same as the DVD version. Save money, buy the DVD version. The movie \\"The Island\\" is a good example. The Blu-ray version is a big step up from the DVD version. But not Collateral.
B004LUS390|5.0|this app is amazing but I do disegree with the casaul doodles I like the way it is setup and overall bu this app if you like drawing sketching whatever you want to call it buy it buy buy buy buy therefore by it /
B000H6H81Q|5.0|sooo heavy and well made. realistic and even comes with a little person attached to compare how big it was comapred to humans. also comes with little education booklet about the wooley mammoth.
B0036TGSIK|4.0|FUNNY MOVIE,DO NOT RECOMMEND FOR CHILDREN. I GOT A GREAT BARGAIN. IT ARRIVED QUICKLY AND IN GREAT CONDITION. LOVE SHOPPING AMAZON.
B006C1DH92|5.0|its a nice game overall but the graphics and game play is not that special , but nice game for the first 2 hours ...
B0052TDGQO|5.0|Who wouldn't love the music by Scotty McCreery. Great CD, Great Music if you like country music. The CD arrived quickly and in great condition. Amazon is the place to shop.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|great game. good graphics,easy to learn in. however in two player the board moving becomes annoying but there is a button to remove it. and the undo button makes it easy to cheat.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this app every Sunday at church.  Very easy to navigate to the different books in the bible. Also,  love the different Bible versions.
1401216676|5.0|I read this it's bloody brilliant. A small bit short as it was only intended to be a one-shot. This was typical Alan Moore and I loved it. The fictional biography of the joker everyone's favorite bad guy, the journey ito him mind as he goes insane with a little ambiguity left at the end. Also this has some ingenious private jokes towards the Dark Knight which makes it even better. Simply a classic.
1439153663|5.0|This is a really good read.  We have had it on our reading list at the Bayliss Public Library Book Club.  It is hard to know that life has been and may still be as harsh for people.  The struggle to be free and move forward is one I can identify with.  But, as the ending shows,from the ashes, you can rise...  Get it read it and pass it on!
B001UV4XJ2|3.0|I love this movie, and the image and sound quality are outstanding, but enough about that.  What really ruins  it, is this new DRM scheme, Ultraviolet, which is completely useless. I am sorry, but  a \\"digital copy\\" that requires you to sign on with not one, but two different services, and that, at the end of the day, is nothing more than a highly restrictive, DRM-laden STREAMING service, requiring an Internet connection every time you want to watch the movie, is a total waste of money in my opinion.  But they won't be getting any more money from me for that Ultraviolet crap in any DVD  I decide to purchase in the future. I did not mind paying extra for DVDs containing a digital copy, because I could then download it to iTunes and, that way, I would have a copy of the movie ready to put into my iPhone or iPad, or stream from my Mac using AirPlay  directly from iTunes, now, none of that will work, and frankly, a system that requires you to jump through so many hoops just to watch a movie is not worth it, in my opinion. I only gave it three stars because it also comes with a plain DVD copy.
B006QF7664|4.0|This movie starts out with viewers feeling like they are watching a NASA documentary. I enjoyed that the introduction felt like a late 60's or early 70's space race documentary. But soon you are thrown into a scenario from the point of view of the astronauts. Their mission to land on the Moon is not what it seems.....I will not give away the plot but if you enjoy space exploration, conspiracy theories, alternative possibilities, government cover ups, and movies with \\"twists and turns\\" at every corner then this movie is AT LEAST a rent. If you love all the descriptions I have used then just BUY it. This is a great low budget \\"independent\\" movie that didn't get much play in the theaters and \\"critics\\" have put their noses up at it but it's usually my experience that if critics love a movie I dislike it and vise versa. On the other hand \\"normal\\" viewers of this movie have praised it and rated it well. I personally would have given five stars but some people just will not see the movie for what it is: ENTERTAINMENT. Most elements of this movie are possible but not probable.....who cares?!?! It's a movie not a historical documentary so enjoy it :)
B00005TQKQ|4.0|It's hard to review this product for several reasons. First and foremost I am using it on a very old camcorder so it is difficult to say whether it is doing what you hope. I assume it's working but it's hard to tell as the video looks about the same. It is also quite expensive.   In any case I needed to do something as I am trying to digitize old video footage. The downside is that the tape is so long I will never even come close to using it all.
B006C1DH92|5.0|Solid on the Nook Tablet pre-1.4.1 update, this has great PinB comments and excellent graphics.  This should be in every FN fan's app library.  Kudos for a great game!
B005ZUR724|1.0|game requires an update that is not available ....AVOID for now . Game was great and worked fine until a new update was required.  however the update is not available.
B0063IH60K|4.0|lots of fun, easy game to play when you have a few minutes to spare. I like the Vegas scoring option.
0765322889|1.0|Maybe reading it on a Kindle for Droid threw me off initially, but I had an extremely hard time keeping track of all the characters, and the locales described. Switching to the hardcover part of the way through, I found myself referring back to the list of 50+ characters almost every chapter. On the Droid, it was too much hassle to keep going back, so I quickly lost track. I think that because within each chapter, the POV would switch to multiple characters, I could never get invested in the story. With all the high reviews, I wanted to like the story - but even in the final chapters, I didn't know who any of these characters were, and what their alliances were.
B005YDLJ76|5.0|I was very happy with my order of Beyonc&eacute; Live at Roseland that I received from Amazon.  This was only my second time ordering from Amazon, and I was again pleased.  This was my Christmas gift to myself, so I was very excited to receive it.  I love the way that they offer the price adjustments, so not only did I get a great pre-order price, but I also received money back when the dvd went for less at a later date.  I just watched it yesterday for the first time with my mom and 2 yr. old niece and we loved it!  I love her for many reasons...not only is she a fellow Houstonian, but she has a drive, humbleness and creative mind that is very, very rare.  It is definitely something that inspires me and I know that she inspires so many that she touches.  It was amazing to see my niece watch her move in her videos, she was in awe.  After each video ended and we stopped dancing she would say \\"It's gone off, play it again Ni-Ni!\\".  Thanks again Amazon for great customer service!
1439170916|5.0|I have a science background and work for a pharmaceutical company.  I have an interest in subjects like cancer and its treatement.  This book is very well written and even though it can get technical at times, it still held my interest.  The sad fact is that we have a long way to go to beat this deadly disease.  I would recommend this book to anyone that wants to learn more about cancer, its challenges and the successes we have had in battling this disease.
0439796644|5.0|Michael Morpurgo's novel to stage adaptation and screen adaptation of his recent novel, \\"War Horse,\\" has been widely received by critics and audiences around the world. The story is told from a horse's point of view and the author does a masterful job in allowing readers to imagine what it might be like to be a horse especially in the 1910s before the brink of World War I.  The reading is easy at times. Morpurgo is very descriptive about life and the surroundings. Even from Joey's point of view, the reader will understand what the horses must go through in a human war. In fact, the novel makes a point that horses are beautiful creatures but who are suffered man's indignity in wars.  The horses' role in wars before cars became readily and easily available was an essential factor in fighting the enemies. I believe the novel will be a must read in middle school and high school reading lists within a year.  Morpurgo writes for a younger audiences but even older audiences can enjoy his writing as well. This book is quite wonderful, sad, and hopeful at the end. There is a short interview with the author in the end of the book. Also, the novel would be more useful if it featured maps and a brief review of World War I to help the reader.  One final note, Michael Morpurgo and his wife, Clare Morpurgo were both awarded the MBE (Member of the Order of the British Empire) for their services to their children's camp in the British countryside. Michael Morpurgo was recently honored again with the OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) for his services to children's literature. I wished that was just mentioned in the author's biography.

B004WE01YA|5.0|As with the other 3d Disney DVDs that we've obtained... this one is flawless.  No ghosting, and there are a lot of moments, within the film, where rain or different elements project out into the room.  The colors are superb!  This movie has a great message to deliver.  Disney rendered it in 3D marvelously; it looks fantastic!
B004EWEX9Y|5.0|ipod touch 4g has tv out function that is app specific. it doesnt mirror the entire ipod all the time. but it works well with netflix, youtube, crackle ect. if you want constant ipod mirror, you need to download one of the many apps that \\"allegedly\\" work. but anyways, this works great on every tv that i've tried it on, without any extra software. including my kenwood kvt-614 and pioneer avic n-1 in my cars. remember, composite for old school red blue and yellow. component for 480p blue green ect.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I devoured the book within a day. I was sad to see the series end, but I felt it left on a good note that tied up everything beautifully.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I need a plan to remain focused and there are so many to choose from. I've used monthly as well as seasonal plans and enjoyed each one.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|I have read the many reviews here from good to bad. Primarily all points of view have some credibility. There are many reason this release fails and just as many as to justify its release. But i think what needs to be remembered here is the chronological events prior to the official release of the album back in 1970. Originally set for an early 1969 release this album was pushed back on a day to day basis until its eventual release in March 1970. Along the way the Beatles even found necessity (for many reasons) to release an originally unplanned album \\"Abbey Road\\" for a rush Christmas release. Prior to this many \\"entrepreneurs were able to release unofficial release of the \\"Get Back\\"/\\"Let It Be\\" album with varying degrees of completeness and quality. Thus giving birth to the commercial bootleg. Some of these titles sold 10 of thousands of copies often being copied in other regions of distribution straight form someone else's vinyl copy (snaps, crackles, pops, and all). These were essential for any Beatles fan. I still have mine. With the release of Let It Be...Naked we now have the Beatles own statement on Bootlegs and their \\"official\\" version and digital release. Well Done. This is not supposed to be stunning unfinished unrelease traacks form the vault, but merely a documentation of the period just before the official release but now in best ever sound quality and as close to the original direction of the release than even the prior official release. This was supposed to be a bare bones no overdubs one take fits all production. Here it is, enjoy!
B005VR9328|5.0|This album is Phenomenal! I never imagine that The Roots will out do their previous album each time one is released, but they NEVER disappoint!! They are remarkable artists and not only are their beats/music great, but the lyrics they speak are thought provoking and inspirational!  GREAT ALBUM.... definitely worth buying and listening to over and over again!
B003IKMR0U|5.0|This is one of my new favorites.  Easily portable to take in the car and play at a restaurant table while waiting for service.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|lots to do for free. ads are annoying but don't ruin it. the games are varied and there are lots of them to unlock. do feel.bad about update though
B005OHSD3A|4.0|Parcel/Delivery: was good, within the time frame that I was expecting. The book was in good condition (brand new) no dints, tears etc.   As for the actual book content - only have just started reading but my first impression is that the text and language is fairly simple to read (good thing). Captivating on some pages but as with all diet books your really only going to read it if your motivated to follow whatever plan/advices the book tells you. If you have done Atkins before and liked it, you will like this book.
B000PY30JE|1.0|Chet Baker's \\"Chet\\" album is at the top of my favorites list, which I give five-stars.  HOWEVER, that applies to the clean, lovely 1987 mix on CD and the recent LP reissue, NOT to this poorly-engineered 2007 24-bit remastering by Joe Tarantino of Fantasy Records, Berkeley.  Sadly, this \\"demastering\\" ruined the album with a ludicrously overblown bass boost.  On both of my two music systems (hi-end and well-tuned) this remix inflicts boomy headbanger bass onto what previously was a gloriously balanced jazz performance.  Avoid this issue and look for the properly-engineered 1987 release; you'll be rewarded with some of Chet's remarkable jazz ballads from his peak years.

B0068AWQQ2|1.0|Thank goodness I rented this at Redbox, instead of my usual Amazon rental. Even so, I want the 40 minutes of my life back that I spent watching this flick.
B005ZUR724|5.0|I know, I was upset it didn't work today too. But don't you think you should give them a day or two before you kill the ratings? went from 4.5 to 3.0. that's pretty harsh.
B0001WTWCO|5.0|After years of resisting DVD extras I've recently got into them and have started buying special editions of favourite films to watch the documentaries and listen to commentaries, interviews etc.  'The English Patient' has been a fav for years, so I was really looking forward to it. The film is definitely 5 star: beautifully shot and acted with a wonderful script and the most heart wrenching story. If you've missed it somehow, I suggest you buy a copy and watch it now... though I wouldn't necessarily recommend you fork out the extra for the Special Edition.  The Two Disc version is packed with extras but personally I didn't think they added up to much. They've managed to gather together all the important names behind the film - including Minghella and Zaentz - but I thought the interviews were a bit bland and lacking insight. There's definitely not enough from the cast. The long interview with Michael Ondaatje (who wrote the novel upon which the film is based) is rather boring and seems to go on forever. Also included is a made for TV 'Making of' (which is all soundbite and no substance) and a featurette on the real Almasy which is myth busting... but not in a good way (I would have preferred to keep my romantic notions of the Count!). The thing I liked the most was the deleted scenes. I think they made the right decision omitting these from the final cut (esp the Kip/Hannah minefield scene) though all the footage with the ostrich is intriguing!  Overall a 5 star film, 3 star extras. Bit of a wasted opportunity I feel and given that we'll never hear Anthony Minghella talk about the film again, a shame.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I haven't had any issue with this app! Even the ads are convenient, they only pop up after you end a hand and before you start a new one!
B005K17RU0|5.0|It works perfectly on my fire and my kids can even check the forecast and they're only 6 and 7!!!
B004GYY714|4.0|this is really good the only downer is that when I want to listen to z100 it gives me somekind of 106.something.  I thought that was very very poor but otherweise the other stations are really good.  I highly recommend it also I heart radio because it has z100 and Elvis derand show in very good quality
B006LS7DQE|5.0|Very fun game that I found myself spending a lot of time playing. It was well worth the 3 bucks.
B000JIHP88|5.0|My 4.5 month old just got this mobile and loves it!  We were looking for one that moved and played music for longer than just a couple of minutes to replace one we had from Pottery Barn.  She seems captivated by the flapping leaves and soothed by the music (which I was afraid was too soft but actually is perfect at lulling her to sleep)... Love the bright colors and shapes as well as the multiple choices for music.  All that, and not a bad price at all.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This is an awesome app, worth the money, a lot of customization, and looks realistic too. I am very pleased with this app
B004WGGQPQ|1.0|this is the worst app I have seen yet if you want fun try angry birds rio it is totally awesome
B005L38QK2|4.0|If you are considering this mouse, I assume you are also looking at similarly priced products such as [[ASIN:B001NTFATI Logitech G9X]] and [[ASIN:B002YNS8XC Razer Imperator]]. Most of the decision will come down to personal feel, unless you happen to be a [[ASIN:B00178630A Diablo III]] fanatic who needs the mouse designed for this one game (or perhaps a [[ASIN:B002I0KP4G StarCraft]] or [[ASIN:B002I0HKIU WOW]] player who wants one of the other mice customized for those games).<br /><br />Depending on the deal you get, this mouse is a bit cheaper than others of equal quality. It is also considerably lighter, which some reviewers didn't like but all other things being equal, I prefer. I think it's also sturdier, but that's based on looking at it rather than extensive long-term testing. I didn't care for the styling, but it doesn't matter a lot to me anyway. You might like it.<br /><br />Other than that, I don't see much to choose among these. They work equally well for me, you may find one or another more natural.
