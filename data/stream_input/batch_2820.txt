B00594XOZU|5.0|I'm glad there's a kick app for kindle. I have on my mobile phone but was very pleased to see that it was made for kindle fire as well. It sure helps since i spend most of my online time on my kindle fire.
B0049J2CKE|5.0|love the picture quality.acessabitlity for my grand. the turn around time for viewing. long enough for the grand to be satistified
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I had no clue what to expect when I picked up this book, but I'm glad I did!!! It gives you such an amazing and unique insight to childhood cancer. It really shows you some of the things most of us will hopefully never have to go through, but does happen too much. It shows you just a little bit of something you will never really understand unless you go through yourself, and gives you so much respect for people with cancer. You really realize how strong they are and have to be. I love this book so much, and you will too, so read it please!!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|the easy access and picture quality. the turnaround time for viewing. the easy acess for children to pull up when they want to watch
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|How can you not love a Die Hard movie?  This one is a little shorter in timeframe than the rest, but they didn't an excellent job finding an actor who you felt could really be Bruce Willis's son.
0345803485|5.0|I couldn't put Fifty Shades of Grey down until I finished it...had to order the other two books for the set.
B005LAII44|5.0|Excellent movie although it is misleading regarding Channing Tatum.  Channing Tatum is actually in very little of this movie. Spoiler alert they pretty much kill him off at the beginning.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids love this game.  I am still somewhat a neophyte when it comes to games on a phone.  The kids however love it and it helps keep them occupied on rides.  How did we ever survive prior to technology....  Thanks!
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|Love the prequel to the Wizard of Oz--which of course everyone has seen over and over and over.  Mila Kunz was amazing turning into the wicked witch.
B006JTS5OO|5.0|I greatly enjoyed the film, but the blu-ray released has excellent production values, with many semi-hidden features.  When the film is paused, a semi-randomized intermission begins.  The picture quality is stunning, and the extra features, such as behind the scenes and bloopers, are nice additions.  The fact that this release also includes a DVD copy of the film is nice so I can lend the film to my parents, who did not have a blu-ray player yet.  It also allows me to bring it to school to show my students, as the school is not blu-ray capable either.
B00330UFQS|5.0|Love this album. They released a ton of songs and was a great follow up. Highly recommended for any Lady A fan
B003EI2EH2|3.0|Nothing like a wish for weight loss but eat right and exercise that's the best one can do for themselves. No magic remedies.
B0043RSJ8G|4.0|I found myself waiting to get back to the book . Ending was quite a surprise! Another great one by Jodi
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Since razor mouse keep breaking because of their poor quality clicking pad, i decided to get a mouse from different brand.<br />Found anker mouse with an average price for a gaming mouse and its the mouse i been looking for. The quality of a mouse is great, instant dpi switch and macro makes it a flexible mouse in gaming.<br />the color is a bonus allow you to switch any color you want, but sadly you can only switch color on the mouse emblem of anker not the scroll button or the side.The left side of the mouse where the button are is comfortable to put your thump on. The mouse is very lightweight thats why it came with a mini weight to put on as well but i don't really use it since im comfortable with lightweight mouse. Overall im liking this product and its an alternate to death adder or razor naga.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|One of my favorite movies. Joe Pesci is great. Paul Sorvino is a great Boss. Top 5 gangster movies of all time.
B000ICXQXS|4.0|I watched this movie as I was cast in the community theater production of the same name/story. Great reference! Glad I watched it.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I like this game a lot but I wish you could play just you and a computer other that it is fun.
B003SI9WYG|5.0|We have liked this movie since it came out almost twenty years ago. Will watch frequently I know. What's not to like?
B007REV4YI|5.0|Good Bond flick! Still entertaining after all these years. Every one has there favorite actor who plays 007, but all of them gave something to the character. In short Bond is Bond no matter who plays 007
B002PNER9U|5.0|My husband is not very into musical theater and really enjoyed this movie. I am glad we could watch it at home together. I hope to someday do a community theatre production of this.
B00C68JXAW|4.0|Not a bad 007 movie. even if it's not a part of the Bond franchise. Bond is Bond No matter how you look at it.
0375703764|5.0|This book is definitely a strange read but it's worth checking out. His other books aren't that great though which is mildly disappointing.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|The app allows me to shop from my phone or Kindle and sends reminders about watched items and feedback.  The only drawback is that on some searches, the filter option is not available and you get too many results to sort through.
1451627297|5.0|i thought this was a fantastic read and a wonderful change of pace from Stephen King's usual horror craziness extravaganzas.
B001BANK32|5.0|I read this inn the sixth grade I'm now 34. I got so much more out of it and was creepy even more. I'm now going to watch the television series soon.
6305128952|5.0|got it for my dad as a present and I can't wait till he watches it! He's been talking about wanting this movie for months :)
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Enjoy all aspects of the series. A totally foreign life style to learn about and experience. Recommend seeing all seasons
B00A757EFW|4.0|Great just like arcade game ! The touch screen on my I Phone works great with the movement of the pack man
B00BEEKN26|1.0|What a ripoff to get the first show at no charge and then charge for the second one.  You can cancel the trial membership now.  I'm not interested in this type of treatment.  Debra Jackson
B00966TN1Q|4.0|Cold-cases always look hard to solve.Luck and perseverance is needed.H.Bosch's got them both.I like the plot.Easy to read.Makes you aware that crime-fighters never give up upon a case.Main character evolves - Harry Bosch is getting older - but his experience in the matter is still needed around.This anticipates a slow end to investigations by the main character but I hope it takes a considerable time!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|A great concept with intriguing sub-plots. These are not cheesy zombies; they're the walking dead. There is a big difference.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book was recommended by a friend.  It is not the genre that I am usually interested in.  After starting it, I found that I had a hard time putting it down.  I ended up reading through the night to finish it.  It is an amazing recount of what really happens, as opposed to what we hear happens.  I have always felt proud and honored to be able to live where I live.  Knowing the sacrifices that have been made, make me feel so much more. Thank you to all who have served, all who are serving, and all who will serve in the future.
B00CEK9OTM|4.0|I really enjoy playing Core Dive. There's no documentation explaining game play, so you just have to figure it out by trial and error. Once you figure out the basics of game play, then you have to hone the physical skills involved in controlling the ball. Game play is difficult enough so as to not be too easy / boring, but challenging and fun.
0316056898|5.0|Tina Fey is funny, quirky, intelligent, witty and incredibly honest. If you already like her, you will LOVE her aft reading this!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love the show. I've enjoyed every episode.  I've laughed and cried and commiserated.  I looked all over the place four the 3rd season as i don't get a clear picture for pbs and don't have cable, i was grateful to find it.
B002V0GZ9M|5.0|This movie has always been a favorite of mine.  I had to buy it so I can watch it whenever the mood strikes.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|this is a great movie cant wait to i watch part two. in this movie hit girl, kicks but. the cast and crew did a great job.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|This movie was so good.  I love the storyline and the characters were well thought out, and the elves were so funny.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I want a Mr. Grey. Every woman does. Everyone female who doesn't meet society's standards wants to be Ana and wants a Christian.
B003XQPYR2|4.0|I have to admit I spent a lot of time the first time I watched it wondering where the forest part was.  Didn't Robin Hood live in the forest?  Well, never fear, they live in the forest for the last 5 minutes or so.  I wish it had closed captions, sometimes I had no idea what people were saying.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|It freezes or shuts down more than it opens and works properly. The developer really needs to work on this because it's annoying. So glad it was a free app
B0073LWEXK|4.0|This was a great game but once you find the objects the first time you know where they are going to be.  The map was a little confusing since it wasn't square, it had all sorts of weird angles.  But all in all I thought it was a great game.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Very interesting.  Some rough spots where story flips back and forth from past to present.  Made me want to learn more about the orphan train survivors.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm addicted. I pin everything. I love this app and it's incredibly easy to use. Highly recommended for anyone because it's so easy to customize and show only the things you love.
0615782043|4.0|Revenge of the Orgasm, by Author-Poet G.P.A. offers to us the multifaceted perspective, that for some inexplicable reason, reminds me of the old joke.... Q - \\"Do you ever talk dirty to your wife, while having sex?\\" A - \\"Only when I happen to be near a phone.\\" Maybe that's the idea, to take turns, while in bed, reading this prose to each other.<br />I'm not sure if the Author is making fun or having fun; although, the having fun part does seem obvious. Much of the interpretation will be from the mind of the reader and my mind just isn't that sharp these days. It's kind of like teasing foreplay more than the needed raw graphic sexual gripping frankness. The poetic translation leaves a distraction from the message. The free verse multi-stylize, multi-topic prose can certainly, by itself, be entertaining. I think the reader will take as much away from the work, as much as has her or she is willing to put into it.... no innuendo intended.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Well worth a try its free<br />Very addictive dont want to put it down. overall give it a go you will love it
006097625X|5.0|Loved it. Really enjoyed reading it. Gives you great perspective of comics as a medium, and of media as a whole as well while explaining it in engaging, easy to digest ways.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I look at the weather locally daily for information regarding the forecast so I know when I can go rc airplane flying.
B009AMANH4|2.0|Smart Shop USA claimed this product was brand new in packaging-it was not. It was reshrink wrapped, the DVD had small scratches all over it, and the blu-ray had fingerprints all over it. When they reshrink wrapped it, the case and paper insert got crinkled all up. This is very unprofessional of a seller to claim a product is new and flat out lie. Stay away from Smart Shop USA at all costs.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Wonderful! I loved this book.. Best series ever. Beautifully written. Great for young adult book readers and people who don't read.
B005H9B44A|5.0|Fantasy, Vibrant, Love, Strength and Action.  What more could you want from a movie. Mmm how about Thor 2! Nice
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I didn't understand why different people kept getting introduced in each chapter and I had to try to concentrate on each little story within the book.  Now it all makes sense!  Great book!
B003LXXEFG|5.0|I had been listening to this album a lot off of slacker radio. I decided to just buy it, pus it was the remastered version. For 3.99 this is a steal.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|If Rick kills percabeth I kill him. That's all I hav to say.<br />Nahh I have more. This is prob the best book in the hoo series so why are u still reading this?<br />Go buy it!!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was recommended by a friend. Not my usual genre, but we'll written. A very intense read, couldn't put it down.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Good, exercises, easy to read, powerful message. Loved the way the author delivered her message. A wonderful book and must read.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|This was a selection of my Book Club and we all loved this book.  It had mystery, romance, and many twists and turns.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved it<br />It captured my attention until the end. It was sinister and gruesome and romantic and exciting at the same time. Great story line and character development. I highly recommend it
B00CPK8U96|5.0|(I supposed this is a bit biased as he's one of my favorite musicians.)<br />The only Frusciante solo album with studio production, Shadows Collide With People offers a unique view into his style of songwriting and around musical capability, and is a great gateway into his more experimental work for people new to the artist. Caravel and Omission demonstrate a melodic and vocally centered aesthetic more akin to more traditional rock/pop, while negative 00 ghost 27 and failure33Object are more experimental and demanding of an open mind. Omission especially stands out to me with Josh Klingoffers vocal work. Though I personally would rank the Empyrean as my favorite Frusciante album, this is a close second as it's a great balance between his guitar, synth, and vocal work, and should be enjoyed by both most Frusciante fans, and offers a good starting place for most fans of alternative rock just looking into him.<br /><br />Recommended for: Experimental music fans who like John Frusciantes more song oriented work, People getting into his work.<br />People who generally like john frusciante.<br /><br />My other two favorite albums by him are the empyrean and the will to death, also worth checking out (I would say all of his work is)
B009YP9L7U|3.0|The concept of the two main characters suddenly finding themselves married is fascinating, but three quarters of the book is about the sex and passion between them, which is acting like a crutch that the weak storyline is leaning on.<br /><br />The writing style, where the parts of the chapters shifted back and forth from one perspective to another is great, and surprisingly easy to follow.  Many other authors attempt this, but don't pull it off like Kelly.<br /><br />I would recommend this to someone looking for a quick and easy read, as long as you don't mind lots of sex in your stories!
B007FEFLTO|2.0|The plot was very predictable and the charter development seemed to follow what is outlined the text book on fictional writing. Not as good as the first book in the series and no where close to Pillars of the Earth.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Broadchurch has rippled my heart out and tap-danced on it and I am dying for more.  Four more words required.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Quality was good and worked well.  We have watched it twice with no problems encountered either time we watched it.
B001NI5CCY|4.0|This movie is a classic in my eyes.  It's not entirely factual as if I recall Permian did not make it to the finals that year to face off against Dallas Carter but regardless I would highly recommend it to anyone that enjoys watching football movies about the pressures of playing in a town where football is everything.  Great acting; and a lot of good motivational speeches in it.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|As stated above all of the products we have ordered these discs worked well and gave us no problems at all.
B00AHXIC50|4.0|Easy to listen to, easy uncomplicated music that makes for a good time . I would recommended this purchase for those who listen to pop music
B000JIHP88|2.0|I should probably begin by saying that this WAS a wonderful mobile.  Our son absolutely loved it and we hoped to be able to use it for our next child.  However, the motor in the mobile began to fade within the first month and was dead by the second!  At first we thought it was simply time to change the batteries since we'd used the mobile regularly.  Unfortunately, while the music and the lights in the base station still work perfectly, the mobile simply won't move.  We considered buying another one, but $20/month is a bit pricey for a mobile.
B009X01D9U|4.0|A sturdy, protective cover in a beautiful choice of colors. it was hard to resist the temptation to buy more than one.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I thought it was a very insightful book and a quick read.  I enjoyed it very much and recommend it.
0321647440|2.0|not suitable to learn<br /><br />it should start with simple things and then move to more specific uses<br /><br />too complex at the beginning
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like this game. It is challenging and makes you use your noodle. It could use a help or hint feature on a few levels & you shouldn't have to write a review to continue. Overall this is a winner.
B005AKFXZW|2.0|I was very disappointed with this book.<br />I found it to be very confusing. It jumped around so much that I couldn't follow half of it.<br />It was only about 3/4 of the way through the book that I finally started to get excited about what was going to happen at the end. I wouldn't recommend it to my friends at all.
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|I  was  skeptical at first.  it takes a bit to get started but just  keeps getting funnier.  if you like Shawn of the dead and all the others you will love this.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Hands down the best slayer album ever!!! If you've never heard slayer before this is the album to buy!!!  One of the best heavy death metal albums ever for that era!!! Lyrics are intense not for kids... I looked all over for this album and could not find (brand new) in any stores. Thanks amazon for always coming through for me!!!!
B002GHHHPQ|4.0|I liked it. It is a great movie.  I would recommend it to anyone that like to know about the second world war.
1607066017|5.0|Vaughan and Staples are right now the best tag team in comics creating a unique storyline with outstanding artwork. if you are a fan of genre blending fiction with unique characterization and surprises in every issue along with art that continues to get better this comic for you.
B005LAIGN2|4.0|My Son likes wanted the movie because he liked it. I would recommend this to anyone that like history, ok
B004NOCCEG|5.0|Financial services sector owns Washington, and that is a problem explained in thorough by this documentary. Democrat and Republican alike, changes to corruption need to happen. Regulation and reforms must protect every American. Post-2008 believing in Libertarian economic notions to protect the 1% isn't possible anymore for someone without an ulterior motive.
B005T87QCI|5.0|The games from gameloft are the best but this is the best of them all it is worth every pennies
B003WE9TU8|1.0|Movie much better,wish it could have been more like the movie and poor story telling did not make for a good read
B009WUAK2M|1.0|The dialogue is atrocious. The plot is incoherent. Each cameo is more awkward and cringeworthy than the last. And the guns operate on \\"A-Team rules\\" - only the bad guys ever get shot. I want my two hours back.
B00DH4BL8Q|5.0|Story telling at its best. I think Percy's character in combination with annebeth really is good,some romance With some action.There is also great Greek mythology which I never new,will definitely recommend this series
B004K58GSO|4.0|Have watched this film for years.  John Wayne AND Robert Mitchum, how could you go wrong?  Just a good ol western
B004ZJZQ7O|4.0|Great movie good picture sounds great plays good on my Blueray DVD player no complaints shipped to me in less the a week
1601251505|5.0|I highly recommend getting this book if you are planning on playing or running any games of Pathfinder. Packed with information and although you can get almost all of it online from Paizo's website, it's much more convenient having everything available right in front of you.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I am just a fan of everything Robert Downy Jr. .  Also loved Thor, Captain America I could live without.  But the combination of heroes made for a power packed evening.  Watched it twice may watch a 3rd time.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I enjoyed the middle to the end, but felt as though I was left hanging without a resolution at the end. I prefer when the villains in the story get what's coming to them, and that Isn't what happened.
B002PJN59M|5.0|Ok, people will gripe about one version versus another version.  I can embrace them all, because they are stories.  In that vein, this rings true to much of the \\"Le Morte d'Arthur\\" by Thomas Malory, in which his sister is his enemy, and in the end he's carried off to Avalon and so forth.  I still think that of all the people in all the vast recreations of any version of the Arthurian films, plays, and so forth, that Nicol Williamson was the best actor to portray Merlin - he carried the character with so much personality, between the fleeting moments of whimsey and deadly seriousness that no one has ever done it better (and as much as I like Sam Neil, he's a poor shadow to Nicol Williamson's Merlin).<br /><br />Great movie, and Nigel Terry makes an awesome Arthur.  And as much as I loved Cherie Lunghi in other projects, I hated her for betraying Arthur in this... and for an actress to evoke such emotion means she's a VERY good actress! (Loved her in Covington Cross, where she was paired with Nigel Terry again)<br /><br />Overall a great version of the Arthurian tales, and the sound track (O Fortuna!) is good accompaniment to the movie as well.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|A very entertaining game. My kids love it and so do I. Collect bananas and run over or slap other minions!!!  It's also fun to challenge your friends.
B0049P1VHS|4.0|I'm still viewing these but so far so good.<br />Thanks very much I look forward to ordering future seasons in the near future.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|This book is similar to the Kingkiller Chronicles, as the readers follow a single character throughout the book. This book is in fact a bit better because there is a conclusion to all the hanging threads and my interests never waivered. What Im saying is that if you liked Name of The Wind by Patrick Rothfuss then you are going to love Blood Song....nuff said?
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I love the humor, relationships of the co-workers in the law firm.  The cases they work on are very interesting too!
B005DCJ1J6|1.0|Started movie showed previews the movie started and goes to chapter 9 in the movie got for Father's Day and to late to return wasted money.
B004UOE7VA|5.0|I have the  Tron soundtrack already and love it but this remix  is even better!  Way  awesome! I haven't stopped listening to this for a week.  Definitely worth getting.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I watched the movie first, then read the book. Although they ended up being quite different in ways, neither one tarnished my view of the other. Book and movie are equally great for different reasons.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|I love this app.  I use it a lot to release stress,  it's very entertaining . By the way l am 40.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It's a fun to do while waiting or a good distraction when you're trying to solve a problem.  Could also help someone to learn to focus and think things out before acting.
B008Y5FNL4|5.0|I love this movie, I can watch over and over. This movie was made true to life. The HD version is great.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|Metal Gear Solid is a masterpiece. This collection includes every MGS game directed by Hideo Kojima. This collections will keep you busy for hours in the most impressive universe in the history of video games. This is a must have for any fans of stealth or action games.
B008X77K8W|5.0|This is the best music I have heard in years...what a great songwriter and singer... very deep and moving...I cant wait to hear more of his stuff
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a challenging game that makes you use your brain and memory. I would like more puzzles like this
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Adenosine and addicting very fast hard but not fusturating buy this game or play for fun you won't regret it.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Really enjoyed the game.  Puzzles are short but quite challenging at times especially if you want to get all the stars.  Completed the game now cycling back to get a perfect score.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed this book - good story, several interesting turns in the narrative.  Easy to read and follow, was a good beach read.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Quickly and easily clears unnecessary files and applications on Kindle Fire. I tried a couple other cleaners and this was the easiest to use.
B003VANOFY|3.0|the fact that it uses the same frequency as my router makes me lag while playing online games, its way cheaper than the next best wireless headset the astro50s I would recommend getting astros if you have the spare money as they are a direct upgrade to this.  The sound balancing seems a bit off esp compared to real surround sound competitors. The digital surround just doesnt seem right and I never use it because of that.  I had to tweak all my settings for a few hours before I found a solution to get rid of the seemly endless static.<br /><br />If you are experiencing static try doing this.<br />---------------------------------------------------------<br />Open Control Panel and Power Options<br />Make sure you are on the High Performance power option<br />Change plan settings<br />Change advanced power settings<br />Scroll down to USB settings<br />DISABLE the USB selective suspend setting for both on battery (if you are on a laptop) and Plugged in.<br />Next, turn off your headset.<br />With a paperclip, press inside the little hole on the USB transmitter stick<br />Hold the Power Button down on your headset for about 10 seconds until the Green Light goes solid on the USB transmitter stick
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Every time load the app when it starts to load my news feed it closes. Hopefully this is being fixed
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Game is lots of fun when you can't really get a good magic game anywhere else and don't have lots of friends who play the physical card game!
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Very enjoyable for any trekker. My only beef is I really couldn't commiserate with the villain at all.. No good deed goes unpunished...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is good for everyone to play. My kids and I work on the puzzles together.<br />Some levels take longer than others to complete and some require math skills.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|The official Nintendo GameCube controller far surpasses any knock off controller I have tried to buy to save money. You buy Nintendo the first time and you will save money in the long run.
0385528787|5.0|Being the 3rd book in a series, I did a re-read of Oryx and Crake and The Year of the Flood prior to reading this.  That wasn't entirely necessary but I have no regrets about doing so.  I enjoyed having it all fresh in my mind going in.<br /><br />If a reader hasn't read the first two books and wants to read this one is that a problem?  Probably not.  There's a good synopsis of the first two books at the start.  However, I do feel like you'd be missing out on some great books.<br /><br />At first I wasn't sure I was going to love this book.  Often I didn't think I was going to love this book.  It follows the same pattern of the previous books, where part of the story is told in the story's \\"present\\" and part was reflections and back story, and in this case ... I just didn't want or need the back story.  Sometimes it was just random stories that really didn't fit in all, and then it was a re-hash of events (or lead up to events) from prior books (particularly Year of the Flood) told from a different character's point of view.  That REALLY annoyed me.<br /><br />But the parts in the \\"present\\" were so good, and as the book went on it just kept getting better and better, and by the end I absolutely loved it.  So if you get bogged down in the beginning, don't let it get you down.  It's worth it to persevere.<br /><br />Atwood is a master story-teller, a beautiful writer, she's funny and she's created memorable characters you can't help but love, (especially a certain little Craker named Blackbeard!)  I thought this was a perfect ending to the series.
B004YCKJSS|5.0|It was a good relationship movie explaining some things I couldn't just &#34;tell&#34; some people that the movie could.<br /><br />DVD was as advertised and what was needed.<br /><br />Arrived quickly - seller deserves KUDOS !!<br /><br />Thanks
B00C0NFMKI|4.0|This isn't their best work, but I do like the new album. A lot of different styles are represented here, showing their talent -- especially Haley's vocals. Just don't expect some of the same grit and gut from their past albums. This is definitely more poppy, radio-friendly.
B002N57KG2|5.0|My 14 year old son loves this movie.  He watches it over and over.  Brings back some nostalgia about the good ole days of fun funny clean movies. :)
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|This is the perfect game for the procrastinator.  If you have something pressing you need to do, this is always more fun.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was really well done. It offered a fun puzzle and brain workout. Problem solving skills were tested. And it did it in a fun, mysterious, and intriguing way. I hope they create another one!
1589795474|4.0|The book's central point is that most millionaires are frugal.  It makes this point thoroughly and gives several reasons why it's true.  A 2nd major point is that most people with very high incomes are not millionaires (a million or more in assets), and why not..<br /><br />The book tells me what I wanted to know and gives lots of examples and evidence.  The drawback is that it's very wordy and repetitious, and some of the examples and especially the detailed evidence are simply excessive.<br /><br />The book is good for people who want to become millionaires, but by telling what it takes, it may make some people content not to be millionaires.
0761169431|5.0|My grandson is a big fan of Star Wars and also is involved in origami.  All he could say is &#34;wow&#34;  when he opened the book.<br />Excellent paper graphics and instructions.
B0037471TE|5.0|Detailed description like no other. Felt the thrill like I was there myself. Hope the sequel picks up from where this one left
B002WY65VU|5.0|THIS MOVIE WAS GREAT....I WATCH THIS MOVIE PRETTY MUCH ONCE A MONTH IF NOT EVERYOTHER MONTH...WOODY IS AMAZING..HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FLICK
B00821OX98|1.0|They obviously have no solution to their &#34;problem.&#34; The series runs on and on. without a resolution to the &#34;hook&#34; (the dome) the story simply devolves into a soap opera with all the predictable characters. Steven Spielberg's attempt to reach multi billion dollar status. Cheap and easy production/story. Not worth one's time.
B00417HV14|5.0|I REALLY CANT SAY ENOUGH GOOD THINGS ABOUT JOE. I HAVE ALL OF HIS DVDS AND LOVE THEM ALL..HES AMAZING
1558908846|5.0|a great price for this movie, good quality widescreen, great lines spoken like, 'i knew you'd say that' and 'double whammy'
B000V86OKG|5.0|THIS SERIES IS ONE THAT SHOULD BE LABLED AMAZING. DEXTER IS ONE OF THE MOST EXPOLSIVE SERIES ON TELEVEISION TODAY
B005GFPZYK|3.0|This book definitely did not live up to the hype. Although I have the greatest respect for Mr. Kyle and all Navy SEALs for what they do for our country, an author he is not. Way too much fluff and not enough of what the premise of the book is supposed to be about. There was very little sniper action described. If you want to read a great book about a sniper, read &#34;Marine Sniper&#34; about Carlos Hathcock in Vietnam. Much better book.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|THIS SEASON IS EXPLOSIVE AND WILL KEEP YOU ON YOUR FEET. I LOVE THIS SERIES AND CANT WAIT FOR THE REST OF THEM TO COME OUT...
B00AQMQBKK|4.0|Elder Sign is a well known light dice game. I love the art of this version. The rules are far too complex for what it actually is and I wish that the game didn't make me play out the parts where it wasn't possible to win. The graphics are the best of any game Ive played on the kindle. My only complaint is that the game is way too easy. Anyone with a good background in board games should be able to \\"figure out\\" the game with little effort. Still its a fun time burner good for a plane ride. Recommended!
B000DN5W4I|5.0|I LOVE JOE...HE IS THE MOST AMAZING THING TO HIT MUSIC IN QUITE SOME TIME. HE IS FULL OF TALENT. THIS IS AN EARLY DISPLAY OF HIS TALENTS...YOU WILL LOVE THIS IF YOU LIKE BLUES
B00AQM8H9I|4.0|Hey that's my fish is a light abstract strategy game. This version is pretty dang good. There's no setup time like the physical game and it supports multiplayer. The scores are tallied for you mid game and the animations are great. Some cons are that you must finish clicking every ice tile even if you are the last surviving Penguin in a block. The animations are also kind of slow. The game doesn't make you wait for them to complete but it still bugs me. Overall its worth the money if you like the board game. Great for flights!
B005FISBV2|5.0|LOVE THIS SERIES...ONE OF THE BEST SERIES ON TV..CANT WAIT FOR NECT SEASON...DONT EVERY WANT THIS TO END...ALTHOUGH I KNOW THATS IMPOSSIBLE
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Great game enjoyed playing so I purchased the add free application recommend it for children and adults. Colors are good and I found this game easy to play. My three year old granddaughter loves the sounds and flying birds

B00377V6J2|5.0|THE DUO OF THE ALBERT AND STEVIE IS AMAZING. THESE GUYS ARE TWO OF THE BEST AROUND. BOUGHT IT FOR MY BOYFRIEND AND HE LOVES IT
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I've read so many holocaust stories over the years from the author's individual standpoint. Ken's perspective in Winter of the World, as Hitler comes into power and tensions rise and the terror of what is about to happen builds, is completely new and so well written-you feel like you're there, living in this same helpless nightmare...Incredible and dramatic.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|THIS SEASON IS EXPLOSIVE AND WILL KEEP YOU ON YOUR FEET. I LOVE THIS SERIES AND CANT WAIT FOR THE REST OF THEM TO COME OUT...

B002SR2PKG|5.0|I RECEIVED THIS HARDBACK BACK IN 1983...at 25 yrs old as a way to fight boredom while on medical leave....i fell in love with the characters as kids and felt like i grew up with them in the book. VERY WELL written..everything written had a meaning and keeps you in suspense until the finale...now at me being 52 yrs old and reading it..realized alot of little things i missed or overlooked back then..understood alot more.<br />Thanx Stephen

B008JGSM6G|5.0|There are ads. And the packs that come with the game are limited. That said, the game is highly addictive and I can't stop playing.
0061992860|5.0|This product is very very useful...has a ton of useful information in it and fits nicely into a side pouch of my BAIL out bag...I still have room  in the pouch also...very very pleased

B00004Z4WR|5.0|Nicholas Cage is already a good actor...and Angelina Jolie just adds the touch this movie needs to make this a good film.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I bought this just to add onto an order to get Free Super Saver shipping for another item.<br />I already had a couple of Verizon car chargers, one dual port.<br />This one seems able to handle both charging a Nexus7.2 tablet and a Verizon Galaxy Nexus or a Nexus4, any two at a time.<br />Does not heat up and the cables I supply to connect with it don't wiggle loose.<br /><br />Anker continues to impress me with their battery and charging products.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|MY BOYFRIEND AND I LOVE THIS SERIES..I CANT WAIT TO ORDER THE SECOND SEASON AND START GETTING DEEPER INTO THE PLOT...WAS AS DESCRIBED AND SHIPPED FAST
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I watched dispicable me and dispicable me2 in theaters and loved it when I found this app I was extatic! this is must see movie and a must get game please read this before buying this game!:)
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Good game, however it froze on me during a great run and force closed. if this was to keep happpening I could see me not playing anymore. Hopefully it was only once! Fun game though, worth a try.
B003L8GPT8|5.0|This LP is Awesome and I am very happy with it. I got it in very quick time and have enjoyed every second of listening.
B00B89LZ4C|3.0|They deliberately open the packaging so there is no future value.  I should have sent it back and got my money back.
B0055HVDZO|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite albums. I'm super excited to have it again and love listening to it in vinyl. Thank you for the great product and service
B009RH9HDS|4.0|I love the color .  I got the Orange to match the word fire.<br />Do not like that it slips out of the case easy. I do like the elastic to keep the case closed.
B004SIP6WW|5.0|Cop Land is one of those movies that you just like to watch when you're in the right mood, especially for me on a dark overcast day.  Very enjoyable.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Love the book.  So hard to put down spend my lunch hour at work engrossed in its pages.  Cant wait to read the next book.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|great story line with fantastic characters all developed so nicely.. keeps you on the edge of your chair and very hard to put down
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a fun game that helps keep the brain active, The game is also helping me to learn how to use my Kindle.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|Just can not believe these things still occur in the world!!  Written very well and can really get a feel for the protagonist and his ongoing psychological trama.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|The UTUBE viewer and downloader works well with the Kindle. Occasionally the video pauses are annoying, but I expect them with my relatively slow system.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|great book and so well written. Even though a fiction after having read Escape from camp 14.. you realize so many things in the book are true! One of my favorite books!!!!!! Fantastic story!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|A fun game and an interesting way to check out the IM3 armors. A bit repetitive though. It's free so check it out.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I just can not  wait for more levels. I'm sorry its over. Very challenging without being impossible. Nice music and graphic.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Engrossing book that explored the relationship between two teens that grew up so emotionally linked that they felt each others pain. This book keeps the reader involved as well,
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's so addictive I still can't beat meana but that's what makes it so fun lol overall I love love love this game and u should too
B001UZHBY2|5.0|I love Kurt Vonnegut and have read all his books numerous times. this one is a great sort of mid-life coming of age tale, looking at family and history and context and life in general being based on how one approaches it . I highly recommend.
1616550414|5.0|Love me some Zelda related merch! Great book for people who are fans of the series! Would have been nice if the few months later &#34;discovered art&#34; was a part of this.
B009WUBERW|5.0|I liked all the 80s action stars in this movie. I like the special effects and interaction between these old starts which leads to many funny scenes in the movie. This movie is for the fan that likes the good guys winning in the end.
B002RPR6DU|3.0|Just short on plot but classic film for its day, purchased for nostalgic reasons the robots and transports are really cool.
B009E9R1IM|5.0|records are very well mastered for vinyl playing. if you like Led Zeppelin and vinyl, just go and buy it!
B002SGYPS2|4.0|Shows Jim Carrey in a different kind of role. He is both serious and funny in this movie.  It's definitely worth watching.
B004CURZFC|5.0|Great story line and great visuals.  The owls seem so life-like.  I would recommend this movie for anyone who has a vivid imagination and loves a great story telling movie.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Great app that has a lot of variety. the tonal beats for sleep are absolutely amazing. they have helped me get to sleep, as well as have deeper, more restful sleep. which is good since usually I'm sucha light sleeper.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Very intriguing and kept me wanting to read more. Loved Eliza`s free spirit and how she believed in herself. Plan to read more of her books.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I never read books.. about a year ago someone got me started on the hunger games and i have just now finished mockingjay... i would recommend this book to anyone... it always had me wanting more but because of time issues i had to wait months in between books. Please read all 3 books, they are AMAZING!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun game for everyone,  you personalize you own horse and stables.  Good mini games to keep your horse going.  East way to earn gems to get cool items for your horse.  Recommended.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I was really sorry I downloaded this...It's not a game.  It's only a help guide on how to play the game.  I think it's misleading
B00127RAJY|5.0|Best workout ever, she works you so hard, but the results are wonderful. Just a couple of days and I can tell my endurance is improving already.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|This is alot of fun...give it a try.  Really makes you think but in a good way!  Once you start...you can't stop!

B008B3MZNI|1.0|image and quality very bad, seems video with much interference, I do not know why you send blu ray defective,no relation to customers , is bad reputation ,I am very upset , I am pay for brend new ,not for used or defective
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great game for the whole family. Nothing very complicated to this app, just guess where to place a coin &amp; hope for the best. Easier than the real carnival game for sure, you at least win a prize for your efforts.  Win carnival rides, prizes from side show games, &amp; you'll reach an even higher level.  You can all play one game &amp; nobody losses.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This alarm clock app is very helpful in the morning especially on school days. I just want to thank the creators of this app because they helped my kindle become a multi-purpose tablet.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so fun. Envoy playng it people of any age can enjoy it. It is much better than the demo
B006LSZECO|5.0|One surprise after another.  Hard to put down.  Not too happy with the ending, but that's life.  Read it on vacation and will read more by this author.
B00004SPYJ|5.0|This was the best production of Shakespear's story that I've ever seen done. I've loved reading shakespeheare for as long as I an remember. Franco Zefferilli took two children, Leonard Whitting 17 and Olivia Hussey 16 and kept them in time period costumes and speech.
B000P407K4|5.0|For the cold war kids who hid beneath their desks in grade school while the sirens blew, (and I was one}, this movie is the epitome of gallows humor. When you are faced with the reality of &#34;it's the end of the world as we know it&#34;, then all you can fight back with is humor. And this movie fights back. It makes fun, sarcastically, sardonically, deeply and darkly at the institutions that brought us (bring us?) to the brink. That these institutions are political, military, governmental, and nationalism versus nationalism, is not a random choice, what other institutions are capable of catastrophe at this level. Three actors raise the bar to heights that have not since been exceeded, Peter Sellers, George C. Scott, and Sterling Hayden. This movie also sealed  Stanley Kubrick's reputation as an all time great director with a unique world view and the ability to deliver iot to the screen.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I just did not get this book. Was certainly not my favourite and would not recommend.  Stories never seem to end and characters were confusing.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Fantastic writing and story lines. I started watching old seasons on TNT and had to watch the newest to catch up before the new season starts. Absolutely love it!
B008VVT51U|4.0|A great cast in a unique environment confront some of the real challenges of aging in a very endearing and engaging way. The plot is somewhat predictable, but my entire family enjoyed it none-the-less. Certainly worth the time!
B0095MVOMC|5.0|Very challenging!!!  A unique game that takes already neat and interesting pictures and adds a twist.  Should come with more puzzles.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|I have lots of fun with this app, but it updated and deleted my whole world when I was level 15
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|The game art, attitude, &amp; gameplay is excellent. So far, I have just played the first 4-5 courses...it looks like it's going to be more a lightweight fun solitaire with fun tweaks, not serious or difficult solitaire game. That's fine with me, if I want &quot;serious&quot; solitaire there are many other games!
B003DNN0L2|5.0|What is it about his movies that I find so charming? I'm not ordinarily nostalgic for my childhood but his movies put me right back in that place. Such lovely, charming, funny and fulfilling films. This is no exception. Great performances by this all star cast.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This battery app is very useful for a quick reference to find how much the kindle has charged. Nice not to have to go to settings to check.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Being a wife is hard enough without being subjected to public humility and shame, becoming a suddenly single mother and bearing the stain of what her husband has done not only in his work (allegedly) but on a personal level. Julianna Margulies handles the role with grace and style in the face of great adversity and is quietly taking it a day at a time. Her skill as an actress is most evident in the quiet moments when anyone having been in a similar situation can relate and shows the power of love between a husband and wife and the ties that bind.
B000OLROWC|4.0|We watched this movie for the second time with our grand children.  They really enjoyed the movie and talked about it for days.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|The game can be addicting. It is a good game. Keep updating it. The last updates made it even better.
B002N1AEN2|4.0|XX is a band that I always eyed their cd, heard some great reviews about them and the cd. I didn't buy it till a year after it's release when i came accross a few of their music videos and became a fan right away. It's very relaxing music sort of gloopy trip hop and the use of electronic beats and drum machines. The guitar work both bass and guitar are very simple but are played beautifully. The lyrics are descent, all love songs, which is not a bad thing XX makes their music a very enjoyable listen.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If you like the movie you'll like the game. Mario type hopping and jumping game, should keep the kids occupied. But it's &#34;free&#34;<br />because they want real $$$$$ to unlock features, so I'm not sure you'd want to leave your kids alone to run up a bill.
B000000WJK|5.0|The Verve, sadly this band isn't known very well as bands like OASIS, BLUR, etc which is well sad, one reason is RICHARD ASHCROFT possibly one of the greatest singers in the rock genre in the past 20 years. While most people know The Verve cause of \\"BITTERSWEET SYMPHONY\\" and the \\"URBAN HYMNS\\" album, they just havent heard the masterpiece of A STORM IN HEAVEN, one album that i like to say it's one of those perfect albums. This album has more of a psychedelic feel to it with lots of crunchy guitars and is so messy but done perfectly. A STORM IN HEAVEN isn't necessarily the typical britpop album but it's a very insteresting listen and it's far different then their later sound, any fan of rock music will enjoy A STORM IN HEAVEN.
1427205264|4.0|I just finished reading the book for the 2nd time in twenty-five years in anticipation of the movie to be released in November this year.  I often by the cd's after reading the book to reinforce my memory and knowledge of the characters and storyline.
B008B11R1Q|4.0|While their debut album was a great album, their second album \\"COEXIST\\" offers just about the same as their previous, there is nothing new, no experimentation, which is one complain i have. COEXIST is a good album but if your expecting something new you won't.
1883217040|2.0|Disclaimer: I learned Jazz Harmony at Berklee and unavoidably talk about it with that terminology. I don't mean to suggest by doing so that that is the only way that Jazz Harmony can be written about or talked about, and don't wish to leave the impression that my criticism of this book is sourced in it not being done the way Berklee does it. Part of my reason for reading this book was to try to get outside of the Berklee mindset to be able to better communicate with musicians who didn't go through that program. To that end this was a useful and good book, however my criticisms below remain.<br /><br />I bought this book on the strength of Randy Vincent's Drop 2 Book for Guitar which was based on Levine's treatment of Drop 2 voicings for Piano book. In retrospect I wish I had saved my money. While there is a fair amount that is useful in this book, there are long sections that are inexplicably given over to subjects that have little to do with Theory. In particular the end of the book gives over dozens of pages to an index of standards that is both incomplete and self-serving to the publisher as it lists page numbers drawn from Sher Music's inferior series of fake \\"Real Book\\" collections and doesn't bother to reference the fake books most players are likely to have, either the actual illegal Real Book, or the Mel Bay licensed version which holds to the pagination of its illegal predecessors. There is more of this too. Long lists of recommended recordings and listening that, while probably correct in that anyone who wants to seriously study jazz should be familiar with, have more to do with ear training or performance than they do with theory.<br /><br />And what theory there is, is unfortunately incomplete and at times incomplete to the point of verging on incorrect. To begin with, any book on Jazz theory needs to necessarily deal with the various divisions in symbolizations. Because a lot of Jazz analysis built up in different places with people who weren't necessarily communicating with eachother, there are different ways to write fundamental stuff that are used by different folks. Ideally a book on theory would cover all of these: New York vs. Nashville, East Coast vs. West Coast, Berklee vs. Every Other Music School, and Jazz vs. Common Practice Period analysis all create differences in nomenclature and symbology that a good book on theory ought to address. Not only does this book give short shrift to these differences with a mere note that \\"different people do things different ways\\" the publication adopts it's own ideosyncratic approach to chords and harmonic analysis rather than sticking to one of the more well-defined practices such as Common Practice Period or Berklee's Harmony notation which, even if not the most familiar to every Jazz musician at least has the benefit of consistency and completeness.<br /><br />Additionally there are problems that stem from sloppiness or laziness. For example, in his discussion of modality, there is no real discussion of how modal harmony works or is different from the tonal and multi-tonal harmony that dominates 90% of jazz practice. The approach taken here is much more aimed at the improviser than the composer, and the book adopts the shorthand too common among jazz musicians of confusing modes with chord scales. These sorts of errors, while they won't matter to a player who wants to know what scales he can draw notes from over an sequence of extended dominant progressions with interpolated two - fives, it will not assist the theoretical analysis of the moving tonal roots and tonalities of each key of the moment, and can only serve to confuse matters while aiding and abetting the left over artifact of the Bebop eras preference for 6 chords in its reliance on the dorian mode in minor harmony, something that often leads intermediate and even advanced players away from fruitful opportunities in modal options that are more interesting that shoehorning a major 6th into the chord scale ofevery minor chord whether it takes it or not. In it's place every minor chord becomes a component of a II-V progression whether that's actually what's happening harmonically or not. These are the sorts of errors that happen not because of what this book says, but because of what it leaves out, failing to address these sorts of lazy compromises that are common shortcuts used by performers with an incomplete grasp of the various possibilities of standard tonal and modal harmony.<br /><br />Finally, the organization of the book leaves something to be desired as well as the space constraints given. The discussion of chords and scales could be much longer, and there is short shrift given to several more advanced concepts like polychords, hybrid chords, and the possibilities of chord voicing and voice leading with inversions are all lumped together as \\"slash chords\\" a term that is given the short and completely inadequate description that it's \\"an instruction to the piano player of what chord to be played over a bass note.\\" guide tone lines are discussed but only described rather than give a full explanation as to why they work. subdominant minor chord function and other modal substitutions are touched on in the section on reharmonization but are not dealt with in any systematic sort of way. Coltrane style constant structure chord progression, cluster based harmony, and quartal harmony are neither discussed nor included in the index, and if mentioned are only obliquely treated by the text. At the same time there are huge sections on practice (any important topic but one that is traditionally the opposite subject matter and complement to Theory, which the title of this book promises) and overly long treatments of both Rhythm Changes and the Giant Steps progression, both of which are interesting important subjects in Jazz theory but that shouldn't be given as much space as they are compared to more fundamental concepts that are only briefly treated.<br /><br />THese sections are good, and well done, and the section on Rhythm Changes is probably the best part of this book. However, whole books have been written on Giant Steps and this book cuts an uncomfortable middle ground between a brief mention of progressions by thirds and an explantion of how that was used in Giant Steps, which is really all that is necessary in a book on theory such as this, and a book length treatment of the progression for a performer, which in order to be truly useful really should probably be instrument specific like Wolf Marshalls book on Giant Steps for guitar or David Demsey's transcriptions of Coltrane's Giant Steps solo written for Saxophones put out by Hal Leonard. By splitting the difference, this book presents both too much and too little about Giant steps.<br /><br />Along with the section on Rhythm Changes, the section on pentatonic scales and blues harmony are also quite good and because these are less involved topics are much more complete than other sections. If the rest of the book were up to the standards of those sections and there were much less filler involved with the literally dozens and dozens of pages of unecessary bibliography of standards which is not what I buy a theory book to acquire, I would probably give it three and a half or four stars. As it stands I feel like I wasted a lot of money and got a lot less than was promised in a book of this size. There are better and more complete books on Jazz Music Theory, and I would not recommend this book for anyone other than a curious completist with a solid understanding of Jazz already who was interested in seeing a slightly idiosyncratic approach. Even at that, however, buy it used because there is much in here that is throway and the ratio of information to pages is not high enough to justify the page count given in the description.every minor chord whether it takes it or not.

B000000WF0|5.0|I simply love this band, from their early work to URBAN HYMNS they seem to always make great music and expand as musicians and songwriters, i've always said RICHARD ASHCROFT is a f****** genius with an amazing voice and one of the best singers  of the past 2 decades. The Verve are not recognized too much like big 90s bands RADIOHEAD, OASIS, BLUR, etc and don't get much credit for what they do, and i'm sure that was one reason why the band split up after this, reunited and split again. To me they are a band that should have been at the same level as 90s pioneers OASIS, BLUR, but they just didn't, and it's weird to me. Urban Hymns the bands most popular album all cause of \\"BITTERSWEET SYMPHONY\\" and trust me that is not the bands best song and if you think so then your not an actual fan of the verve and you haven't really listen to this iconic band. \\"Drugs Dont Work\\" one of my favorite songs of all time \\"Sonnet\\" such catchy melody in this song and great instrumentation and Richard's amazing vocals \\"Velvet Morning\\" is another great Verve track has the early verve sound. Overall this is my second favorite VERVE album but if you happen to come accross this album buy it you won't regret it, if your new to the verve it's also a great introduction it pretty much covers what the verve is all about, it is a legendary album and a great one too.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This was my first hidden object game; I wish it had not because it spoiled me for others. There is a bit of running back and forth but it makes the game more interesting.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Would have definitely given this game a full 5 stars, but I was still ready for more when it ended all too soon!
B003FIUTA0|5.0|How I wish everyone could watch this ..<br />a time honored faith shows a remarkable change that should have happened<br />back then but somehow did not stay stable.<br />None the less ,it is timely for now concerning racial division ... you'll see why<br />when you watch this movie .<br />At one point I was on the edge of my seat !<br />NOTHING BORING HERE ...a little slow getting started but then it's powerful<br />work begins !
B00D02Z1EA|5.0|August Burns Red is one of the most talented bands in their genre. Hands down. They've outdone themselves with this new album. Fantastic melodies, lyrics, and heavy as hell.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Better operation then first magic academy. More problems to solve and different types of puzzles to solve. Best part is getting it as free app of the day.
B00B2DSK06|5.0|I HAVE NOT WATCH THIS MY DAUGHTER SAID IT WAS REAL GOOD, WISH I COULD TELL YOU MORE, I DO NOT WATCH MANY CARTOONS.
B00785P2QC|4.0|It's a really great game never freezes or screw up<br />I would tell everyone about this game to at least try it
B0031R5K68|3.0|Seams quiet unreal, as you read on it seams inpossible to fil the pages to the ends.<br />Story keeps carring on.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|I love all of the reacher books. they are easy to follow and give great detail.  This is a good book
B0055PMJMW|3.0|A quick filler by Mr. Connelly, if you will. These are 3 short stories. I enjoyed the first one. The other two are OK. But they end rather abruptly without fanfare. It's almost as if the reader says: \\"Yeah, so?\\" No real twists, no climax; just the end. The stories aren't bad at all. The conclusions leave something to be desired. They make for a quickie read. But they certainly are not up to what one expects from Mr. Connelly.<br /><br />Some readers seem to feel shortchanged, not realizing these were short stories. I don't understand why. The book's description states three Harry Bosch stories. It also states a length of 105 pages. That, in and of itself, tells you they are short stories.<br /><br />What I did find irksome and selling the reader short was the Kindle version ends at a mere 72%. Reach that point and you're finished. Meaning over 25% is devoted to a preview of a full length novel. I'm sorry, that is shortchanging the reader. This happens somewhat frequently. But at less than 3/4 the way through and, without warning, your done. This reaches a new plateau in ending early.
B00884GR0W|3.0|This game is something fans of minecraft and survival craft should try. It is like those games but different. Minecraft doesnt have goblins, sky kingdoms, or atlantis, but we all wish it did. I only wish there was some kind of backstory or explanation of what to do and how to grt certain things and what hades and stuff is. I was exploring a cave and got caught completely off guard by a n earthquake! Now thats the kind of stuff they should explain to you. The recipe book isnt much help. But all around block story is a different twist on blocky games. It is worth the money! ;)
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I really am enjoying this book and am anxious to see the movie based on it,despite the fact the movie differs considerably from the novel(or so I've heard!).The books style works for me-the separate interviews keep the story fresh and allow the author to tell the story from multiple perspectives.It is honestly the first book in years I've had trouble putting down...I have to add I am only half way through,but I have no reason to believe I will like it any less!
B006LXQID8|5.0|This was a great movie, very artsy and fun. I didn't know what to expect, but I wish I'd seen it sooner!
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|See above<br />One gets a glimp of Afgahanistan - and it is a story of a friendship and loyalty<br />too.
B00BP29SAA|2.0|my nephew likes the Dr. panda hospital one - that one has lots for him to do... this one doesn't seem to have to many games to play.  kept him busy for awhile - but I think more little games should be offered.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show and that it shows a wealthy family that can be taken down by the knees at any point. It is a true family life story set in a perfect era!
B004FHP9KA|4.0|This movie is one of a kind, it keeps you thinking even for hours after the movie has ended.<br /><br />Must watch
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Fun so far! Only on level 4 but enjoying it. Took a bit to get the hang of it but catching on now.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|this movie is a good not great movie, good watch when you have nothing else to do lat at night
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love that there is a timer and binaural beats. Listening to this is so.peaceful and puts me to sleep very quickly.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Great book  a very interesting and thought provoking story based on history and one of the most dangerous times in history. It is so difficult to imagine how brutal and devastating the 2nd world  was for those of us who were not even born then.
6305161976|5.0|Takes place in a time when non-white actors were few an far between, but this fact has nothing to do with the movie.<br />Oh yes it does; French Morocco or is it Colonial Morocco? I only say this due to having many friends from Casa, Rabat, and Fez.....and yes, Dooley Wilson was a bigger star than he thought. Where were the Moroccans? Enough of my speak.<br /><br />A love story that could have been &#34;sappy,&#34; but neither was it an action movie. A drama that tickled my fancy for history, geography, and political science.
B0050DIWHU|5.0|This guy are top notch when writes do read more from him I sure will in the future. Count me in.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is so ridiculously well written. The way that Suzzane Collins paces this book is perfect. Every chapter wants me to keep reading more. Such a page turner and an amazing book.
B0042RUMIW|5.0|arrived much, much quicker than i thought and in perfect condition.<br />it was a bday present for my husband and he loves it :-)
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I really like this game a LOT! After playing it I really want to go and see the Oregon Trail....A MUST HAVE GAME LIKE TOTALLY GET IT NOW DON'T WAIT!!!!! :D
B009AMANBA|5.0|I was surprised at how much I actually liked this movie. I bought it as a gift for the hubs. He's into history and war movies and honestly, that's not my style of movie, as I tend to be more drawn to character driven movies. Daniel Day-Lewis was exceptional and the screenplay was impressive. The writers did a nice job of embedding character into Lincoln, whereas a lot of writers focus on biography. Great supporting roles/characters as well.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|I have 33 photo editing apps on my GS 3. This would be my first &quot;paid&quot; app, although I got it as my FAOTD. As a free app, absolutely worth the download. Would I have been disappointed if I had paid for it? Absolutely.<br /><br />There are tons of apps out there that are free with more fonts, more features,  and zero cost. I've been known to use up to six different apps to get the final product I'm looking for,  hence the 33 various editing apps.<br /><br />How I wish an app would come with just tons and tons of amazing fonts and features that would set it apart from the others. Until then I'm just glad I have 64 gb of space on my phone!
B009FBX5M0|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie and mostly because of the blend of great music with a very well done classic Bond adventure.  Listening to the soundtrack will take you right back to those great sense in the movie.
B000J159N8|5.0|This was an exception portrayal of combat action in Vietnam and the tactic employed.  I'd rate this as good if not better then the movie \\"Platoon\\".  Mel Gibson was great as were all the supporting actors.  It was very violent, so it's not for the faint heated!  I'd recommend to to any one who enjoys war movies.  Historically it might be a little of an exaggeration, but I though it showed the reality of the war.
3836509032|5.0|A great example of design and specification reviews. A great book to have and use as a coffee table discussion
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Amazing look at Lincoln, the civil war and a cabinet that made history. Easy to read and well done look at the era.
B003TOH8AE|1.0|This movie was so dumb I couldn't even finish it.  I waited forever for them to get to the point, but it seems like they never did.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|it rocks the jeep is awesome.it would be more awesome if they make prices more realistic.it would be cool if there was airplanes and helicopters and air maps.but still its the best raceing game around!
B000P5FG1I|5.0|I am very pleased with the physical album (which is the original print and cover of the British version). it goes without saying that Back To Black is a modern classic. I plan on keeping this record mint, unopened; it will bring me years of pleasure. OMG I LOVE THIS ALBUM OMG I LOVE AMY WINEHOUSE REST IN PEACE! LOVE - RETRODUDE
B008P1EWIM|4.0|For my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; this is a good app to have around. Always able to check weather fast where ever I am at.
B005H9B2CE|4.0|I enjoyed the importance of moral character Thor portrayed,  The was humorous, romantic, nice action but starting out is boring.
B008I43DYU|5.0|Great Calculator. It will do much more than I am capable of doing with it. Nice app to have on a tablet. Never without a calculator. And like I said, it will due much more than add and subtract, much more.
B00CS65QGW|5.0|This song is fun and fast pace. Its excellent for working out, doing chores, cooking, walking, or just hanging out.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Great book! It was very informative, opened my eyes. I have passed this information along to my family members. My brother who has been over weight for years has begun to shed unwanted pounds, and regain his health.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|my kids really enjoy this game.  the first upgrades require a reasonable investment of time and made it more fun.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|This app gives me a starting point when I want to find something! I've already used it a dozen times and only had it less than a day.
B005IKZSYA|4.0|This is the story of a Pope, elected to office who can't handle the job.  It sounds like it could be a drama or a comedy and in fact it is a bit of both, yet both aspects of the movie are subtle.  The humor is soft and understated, the drama is subtle with excellent acting from the lead character.  Being Italian, many the ins and outs and processes of Vatican life are revealed and the whole situation is handled with tact and compassion.  Wondering how they will resolve the issues keeps you guessing until the end.  Very good DVD.
B0031TZ8TU|4.0|Book brings a nice blend of facts and fiction with a story that is very much engaging and that also provides historical context.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I enjoyed the acting of the actors involved.  Good story line.  Would recommend this movie for those who enjoy action movies.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Love this app!!  I love how it indicates how much battery time is remaining by function ---reading a book, surfing the net, watching videos, etc.  The graphics are great, too! Highly recommend!
B0074VTHKM|3.0|I didn't care for the ending but overall have read most of John Grishams books. I likw the law theme.
1451695195|5.0|I really like this book. The book is written well, warm and hopeful. I would rather give the book than a sympathy card.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|I LIKED THIS BOOK BETTER THAN \\"Enders Game\\",  but they're both excellent reading!  I guess because game was about the dark side of our natures, and speaker was  as Lincoln said,  about the better angels of our nature!  A movie about the crusades I recently saw again, (For the fifteenth time) had the main character address his soldiers  to rise above the brutality of life by  a simple credo, \\"Speak the truth, even if it leads to your death\\"!  And so, to my thinking, a Speaker for the Dead, is something I find idealism!  Peace!
B000UZQI0Q|4.0|...but it doesn't surpass the original.  If you enjoyed the first book, you will continue to enjoy the Mistborn world.  If you didn't like it much, this second book does offer more in the way of politics and internal struggle than the first, as well as exploring some of the &#34;fantastic&#34; elements of this universe.
B00BUAEYVK|2.0|didn't really care for it, tried to watch it, ended up skipping over chunks and backing up. think I got most of it, not very interesting, lots of gun battles, vehicle crashes, and explosions; not believable that in the midst of the chaos John would be trying to connect with and have meaningful conversations with his son, too much going on for that scenario to be believable, too noisy for characters to be conversating (other than perhaps saying duck or run).  liked the idea of adult children of the hero and the villain backing up their dads, but that was the only unusual element I remember.  acting was fine.  2 and a half stars.
0446573027|3.0|As much as I enjoy Baldacci's books, they are starting to seem a little cookie cutter to me, I hate to say.<br />The renegade protagonist, and a series of plot twists that seem to keep going deeper and deeper, and with each turn seem to be just that much more far fetched.<br /><br />Some times they are believable, while, others they are a little predictable.<br /><br />I'll give this series a chance though, and pick up the next book
B00B769XB8|2.0|didn't care for it, lots of fighting/violence aimed at witches (women) so lots of beating on women characters and just don't enjoy that type of entertainment.  witch makeup great, though most of the bad witches looked very similar, with varying wigs. the acting was fine, just didn't like the story, though an interesting beginning. when scenes shot on the forest set, really fake looking, I could tell when they were filming in an actual forest, versus when they were filming on a forest set. characters were fighting machines, not really fleshed out. didn't really get to know any of the kids rescued. just not a well told story. liked edward.  2 and a half stars.
0525953728|4.0|I commend the SEALS that went in and took out Osama.  It was a tale of heroism and great historical value.<br /><br />As I read through this, I felt like I was there with the SEAL team as they were moving through the compound.  It gave me chills when they ID'd the body as Osama<br /><br />I think this is a worth while book to read, to learn about what the SEALS are all about
B0001RVP88|3.0|A tear jerker at the end. I cried even though I already knew what the outcome would be. It's a tragic true story.
0060873175|5.0|Michael Crichton is simply brilliant.  Once again he paints a scary, realistic picture of what could be.  He raises the questions once more as scientists and humans, \\"not can we do this? but Should we do this?\\"<br /><br />In Micro, the villan is taking unsuspecting young scientists and transforms them into people, smaller than bugs.<br /><br />It is supsenseful, descriptive and very powerful.  We are lucky as readers to have this book, following his death.  I can only hope that there are one or two more unpublished novels yet to come.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|A true masterpiece.  It speaks for itself.  It's been on the charts forever.  I guess we won't be hearing much from Adele soon, because &#34;Adele&#34; is about heartbreak and she is now happy.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|This is such a fun game of golf solitaire and very addicting!  I love the graphics and the animation. Fun game for sure!
B000JMKTLO|3.0|This is weakest of her three books. The main character is in so much pain, it is hard to get past. The plot is so sad and the outcome in the end is even more so.
B00413QB5A|5.0|The chase is on to find the real Modigliani.  This is a very interesting story that keeps you turning the pages to find out the answer.  Do not peek at the conclusion.  You may be surprised.  The ending was a little abrupt for me, but I loved it anyway.
B002VRZEYM|4.0|I thought this was a very informative documentary on what in really happening in our food industry today.  I'm glad I watched it and recommend it for anyone who wants to know what is really going on with what you're putting in your mouth.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this game is not only fun but also educational in the art of horse care, it is simple and easy to use, everyone should play this game.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|The game is very similar to diablo. Its justmuch simpler, and without all theextra crap blizzard has injected into their games lately.I
B0028IDXDS|5.0|My baby is in love with these wubbanubs!  The monkey is realllllly cute!  This was actually our 2nd monkey we bought.  We lost the first and had to have another.  We also have the giraffe, turtle, dinosaur, and new brights dinosaur, and brights lion.  All of them are darling.  Worked perfectly when he was little to help hold it in his mouth. Now, he is a year and he can find them in his crib easily if we wakes up.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book starts out a little slow. I thought I was going to be bored. But, it was a fabulous read! I loved the last chapter. Awesome!!!!
B008Y74B10|5.0|Anyone who got got bitten by the 2008 financial collapse should watch this documentary to see how corrupt and poorly regulated the financial industry can be.  Any one who didn't should already be in jail or in Congress!! In all my days  I have never seen such a revelation. Charles Ferguson should have gotten the Nobel Prize for Economics  and a Pulitzer for producing this docu-drama.
B002BWP49C|5.0|This DVD is rated as a 5 star because of the quality and the pricing.  My grand-daughter is into the Twilight Saga and collects all of the DVD's.  We had recorded this Part 1 but somehow our DVD was reformatted and we lost it which necessitated going to Amazon for a replacement.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|I rarely read books by Nicholas Sparks since i find them sappy sweet and overly predicable. This story sounded as though it may be a little bit different from his usual theme and sounded interesting when I read the blurb. I did enjoy the story and the enmeshment with the after life. The ending, I am sad to say...was predictable.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this series.  Once I started I couldn't put it down.  I can't wait until the new movie comes out.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Game is very challenging and keeps you hooked.  You will want to keep playing until you solve it.  Sound effects are very effective and add to the atmosphere.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|[posted by my daughter]  If your looking for a app like temple run, this is awesome for kindle fire and just fun to play so get as soon as you can.
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|I love it, the grandkids love it.  Truthfully, I could spend too much time with the great designs I am making.  I feel like a artist!  This is so relaxing-perfect to play a bit while on a boring flight.  Then fill in with a book on my Kindle.  Glad I got it free, but I would even pay for it.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this is the best game ever I love how it is made because of shark week and pepole how don't like this game or even any games don't say anything because If you don't have anything nice to say don't say any thing
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love the game, but sometimes it's a little difficult to raise money and earn diamonds. But other than that, it's fun, realistic, and great for passing time.
0060574216|5.0|Everyone should read this including all men.  EXCELLENT!  This is not a book to decorate your book case but should be opened and a few lines read every so often.
B002AWX6UM|3.0|That it is a good book but too much battles and people dying.... People that is in High School. Yupp
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Once started you had to read the trilogy, at least I had to keep going.  It was a good read and it tied up the story with some surprises and imagination.  Characters remained true.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one of my favorite and most addictive game I've ever played before I know any age will enjoy this game.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|well written from the dogs point of view. Heartwarming.. Wonderful story...what more can i say? I loved reading it and was sad when it ended...happy ending though
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like to play minecraft on the computer and on x box 360 I really like to play minecraft pocket edition<br />I like it more than x box or pc edition
B00B7Y0206|4.0|Sure it is good it was a little fun and very cool to have to git it.<br />Lol I would like to suggest
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It is a really good game I think everyone should have it-one of those temple run/subway surfers game really fun
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I thought this would be a stupid app but it really isn't. It's very convenient. I like to be able to know what percent I'm at and see how much longer it will last. Very great thing to have.
0060723513|5.0|This book was such an eye opener.  I did not know the Aborigines were so superior in their values and morales.  We have so much to learn from them.  What a tragedy they have suffered.  They have a powerful message and I hope the world listens.  I will be ordering more books.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book is fantastic. Every day when I read it it was  I was taken inside the world of  katniss evergreen and peers Millard. It was like thriller exiting things in every page !!!!!!!!!!!! : ) : ) : ) : ) : ) : ) : ) : ) : ) : )  : ): ) : ) : ): ) : ) : ) : ) :).
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game ever . I think you should buy this game. You could build things, fight zombies and skeletons. There are caves with spiders. Plus, the game updates for free! I think you should get this game.
B00991TCOG|3.0|Little modernistic in the backgound music, but, Lindsey Stirling is a good musician, with the music she plays on her fiddle.
B00CWV8X04|4.0|The acting is great overall, though CZJ and CT don't have much to do; Roony Mara and Jude Law are both terrific. The buildup to where we finally put together what's going on is well done, but the conclusion seem hurried and there were parts we had to re-run more than once to catch the dialogue/gist of what was going on. At the end it (quickly) gets wrapped up in a neat little package for the hero, which seemed overly pat (villains punished appropriately--and quickly!), but it was satisfying for the most part--nice lighting, nice music--for a digital movie night at home on the couch.
B000FCKC4C|4.0|It's undoubtedly an enchanting story about a boy who pursues his dreams. There are unexpected twists that make it even more interesting. My only reservations are you need to be religious to find the story plausible.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|So this toy is 34.99 on the Lego site and at the stores but unavailable because of demand, back orders etc. So what does Amazon do? it becomes greedy and rips off its customers by charging 23.00 more. I guess if you can get it more power to you but a little surprised but mostly just disappointed. My son will have to wait until it becomes available at the retail price not the Ripoff Ebay/Amazon price
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Nice combination of puzzles and hidden objects.  You can get hints if you want, but overall it's not too hard to go it alone.  Great way to pass some time without getting frustrated!,<br />,,
B004HXIZVC|1.0|Why does this app need access to so many things like contacts, accounts, gps location, etc.  In general things like this raise major red flags.  Forget the app just use a browser and play the music.
1575666286|5.0|great gift did not read this book so can not tell you anything about it, got for a friend with cancer
B0047BXRB2|5.0|I has seen this movie when it first came out. I was a Cyril Hume fan an I wanted to see what he did with a movie. I was fascinated by the movie. It has been one of my SF favorites ever since. It is somewhat crude in its special effects by todays standards but it is a solid adaptation of Shakespeare's play updated for a 50's audience. The premise and movie stall hold up today, 40+ years later. It is a thoroughly enjoyable movie with the evil being more subtle than in today's movies. Anne Francis, Walter Pigeon, Earl Hollister's comic relief and Leslie Neilsen's all turn in good performances. Also, &#34;Robbie the Robot's&#34; debut is a landmark. That &#34;character  has evolved into an icon for SF fans. Buy it! Enjoy it! See why it has earned a niche in the genre of Science Fiction movies. Amazon had a great price and delivery was right on time.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Drawn in large part from the author's actual experiences...a fantastic fictional journey through life in the slums of Bombay, unspeakably horrible prison conditions, drug addiction and the yin and yang of the Indian mafia.  Highly recommend.
B00COGY2P2|5.0|Great classic action movie. Good action scenes and overall unpredictable. Not sure if its exactly true to the book, but excellent film regardless.
B005PK56TA|2.0|In a strange way I sought of enjoyed watching this show. However, even for a horror it 's plot was implausible-- How many tragedys<br />can be packed into one hour--way to many.However, the acting was superb, especially Jessica Lange, Conney Britton. There are many more who are deserving but my memory fails me.  I know darkness adds the aura of mystery, but the whole movie is a bit much it is so dark most of the time you can't even see it.
B00821OX98|5.0|Thanks to Amazon Prime offering the first 2 seasons free, my family sat down together and loved watching this show.  We missed it when it first came on TV, but did not want to start another season without seeing the first. I will definitely buy season three, then I know we will not miss season 4 when it returns to TV in the Spring.  First it is The Walking Dead, Falling Skies, Arrow, then Under The Dome.  Watch these shows, none of them will disappoint, they are all really good.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Loved the paired chapters: point counter point and differing perspectives of the same events provided opportunity to consider divergent perspectives in current events.  So much may change, but so much of human nature is both entrenched and enlightened. Sophisticated vocabulary beyond English.  A great read even for a PhD.
B00ABLJ5NQ|5.0|This is a beautiful book, immersed in the simple and absolute magic of childhood. A young boy makes a friend and the world of wonder and mystery open up. There are so many wisdoms and moments to make u think and transport u in this novel, i  want to read it again, now, just as i've finished it. Enjoy this book, its a wonder
B005HEFB6M|5.0|Scott Baculas acting is horrible but the stories are well written. The timeline is before ST TOS and reminds me of Firefly.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|The movie made me want to read the book, and I am glad I did. Mr. Brooks's writing is so detailed, so thorough, it makes it all seem possible.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|it is ok. the money you need to spend for rarity is just stupid. this game is good for rich people tho.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Really love this game. Playing it for 3 days straight and got to level 19. The graphics are good as well
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Having loved the music since the first time I heard it, I really appreciated the way this film presented the story making everything that happened understandable.  I thought the cast was fabulous and the difference in having the actors sing &#34;live,&#34; took nothing away from they presentation.  In many cases it was helpful as you were able to distinguish each word, not always possible when music is dubbed in.  Always arguable, who should have played what character or who could have sung certain songs better then the person selected is really lost as the talent of those in the film was just fine. In fact, I was often pleasantly surprised how well some of the actors could sing whom I never heard sign before.
630514415X|4.0|If you like basketball films and realism, this movie's great. It's a Spike Lee film, and while it's not Do The Right Thing or Malcolm X, the directing is nothing short of great, and the father/son relationship in the film drives it and deepens as the film moves through the plot. Also, this film is not about a boy growing up, it's about a grown man making hard choices. It is very different from your normal, stereotypical teenager with basketball skills film. It's a nice ride, so sit back and enjoy!
B005GFPZYK|4.0|The book just reminded me how much some people sacrifice in war. Not only the soldiers, but their families at home. Not only while the are gone but even when they come home.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|This was a good movie, but a renter for me. I liked it, but not enough that I would watch a second time or purchase.
B007JMW46U|5.0|Loved it !!!! Very clever in plot and rich in detail. Can't wait to read the rest of the Sherlock Holmes books.
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|This was a renter for me. I would not purchase or watch again. It was an okay movie, nothing great.
B008I43DYU|5.0|Works great, just what I needed. Now I won't have to hunt all over my office for a handheld calculator
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I had never heard of Neil Gaiman until Coraline. I love the dream/nightmare style of Mr. Gaiman. I imagine a Tim Burton style when I read this book. The characters are relatable and the narrative drifts between real life and a dark animation.
6304712944|5.0|this is one of my all time favorites - every time I see it I am reminded on why I loved Richard Harris so much, before he met Harry Potter
0439023483|5.0|good series, Wife enjoyed them and no i am listening to the books on audible. Movies are worth watching as well.
B0057UAE54|5.0|Bought for $3.99, what the hell. Catchy tunes, great guitar work.  The Bonus was Warren Haynes (Gov't Mule) 11:44 version of &#34; Do you feel like I do&#34; is worth the $3.99 alone.
0553801473|5.0|good series, he is a little long winded but it comes with the territory. TV show is worth watching as well.
0525953728|4.0|A fascinating look at both the background on Seal Team 6 and much of the specific preparations and concluding operations of the raid itself.
B001IYCMNA|5.0|My router has wifi in it, but we have a larger area to cover with Wifi. I wanted the same wireless network so the devices would stay connected and not have to reconnect. I installed two of these units, one in each area. Then set then up EXACTLY the same, with one exception, I put one on channel 6 and one on channel 11. I was then able to walk around my large area and keep wifi. I tested this by streaming youtube video while walking around. It was flawless..<br /><br />Works great with any Wifi device: computer, tablets, iPhone,etc.<br /><br />Units have been installed for about 6 months still working well.
B003IEJZUG|5.0|I admit, I struggled through the first few chapters and I thought if the entire book was in that manner, I'd never make it. I am normally a fast reader but I anticipated it would take me a week to finish this. But eventually the story took off. I did not want to put the book down. After finishing a day later, I can say this:  the book in its entirety is beautiful, powerful and moving.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Too bad they stopped at season 1 for the series.  Excellent writing, dynamic characters in a science fiction western setting.
B008VBYN80|5.0|This game is a great way to achieve the same goals that you would with the age of empires but a lot awesome and has a good empire role and leader ship role playing.  Even if your not interested I. This game you should try to play it the only thing I don't like is that it takes a wile to load and has been the same goals in the age of empires.
0812993845|1.0|I have so enjoyed many of her other books.  They are usually light, fun, silly and totally enjoyable.  This book is stupid.  The characters are unlikeable and unbelievable.  I keep debating whether to finish it or not .... I'm hopeful it will redeem itself in the end.  Although reading some of these other reviews I am not hopeful.  So disappointing.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|I went through 2 Microsoft GPS Receivers then I got this one.  I use Streets & Trips for my cross country routing in our motor home and love it.  The two failed units lost their connectivity or ability to pick up satellites in only a year or so.  Both I junked.  I read several reviews and came across this one with good feedback.  I now join those others and say this one does everything I want it too.  Somehow the computer and it recognize each other every time and it has been trouble free for a couple of years now.
B00936A0RU|5.0|My dad and I loved watching this movie. I highly recommend seeing this movie. It is worth your money and more. Fast shippment.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minevraft is so cool.its had an update recently.its becoming more and more like the xbox and pc version but I think it needs caves.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Filled with bloat now - ads, &quot;rewards,&quot; &quot;achievement unlocks - and the weather portion has suffered. The weather is harder to find and useless &quot;alerts&quot; are pushed in an apparent attempt to draw more clicks. I get flash flood alerts at the drop of a hat - with every summer afternoon shower, it seems - followed soon after by &quot;dry conditions will continue.&quot; I'm looking for an alternative.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Great read as I was invested in the characters right away.  Somewhat predictable but gripping nonetheless.  Looking or ward to my book lub's discussion on this one.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|It has not worked today... I think it's time for an update.<br />I also notice it won't pick up on all posts
0785139168|4.0|Enjoyed seeing one of my all time favorite books in comic book form...agree with over reviewers though that it felt too rushed. Still, it's a great way to introduce young people to classics...
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Fabulous book. Reading it feels like a vacation. Take it with you to the beach (or a nearby hammock!). It grabs you from the beginning and keeps you interested until the gentle, surprising end.
B008BU75IQ|2.0|Like so many other reviewers I have read and enjoyed  many Archer books. What happened to this one? At times did not &#34;recognize&#34; the style as being Archer at all.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is one of the best series I have ever watched! Every season gets better!! I recommend this fantastic show
0553801473|4.0|I like it but it didn't resolve enough from previous books. There are too many characters to keep track of and too many details that bog down the reader. It's annoying.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|You can pretty much know you are going to like/ love this book after the first chapter. Characters are pure. The story is told with enough originality and feeling so it doesnt turn into a cliche.
B000NY12LO|5.0|Amazingly, 19 minutes can change a life, take a life, or create a life. Never give up on yourself.  There's always a different road to take.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This trilogy was exceptional! I couldn't out it down! All I'm praying for is another addition! I hope there  is more!
B005HEFB6M|5.0|The characters seem more realistic, and the plotlines are more riviting and interesting than TNG or the original.  Additionally, the equipment/hardware appears to be more functional, and not just a bunch of blinking lights and pulsing panels.  There's almost a retro-feel to the interior of the Enterprise.  The ship looks more like a real functional spacecraft and less like an architects dream. Love that T'Pol too!
B00821PCJS|5.0|This is a neat drama series that has a good cast. The idea of the series is a scary one, but it is fun to watch the revolution progress.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|I loved the new series with David Tennant.  Very interesting storyline and great acting throughout. I cannot wait<br />for the 2nd installment.  Anyone who is a David Tennant fan should watch this.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I like the length of this cord. I can plug it in at night and lie in bed and read.
B000255LIY|1.0|While Sir Patrick Stewart is magnificent in his role as Henry (as usual), Glenn Close is NOT convincing as either a British or French queen.  The sets and costumes are wonderful.  But that is about all I can say positive about this movie.<br /><br />Remember \\"King Richard the Lionhearted\\" from the Robin Hood story?  This movie portrays him as a sniveling homosexual mama's boy.  This movie is one long profane fight between family members.  Glenn Close is constantly telling Patrick Stewart that she slept with his father - then she says she didn't - then she said she did.  She made \\"Stepford Wives\\" the same year she made this - maybe she got the roles mixed up.<br /><br />DO NOT let young children watch this movie. It is listed as \\"unrated\\" but it should be rated MA - there is nudity, profanity, incest and homosexuality.  Normally I would say that any movie with Sir Patrick Stewart in it was worth owning - I will make an exception for this one.
0375869026|5.0|and so should all schoolkids from 10 to 16.....made me laugh, cry....read it in one afternoon..couldn´t put it down....let´s see what my daughter thinks
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|This album was worth the wait. J Cole is taking over. He really makes you feel the emotions he's trying to convey through his music. If you listen to it from start to finish you won't be disappointed!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Gaiman takes you on a ride that's all at once fun, scary, and exciting. I would recommend this book for all ages.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Love this movie! Loved it as a kid and Love it now!!! A good watch for children and adults!!! Awesome!!
B00BVMXBVG|5.0|Really amazing actress.Saw it on BBC America.Had to buy the Blue Ray. Tatiana Maslany an actress to watch.Should have been nominated for an Emmy.
B000O8OTNC|1.0|Although sealed package, sharpening blades looked used or damaged. Does not sharpen well at all after repeated attempts with several knives.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is so much fun! It is also so addictine! I recomemed this app! Also it is for all ages!!!!!
B0086DB566|4.0|All around good Family movie!  Not too dar but way different then you might think!!  Great jo by all.Thanks for this treat!!
B003FKZFX4|5.0|This movie takes ultra-violence to a new level. Amazing (and sometimes very funny) action sequences are complemented by outstanding performances by Paul Giamatti and Clive Owen. Highly underrated.
B009AMANH4|5.0|Love it
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I want magnetic fingertips.  I don't have a tattoo or piercings but magnetic fingertips I would definitely do.  I have read most of James Rollins novels and he never fails to keep me on the edge with his storyline but he adds history and science and this time quantum physics.  If you want it all read this book plus you will have something to look forward to in November 2013.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is like a perfect virtual Trapper Keeper, (yes, I am exposed as an 80's goober, and don't mind!), keeping ideas, cool things, future plans, interests at my fingertips and let's me snoop on others boards!
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|Went to see the live concert & met our expectations!  What a great all American group.  Loved the concert!  Should be more like it.
B009X01C64|4.0|I like the way this functions in all positions. I thought I accidently put it in upside down but then just turned it around. good luck getting the kindle out of this after it is snapped in place. if you want a tight and safe fit...this is it.
B009KKLQKO|5.0|My husband loved it.  He is a big fan of them since the beginning.  Went to see them in person now we have the memories.
B001RMYWG8|5.0|There are good new movies out there but let's not forget the classics... this is one of the best ones!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Excellent movie, this could have been a mess. but the director took his time and laid the groundwork. Are there some plot problems yes but on the whole an excellent movie, can't wait for the sequel. DC comics will really have to step up their game if they want the Justice League to fare as well.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|Creative music that's fun to watch, these musicians recorded a modern classic. The collaboration on this CD is outstanding! This purchase is worth every penny.
1623360277|5.0|When I bought this book my yearly blood work showed I had a total cholesterol of 201.  After one year my total cholesterol fell to 141.  One part of my blood work was so low it was off the chart.  I am proof that this book works....but you have to commit to it.  No one I know was willing to join me.  Get this book and stop living your life for your next meal.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys are destined to be a genuine 2012 classic. I viewed them on youtube, but wanted the music because they made classic modern and fresh. It will be exciting to see where their music adventure takes them next.
0765348276|5.0|I liked this book a great deal and bought this copy as a gift for a friend. They are happy to have it too.
B005LAII8A|5.0|This futuristic action thriller doesn't disappoint with a tale that weaves and twists it's way through the life of one looper named Joe played by Bruce Willis.  This movie makes you think about &#34;cause and effect&#34; or maybe it would be better stated &#34;effect and cause&#34;, as this is a sci-fi time travel movie.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|Tom Cruise was surprisingly good as the Jack Reacher character.  My husband has read all the books and gave his thumbs up!
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Romantic time-less musical with countless songs and tunes you can sing as you go through life. The scenery around Salzburg is breathtaking and if anyone knows the area, it surely makes one homesick for the mountains and meadows and church bells. Saw the play and watched the movie with my granddaughters recently and all agreed &#34;We want to go there with you, Oma, and experience that area of Austria and the Alps with you. If I could only afford to take them all! What a treat for all it would be
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is so much fun! My little brother and I play it all the time. Keeps him entertained for hours.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|I read this book and then watch the new series of the &#34;The white queen&#34; on show time which is base on the 3 books of Philippa Gregory.  it made me love the series. and I felt so connected to actors. I absolutely  recommend this book.
0061122416|3.0|Though I read and loved his other two books (Eleven minutes and The Zahir) I find this one very philosphical and preaching. You will like it if you are into ficional, philosphical books, I would rather something with more fiction and reality, to be honest its like converting the book: The secret into a story but its not as good as the Secret. The only reason i gave it 3 Stars is because it's biased or anti Islam like most of the other authors, Coelho mentioned the Prophet Mohammed in a honest and respectful way.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Wonderful, artistic, beautifully written. At the same time, tells a difficult story about a time in history that I feel it is important that my sons learn. I have appreciated reading it with them (11 years old).
B009361C5O|5.0|Gets the job done, without to many whistles and bells.  In other words easy to navigate and offers the protections I need.
B003O86FMW|3.0|One thing I would change is katniss is a jerk! :/ I really don't care I'd she dies in the next book
B000JMKNV0|5.0|I enjoy lehane's works and this was one of my favorites..... Definitely one you can read more than once, and as I always recommend, read it before watching the movie!
B004GYY714|5.0|Great investment. Love the sounds I get from Spanish music. Where I live, we do not get any Spanish stations. So the next best thing is TuneIn. RadioLove to listen to it while I drink a few beers.
B009M7G1PU|4.0|This book is a classic and needs to be judged in the context of the time.  It is well written and the plot holds interest and suspense to the end, which still leaves the reader asking what the long term will hold for the protagonists.  It is a powerful comment on the social system of the time and although it is easy to judge the characters and mores of that time, such as Chatterly, it also needs to be seen in the light of the suffering that he and others endured during the first world war.  It is easy to see why the book was banned, not so much for the eroticism as for the revolutionary theme.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Tells you how much battery life you have left just in case you forgot your adapter and you are in the middle of nowhere.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I downloaded season 3 because I was too impatient to wait for August 27th.  I never had a problem downloading or watching any of the episodes.  I would download from amazon again if I needed to.
140006922X|4.0|I found Aslan's book good reading.  I especially liked his spending a number of chapters describing the Judaism of the time.  That is too often overlooked.<br />As with other reviewers, I would have liked footnotes as well as the notes at the end of the book itself.<br />Unfortunately, Aslan had a few textual short comings of note which editors should have picked up.  He has tides and salt water in the Sea of Galilee.  He could not decide whether Nazareth is a village or a city.<br />But far more significant, he does not describe the rise of Phariseeism, since Jesus was a Pharisee.  He went into synagogues; he used proof texts - both of which are significant aspects of the Judaism of his time and helped him to be able to consider himself a messiah.<br />He also pays little attention to the Halachah, which he calls Jewish Law.  Thus he misses the extent of it, and it comes across in a pejorative fashion, rather than as a way of living, which it was to the people of that time and throughout Jewish history.<br />I was also not happy at the number of times that he used pejorative adjectives unnecessarily.  That did not need to occur and his editor should have picked up on it.<br />Beyond these obvious problems, the book is good reading and can help the reader move beyond any kind of literalist approach to the New Testament, which is greatly needed for anyone to comprehend the life of Jesus and what that life has meant in religious history.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game ever. When your in 0.4.0 it sucks but is awesome in 0.7.3. I play it all the time.
B006PE6VW6|3.0|I watched this after remembering that it filmed in my neighborhood.  It was cute, but not something I would have paid to see in the cinema.
0486295559|1.0|I got this book from Amazon and it was in good condition.  I tried to read this book but it was not a fun book to read, i was bored out of my mind and could not finish reading it.
1455523542|5.0|I saw the movie before i read the book and I strongly recommend everybody do it that way because the ending is a big surprise and when i read it the ending had me in tears even though I knew how it was going to end.  Nicholas Sparks found a new fan.  bought my second book and waiting patiently for his new book &#34;The Longest Ride&#34;
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love love love pinterest.a friend told me about it a year or so ago.at the time I questioned it.after looking at it.then totally changed my mind..I enjoy it so much...
159463176X|5.0|The book was amazing! Not to say I expected less from Hosseini.... The only thing I didn't like about this product was the fact that someone tore the sticker off the cover, and left a bit of the glue behind. This might not be a big deal to anyone else, but I  thought I might mention it because stuff like that kinda bothers me. Had to get some alcohol to rub off the goop.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I am not one to pick up a book and read it cover to cover in a few short days, but with City of Bones I couldn't make myself set it down! The book was great and leaves you wanting for more throughout. Can't wait to get started on the second book. I would definitely recommend to all!! You will not be disappointed.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|Very useful always during it every word I need to know to tell my brothers they are wrong Thank you
B009RH9HDS|5.0|I Love it. It is very easy to use, it is practical and I like the fact it has a strap to hold my kindle.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is boring at first but once you get an idea and build it it is awesome you should so download it
B003VANOFY|5.0|My son loves his headset. I'm glad I purchased this one. Did look at a few more and went with this one and feel I made the right choice.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Fun fast and entertaining. I definitely recommend this game for anyone looking for some mindless fun. especially fun entertainment for toddlers and big kids.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Hi this games is fantastic u can be on this game all day and night if you think this game is good
B00EI6E17A|5.0|Had to decide if I hated it or if I was obsessed. .. Im obsessed. .. very catchy chorus but more for hardcore gaga fans. I dont see this becoming a huge radio hit.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|The language and imagery are beautiful, so I enjoyed reading this book even though it has some serious flaws as a novel. It's more a collection of short stories than a coherent narrative. I kept expecting something to happen to tie everything together, but nothing ever did. There wasn't really even a unifying theme to the stories. Some of them overlapped, but they didn't work together to tell one story or convey one message. There are so many characters that by the time he got back to some of them, I didn't remember which one they were, and I thought the wrong guy had been killed for a good part of the book. However, even with these flaws, it's still better than most of the stuff that's available right now. He is a gifted writer, and I look forward to his next book. I hope it will be woven together in the way &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns&#34; was. If you haven't read that one, I recommend it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very good mystery with twists and turns, that keeps you guessing the shole book through.  A fun adventure, summer read!
B008B8DY2O|4.0|Very good story with very accurate background material. Man on the run seeks sanctuary in Mumbai, joins crime world in Mumbai. Character development very good. Story trips along well mostly however there are parts where it gets bogged down a little in unnecessary descriptions. Overall a thoroughly good read with big dollops of philosophy to keep your mind busy.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Based on the other reviews I almost didn't read this book. I ended up enjoying it, and the last 500 pages moved quickly. True, nobody really gets to where we as readers want them to, but the setup for book 6 is really interesting. That said, Martin's editor needs to get a bit more aggressive with the delete button and keep inanities such as dragon queen and fearless raider Dany saying one more time &#34;I'm just a young girl and know little...&#34; from creeping into book 6.  I enjoyed this more than book 4, which was a big letdown for me after the intensity of book 3.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|I love this movie and I was a little cautious about purchasing this DVD off line because I was afraid that i would get it scratched and in poor quality but to my surprise, this movie had amazing quality, no scratches, played smoothing and great on HD tvs. I highly recommend this DVD.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|Just because I don't like Tom Cruise. No.<br /><br />I like Tom Cruise. He's a yeoman. Good.<br /><br />Still, crap movie. Over two hours of anyone's life sucked. If. They watched this movie all the way through. I did. And I learned a lot. Though I was sucked. Rudely. Sucked. Dare I say I paid for it, too? Four or five dollars. That I'll never have to spend again on something...else.<br /><br />First of all, why are they still paying Tom Cruise to do anything in the category of suspense? If Tom Cruise is in it, you know it's going to end well for him whether he lives to die another day, or, as in the case of this movie, not. He's either a hero or a Saint. Comforting, if that's what you're into.<br /><br />Then there was that whole stultifying middle part of the movie where there were (not just one but) two Tom Cruises. Wearing the same poorly designed costume. (and for this I had to wait two extra weeks 'til I could afford to watch how badly Tom Cruise would embarrass himself this time? why?)<br /><br />I like Tome Cruise, but Tom Cruise is a bad actor. He sells tickets but, he's a bad actor. As an actor he doesn't know his limits (which is good), but he doesn't know what he's good at, either (which is not good).<br /><br />In Oblivion he's taken on a story that requires stopping first; Cruise plunges ahead. Hold still, even if all he's got is a second, before firing. Know how to stop and hold still; Cruise can't.<br /><br />Still, good for him for considering the possibility. Likewise, in his next movie, I hope he'll consider looking his age.<br /><br />Ambitious movie. Over two hours. Beautiful design. But Tom Cruise was the bad actor at the center of it. So, one star for the design, one for doing a hard tell. Other wise three stars down on account of Tom Cruise is a bad actor.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I enjoyed this video.  Good perspective on Lincoln and his achievements. I would recommend it to others.  I hope you enjoy it.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Like most of the best sci-fi, the technology is secondary and this story is mostly about people, their interactions and the ramifications of those interactions. I very much enjoyed it.
B00AEKFLOQ|5.0|I really made a big mistake of not getting the Blu Ray Steelbook when it first released at Best Buy. It was around $20-25 at the time. But since I am such a huge fan of Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy. I just had to get this even if it cost me $40. I'm going to buy the other two films as Steelbooks just to complete the collection, and thank god they're cheaper.<br /><br />The Blu Ray had excellent video and picture quality and I advise everyone who likes Batman to go out and purchase this film on Blu Ray, and it doesn't have to be a Steelbook version.
B004K58GSO|5.0|I really love John Wayne westerns and this is one of his better ones.  The storyline is just different enough to be interesting.
B00CW665VI|5.0|With 'Tangled,' Emma Chase brings us a wonderful story of love told from the male perspective...the simple, no holds barred, no games, \\"Braveheart\\" quoting, Will Ferrell movie loving, guy's point of view. And this guy has absolutely no desire, nor inclination, to actually fall into that love trap.<br /><br />The dialogue is laugh-out-loud funny. (Thanksgiving dinner: \\"I'm hit, I'm hit!\\" That's all I'm gonna say.) You will not be able to put this book down! (I read it in less than 24 hours) It's full of smiles, color, and life.<br /><br />Drew Evans is, by far, my favorite book boyfriend. I know what he's like...and I'd do him anyway :)<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and pick this one up as soon as possible. I can't think of a better thing to do than get 'Tangled' up with Drew Evans.<br /><br />To read my complete review, visit fics2flicks.com<br /><br />Paige Turner, Contributor
B000V39KDO|5.0|Incredible action in this movie. Love this movie and look forward to the sequel. Definitely suggest this, if you don't have it, yet
B001R60ESE|5.0|Chris Botti is an excellent musician.  His guests on this CD were great too.  I have several of his CD's and plan to add his next one to my collection.
B0034DGP6S|4.0|For someone who has most of the questions and fears about marriage that were addressed in this book, I found it an reassuring, entertaining, and lovely book.
B00CCEHR80|5.0|Jerry in fine form vocally. Sixteen tracks in total had me wishing for sixteen more!  Sound mix is terrific and Jerry and band nail every tune.  &#34;Midnight Moonlight&#34; with Bela Fleck sitting in gets second set off to a rousing start that continues through to a wonderful rendition of &#34;Tangled Up In Blue&#34;.  Recommend picking up Volume One as well as the 1991 Arista &#34;Jerry Garcia Band&#34; &#34; double cd release.
6305718954|4.0|I really like this movie.  It make's me think about structured religions.  It reminds me that it's the people not the buildings that make christians.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|An innovative premise, wonderful production quality and our favorite actress held us glued to the TV.  Our only complaint is that we've had to wait far to long for thenext episode.
B004TI5N38|5.0|I have read all of David Baldacci's books and he never disappoints me!  Keeps you wanting more and more. An extraordinary author who keeps you in the story and you never want it to end!
0061438294|3.0|This is a good intro to basics in my opinion, and I've referred back to it a few times. However, for in-depth or advance knowledge you'll probably want to seek elsewhere. The book is mixed with facts and the author's real life examples, but doesn't provide enough specifics to teach someone the methods. Though he mentions other situations in his examples, I feel most of the book is geared toward &#34;business body language&#34; rather than a &#34;street smarts&#34; approach. Deciding which you prefer will help your quest.<br />It seems his reading of body language is based on some knowledge, but more on experience and intuition. This is great for him, but for readers who don't have the innate ability, it may leave them unsatisfied.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Enjoyed solitaire from the time I was a kid.  Now this one brings back these memories.<br />There are many but this is the best
1401307450|5.0|I really liked this book it was insightful and bluntly honest; it showed a whole new side of Anthony Kiedis a mature, insightful, self-aware, and bare side. I truly enjoyed it.
B000LXH0AY|5.0|Excellent acting, singing and choreography. Love the character of Maureen. Highly recommend to those who need a better understanding of NY in the 20th century.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|A book that most people can read to ascertain what it probably was like during the life and times of Jesus. It has plenty of detail with ample notations for resources to realize what those times were like. It is scholarly but not so scholastic to be confusing to the average reader. His writing gave me a greater respect for the of the Jesus that, as a Christian, I continue to follow with an even greater respect.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Its challenging, which makes it a good game. Yet easy enough for my four year old to play. Plus its a free app.
B0021L8V0W|4.0|I thought it was a great movie good action story was pretty good I wish the guy could have been saved but I am glad I bought it
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I could not wait for this book to come out. I was disappointed as I thought it was too short for the wait. The story line picked up right where the last one left off and thought the story was good, just way too short!
B000N2HCKQ|5.0|I picked up this book based on the recommendation of a friend. It is easy to read, interesting and insightful. I highly recommend
6304806418|5.0|I thought Madonna did a fantastic job of portraying Evita Peron.(Although critics may disagree with me.) Antonio Banderas as Che was breathtaking.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|I like a good sci-fi movie.  I expect plot twists, but I also expect them to be a logical extension of the movie.  I found that the plot twist was out of sync with the story up to that point.  It seems that it would be so much easier to build new drones by the thousands than have a complicated system of servicing them when they get taken out.  It just seemed like a cheap way out.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie, and maybe when I watch it again, it'll make sense.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|Don't download it, it's not worth it, even if it is free. Very hard to figure out and kinda dull.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Had fun searching for all the clues. Everyone likes to get in on the game.<br />We even have competitions on who could find the most
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome it is the.funest game ever you should play this game it is not a wast of timed -
B000GCFO0I|5.0|Bought this movie started to watch it and realized I had seen it already.  I kept it and put it in my movie library.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Great mystery - hooked after the first episode!  Can't wait to see the next 7 to find out &#34;who dunnit!
B004SUDQ8Q|4.0|a look at at time and place most Americans have never heard of; the story of 3 young girls having been torn from their families in an attempt to &#34;make them useful&#34; to society and the struggle they face to go home, I found a similarity to the treatment in this country of the first nation peoples that Europeans found when they came to here.  The thought of native residents being a life form of lower status and the need to train the children in European ways so they they can become &#34;productive&#34;. An attempt to erase a culture they did not understand.  The fact that it is a true story, the actors are real (not professional) who put their all into the story as well as the ending where we get to meet the real &#34;girls&#34; grown up and learn the rest of the story make it a memorable and moving experience.
B00005UKKF|5.0|I love this video. I collect anything that has to do with Britney Spears. Have been a very big fan since she started on Star Search and the Mickey Mouse Club. I think any fan would love to have this in their collection! Highly recommended!
B0007MWZEK|2.0|This original model requires you to go underneath and physically remove the trash picked up.  It's messy and sometimes hard to get back together and you can drop it before it gets into the trash k  I thought I was buying another one like I had, but was bitterly disappointed.  Pay the extra money for the touchless dump.  I own the flip dump model of this machine and absolutely love it.
B007FROGME|4.0|A gripping book that very easily plunges you into the world of stalinist Russia.<br />The plot is very well written. The only con is that it sometimes feels like a movie instead of a book.
B00CDXOXB4|5.0|I really enjoyed this really sweet story with a nice plot. I would recommend it to anyone of any age.
B001JIFYSA|3.0|Kept hearing &#34;You've got to see that movie!&#34; - - it was cute, but not one that felt like I should be recommending it to others.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I'm reading this for book club but it also applies particularly to where I am in my career right now. Sheryl Sandberg is generous with her observations and experience but is not expecting all women to make the same choices or take the same path. She is expecting all women to look at their choices and strengths as women and see these strengths as valuable and relevant to any path they choose and that femaleness is just as important in any organization as maleness. I love how she wants women to reach the top positions of organizations with these strengths as women and not as trying to be more &#34;manly&#34;<br /><br />The book is empowering!<br />J
B00005RDAF|5.0|I love this video. I collect anything that has to do with Britney Spears. Have been a very big fan since she started on Star Search and the Mickey Mouse Club. I think any fan would love to have this in their collection! Highly recommended!
B00973DDN2|5.0|Love it! Finally purchased this after waiting to see it in concert first (which was amazing), now one of my new favs albums.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I'm 're reading these books for the 6th time. They are so well written.Diana's attention to the smallest details, draws you in and makes this series one you don't wAnt to put down.
B000FA5TTW|5.0|This is one of the most difficult, poignant and beautifully written books I have ever read!  I loved it and shared it with everyone I could think of.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|This is a very enjoyable game and is easy for the kids 4 and 7 to play. It keeps them occupied for hours and fun for me as well...........
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Just what I wanted.A speedy view of the weather, without all the garbage now on the weather channel app. Nice and precise and fast.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I bought this to go with the wall adapter. Like I said in my last review this<br />charges very fast which makes life much easier!<br /><br />Highly recommended! Thank you!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|As usual, Khaled Hosseini writes with flair and passion about deeply felt issues and well drawn characters.  He can get a little maudlin at times, but that's what we love about him.  In this well paced novel, Afghanistan is as much a character as the protagonists.  The years pass and the land abides, despite the follies of those who live in it or who covet it.  Never boring, the book carries the reader along and makes a full circle, with a bitter sweet ending.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|A very very fun app. I would highly recommend this app if you like simple controlled game this is the game for you. Get it
B009WUBERW|4.0|Good action, lots of old timers, good to see them all again. Cant wait for the third one to see some more 80 action  actors
B00B29J0I6|4.0|This game makes a great pastime in games, but there is a problem when you hit the bombs they explode but it's still there! Please fix this problem!!
B00005KARK|5.0|recomend this movie to anyone that wants to recall childhood memories. fast delivery good condition now my kids could watch my childhood cartoons
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This Trilogy (still only 2 books) should become required reading for future generations.  History books made to be read, enjoyed, understood and remembered.
B003B02O0A|5.0|Currently re-reading due to sequel coming out in the Fall. Originally read it after reading THE FIRM. Both books good but far and away prefer this book as I'm more into social issues than the business atmosphere of THE FIRM. Hoping SYCAMORE ROW -- the title of upcoming sequel -- is as good!?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Easy to use and very fun! Can't put the game down! A lot more realistic than other horse games and easier to use than others.
B002DQLGHU|5.0|Great movie must watch best ever need to watch best ever love life worst HP movie but that's like saying you have too much money to spend
B009ZFPQOQ|5.0|My husband was a truck driver.  He would never like me to mention anything about traffic or taking a different.  Now he ask me get get My Little Friend out when we start to drive.  Before he called me a backseat driver - now I am his Co- Pilot.  Waze has stopped us fighting when we travel.  Thank you Fellow Wazes!
B008XKSW7M|5.0|This movie is funny and a tear jerker.  IF you want a movie that is entertaining and moving, this is the movie!  I enjoyed it very much and the actors and actresses were very good.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to laugh and cry.  A very moving movie.
B001POX73C|5.0|One of my very favourites which I've been meaning to add to my collection and I'm so very delighted to find it on kindle, thank you Kindle!  I read it and loved it over 30 years ago and I appreciate it so much more now that I'm older and have written novels of my own.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is one you cannot put down .  I am still thinking about the ending.  Well worth reading but I am still trying to decide how I feel about the ending.  Definitely not what I expected.  So, start reading but keep in mind that you will have to move to the final book immediately,  so make sure you have it available
B009R659L8|5.0|abosultely LOVED this book - I didn't have a clue as to how it would end , at every turn there was something surprising
B005544V6A|4.0|I knew nothing about this series, but will now continue to watch  the rest until it disappoints ! A little unrealistic, but fun nonetheless.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I watch it every time its on so it seemed ridiculous not to have my own copy.  Now, I can watch it anytime I want to.  Great little, sweet musical .
B00CWV9FQA|5.0|Four year old boys love it and watch it over and over. Makes babysitting real easy. Batman learns to ask his friends for help.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a really fun app at the end of the day to just relax and forget about the what's been going on.. I highly recommend it. Just make sure you have a kid around to help you out on occasion.
B0033AX20E|3.0|It's okay metal, but really it sounds just like everything else from Dragonforce.  There is nothing to distinguish this album from anything else they've done.  Good background noise for drowning out the blah blah blah at work.
1476734941|5.0|I purchased this book after hearing about it on Rachael Ray Show.  The<br />book proposes a very different way to loose weight. I find this method<br />of weight control seemed better than pills or other things I have read<br />about.  I am going to stick with it for a while and see if it truly works.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love solitaire and this app fits my needs perfectly. Easy to use and simple to understand, this game is a great time passer.
B008JF8O9M|2.0|I am not able to get the kindle fire to print anything.  It's very upsetting but I feel pretty sure it's some lack of understanding on my part.
B0053TMP24|4.0|That was a great book. I can't wait to read the next one. The characters have amazing personalities and a lot of luck
B00CWY76CC|4.0|nice app tapping doesn't work all the time; tips would help; sometimes hard to figure out what the objects are.  Great brain work.
B005K17RU0|2.0|I used this app on my HTC Eco 4g without complaint. I got my new HTC One and now the radar maps show nothing. Blank screen. Might just have to find another app. BTW, I use a weather app everyday.
B007FKI9G0|5.0|I must have seen this movie 20 times, and I still love it.  There is always something new that I catch each time.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|good to keep up with friends and all.  i can message them privately and i like that.  is is sometimes a good place to get a laugh.
B004I744AS|3.0|I guess I was spoiled 50+ years ago when we had to use a huge, heavy book that was jam packed with all sorts of info.  Long before the information superhighway provided, we learned how to use a &#34;real&#34; dictionary.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|I loved it. It had lots of twists and turns and got you in the end. Very interesting. I would and did reccommend it to a friend.
B005ERYEGU|4.0|Really great argument for lead generation that leads to revenue.. phenom read. I would recommend this to any VP of Sales or CEO without a doubt.
0865479186|5.0|This book should be required reading for anyone wanting to know the truth about nutritionalists and the false claims they make, how bad research is done in academia and biotechnology companies, incompetent educators in the public school system, as well as the way the mass media goes along with spreading deception to a gullible public.  The only downside to reading this book will be the lack of respect the reader will undoubtedly develop towards so many unscrupulous \\"professionals\\" in the so-called health care industry.
B0055QYKQO|5.0|working perfect for me after 6 months. have it running with amd 8350 cpu simple to construct and no issues so far.
B005HSL626|4.0|my toddler loves to play this game but keeps hitting the ads.  I can't use it unless I am right there to monitor<br /><br />'
B004SIIBGU|3.0|I found it is faster and easier to use a search engine.  Maybe I did something wrong.  Maybe I'll it again.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|The writing and the acting make this show brilliant! This show just gets better and better with each season. It never disappoints and can be watched over and over. With Penny finally saying 'I love you' to Leonard, the quirky relationship between Amy Farrah Fowler and Sheldon, and the rest of the gang up to their craziness. This show is one of the best shows ever.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This was a gift and i thought it would take me a long time to figure out. It's wonderful. Holds more than you can dream of and so easy to use.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Interesting historical fiction story line.  No bad language or scenes.  It has an appealing combination of humor and drama.<br /><br />I would recommend to my friends.
B001NHNG64|4.0|This is another book series that I started with a later book.  Once I read a few, I wanted to start at the beginning.  Next for me is #3.
B004H0M8EA|5.0|Welcome to the Anthropocene Period -- that time in the Earth's history when humankind and its doings constitute a major force shaping the present and influencing the future.<br /><br />The question is &#34;will there be a future?&#34;<br /><br />There is a vast scientific literature on the topic, replete with intense investigation, using a range of tools that could not have been dreamt of only a few decades ago. Jared Diamond set out in &#34;Collapse&#34; to make those findings accessible to the general public; hence his book is informal, even chatty, but though it presents a vast amount of data, the text is without footnotes and references (but don't worry -- sources are set out at the end of the book.)<br /><br />Diamond confronts a prevailing view of history which salutes human advancement, despite ups and downs, the passing of a global &#34;torch&#34; from one culture to another: he insists, on the contrary, that there have been many cases in which a society or culture, after a period of prosperity and success, has so mismanaged its relationship to its resource base that it has contributed to its own destruction.<br /><br />He asks if we can designate a general framework through which we can examine such cases of collapse, and proposes a set of five &#34;forces&#34; , whose form may be particular for any society, but whose general contours are repeated in other cases.<br /><br />1) environmental damage<br />2) climate change<br />3) hostile neighbors<br />4) friendly trade partners<br />5) society's response to its environmental problems<br /><br />What is striking about many of the cases of collapse is that the &#34;leadership&#34; of the society in question has failed, in the sense that it did not adopt measures which could have saved the culture. Indeed, in many of the cases cited in the book the leadership elite did not even perceive that there was a problem.<br /><br />Inevitably there arises the question of the relevance of Diamond's conclusions for our present day world. In a globalized world it is easy to forget that we depend on the resource base that we have inherited, depend on its health in the form of its forests, its soils, its water, its air, its ambient conditions such as temperature. We have our hands on such potent levers that we can remake the planet we possess, but we cannot guarantee that this remaking will succeed.
B000TGJ7ZY|5.0|I hope they don't keep coming out with new formats very often or I would go broke replacing my favorites.
B00C9G22R2|1.0|I will keep this review/opinion succinct.  Among viewers of Asian cinema, there exists hardcore martial arts fans and fans of cinematic Asian art-house. I consider myself a member of the former, so please keep that in mind as you read this review. Trailers for THE GRANDMASTER will mislead many martial arts fans into thinking that it is a kick-ass martial arts movie that adds to the developing canon of films depicting the life of Bruce Lee's teacher IP MAN. In actuality, this film is a sizable chunk of Asian art-house with an historical focus. IP MAN just happens to be one of the characters in the film.<br /><br />Anyone looking for action and knockdown-dragout fights in the vein of Donnie Yen's IP MAN films will be devestatingly disappointed. The actions sequences in this film are very few, very scarce, and nothing at all spectacular. Not only is the IP MAN character absent from a large chunk of the film, but we are not even offered any kind of final epic fight at the end. None of the film's skirmishes are at all lengthy.<br /><br />I am not an idiot who only watches wall-to-wall bloody action. I understand that this film was intended as historical and philosophical drama and high-end art--I understand that after having seen it. But had I known that from the start, I probably would not have bought this film at the WizardWorld comic book convention in Rosemont. I believe Director Martin Scorsese has agreed to officially present this film for American distribution, and given the type of historical and epic scope the film illustrates, I can see and understand Scorsese's appreciation of its beauty. I am not a hater of the arts and I certainly recognize that this film was not intended to be a Shaw Brother-type of escapist action. However, the trailers present the film as exactly that, and I think many fans of the Shaw Brothers escapist fun--such as myself, will feel very cheated after sitting through this film.<br /><br />So to conclude, if you are into artsy foreign films, you may find much to love about this movie. But if, like me, you just want some great and spectacular, death-defying battles, with unbelievable stunts, bad dubbing and mad blue-screen effects, don't waste your time on this long, talky, forlorn flick.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Well written and I enjoyed the 2 points of view. I thought the ending wasn't the best, but overall a good summer read.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Good plot line, great character development.  The author sucks you in, and you read this very quick.  Can't wait to start the next one.
1250008409|5.0|If you are looking to get into meditation, then look no further.  This is a great book & practical.  A must!
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|Could not put it down.  Clever and beautifully executed.  Offbeat theme but never misses a beat.  Covers the whole gamut of inter-family relationships.

B005MHI0QM|5.0|This book is  a most read . I would suggest this book to any one who was looking for a good read
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I loved all the characters, the writing style, suspense, comedy and of course the love story.<br />Thanks Graeme for writing this.  It's a book I will recommend to everyone I know who loves to read.  I will re-read this treasure again.
B001RHOJSE|5.0|Hannah Arendt's honest and courageous report on the Eichmann trial is an example of crisp, clear thinking that refuses to be taken in by stereotypes.  Great book.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Several friends told me that this was a &#34;must read&#34; for the summer.  Although it was enjoyable, it didn't leave me wanting to read more books by this author.  Some interesting plot twists, for sure, and a fun read.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My 5 year old daughter absolutely loves the game. She loves those little guys. Love the challenge also. A must have app for minion fans.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Great read. Keeps you involved up til the end and leaves you craving for the next book and curious about what happens
B00A2IUHM6|5.0|Funniest movie I've seen in a long time!  Not a kid-friendly teddy bear movie - be warned!  But freaking hilarious!
B007SGM084|5.0|I really loved this book it had all three books in one. I didn't have to wait for anything. She wrote with such strong feelings made you want to be there throughout the whole book. Kept you wanting . Unbelievable every word you hung on hated to but the book down. I'll reread it again to see if I missed anything and movement  and feelings it left you wanting to get your man that's for sure .
B005SS2QXS|5.0|The thickness of the material and the size of the openings do not interfere with the iPhone holder in my car, the dock on my alarm clock, or the 90 degree angle 3.5mm plug of my headphones. Access to the locking switch is easy for average sized fingertips. All the buttons are raised so you have that extra tactile confirmation. It wraps around the iPhone 4S extremely well, there's no play in the fit once installed.<br /><br />The material itself is soft to the touch and provides a positive grip feeling. It does resist sliding against cloth when slid into a pocket, but that also means it resists sliding out. I haven't noticed any serious problems with it attracting dust or lint.<br /><br />I bought this case because of my positive experience with Griffin Tech's Survivor case for my iPad. After taking a good look at it, a friend of mine ditched his hard plastic case, from a different company, for his iPhone and got one of these.
0307593525|5.0|Nothing to review here, really. Julia is amazing. Anyone who cares about cooking should own this book. It is simply irreplaceable.

B007GCY8FS|4.0|A Wanted Man Review<br />I love Jack Reacher and thought this was one of his better adventures. Where is the next one?
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Loved the Kite Runner and other of the author's books.  This one doesn't disappoint. It would be a good book club book.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|American Sniper is a very moving story of Chris Kyle's life. Of course his experiences as a sniper are exciting, but his very honest story of the effect of military service is very heartfelt and emotional. Everyone should read this if for no other reason than to support a true American hero.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I love HO games and this one is by far one of my favorites. The story was intriguing and the game flowed nicely. HO segments were not only fun to solve but some were quite a challenge. I highly recommend this game. Would have liked for it to last longer but all good things must end. Get this game it's worth the money.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was a book I hated to put down.  As each chapter was coming to a close. I found myself anxiously wanting to read more.  Brilliantly written..<br />BRAVO
B008P1EWIM|4.0|I like the weather is specific to my town.  The report is accurate to the current weather.  Nice colorful presentation.  I don't have to turn on the TV or radio to get the weather.  Good for the mornings before l get ready for work.
B005USZYDU|3.0|You know i LOVE anything Grisham writes - in fact I've read them all.  And I was thinking as I was reading this that it seems a little elementary and sure enough - I believe its meant for a younger generation.  But it was good....as is all his books.

B0013K1ALE|5.0|Freak'n awesome ha, I had to get this film. I am a die hard Zep fan;). I got more than I wanted and that's awesome business. You guys rock!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004K58GSO|5.0|great movie! better than we remembered it!<br />John Wayne is the best and we think he should always be recognized as great!
B001L83PLQ|5.0|This books was so captivating that I never dropped it once I started. Amanda did exactly what this fiction intended to do; bringing back the pictures of the Biafra tragedy to those who only heard the story, and those who never did. The characters completely depicts the live characters that inspired them. I love this book and I hope such tragedy (civil war) never lurks its head again. On a lighter note, the most painful part was the disappearance of kainene; achieved the authors purpose but left the reader in pain, reading quickly towards the end and wanting to read more. Hoping that she will return but she never did. What a tragedy!
B0026OR1UK|4.0|This is a great book that explains how people get to be really great at what they do. It is inspiring to know that you can get really good, really fast as long as you have the right method (or coach). Once you have the right method, it is really up to you to practice deeply. I think that this book along with &#34;Outliers&#34; by Malcolm Gladwell gives you the inspiration to work hard and smart in anything you do and you will achieve the results you want.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|lep's world is awesome! I love it. The NER brothers are awesome .Thank you for making this app I will always play it

B00DRPVE3M|2.0|This is the best Uno game out there.  However after about an hours play you have to buy tokens to continue to play.<br />It can get expensive quickly. Personally I love the game but will delete it.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Hard to put down.  Good suspense and inventive.  Only negative is the constant shuffling of plots.  Would have liked to continue one plot line a little longer.
B00CA3C1N4|5.0|I can't get enough of this game, it's such an addiction and I would recommend it to anyone. The ability to level up and learn new abilities makes it all the more addicting and desirable to play harder AI's.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|As I found the story interesting parts were vague but understood it was to protect the brave Seals that were involved.
1451695195|1.0|it is a very boring book! The author talked about himself on and on, but not much about proof of heaven. I couldn't finish it!
B009DCOU9S|3.0|And frustrating at times. But the game was too brief in my opinion. Still enjoyed it, just don't expect more than a couple days of fun.
B00AW0DM8K|4.0|Characters one cares about even when the reading is done. The concepts that stretch the reader's mind are threads that weave their way through three separate but very connected stories.  Brilliant storytelling.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Worth the 5 bucks to rent and watch with my wife, but it wasn't groundbreaking. What I enjoyed most was the soundtrack which was done by M83. Overall a good movie to watch if you order takeout and kill a bottle of wine.
B00E5C3AJM|4.0|At least this one has more stores open. The original one really needs updated before releasing a new one. I really like the rock star clothes
B004TTMYQG|1.0|Very bad update. I contacted them on when they plan to upgrade the version to what's on play store. Apparently they do not have plans for this. Why?? Is Amazon App customers second class citizens??
B00DP3IGJ6|3.0|Bottom line:  This is your typical Hollywood attempt at a big budget science fiction flick.  It has good initial primary character development, good plot, then sort of fizzles out at the end.  If you've seen the indie sci-fi flick \\"Moon,\\" you'll likely end up underwhelmed.  Read on, ONLY if you're not afraid of SPOILERS.<br /><br />Now to the nitty gritty- The movie gives you a place to start, a premise for the story, and throws in some  amazing special effects to wow audiences.  Tom Cruise's character is a \\"yes\\" man who spends the first hour of the movie discovering there's more than meets the eye  (Sort of like George Clooney's \\"Solaris\\"- There are unanswered questions.  The second half of the movie is spent turning a good sci-fi theme into an action flick.  A woman from a dream, his wife, joins him on the roller coaster of a ride, again more showy special effects.  In the last twenty-five minutes, the movie seems to rush, running out of time to wrap everything up into a nice, neat package.  It doesn't quite do the plot justice.<br /><br />The end of this movie is just too \\"live happily ever after,\\" without the emotional attachment- All the surviving, underdeveloped minor characters come together after the heroic salvation of the human race, and the movie ends.<br /><br />In short, this movie is a story turned mediocre Hollywood.
1781162646|5.0|What I loved best about this novel was the humor and humanity of the hero of Joyland.  I found myself laughing outloud.  Told as a coming of age novel set against the milieu of an amusement park was original and rich with details of people, plot and atmosphere.
B007N85POS|4.0|I like the game and would have given it 5 stars, except for everything on the screen seems really too small.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I didn't think it was possible, but this is actually a good sci-fi movie that was made recently. The movie provided a good story without adding the ridiculous liberal lecture. The very few love scenes were very brief, so they didn't try to do the typical Hollywood thing and try to appease everyone. The scenes were very beautiful. The movie reminded me and my husband of FallOut.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|If I could only have one game this would be it. Tons of fun. Hours of entertainment, many different games to choose from makes this a great game for all ages.
B0067QPVJ6|3.0|If you remember John Carpenter's \\"The Thing\\" and enjoyed that then you should enjoy this as it is essentially the same movie.  What this movie gives you that that movie didn't was a bit more of an explanation of the \\"what\\" and the \\"why\\" of the alien fiend, not that it matters as the film was really about paranoia regarding who we are and can we trust ourselves and others, and unfortunately it doesn't do as good or smart of a job of playing upon, developing, or sustaining the paranoid aspect.  But that's not saying that it doesn't manage these elements and include some good creature effects (I prefer the original's though as its more practical effects carried more weight than the digital effects here).<br /><br />The winsome Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays Kate Lloyd, the heroine and brains of the picture, and she does a good job though it's not quite believable how she picked up on and understood everything so quickly.  But, again, that's not what this particular film is supposed to be all about.  In the end it is an entertaining flick for the sci-fi fan, not bad, but not an improvement over what has come before either (and it is set up to essentially be the prequel to that film as this film ends with the scene of the dog being shot at from the plane which is how the previous film opened).<br /><br />Worth a rent.  3.5 stars.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|Signed up long ago and although retired I still find this site useful in keeping in touch with those I have worked with previously.
B009ZNU15C|3.0|\\"A Bronx Tale\\" is one of my favorite movies, of any genre, ever.  The story is interesting, the \\"life lessons\\" are provided amply via great dialog and acting, the 9-year-old kid is cute as heck and just terrific in his role (the older version of him actor is not far behind him in acting ability), and the place and time are perfectly re-created. (I can relate to the characters, having known some version of almost every one of them when growing up in NY.)  I can view this movie again and again, and I love it every time.<br /><br />This review is specifically about the blu ray release, this so-called Region-Free version.  This is actually the official United Kingdom release of this item-- this movie has never been released on Blu-Ray in the USA-- but it has been released in the UK.  This Blu-Ray is incorrectly labeled on the back-side artwork as \\"Region B,\\" but actually it is a Region-Free disc, meaning it will play on Blu-Ray players around the world.  However, I can tell you that the special features--the two extras (a making-of documentary and a trailer)-- may or may not work on Region \\"A\\" (US) Blu Ray players (actually any non-region-B Blu Ray players).  The UPC for this release is 5055201819864, which is the one I have, and English is the only supported audio and subtitle language.<br /><br />On mine, the extras simply won't play when clicked on.  I tried several times, including switching off my 2013 Sony Blu Ray player, ejecting the disc, inserting it again and trying the special features again.  Nothing happens when they are clicked on.  The movie itself plays fine, but the extras, once highlighted (pointed at), do nothing when clicked.<br /><br />Maybe someone else has a different brand of BR player that will work with this blu ray, but my US \\"Region A\\" player is clearly not fully compatible with this \\"Region-Free\\" disc.  Funny thing, I have a British-made Region-Free Blu Ray of \\"Notting Hill,\\" and all the extras on that work perfectly.<br /><br />Another technical malady: one time, when I fast-forwarded through this film at the highest speed, I could not then get it to stop; it raced through many minutes of the movie, though the displayed time point in the movie didn't budge, and the only way I could stop it was to turn off my player-- a fairly new unit that's had no problem with any other DVD or Blu Ray, and I've played at least 100 discs on it.  Fast-forwarding and rewinding at slower speeds yields no problem.<br /><br />Another complaint for this British version blu ray: the English subtitles are VERY loosely written, not nearly as accurate in reflecting the exact words spoken as are either of the previous DVDs. One example that irks me: after Jane had encountered Sonny's guys while looking for Cologero, he then comes upon those men, and one says to him that \\"A fine-looking moolinyan chick was just here looking for you.\\"  This is accurately re-stated in the subtitles for the DVDs, but NOT on this British blu ray, where instead the subtitles say, \\"A pretty black girl was just here looking for you.\\"  Why do they swap \\"girl\\" for \\"chick\\"?  \\"Pretty\\" for \\"fine-looking\\"?  And \\"black\\" for \\"moolinyan\\"?  The latter means \\"eggplant\\" in Italian and is a slur towards blacks; why do the British clean this up for the hearing-impaired?  They certainly didn't overdub the audio, as what the man actually said remains in this blu ray version as intended . . .<br /><br />As for the look of the film: it's the best version we've seen, but not perfect.  The color is vivid, and the picture often sharp, but not always.  In most scenes, it looks like a light is shining on the faces of the actors, such that the flesh tones don't look authentic. Some scenes look far less high-def than others.  Overall, it's a \\"good\\" (not \\"very good\\" or \\"excellent\\") HD remastering/transfer, but I've seen many more blu ray movies that were sharper on my 55\\" HD TV, even much older films.  The bit rate is not the highest, rarely getting into the high 20s, hardly ever the low 30s (Mbps).<br /><br />I'm a bit disappointed with this blu ray, ESPECIALLY at the $25.00 or so price.  The studio seems to give with one hand, then take away with the other, for this movie's various releases.  The first DVD, from HBO, had decent picture quality and had the two extras.  The 2nd and last DVD, from another studio, has a MUCH better picture than the first--it looks very sharp on my older tube TV and darned good on my HD TV, too-- but it contains no extras.  Then this Blu Ray is released in England, with extras, but they won't play for me in the US.  And the actors' flesh tones, again, don't look so great.<br /><br />No more versions of this film for me!  I need to keep ALL THREE of the ones I have so as to enjoy the extras (on just one, the first DVD) and to see the best picture quality (the Blu Ray on my HD TV and the later (2nd) DVD on my non-HD, tube TV).<br /><br />I hope this review helps!
0060775858|5.0|This book was a gift for a one year old child. I loved reading it to her and it was not a book that she had.<br /><br />I was very happy with the purchase.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|Aslan's book was creative, to say the least. I bought the book, because I caught the last segment of an interview about the book. I pre-ordered it on kindle, and was eager to dive in. The day the book arrived, I read through the introduction to get an  overview of where he was heading. Almost immediately, I picked up the all to common portrait of Jesus from the scholastic world. Though I was a bit disappointed, I continued to read. About halfway through the work, I was almost ready to put it down and move on to something else. The way Aslan deals with the evidence was a bit disappointing. He minimizes the records given in the gospels, instead painting a picture from other historical elements of the time period. Some of the information he used to arrive at his conclusions is worthy of consideration, but I did not like the way he practically used it to dismiss what was in the gospel accounts. At the end of the work, stemming from his formulated idea of these times, he displays two sects of early Christianity. One from those who belonged to James and the other to Paul. Taking what Paul wrote in 7 instead of 12 authentic letters as mostly secondary knowledge, he claims that to really understand Jesus, we should look at what James wrote. Indeed, there is some overlap between the book of James and the Sermon on the mount and Aslan's statements are worth further investigation. I appreciate his thought process, and creativity in such a difficult project. The times of the 1st century in Palestine were diverse to say the least, but I believe we can know more about Jesus by analyzation of the accounts recorded in the gospels than outside sources. The work reminds me of John Dominac Crossan's work from 1991 on Jesus, as both give a portrait of a Jewish peasant. For anyone who wants to pick this book up and read it, I say do it. The work will give you a glimpse of both some historical understanding of 1st century palestine, and scholastic approach towards deciphering it. Make sure, though, that you understand that there is more to the story than meets the eye in Aslan's work. I would pair it with the work of those like N.T. Wright's Simply Jesus or James Dunn's Jesus Remembered if you are semi-serious about  being exposed to some of the different angles that are taken in modern scholarship.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is a fun game to play on my Kindle 8.9. The graphics are good, but the screen is a bit crowded with so many tabs and goals. It is also a bit difficult to place new buildings or upgrade existing ones because they appear over the landscape which means buttons for existing buildings get pushed at the same time. I deleted a couple of trucks accidentally this way. I also didn't know what some of the buttons meant, but I figured it out after playing for awhile. Overall, it was worth purchasing and I'm still enjoying playing it, even with some of the difficulties navigating the screen.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is fun and very addicting.  It is a good time-waster...or bad...depending on what you want to do with your time! Good for when you need a little down time.
B00555X8OA|5.0|Hard to know where to start. I was completely absorbed from the beginning and stopped at the end of every chapter to let the concepts and new terms sink in. I fell for every example even when I knew to question. This is something I will work on the rest of my life. This book is now on my 'read every year' list

B009N4QJ54|5.0|If you enjoy the absurd, this is the movie for you!  All the actors are at the top of their game and the Coens take you on a wild ride as Norville Barnes learns to succeed in business without really trying.  There are so many funny catch phrases in this movie you will find yourself using in your day-to-day life.  It is a must see for any aspiring captain of industry, &#34;I'll bet my Pulitzer on it!!&#34;
0783226004|5.0|This was recommended to me by a friend from work.  It's a great movie.  It has suspense, technology, comedy, and great actors.
140006922X|5.0|I thought it was very well researched, well written, and made me feel closer to Jesus because of the great detail about the time and place of Jesus' life.
1904633420|1.0|When i bought it i tought i was buying a &#34;fully sized&#34; book, but when it arrived i ordered a &#34;pocket edition&#34;, the book seems to be good, but this special book its for ladies(with the due respect).
1416972242|5.0|The first book had me flipping pages until the end where I fell flat on my face.  If you've read it I'm sure you know exactly what I am talking about.  While others may find the romance disturbing, I can't believe that they are actually related!  And towards the end, whatever Jace was told, I'm sure will end up confirming that.  Sometimes the characters drive me a little insane because they really are just SO over the top, but at the same time I love them and it's a miracle I took the time to write up a review instead of just powering through to start the third book (which I plan on doing as soon as I hit submit).<br /><br />This story definitely surpassed my expectations and left me wanting more this time instead of questioning my sanity after the end of the City of Bones.  Good job and 5 stars!  I hope the rest of the story is just as amazing, if not better!

B002MFWLXK|4.0|Painted with a broad brush but Stone's vision is a compelling take on events taking place after the darkest day of modern politics.  A fantastic ensemble cast of Hollywood's who's who with standout performances by Joe Pesci, Donald Sutherland, Tommy Lee Jones, Gary Oldman,  and even John Candy.  Kevin Costner is just fine as the stalwart DA Jim Garrison.  Stone delivers a potpourri of conspiracy theories that somehow pull together as fascinating drama that offers viewers several possible takes on just who was responsible for JFK's demise.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I like the game so far but It needs a hint option. I'm sure I'll get the swing of it.,<br />,
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|Mindless entertainment. A story that has just enough background and plot to keep it moving. It is better than the Twilight movies.

B0036S4B6M|5.0|After I watched the Netflix series, I decided to read the book.  After all, I also went to Smith, so felt a kinship there - it was a fascinating look into prison life, albeit &#34;high end&#34; prison life.  Highly recommend.

B00BH0VSM6|5.0|Let yourself be taken into the world of Norwegian detective Harry Hole (How-leh):  experience a taut adventure as Harry travels to Australia to solve a case.  If you like this one, just buy them all. They have their strong and weak points, but there is a certain quirkiness and humanity to Harry that colors his life and his crime fighting style.  For better or worse, Harry gives us a look into the Norwegian  crime fighting style.  Mr. Nesbo has created international characters with a Scandinavian flair. Stereotypes? You decide.  As some have not yet been translated into English, reading them in order isn't possible, but that doesn't seem to alter the appeal of the characters or the stories.
0765357151|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, saw it twice. Then thought it was time I read the book. I was not disappointed. This book was a real page turner. I read it in a couple of days. It's more of a short story than a full novel. The book deals with the biggest questions of life. What does it mean to be human and is there any meaning in life? Is there a God etc. But it sets these in the context of society. Should society crumble how many of these big questions would remain? How many of them are simply the product of the society and culture we inhabit? Matheson has some good insights into this. I loved the authors frank description of the nature of being human. Neville looks to the achievements of humanity and finds that in all those books (i.e. read education) they cannot put out the fires in him, they wouldn't change the cravings of his flesh. He knew his alcoholism was killing him, but all the education in the world wasn't going to stop him. Such is the power of addictions over the human mind. He also asked questions of technology. In the wake of our reliance on science and technology for progress and improved living conditions, what happens when something goes wrong? Could these things we view as great achievements ultimately bring about our downfall? Humanities reliance on something as useful as a vaccine produced horrendous results, almost exterminating the planet.<br /><br />In terms of ethics, Matheson follows the crumbling of society to it's logical conclusion. Robert Neville became his own ethic, he alone was the arbiter of right and wrong. However there was much he couldn't shake. He knew his alcoholism was wrong in some sense, and that to rape women (even women he was experimenting on) would be wrong. Somehow he couldn't shake the basics of morality. Mathesons' views of God and religion were decidedly modern, even though the book is in many ways post-modern. The Cross would affect Christian vampires but not Jewish ones. Could Neville logically explain this without slipping on the banana peels of mysticism? But to do that is to pit logic and mysticism against each other, as is common in the modern world. Even worse it writes all religious experiences off to mysticism, as if they do not involve the mind or the whole person.<br /><br />Ultimately, there is another question that permeates the entire book. If the vampires represent the next stage in human evolution, why is he resisting? Why not join them? Why is he holding onto his humanity? Perhaps Matheson's point is that to be human is something more than biological, and material, and ultimately quite mysterious. Far more so than the enlightenment project would have imagined. At his execution Neville realises this and sees his fate, to become a legend like other stages of the human evolutionary process.<br /><br />This was an exciting book, a real page turner. Very different to the movie and well worth reading.on the banana peels of mysticism? But to do that is to pit logic and mysticism against each other, as is common in the modern world.

B0079R8KO0|5.0|I love this item, it is perfect for reading or just doing anything on my kindle. Glad I got it.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|One of the best shows I have seen in a long time! The CGI is pretty good but the acting is even better.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Rented the movie before going to see Red2. A lot of action which always makes a movie. I'd watch it again.
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|The political climate today is hard and miserable for most of us in the US. This shows the how close we can come to being an abomination if we followed the isolationist. I hope we can meet the challenges of our generation as well.
B006IYG5HE|4.0|The pace of Jo Nesbo's Harry Hole (How-leh) detective series is not the roller coaster one expects from American crime novels.  Rather, the Norwegian author sets his novels in Oslo (or sends his protagonist to other locations) where the pace of crime fighting is more mercurial:  there is more about human nature and less about criminal antics.  I recommend this series for anyone who wants to get lost in a good read while developing a connection with the hero.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Superb acting, great storylines, fantastic synergy among the cast. Love being able to watch episode after episode absolutely commercial free.
B009178OQA|5.0|The simplicity of the movie is what makes it good. The passion, love and respect that Jiro has for his job comes across so clearly and powerful it makes you think....do I love what I do at my job? do I do my best everyday?
B001I45UFC|5.0|My daughter is loving it just as I did as a child.  We can't wait for the rest of the series.
B0010SEMP0|5.0|Jeaniene Frost does it again!This book is a fast paced thrill ride right from the beginning! I love the characters, they are so beautifully written that I feel so connected to them! When Dave was killed I cried, when Bones and Cat were reunited I was ecstatic and when they revived Dave months later I cried happy tears during there reunion! I love the world that Frost has created! I will be starting the 3rd book soon! I can't get enough!!!
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|Anne Elliot, this early 19th Century Cinderella, has two unattractive sisters and instead of a mean step-mother, a silly father.  Talked out of marrying the man she loves, she gets a second chance eight years later, and wins his love all over again.  The most deeply felt, deeply satisfying novel in English literature.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|This movie is great! Although it lacks some character development and the action goes on for a tiny but longer than I would have liked, this movie is extremely good! Loved it.
B000U6BT40|5.0|Love this show and am so glad it's on amazon instant video! It's so easy to watch anywhere I am.
B003FXXNH6|5.0|Love this DVD movie. It was an awesome watch, well worth the dollars spent to purchase. But it, watch...you will like it!
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|this light gives off lots of light, use it in bathroom for night trip there.  Like that it doesn't detect motion in day light.
B008602KQI|4.0|I haven't read the book yet but definitely enjoyed this movie. Love Jennifer Lawrence as the protagonist, as well as every other casting decision. I agree with some of the other reviewers who mentioned that the action, blood and desperation were whitewashed a little too much. It was hard to believe that this really took everything the tributes had--every time they ran or did anything, it was as though they had brand new energy and some soap. But other than that, a moving and very engaging movie. Can't wait to see the next one--and I will probably go read the book!
B00821OX98|4.0|great show , lots of action and interesting plot..good definition and no freezing ...that is great and no commercials which is even better..you really can enjoy the shows and movies...
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Not a fan of the new app. Liked the old one a LOT better. Using Accuweather a lot more now.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I absolutely love this program. The script is accurate and engrossing. The characters are real. The clothing, hairstyles, autos etc are all true to the period being depicted.
B00333NCTM|5.0|This book will take you through Ozzy's Highs and Lows, I found myself laughing out loud and unable to put the kindle down at times when I should have been doing something else. Excellent read.
0895260131|3.0|I have read several other books in this \\"Politically Incorrect\\" series. I greatly enjoyed the series' guides to American history, the Constitution, and capitalism. This guide to Islam falls short of my expectations based on those excellent volumes.<br /><br />This book seems to be a mile wide and an inch deep. For instance, Islam mistreats women and encourages violence. Why not cite more contemporary example to support the argument? I don't have a great deal of knowledge about the history of Islam or the Crusades and would have liked this book to provide a little more historical background instead of just trying to counter all the PC myths about Islam. Really, the factual shortcomings seem to be caused by an attempt to shoehorn in a lot of material into one book.<br /><br />I also noticed that in a lot of the \\"Jesus vs. Muhammad\\" sidebars, the author liked to cite the biblical source of the quote from Jesus but the contrasting quote from Muhmmad was not cited. That is rather unscholarly. Robert Spencer is no Thomas E. Woods, Jr.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|love this game! I play it with my girl. its fun finding objects in a picture. I look fwd to playing it everyday
B00AEJM6H2|2.0|why all of the sudden is it telling me I need an internet connection to play the game? I've played it HUNDREDS of times without...piece of $&amp;!#
B00CRS88IO|4.0|This was a good read. Not the best book I have read but enjoyable enough. Good for a dreary winters day
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is actually cute and it runs well, looks good, And doesn't get all laggy. Only con is all the ads for you to buy stuff, but that's to be expected in marketing.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|I thought that it would be better movie and it kept going and going and it got Very Slow putting me to sleep!
B00B9366VO|5.0|Sound City---extremely well done.  Will be especially interesting to those who love rock and roll and those that love the guitar.  Well done and extremely well put together.
B004YOEFG8|5.0|It was amazing to see this in 3D and blue-ray. The clarity was excellent and the entire family enjoyed it immensely.
B0070R40V6|5.0|The first instalment of A Song of Ice and Fire paves the way for a great series. Great writing and very enjoyable read.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's hard to play at first. I wish it had more explanation. However it is addicting and I<br />enjoy playing it. My eight year old loves it too.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|This app is not for kindle fire so if you read the comments thay lie and also im not going out with saleena Gomez
B002VNFNTC|4.0|Bukowski is a fantastic writer and his ability to convey the emotions of his protagonist to the reader is uncanny. A brutal look into the formative years of a tortured yet brilliant mind.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I had no problem downloading the android app for my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2.  Since I've had a Kindle in the past I already had an account with Amazon.  The sample downloaded smoothly but when I went to purchase the book, there was a problem seeing it on my tablet.  Not sure if this is Samsung's problem or Amazon's.  I could see the purchase on my Kindle account although clicking &#34;deliver to my android&#34; had no result.  After many attempts and much frustration I was able to &#34;refresh&#34; my screen and get the book.
B00881VLCE|5.0|If you'll like doing jigsaw puzzles then try this I would recommended it to anyone.  You'll see why I rated it 5 stars.
B00CHMBQRA|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie; however, please be aware, it is also called 'The Expatriate' (which is the title by which I purchased this movie). Erased (The Expatriate) is stylised an old fashioned thriller which pits the wrtiter against the viewer with a good set of actors(actresses) along for the ride. Though some scense are almost somewhat chiche in their presentation, this by no way detracts from the movie which moves along a reasonably quick pace (though not so fast as to wash over the story line and leaving the viewer wondering what just has happened or whether a scene was deleted and left on the cutting room floor). I enjoyed this movie from start to finish, I did not give it 5 stars as it did lack a certain 'WOW' factor but for the opportunity to tune out and enjoy some good TV/DVD then one cannot go far wrong with this film.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Phenomenal acting. especially the little boy. He broke my heart with his performance!  epected mcconoguy or witherspoon to steal the ashow,  but it was definately the boy and his parents
B004DK5CW4|5.0|We had looked everywhere for this movie to buy. My husband wanted it so badly. I got the bright idea to check with Amazon.com. Sure enough, they had it. My husband has watched it everyday since it arrived in the mailbox. We love this movie. I haven't failed to cry,even though, I know what is going to happen.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|Could not make head or tail of the store, lost from very beginning the only reason I stay till the end was because of the stares they still did a good job of acting.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Please so good it's best ever. I bet you like too go sho dog. Hollar Like I awesome FUN. GREAT GAME
B000JMKO3C|4.0|With a dark title like Veronika Decides to Die, I was quick to turn this book down.  A friend of my sister's changed my mind.  He is not the bookish nerd type at all and yet he recommended this book when I mentioned the bizarre title that was on my mind.  Then I felt all judgmental and figured if it could get this guy to read, it must have some value.  I started in and was swept quickly away with the story.  It was such a genuinely good story of people.  The characters were so deliciously developed and you got to feel invested in these \\"crazy\\" people.  The travel through shocking moments made it assuage that thirst for a good read.  I don't know how I felt about the ending, but it left a good taste.  I love a book that can take you where it's going, even if you don't want to go there, and convince you that you want to come along.
1781162646|5.0|Another amazing story from King. This one sucks you in from the beginning (as most of his do). Joyland is a murder mystery/ghost story rolled into one, with the story of lost loves, first loves and learning to mend a broken heart done in only a way that King can pull off. I loved every moment of it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think more updates better the game and more people will by it, it really is great iron bars and doors would be good and switches. Signing out... Skull Basher
B001ECDVKE|5.0|I couldnt find this piece of cinematic history anywhere in my town. I ended up saving at least 10 dollars and got it within 3 days.
B00C061I1M|5.0|When describing this album to a friend I said that Valerie June is the female<br />counterpart to Otis Taylor--blending to various degrees Jazz, Soul, Folk, Rock<br />and Blues into a united \\"rootsie\\" whole. If the first song (Workin' Woman blues)on Ms. June's new album was played by Otis Taylor with his daughter<br />Cassie singing you would not argue that it was one of his compositions and<br />arrangements, especially with the lovely horn work. With further listening<br />though you find some distinct differences--in some songs there is a decidedly<br />\\"garage rock\\" sound that you don't really find in Otis Taylor's music.<br />  Dan Auerbach's production and guitar work seems to have had a lot to do<br />with the brilliance and character of this record, his gritty production<br />seems to perfectly balance Valerie's pure childlike voice and add real spice<br />to her sometimes simple, stark songs. Let's hope they do a few albums together as<br />this one has been stuck in my CD player since I got it. All the songs are great,<br />I especially find the title song, The Hour and Shotgun to be masterful.<br />  It is good to see people like Ms. June, Otis<br />Taylor, The Carolina Chocolate Drops, Cold Specks etc. bring some<br />earthiness back to and not be embarrassed by their esthetically important musical heritage-- they are actually bringing something vital and fresh into the \\"retro<br />roots\\" mix. Buy this CD!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It was great to be able to watch season 3 without commercials and all in one evening.  Looking forward to season 4
0307887448|5.0|It was worth buying. The book is not your usual sci-fi book. Though it can get a little slow at some parts, people with interest in vintage things can truly enjoy this book.
B00004Y6NP|5.0|Had the cassette of this years ago and it finally broke.  This is always so calming (mostly) to me and reminds me of a time in my life that I miss.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Fun game and very challenging. I've played.similar games so I knew to just.start tapping away and something would eventually happen. Color patterns are very important so pay attention!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|If you're anything like me you suffered through A Feast for Crows just DYING for a few chapters dedicated to all of your favorite characters. Well, for all that AFfC lacked, A Dance with Dragons has in its possession. You'll find this book studded with chapters for Tyrion, Dany, Jon Snow, Jaime Lannister, and even a few special new perspectives of longtime secondary characters. If you've come this far in your journey through the song of fire and ice, you'd best carry on. But be wary, fellow journeyman, for the night (like this book) is dark and full of terrors.
B001EBWINQ|4.0|The movie was good in general and the actors had good performances. The war story behind the movie makes it more interesting.
B005LAII4E|1.0|The only reason why I am giving this bloated piece of diarrhea 1 star is because of The Rock (and because Amazon won't allow me to give it a 0). Now I wasn't expecting a 'Godfather' strong plot line from this movie. I was expecting a cliche filled, linear action movie and John Chu found a way to mess that up too. This movie was all over the place, the action sequences were pretty dull, and I had no idea why everyone was fighting. Just a giant BLEEP storm. 1/5<br /><br />OH and one more thing. If RZA is in your movie, it is guaranteed to suck.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|I wish the games was longer but I love playing it over and over again because I see how long I can survive so I will definitely buy it if I had money
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|I enjoyed The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry.  Joyce's writing was descriptive and I could feel her characters jump off the page.<br />She utilized similes and descriptive words to bring her story to life.  I not only could visualize the Harold and the other characters in the book, but it was as though his shoes and clothing were right in front of me.<br /><br />A &#34;slice-of life&#34; novel...with so much to say about relationships, choices we make, struggle and inner turmoil.
B00CWV9FQA|5.0|My grandkids love it and that's all that's important. They ask me if they can play it every time they visit.
1582406634|1.0|Not impressed with the lazy slop that is passed off as &#34;art&#34; these days.<br />I'm almost afraid to want to know what the drawings and illustrations were that did not get &#34;selected.&#34;
B00CL0J99K|1.0|Iron Man 1 was a delight. Iron Man 2 made me question where exactly they were taking this trilogy. Iron Man 3 confirmed all of my fears. Why, it isn't even an Iron Man movie! It is a Tony Stark movie, and a poor one at that. The plot is very poor and at many times during the movie you are just left thinking to yourself, \\"what is the point of this scene?\\" The movie is filled with cliches that make you wanna drown a bag of puppies, and just when you think it's over Shane Black just shoves another one down your throat. Now if you're a superhero movie watcher, nothing anyone says will stop you from watching this movie and I understand that. BUT, if you are a casual movie watcher, this movie will make you angry and possibly leave your spouse. 1/5<br /><br />OH and one last thing. For what this movie did to the Mandarin...an iconic Iron Man villain...unforgivable.
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|I bought this DVD for my husband who has been a Leonard Cohen fan for many years...so I watched it with him and was blown away by the music and the pure poetry of this performance! This man is a genius and I so wish I had been introduced to him years ago. We have many of Cohen's CDs but to actually watch him perform is such a treat and I'd recommend this DVD to anyone who appreciates his talent!
B00BC24NT4|5.0|Every so often, it's nice to have a quietly compelling story to read.  One that makes you think a bit, as you follow the twisting trails of evidence to its ultimate conclusion. This is one of those books. The kind you can't put down easily, if at all.  Bond-style flash is thankfully absent, and the heros, such as they are, are rather flawed, but in a totally human way. If you enjoy Mr. le Carre's books, you won't want to miss this one.
0345529057|5.0|Awesome. More than expected, perfect reading to finish every day, Its really hard to read a little. Fully recommended, the book does not include sex scenes from TV series.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is the most terrific app in the whole wide world. I am addicted!! There I sooooo much stuff to pin you wouldn't even believe it! Whoever created pinterest is a GENIUS!!! Buy this app! You will not regret it! When you create an account, all you have to do is make a username, password, and put in your email account, no adress or anything!! Or, you can sign up from Facebook or Twitter and find friends from there! Once you start, you can't stop! Pinterest is full of recipes, home design, fashion, animals, photography...and, well... anything your heart desires!
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|Wanted to love this!  Very funny in some parts, but also random and lacked a good plot (or ending!)<br /><br />If you're expecting any real career advice, or working mom tips...look elsewhere.  Funny, quick read though.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|Verbose.  Full of historical information ...but never come out and says it all....in one complete thought.......made me rancorous at times.....then big let down..........
B00CM9JKQM|4.0|With all the crap I have learned about Geoff Tate in the last few weeks..  I'm happy for these guys.  I still say Geoff has a great voice, and he was great when teamed with DeGarmo, and I like most of the guys he hired in for F.U.- and it is a decent album also- but this album opens a new door or chapter, and I am excited about their future.  went through this before with Deep Purple and rainbow- can only hope we will get double the great music.
B0059WTMLW|3.0|Easy to use, some of the puzzles are harder than they are rated, I like that it saves and you can return when ever you want.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|I think I like everything about this book!!<br />I like the way it's written, with either Parks or Eleanors perspektive, and I like how the story is told. I love both Park and Eleanor. I was a teenager in 1986, maybe that has something to do with it but I don't think things really has changed that much when it comes to true love or just beeing a teenager. Or how different life can be. It is not a &#34;sappy&#34; love story, it's a tale about life and of love. I think everybody can enjoy this book. Read it and you'll feel a bit more than you did before.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like the new Accuweather app. It has just about any information that the user would want.  My only criticism is that the pages are cluttered and not as user-friendly as the earlier version.
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|This app is awesome u absolutely NEED to get it ! And the best thing is  ITS FREE!, So if u don't have it get now mow now I love it
B003L77GRO|5.0|I could hardly wait for it to arrive.  It came exactly as described, and as true fans of the Dexter series, we were thrilled to own what will one day be classic TV viewing for the new millenium.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I read the first book of the trilogy, enjoyed it, but I'm not a person who likes series, and much less best sellers, so I never went on reading the other books... until I read what Larsson's widow, Eva Gabrielsson, wrote about the author's life and death. Only then I realized the accuracy of the trilogy and was fully aware of the cruel reality underlying this fabulous fictional story. Thank you Stieg for exposing the men who hate women, in Sweden and everywhere, and thanks Eva for exposing the greedy men that attempt to monopolize Stieg's legacy and make you disappear. Hold in there.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|A great movie. Saw it in the theater and couldn't wait for it to become a available. Received it promptly and in great condition.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I was so excited when I found out that there was a new Gaiman novel! This story was so nice to read. It was a bit short and I wish there would have been more back story on the Hempstocks but I enjoyed it none the less. I hope it doesn't get ruined by Hollywood because this story belongs within imagination and not on screen.
B00003CX9W|5.0|I loved this dvd  because they had a making of Fantasia included as a bonus feature which the latest reissue did not have.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|this game is fun and challenging. very addictive. it crashes sometimes on my kindle. hopefully they fix this in an update. recommend.
B005PK57IK|5.0|This is Such a well written show with very well developed, real, and complex characters! It is amazing how from one episode to the next, the characters you love and hate can switch places, much like real life.
B0094K1MH2|5.0|Movie was very good! Kids loved it. It is their second time watching  the movie. Streaming quality was very good also.
B00DI75SWM|5.0|I love it! :D It shares expressions when words cant. I love this app. So, get this app. That's and order!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Accurate, and provides on the information needed to plan your day. If you travel or work outside this is very good.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great great book! It's a page turner! Every time I reread it, it get ever better! I love this author!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome it can be for girl and boys. I it awesome. I also got the computer game. So it's almost like a way better game of legos.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I have read everything I can get my hands on that deals with the 1st century.  This is the most comprehensive and well reserched work I have read.
B00AYXNKIC|5.0|This game in my opinion is better than trials xtreme 2, it adds a lot of new features.<br />For one thing it added a new in-game money system, and with it you can buy new bikes and clothes with it. Of course your guy will start out with horrible clothing, but that is typical with these types of games. When you complete a level for the first time and get three stars, you can expect $500-700, after that you will get less each time you replay it. The first bike costs 50,000 and the other one costs 200,000. It is a good strategy to get the better one, as you need it to complete the last level. The clothes are a little pricy if you want something good, but you want to get the bike first.<br />New obstacles and scenery were added, including giant wheels you drive inside.<br />They also added a racing element to the game, where you can compete with other people's scores or race yourself. This is a nice feature, but it is not as much of a get 3 stars game as it is a racing game now. Some might like that change, others  may not. One extra thing I noticed was that you can't use button controls anymore and have to tilt, which isn't a big deal but worth mentioning.<br />At the end it is a great app and well worth the $3. It is a great follow-up to the previous version.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Would recommend this app over all others, have tried 4 different weather apps and this one works the best overall.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Rodriquez is fantastic. Can't imagine why his albums didnt become a raving success in USA. I listen to this album everyday. Have Cold Facts and Searching For Sugarman on my iPhone and listen to him while I walk 8 miles a day .<br />Would love to hear him in person in Radio City Music Hall in October.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I like it very much.<br />It's free, it's Despicable Me, and it's worth it.<br />It won't hurt to download it.
0451197879|4.0|Written under the Bachman name, this book is a little darker than most King Novels which tend to end on a good note. However, it is still an entertaining read.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I was looking through the pics and thought this would be a great game(if I had the money) and I looked to the left and it said it was FREE!!! I love this game and you'll find me playing it a lot..many times my mom will say it's time to go and I'd say one moment I have to feed my dragons! Great game. =D
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Not sure if i really wanted this, but it was an option with the weather app i bought. Have to admit, I love this alarm clock app, great features. Was a smart purchase since I travel a lot and have a very busy schedule.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game is you like using your think your way out the box skills..some are a little advanced but over all its a really good thinking game
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|The game is so much fun and very realistic and cool to play it is great for kids to play and it is a great brain teaser
1118026470|1.0|I personally have not read this book yet, but I have had so much trouble with the packaging and shipping of this book. I ordered this book new and it came in a small box that you just tuck the ends in the box (this ruins the book because it catches on it). I had the book replaced and the same book came the second time the same way with bent edges of the book and some book &#34;paint&#34; taken off because it moves and everything. You would think that they would learn after the first time especially after I explained why I wanted it replaced because of the way it was packaged and shipped. I had ordered two other books with this one and they came in separate box that had bubble wrap in it. I don't understand why they can't ship all books and items this way or at least more secure and better. I usually don't have this much trouble with Amazon, but this book I have had a lot of trouble with it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a very nicely executed puzzle game, with clever challenges and lovely graphics. I would love to play a sequel. The hint system works smoothly, giving just enough help but not giving everything away.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Absolutely loved this book it was captivating from the start. The book has an element of surprise that I wasn't expecting
B009WUAK2M|4.0|Comparable to first Expendables. A bit predictable and contains some cheesy lines. But, the actors that get together to work on this movie are always enjoyable to watch.
0738212415|3.0|Simple lessons for someone who has always wanted to draw.  Lots of helpful illustrations.<br /><br />Fun with a pencil by Loomis is another good beginner book.  Natural Way to Draw by Nicolaides is much better but a bit intimidating for a beginner.
B001H4R4LQ|4.0|The whole (Inheritance  series) was very good. Paolini is a good writer and has a great imagination while seeming to tie the story line to present conditions.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I've wanted to read this book because of how popular it is on tumblr for weeks now and I read it in a day. TFiOS was such a great book and had such a wonderful plot. There's not many books that can make me cry, but this one definitely made me cry. Thank you John Green for such an awesome book, yet horribly sad book.
B0077EBWVI|4.0|Although this is a remake, the updated version is interesting and contains its own details to appeal to the next generation.
B0016Q2D5M|5.0|this is one of my favorite movies, so I was glad when it arrived quickly, and it was new as indicated
B004UAKAE2|5.0|Although the production is not nearly as slick as Downton Abbey, it is a far superior series. It has depth of meaning, great characters, interesting stories, and, unlike Downton Abbey, it is not predictable. This is great television. Downton Abbey is ridiculous and pandering. Upstairs Downstairs is intelligent and subtle and enduring.
B00BEIYH6U|3.0|My (young) adult children introduced me to Kick Ass several years ago, which I loved as an over-the-top farce with ironic humor, great music, excellent sets, bizarre but interesting characters, a brilliant style of directing and filming, and an actual storyline that had a beginning, middle, and end. I found Kick Ass 2 entertaining, it held my interest until the end, but it was not near as good as the original. A strong story line was simply missing. The plot I am sure was written to be consistent with the comic book series, but I had honestly hoped for more than just the usual teenage angst, the mean high school girls throwing up in the lunch room, and Red Mist changing his name to something unprintable and making odd fashion choices. Still, this is a must see for those interested in following the original story, seeing what happens to the surviving characters from Kick Ass, and of course those interested in seeing how far Hit Girl will evolve as a super hero.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I would tell you how much I love this show but you would think I was a fanatical fan.  I was a fan of Sherlock Holmes long before hearing of this program so I was really hoping this would be a quality show.  Character is very true to the book and both main characters play their part exceptionally well.  I will be sad when I have watched all the available episodes and have to wait for a new season to start.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. I seriously cannot playing it. The only thing I would recommend is being able to get the gru coin things easier....
B000EQ5HSK|5.0|Love this Canon EW-83J Lens Hood for EF-S 17-55 F2.8 IS.  It is the best ever lens hood for this Canon lens.
B004XXIHS2|5.0|If you enjoy a good mystery, this will not disappoint.  The book transports you to another time and also<br />captures your attention right from the start.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Easy to follow, step by step instructions makes it easy (so far at least, I'm not finished yet)  to build your kindle book. :)
B005ZMUQCK|5.0|My kids love the movie, they watch it over and over.  Worth it for me, but 15 bucks? and its not even Blu-ray, seems expensive.
0525953728|5.0|This is a great book about the back story on bringing down Osama Bin Laden.  No nonsense, no politics, nothing but Seal Team Six commitment to the mission.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app works great with Kindle Fire HD providing many details about battery usage, time needed to charge the device with USB/AC, time left until next charging will be required and all of this is presented in a very user friendly way. Good job!
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I really enjoyed the book and find myself recommending to friends both inside IT and out.  A great story describing what it takes to win it today's business environment.  Truly inspiring.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|Husband and i got 30 minutes into this movie and turned it off. Too confusing. We were just looking for entertainment, maybe we were not in the right mindset to watch this.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|It's a cute game. Fun to play and easy to learn, even my seven year old likes to play it!
1250029465|5.0|Having seen the great review for the book \\"A Street Cat Named Bob\\" in the USA Today newspaper, I knew I had to get it and read it right away.  Being owened by a cat for these past 14 years, I know what James means about the love and affection and intelligence a cat has.  But to bare your soul the way James has done is in itself amazing.  Most of us would want to hide all the bad things in our life.  Taking time off only for meals and to sleep, I read it and felt bad when I had finished it.  What would Bob and James do next?  Luckly, there is another book out about the two.  Get both books and enjoy a few hours visiting with Bob and James.  Marcia S.  USA
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game  is so fun! I love all the horses! This game is awesome!!!!! You must get this awesome app
B009M588K8|2.0|COMPARED TO CLANCY OR MARCINKO, N.E.D SUCKS. COMPARED TO CUSSLER, IT SUCKS TOO. SLOW READING, MORE LIKE OLD MAN'S WAR TALE. I AM SURE THERE WAS A LOT MORE TO TELL, IN A BETTER MANNER, EVEN WITH THE SECRETIVENESS OF PROCEDURES BEING KEPT
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I downloaded this on my Kindle Fire and it works Great and does the job in helping me to relax and concentrate when I have too many things on my mind.
1444777556|5.0|I was so happy to see the sequel to \\"A Street Cat Named Bob\\".  It was as much fun to read as the first book by James and Bob.  One feels the pain of being a street person and a drug addict.  But thanks to Bob, the cat, this is another redeeming story.  I highly recommend this book to any one who has ever been owned by a street cat.  Marcia A  USA
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|The book provides interesting data to back up the 5-2 plan. It's a short read and a simple idea. I was on the diet for 8 weeks before reading the book. It would have been useful to have some of the ideas presented before starting, but not nessasary.  3 months in and the diet keeps getting easier to do. I look forward to my fast days. My target goal keeps going lower. 1-2 pounds a week are disappearing. I've never really dieted before but this sounded so simple I knew I could do it.
B0015T7Q98|5.0|This album is so freakin beautiful and Ryan Ross did a lot on it so you should buy it cause it's more creative than almost all other music out there
B0063M22QO|5.0|I have had several Mahjong versions of games and they really help my concentration and it is also very relaxing after a busy day.
B00A285OOW|5.0|I love everything Philippa Gregory has written and this book is no exception. She grabs your full attention from the very first page.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|love this game. took quite awhile to down load but well worth it. I will definately play more games from this developer. The graphics are bright . Objects are challenging to find but not impossible.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Been waiting for weeks for the update and its finally here!!!!! One of the best games ever! Worth your money.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I downloaded this on my Kindle but have not had the chance to use it yet so it would not be fair to rate it but in all honesty, I'm sure it works just fine.
0670014893|5.0|I came late to John Le Carre.  Whether his latest novel, \\"A Delicate Truth,\\" is better or worse than \\"Tinker\\" or half a dozen other earlier works, I couldn't say.  What I can say is that \\"Truth\\" is a very satisfying read, and its ambivalent ending -- emergency vehicle sirens closing in on the injured protagonist, at an internet cafe, as he releases evidence of a government conspiracy to the entire fourth estate -- makes clear that the 82-year-old master of the spy novel intends to produce one or two more Toby Bell novels before he's done.  Still, unless you like sequels, the loose ends and ambiguous plot developments of this novel may prove bothersome.<br /><br />What's good about \\"Truth\\"?  The topicality; the dialogue; the local color; the pacing; the jaundiced view of political animals, career-oriented government hacks, public-private partnerships, American and British exceptionalism, religion, modern marriage, and the like; the time shifts; the sideways exploration of character; the nuance.  Sentence for sentence, Le Carre is a very good writer.<br /><br />Some time ago LeCarre wrote a fact piece for The New Yorker about one of his experiences as a British intelligence officer: a posturing senior operative aborted a \\"mission\\" in a foreign bar when Le Carre's gun fell out of his pants to the floor.  I hope he writes more.  I couldn't care less about the Kardashians, but I would like to know what, other than the pretensions of his peers, led Le Carre to abandon a career in intelligence after just five years.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|This is a great rendition of an old classic novel!  Unlike other &#34;Emma's&#34; I have seen, this one gives more history in the beginning which is better for the overall understanding of the story line.  It was well don't and pretty to watch!
B00000J2PH|5.0|I finally decided to get a digital copy and the bonus cut &#34;Out in the Cold&#34; alone was worth it.  &#34;Way Over Yonder&#34; continues to be one of those songs my mind goes to in troubled times.  Carole's raspy, soulful voice adds feeling to the lyrics of life.  &#34;You've got a Friend,&#34; &#34;Tapestry,&#34; &#34;Smackwater Jack,&#34;...I've got an old friend in Carole King's &#34;Tapestry.&#34;
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Google does the job on my Kindle Fire, it works like it is supposed to work, Google almost works silently so I don't even know how much it is really helping and doing for me.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Wonderful music. Good story. Very entertaining . Maggie Smith is wonderful as usual. as all of the rest of the cast.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I hope I never meet any people with the many warped ideas of marriage and how married people think as most of the people in this book seemed to think.  In all my 76 years I have NEVER meet such mean people that apparently thought they were normal!!This was a waste of time and money for me!!!!
1469240661|5.0|Great non fiction book,  and great audio quality on the audio book. After reading this book I am now a Ross Perot fan. This book is about true patriots and Americans.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|I'm still reading this book, but I love it.  There's so much in here that I didn't know about.  It underscores my own personal beliefs that once in office and when not campaigning, the role of the president goes well beyond the traditional democrat/republican political drama we Americans have to endure every day.  This book actually restores my faith that our presidents look beyond politics and try to do what is in the best interest for the country - and won't hesitate to contact and seek the advice of former presidents to make the best possible decision.  Fascinating material and entertaining to read.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I lost my kindle charger and this is a perfect replacement. It is exactly what I was looking for~ it is worth it.
B004FHBO9K|5.0|Classic Americana, everyone that I've played this LP for has loved it. No exceptions. Had to buy it on cd, also, to listen to it in the car.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|This is a nice movie to watch on a lazy Saturday afternoon, not the best but also not the worst. Also Elizabeth Banks is HILARIOUS! Love her character!
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|This is one of our favs - will be for a long time to come. I am buying a 3D TV just so I can watch this on it!!
B002N44XSG|5.0|Fun read, Percy is as funny as always! This little book definitely doesn't seem like it was just made for more money. The Sword of Hades story especially seems important for The Heroes of Olympus series...  Recommended for any Percy Jackson reader!
B009NY43NY|4.0|Before all the loose ends are wrapped all neatly with a bow, Sookie is accused of murdering Arlene.<br /><br />I thought the start was a tad slow to catch my interest.
B000E1JOSE|5.0|This is a must buy for Orbison fans. I grew up listening to his music and never stopped. The quality of his distinct voice never changed. If you want to take it to the next level buy the Blu ray of this concert, it's outstanding with all the supporting artists. It's in black and white, their was a reason for this in that the contract between then and twenty to 30 years was inconsequential. God bless Roy, he made such an impact on music.
B004J4WLPU|5.0|Really enjoyed this book particularly the manor in which it was written.  So many subplots that were all brought together in the end. Kept me turning pages!!!!!
8845230457|5.0|It is my favorite book as a child, only now I get to read it in Italian. It helps me learn the language as a complement to my class.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was a fun game  very challenging.  Was mentally fun but hard to do at some e points.  Would recommend for all ages .  Good learning tool
B000EUDAWG|4.0|Purchased the spider got a practical joke, Worked very well. My mother used it to scare my husband, who hates spiders.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book is very thought provoking as it is written by a physician.  Physician's are often so scientific they give little thought to a superior being in their life.  My daughter is a physician and I plan on sharing this with her...
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I love this game. I downloaded not knowing what to expect but it was very interesting and kept my attention for a long time
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I watched Season 3 of Downton Abbey as it was aired.  Then I watched Seasons 1 & 2 on Amazon Prime.  I decided to watch Series 3 again on Amazon to get ready for Season 4 in the Fall.  The cast, the writers, the costumes and the decor are all excellent.  It is interesting to watch them change as they go from year to year.  Before you watch Season 3, there is a short synopsis of Seasons 1 and 2.  This helps in placing the people and events.  I do hope they have one for all 3 seasons before Season 4 begins.  My husband also enjoyed these series and he's not one for period pieces.  It was just great!
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|great on blu ray... lots of great extras and the fact that all of the movies are in one box set for such a great price it was a no brainer even tho i already had most of this on DVD
B0067TGSOK|5.0|Unlike most self-help books, this books strays away from vagueness and ambiguity. It gives you specific examples of its practices in action and gives you poignant advice on how to get your venture on track and keep it there
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|So far so good with this charger!  I can charge both my iphone and android at the same time and they charge much faster!!!
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|THE LUCK OF THE WEISSENSTEINERS is an extremely well written novel about two families during the horrific events of World War II.<br /><br />Christoph Fischer hooked me in with wanting to read how the romance between a German bookseller and a young, Jewish woman would develop, during a time in history when the possibility of such a union would be an extreme conflict and life threatening challenge.<br /><br />I fell in love with Greta and Wilhelm, with the way their character's are portrayed and with their story. I also love this author's style of writing. His storytelling voice is descriptive, utilizing all the senses, mesmerizing and strong.<br /><br />It is obvious that Mr. Fischer did a lot of research for this book and kudos to him for using the research in a way that gives the reader the realism of World War II, at the same time is able to weave his knowledge into a fictional account, without having it sound like a history book. He writes the historical facts and cultural differences into a great work of fiction that literally has the reader feel like they are part of that era.<br /><br />This book is filled with a lot of emotion and it will touch every reader who absorbs the full impact of Mr. Fischer's excellent way of crafting a story. My emotions ran from anger on behalf of the characters and heartbreak, as well as providing smiles at some light hearted, comical moments. This is what I consider a well rounded story, when it can encapsulate all these emotions, giving me an overall thrilling read.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, and especially to readers in a book club as it opens the door for a lot of discussion
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|Probably my favorite series, it has the sarcastic one (O'Neil), the smart one (Carter), the straight man (Teal'c) and the inquisitive one (Jackson) who together make a great team.
B005LAII4E|3.0|I had not seen the original \\"G. I. Joe\\" but my teen aged son told me this one is much better, so I decided to buckle up.  I'll say this.  People looking for a complicated plot, or complicated characters, or character development, or well scripted dialog, or logic, or science, or reasonableness please don't waste your time.  You get a sense for all of this right off the bat.  The president has ordered the \\"Joes\\" (that's what they're called) to go to North Korea and rescue some guy that is being held prisoner and return him to the U. S.  From the time the order is given to the time it took to be back in the U. S. A. took 7 minutes if I'm not mistaken.<br /><br />So goes the rest of the film as the \\"Joes\\" fight the evil \\"Cobras\\" who have managed to replace the president for evil purposes.  So we get lots of explosions, killing, fighting, shooting, stabbing, things getting blown up, chases, wrecks, crashes and did I mention explosions?  All within the PG-13 check list, of course.  So here is the good stuff.  There is a terrifically staged and executed scene where a pair of Ninjas (Snake Eyes & some hot chick in yellow) go up a frozen mountain to get one of their former compatriots (now a bad guy) and bring him back home.  There is some very tricky camera and stunt work involved as a horde of bad guys in red suits try to kill the 2 good guy/gal.  It's all very cool.<br /><br />The Blu ray transfer is very special also.  It comes with a 1080p video resolution and is of demo grade.  The colors are beautiful and there is every color imaginable from bright yellow to red to some wonderful blacks.  The facial detail is remarkable.  Sweat, hair, pores all clearly defined.  It doesn't get any better than this.  The audio as well is perfect.  This time we have a Dolby TrueHD 7.1 and boy is it a doozy.  From the beginning to the end, all the speakers fill up with great, clear, perfectly balanced audio.  Subs will get a work out as well.  This, again is demo grade stuff.  Extras include a commentary track with the director and producer, 8 short (8-10 min.) featurettes under the banner of \\"G.I. Joe: Declassified,\\" some deleted scenes, a DVD and a digital copy.clude a commentary track with the director and producer, 8 short (8-10 min.) featurettes under the banner of \\"G.I.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great game. everyday she plays and learns hand eye coordination with it. I would highly recommend for ages 3 and up.
B009LUP5XM|2.0|Was disorganized and had a point for sales reps that avoid what makes them uncomfortable but not for everyone. ok
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the book everything about it was good. It may have been the best book I've read honestly. It was awesome :)
B00AG297GK|5.0|Have been a fan of dacha baron since Ali g this is another good one. I think the only reason people didn't like it was because they are to uptight
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|M'y grandson is really involved with this.  He loves it and is learning some valuable principals. He loves it so i do also.
B0094K1MH2|5.0|It was so well animated, I almost forgot I was watching a cartoon! I loved the plot and imagery. I may just have to watch it again!
B004HWYTP4|4.0|The all-star cast of this movie drew us in, plus seeing the previews for the sequel.  When we first started watching this, I wasn't terribly impressed.  I thought it was going to be mainly action.  It did finally pick up, but I also discovered it's some action with a bunch of comedy to fill in.  I enjoyed it overall, but I husband really like it.
B000JCSPG0|5.0|The film that started the TV show- the good one (Starget SG-1). The garbage spinoffs came much later, the sub-par Stargate Atlantis and even worse- Stargate Universe; which was basically just Sex and the City/Desperate house wives/insert random generic pointless ever perpetuating useless drama driven sopa opera tv show here- oh but &#34;IN SPACE&#34;!!!!<br /><br />About the film itself. Very similar to Disney's 2001 animated &#34;Atlantis: the Lost Empire&#34;, except live action and better special effects of course. This film has absolutely stunningly beautiful scenes. It is a blend of fantasy/sci-fi/ancient civilization secrets epic. Think Lawrence of Arabia meets The Mummy meets Star Wars. Highly recommended, also check out the TV show if you liked this!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Ok so I'm like most people....I love minecraft cuz everyone in fifth grade does.... but one little thing the first picture on the screen where u buy the app is not real in this version. Only in the iPad iPod and iPhone version
B00ECU2RGY|1.0|the movie would actually be really good I believe.  If you can watch it I have been watching it for 3 hours and have not finished since it starts and stops every 10 min.  I do not understand seems funny that I can switch to Netflix and Hulu and watch whatever I want with no problems.  Looks like Amazon needs to work on their video products.
B008Y7IP0S|5.0|still great after all these years. exciting, funny, entertaining. I'd say better than the remake. pat Morita and Jackie Chan are equally good, but Ralph is much better than the Smith young man.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|This movie is funny, positive, and easy to watch with the kiddos over and over again. This is a great way to pass a busy line on my kindle.
1596354208|3.0|This would be a good book from which to learn to make shapes. I don't necessarily think I would wear some of this jewelry, but the shapes are interesting and instructive. Including beads is a useful touch as well. I took Marilee's class on Craftsy and she explained the &#34;folded join&#34;, a technique I had been searching for in several books. The video did show this join, but not very well. (The photos in the video often did not show things very well, I thought. Either her hands were covered from view, or in shadow, or the camera was moving around and missed the hands entirely, etc.) I did get some idea of how to do it, but could use some clearer instructions.<br />Marilee knows what she's doing, but her delivery is very quiet and un-animated and somewhat slow in the video.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|The game keeps you interested ,Keeps you coming back for more it is a very good and built game I rate it  5 because it keeps me interested.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Not only do my husband and I love this movie our 4 year old son. This is a great movie I can only hope that Despicable Me 2 as just as great.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Enjoyable, Not as good as his first two books, but still an  endearing story. Highly recommend this book to all.
B000S1M9LY|3.0|Maybe I'm not deep enough to appreciate the genius, but this is a tough book to read. I'm only 20% through the Kindel book and I don't know if I will finish it.
0307476073|1.0|Not about the PCT...she only hiked part of it anyway. Most of the book is just a series of depressing stories about her messed up life. I wondered why it was so popular until I found out Oprah was behind it...figures.
B006IYG5HE|5.0|This author was recommended by local paper. The Snowman, specifically, but I decide to try The Redbreast to get a feel for the author. It is difficult because there are lots of Norwegian titles, locations, and expressions. Most I figured out or guessed at logically. It also skips back and forth between WWII and the present. Political alliances are very difficult to follow especially when the characters are not clearly established until the end. (This is a part of the mystery to be solved!) I enjoyed it once I adapted to the story's evolution. I will probably try the Snowman or another Harry Hole mystery soon.
B00BPWDMP2|4.0|I enjoyed their music, but not one of my favorite of their CDs.  The more I listened, the more I liked it.
B00AHJL7BK|4.0|this is a fun game that is challenging but not so hard that you cannot win...reminds me of playing cross sums as a kid
B007V2UGPE|1.0|this game starts off easy, but you end up having to grind the s***of it to gain enough coins to upgrade and beat levels. also, the bonus of having a second mode sucks. you have to level up separately and the zombies are weak as hell.
B003QTWR08|4.0|Both of my kids, 4.5 & 20 months, were both very in to this movie.  The first 1/2 hour was a little slow, but got better after that.
1603427244|4.0|I liked the idea of going to one book to find instructions on the different methods of casting on and binding off.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|The added some language to the video that wasn't in the book, but I think it actually improved on the original.  This is my 3 and 4 year olds favorite movie.  They can't get enough of it!
B00DDZM0GQ|3.0|the tutorial doesn't really explain the game well. most of the time while playing the game, i'm not sure what i'm really doing. its a different kind of game, but thats not saying much for it.
0062280228|3.0|I didn't attach to any of the scenes in this book. It was promising at first, but the weirdness quickly became apparent as writer's convenience. This author uses fantasy/magic to fly out of corners the story paints itself into. I just don't have much respect for that. The characters are dull, and I skimmed the last 15 pages because I didn't care what became of them. One star for the title, two because it had cats.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This book was an escape with just the right amount of edginess. I loved that it took me to totally unexpected places.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I bought this through my Amazon Kindle and the download was easy and quick. I read through the entire book within a few days. I enjoyed reading this book on my Kindle very much.
B00C2U6G7C|4.0|Hans Zimmer is a great composer. This score does have some nice touching moments like &#34;Look to the Stars&#34;,  &#34;Tornado&#34; and &#34;This is Clark Kent&#34;. Also, great highs like &#34;General Zod&#34; and &#34;Arcade&#34; (both on the bonus cd) making this a good buy.<br /><br />The draw backs to this score is that it's not on smooth or continuing motion throughout the whole listening experience with most of the tracks ending very abruptly. Unlike Zimmer's  &#34;Gladiator&#34;. Also, there is no hero (Superman) theme. The pieces for Clark Kent are there, but so light and delicate I didn't realize there was even a them for him until I listened to the soundtrack a second time.<br /><br />It's great to finally see a new Superman movie that can step out of the huge shadow of &#34;Superman: The Movie&#34; and be it's own. Unfortunately the soundtrack does not do that.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|I love this I've played a lot of zombie and samurai ninja games this is amazing the second is so much better than the first you can change your hero like the kunoichi and better allies and special moves like the flash bomb or the bomb cart
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Recommended. I was surprised it ended, thought my kindle broke because I kept trying to turn the page. I wanted to know more. Story line hooks you.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I'm still in the process of reading this book, but reading it on my Kindle is awesome. I take it wherever I go most of the time. The download was easy and quick as well.
B008XG1X18|2.0|since the last update Pinterest constantly times out and or locks up. Too annoying to use now. Hope they decide to fix it.
B00EBBQXZ0|5.0|Scarface has always been one of my favorite films. When I saw this guide I just had to get it. I would never have believed that it was 30 years ago since this film was made. It's nearly time for another remake!<br /><br />It was fascinating to find out how they came up with the idea of doing a remake of the 1932 original, then how the project evolved and was put together.<br /><br />The author does a fantastic job of summing up this charismatic but evil gangster and goes into great detail about the content of the film<br /><br />I never realised how much controversy there was off-screen as well as on-screen with obstacles coming from many sources.  Record-breaking storms, being thrown out of Miami & disputes with film classification.<br /><br />If You are a Scarface fan then this book is a must!
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|This was my favorite summer read. Memories are tricky, at best, and Fowler has beautifully reminded us of that in this story.
B001C08RHA|5.0|This movie is so fun to watch. The DVD itself had very few scratches and the shipping was quick and painless. Overall I am satisfied with my purchase.
0307719774|4.0|I like this journal, it's a good time capsule of sorts.  It's got some good questions in it.  But keep in mind, there's not a lot of space to write.  I keep it as kind of a secondary journal.  It's a pretty plain journal in the front, but the gold rimmed pages look good.  And, that's about it.  It's not too fancy, but it serves the purpose.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love this game. App works great! It's fun playing with others, or with friends! It's just like sitting around the table with your family.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|I liked it.  Excellent acting.  Took a while to get into the movie, but overall enjoyed the movie.  Four Stars
B003UYV08E|5.0|First off, I enjoyed this movie very much when I received it. Second, the DVD was good. It didn't have any scratches on it and if it did I didn't notice them because the DVD ran beautifully. The DVD also came in its original packaging which is always a plus.
B004RCUJ9E|3.0|It checkers what do you expect.  The is not bad for a FAOTD.  This is nothing I would pay for.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is really addicting and this is like my number 1 favorite game in the whole universe. And the Despicable me or Despicable me 2 fans we be in LOVE with this AWESOME, cool, fantastic, and great game.
B002ZG97RE|4.0|The first 10-15 minutes contain first rate combat scenes, in fact, all the action scenes are very well done, conveying the sense of movement, uncertainty and chaos, intrinsic to men involved with urban conflict. The rest of the film is quite good, as well, although the plot is trite traditional conspiracy theory fiction. This is to say, the fictional hypothetical conspiracy theory of the causes for the second Iraq war, are made to seem quite real, through the skill of the Director, the performance of the Star, Matt Damon, and a fine supporting  cast. I suppose, however, if you take the fictional elements as statements in opposition to your political commitments, your annoyance with those elements of the movie, will detract from your enjoyment. (I must say, that to me, the films assertion that keeping the Iraqi Army and its Chieftains in their positions of power, would be the solution to the problem of democratizing Iraq before we withdrew our troops, seemed rather bizarre. Where that idea came from I cannot imagine.)  At anY rate, if you are able to separate your politics from that of the film's creators, you should enjoy this action-thriller.
B002ZG983M|5.0|I ordered the DVD without any problems. The shipping was on time, the DVD had few scratches and the DVD came with the original DVD cover. The movie is a bit different, but I enjoyed it nevertheless.
B0083TXXZ4|4.0|I bought this for my 10 year old son. He loves these Nerf guns and we all have a great time using them. This particular model has pretty good range and isn't too hard on the batteries.<br /><br />Unfortunately it only comes with 4 clips and 24 darts, so immediately after receiving it I ended up buying the other four clips and 24 more darts to fill it up.
0143123173|5.0|I think Walt Longmire is quickly moving to the top of my list of real men in literature.  I think he may soon surpass Jack Reacher (gasp!).
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I actually downloaded this book Ito my new Kindle in error, but it turned out to be no mistake.  I couldn't imagine I would like a book about two teens who were terminal.  It was so tender and so real.  I really enjoyed it.  I would highly recommend it.
B001QB9H10|4.0|Stathem is such a fun action hero to watch. I received this DVD without any problems Shipping was quick and painless and the DVD itself ran smoothly. It also came in its original packaging which is always a plus for me.
B002BWQ6H6|2.0|I would not recommend it. As stated above the story was difficult to follow although the characters were interesting. Enough said.
B00C6BB2JE|5.0|I love the movie, it is light, fun and action packed. This presentation is the best so far. Looks great on my shelf and it is worth the price.
B004WKH4PS|5.0|Joan Crawford and Ann Blythe deliver convincing performances in this story of sick relationships.  The dialogue is refreshingly terse and Joan Crawford never breaks character.  Great supporting cast.  This story of adult relationships was realistically conveyed without profanity or nudity -- a refeshing change.
B008XCM18Q|5.0|This book is awesome. I had a paperback copy of the book, but I had lost it somewhere. I ordered it off my Amazon Kindle and it was exactly the same as the book which is always a plus.
B00936A0RU|4.0|This movie focuses on the era of moonshine in this nation, but it covers so much more. It's about family, it's about coming of age and it's about sacrifice. The storyline was basic and easy to follow, but it was the quality of the acting that makes this movie a keeper. I really enjoy the Untouchables with Sean Connery for the action. Lawless is about the characters who made the moonshine, not the mobsters who profited from it.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|I love sci-fi movies but only those with a convincing story and plot. Although the plot is simple, still holds a few surprises. It is a bit slow at the beginning but still very enjoyable
B00CWY76CC|1.0|Couldn't guess what this was all about. Went online to get instructions and it seemed to make sense except nothing moved turned opened etc.  It would bring the item forward but you couldn't do anything with it.
B0014Z4ON4|3.0|The DVD itself ran very well. No scratches or glitches that I am aware of. It came in its original packaging and shipping was painless. The only thing about the movie was that I wasn't too interested in the movie itself. That's just MY issue with it. I guess I'm a bit more used to modern-day special effects.
B00CFA222M|3.0|I am a fan of fantasy movies and Jack and the beanstalk is a classic fairy tale story. But Jack the Giant Slayer puts a new twist on the story. This is truly an updated version of the traditional story and the Giant has a much greater role in this new version. The storyline and acting are okay. The action sequences are over the top for this traditional story. So simply put, the action will carry this movie for fantasy lovers.
B005VPRG10|5.0|My kid loves SW Legos and Iike building them with him. This one looks great and is even proportionate to the little lego action figure. one of the best SW Legos for the price
B0019IMVDG|5.0|As usual, De Niro turns in an outstanding performance. The colorful and flashy period wardrobes worn by the characters add to the visual appeal of this film.
B000002H5I|5.0|I believe this is one of Tracy's best works!  Very moving and powerful material here!  A must listen for anyone who likes songs with a powerful message!
B00005RYL2|1.0|I would consider myself as a fan of the Highlander series, both on TV and the movies. But the quality of this film is poor and so is the story. I would tell you about the acting but there was none. Nuff Said.
B0049MAXQG|5.0|Classic film with a few nice, extra scenes that enhance it.  Still scary after all of these years.  Good picture and sound, great price.
B001TXWJ4M|2.0|I should have ordered the disc.<br /><br />The 5 min segments is so distracting that you can't enjoy the show.<br /><br />Get the hard copy
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|This film was superbly done! History & details that sent me back in time... so much great music was recorded there! &#34;Sound City&#34; is what the music world needs today... REAL MUSIC !!!!
B00992CF6W|1.0|I bate the pocket edition. The controls are dumb and you can't even go into a mine. So if you like minecraft then get the xbox 360 edition or the computer version.
B004HWYTP4|3.0|Amusing film. The characters were hilarious - all the actors played their roles to the hilt. Helen Mirren was fantastic, and John Malkovich was awesome. Good popcorn film.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|The book had a nice story and was an easy read<br />I would recommend it to anyone<br />it is a fast read
B003NX76BM|5.0|Not only was it entertaining but very educational about &#34;Searcd and Rescue&#34;. I am a sucker for books with dogs!
0545265355|5.0|Bought it for my daughter...now she would not put it down. Seen the movie as well. It is juts awesome.
159102594X|4.0|I came into this book with very high expectations. So, I found the majority of this book to be slow going, until the last 100-150 pages when you really begin to see the set up come together and with great promise.<br /><br />The characters are all flawed, making them all the more relatable. I think I liked them all the more for it.<br /><br />Abercrombie has definitely wet my appetite! I'm anxious for more!
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Story line was riveting.  Characters continued to keep me spellbound.  Descriptions of scenes were realistic.  I felt like I was on the ship.
0345529057|4.0|When I bought this boxed set the fifth book in the series—which is not included, it only contains the first four books—was apparently already being publicized as nearly ready for publication, but I didn't know that at the time. I wish publishers would avoid the temptation to offer boxed sets before the author is done writing the series. That said, I was enjoying the set very much up through the end of Book 3. Book 4, however, introduced a huge number of entirely new characters to an already cast-of-thousands, and it almost felt like I was starting a whole new series. There is not much mention of the characters I'd spent 3 enormous books becoming invested in and sympathetic with, and it was a struggle to get interested in all these new people because I wanted to get back to the familiar storylines established in the prior books. I'm nearly done with Book 4 and suppose I will continue on, but I can say in all honesty that this is not a series I will keep for future re-reading. It's very dense reading and there are just too many battle scenes to slog (skip) through!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|like it a lot! one of the best free aps in my opinion! I'd recommend it to anyone I know
0441172717|5.0|Excellent!!! I wish it hadn't taken me years to finally pick this up! My absolute favourite moments were the dinner party conversation and the conversation between Lady Jessica and Hawat!! Herbert has such a gift with words!! He crammed so much into one book. So much happened, & not one page was wasted!!<br /><br />I'm definitely going to have to read more of Herbert's work!! The afterword written by his son was very enlightening. Frank put a lot of work into writing Dune. A lot of research, some personal experience, and he even shaped some of the characters after people in his life.<br /><br />I'm really glad that I picked this book up and now own it. Excellent story!! I can tell from some of the foreshadowing and the afterword confirms it, I probably won't like much of where things go in book 2. Hopefully, the following books will bring things back around? Well, a girl can hope, anyway. :) (But please don't tell me! Thanks!! :D )
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I liked this game but was a little frustrating at times lol....I would recommend it .It is fun and sometimes a little mind boggling.....
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Great idea but may have been pushed out too soon. Like my self, many are having problems getting the item to work with a Apple AirPort wireless router. Spent the better part of a Sunday figuring this out. Maybe Google will work out the bugs, but I am disappointed.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is a wondrous tale of family, culture, love, war, intrigue, values through the eyes of Afghan people who come alive on each page. Be prepared for a journey of immense emotion and tough choices. Loved it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book was awesome!! I was obsessed! I kept looking for excuses to read. When I was busy with my day, I was wondering what was going to happen. I was itching to get back to the book!! How else can I tell you that I loved this!?!?!<br /><br />I truly hope there are more books in this world. There is a Q&A at the end where he hints at there being more. So I am cautiously but very optimistic. I'll be the first one in line for the next installment!!!<br /><br />(Written 04 June 2012.)
B007V2UGPE|1.0|If you play as the zombies the people have everything and all you have is hopping torsos and zombies and they have assassins which rush to the gate
B003TOMAPC|4.0|Great action movie that is adapted from marvel comics. Stars nicolas cage, eric johnson, chloe moritz...<br />Ultra violent and action packed.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|I love how this book is planned and how much drama and waiting it is to see what happens next.
B008ALAHA4|3.0|I suppose it's pointless to give this adapter a bad review, since you will have to buy it anyway because it's so vastly less expensive than buying a whole new adapter.  I have about 9 of these things, and after 6 months all but one of them still work fine. (One of them doesn't hold very well and seems to cause the laptop to randomly stop charging. So that's annoying.)<br /><br />At least they're only $10 now. Can you imagine having paid THIRTY BUCKS for one of these stupid little hunks of metal?
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|This is a fun game to play.  If u like super Mario bros you'll like this game.  Fun game with good graphics.
B00007G1ZM|5.0|A mother spoils her daughter against her husband's better judgment, and.....if you are not certain of the result; you need to watch this movie.<br /><br />An all-star cast.<br /><br />The film is very well paced. The director and actors knew when to linger over interesting parts, and when to move things along. There are not any slow parts in this film.<br /><br />Some good morals to the story about spoiling children; spoiling spouses; and living to present an image; rather than sincerely caring about others.<br /><br />The studio spent some money for a variety of sets of interest and detail. There are a lot of people in this film without speaking parts (extras); the studio went all out.<br /><br />Under the \\"Comment\\" button below; I tell why you will like Joan Crawford in her movies.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Its not right to make a gamer like the game on facebook in order to get ahead.  What if t h ey don't facebook?  What if they don't like it that much?  Also, images could be made clearer.  I hate night mode.  It would be n i ce not to be timed.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|As I finally got it to download, I think the graphics are awesome. I'm not so thrilled about the buying coins thing, though.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This is a classic game that brings back memories. A little different from the way I grew up playing it but pretty easy to get into the groove of things.
B000SEGTI0|5.0|Nobody can predict future, but some prediction turns out to be real, or close to reality. I strongly advice to read this book.
B005MLOOJA|4.0|It is a well written and entertaining show.  It keeps my attention and seems to be getting better and better.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|As usual.in his past novels , Khaled Husseini introduced us to the inside of his different personalities who are living  in the harsh human conditions of Afghanistan .
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|I love it so much .....So worth the two dollars I paid .....the only. thing is it glitches not very bad tho ........
0316017930|5.0|This book will open your eyes and give you another look at what makes successful people. Really interesting! I have kids with late birthdays to I can relate the information concerning Canadian hockey players. My son is a dec birthday .... Guess what... He did not excel at hockey that had a dec 31 cutoff date. Even if you do not agree with everything, it does give you a new perspective and makes you think.
B00821OUT6|5.0|Took me a second to get into the show, but once I did I was hooked. In this end of world, post alien invasion show, a group of survivors try and fight back the planet
B0091REZMW|4.0|not for sure if i like it too much.  I don't really see where all these adventures are leading me to.
0061122416|4.0|It was reguired reading for 10th grade for summer reading project-book is in great shape and he enjoyed the story line
B004XUMPFQ|2.0|I started watching Firefly because it seemed well-liked.  The filming was good quality and I loved the theme music (\\"you can't take the sky from me\\").  It wasn't until about halfway though the season that I realized what was bothering me.  The dialogue felt scripted and flat.  The characters were speaking but it felt like they were just reading off lines.  The characters themselves felt flat.  It was like the writers were desperately trying to make three-dimensional characters by adding in generic backgrounds: war trauma, prostitute, preacher, etc.  The whole makeup of the team felt forced and unrealistic.  The preacher's inclusion in the team was especially irking because I can just imagine the writers in a planning meeting and one saying that they need a religious element for balance and the guy next to him says 'okay, let's add a preacher and while were at it we need family drama so let's get a brother & sister.\\"  I wasn't surprised at all that it cancelled after one season.  I'm just astonished at the number of fans protesting. The show had great potential but the writers failed in their attempts to create engaging personalities.
B0057URWSQ|4.0|In true USA network form, its cute, catchy, sexy actors and keeps ya watching, despite being totally unbelievable. It has the token, overinflated ego, geeky cute guy, sexy smart female... and all opposing forces.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I couldn't stop playing since I got it! This game is the game for you if you have been playing all 3 of the other dungeon hunters.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Everything about this show is spectacular: great acting, fantastic chemistry, clever writing, identifiable and real characters, and a perfect mix of drama, mystery, romance,and comedy. It has everything you could ever want from a show. Season 5 was the best yet! I recommend buying all seasons and starting from day 1 to really appreciate the beauty of this season.
B00ARI9CDQ|5.0|all the articles in each section are very informative i read it every day to get all the information great
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|this book is a good way to remember that people with cancer should not give up but enjoy every moment of their lives as much as they can.<br />I wanted to know what happens to Hazel Grace at the end though :(
0425263924|4.0|Although this book reads like '50 Shades,' I must admit that it was a much better read. Miss Day is a great writer. I'm now hooked on Sylvia Day books and have read most of them like 'The Stranger I married and Seven years to sin.\\"  EXCELLENT WRITING and for those who like sizzling books, the two books mentioned are sizzlers.<br /><br />[ASIN:1479302155 I am called Ranjit]
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Excellent read like the first two novels of Khaled Hosseini, but a different plot and different but still interesting and complex characters. Highly recommended read!
B004NELBPC|5.0|i fine that all the articles in each section are very informative i read it every day to get all the info
B005544V6A|5.0|This is a great show that I couldn't stop watching and am now on season 2.  I plan on seeing all episodes and catching up
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|The story line held my attention well and I found it an exciting movie. Watching Reacher unravel the mystery was great, and the essence of that logic seemed true to Reacher books I've read (only 3-1/2 so far). I liked the characters as done by the actors. One distraction, which I nearly got over by the end, was Cruise playing Reacher. There were lines and deliveries that did not seem like Reacher. It seemed like Cruise was thinking \\"This is what Reacher would be like if he were as cool as I am.\\" But his questioning of the young lady at the auto parts store was right on - that is, he mostly said nothing and just stared at her, which made her keep talking. Unlike at least one other reviewer, I liked the fight scenes. I'm not an expert at such things, but the way they went down was a lot like what I read in the books. Reacher is working a couple steps ahead and using his (and his opponents') movements work for him, and that's what Cruise's fights looked like. The only other distraction was the fight scene that started in the bathroom. The \\"Keystone Cops\\" aspect of the two thugs seemed out of place. Otherwise, it was a very enjoyable movie.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Easy to install. Story line was easy to follow and interesting. The bonus material is great even after solving the game.
B00634GHJA|5.0|Makes transferring photos from my tablet to PC and vice versa so easy.  Used to email photos to pick up photos but was time-consuming as you can only email a few photos at a time unless you zipped the file.  This app does it by WiFi and so easily.  Love it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is awesome I love it its like subway surfers but I like this game I love it so much
B006JJBFK0|5.0|just what I was hoping for, no problems and the music was nice. thanx for the easy ordering and receiving of this product.
B006GECE9Y|5.0|I've tried the built in browser and Opera and fiddled briefly with Chrome, but Dolphin has been the best so far.  I love that it's got built in Flash support so I can stream movies easily.  It also acts the most like a desktop computer browser and has the fewest odd quirks.
6305291446|5.0|this movie i love it  i got most of the halloween i need about 3 more movies of halloween i will have the hole set i get my dvd on the amazon so if you like good movie but scary this is the movie for you i

B000SGGUWS|5.0|It was better than the show. It is truly amazing!I love this series so much! It leaves you wanting more! It's addictive
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This is a fun game that I can play for long periods of time. IT IS SO ADDICTIVE :) I LOVE IT!
B00003CXIP|5.0|i really only watch it 2 times but i only seen only half of it that is why i got the dvd and i watch it all and it was a great movie sad but good
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I purchased this for my Mom who is great fan of Downton Abbey. She really loved it.<br />We (family) all follow this series and thoroughly enjoy it.
B00DHNBPA6|5.0|Not many horror revamps provide the blood guts and gore that J Levy did in this AWESOME Classic!<br />Thanks to Bruce Campbell for imaginative and grotesque insight to make it worth raising from the dead and seeing this again and again! Especially on Halloween!!
B004IK8Q86|5.0|Excellent book. Very well written. With some differences, the picture is, in my opinion, well depicts the message in the book itself. I woull recommend it to anyone.
6304806434|5.0|if yo like nicole cage you will like this one it is a good movie i watch it 2 times when i got mine
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The kids seem to enjoy this game.  Me too.  This Seems simple enough until you run out of extra lanes.
B0031RAOW8|5.0|I don't know how I managed to miss hearing about this film until this year.  It's a great family film but it's real tear jerker. If you are an animal lover, even if you don't own a dog, you better have tissues handy.  Sure, my eyes have leaked a little during a particularly sad or touching movie, but this one just plain did me in!  It's all about a dog who is incredibly loyal to his master even after his master's death.  Yes, it's emotional, but I think it's a must see.  Just rent it and keep your tissues close.  On second thought, arm yourself with paper towels.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing!! I can't wait till it turns into a movie (in 2015!), far away but I am sure it will be amazing. You will not be able to put this book down, it has you on edge at every second, every minute, every page you flip. I couldn't believe how awesome this book is as this is not my genre that I normally read. I don't buy into the hype with the reviews on books that aren't my genre but this one, the reviews are completely accurate. Get this book, you won't regret it.
B00631HASU|4.0|I am just wishing that you would put a button on there that will help me when I didn't mean to start my game over... I was almost done and have to start all over again...
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|The kids seem to enjoy the options this game offers.  It is a little frustrating until you figure out how things move.
1595827684|5.0|This exceeds the gold standard for art books in its quality and diversity of content.  The creators have successfully created unique worlds, aliens, creatures, and machines.  The variety of locations and subject matter remind me of the Art of Star Wars books with seemingly more densely packed pages.  When working on my own projects, this is one of the first books I turn to for inspiration.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|I just couldn't put this book down! Ken Follett has done it again!! Another masterpiece of historical fact fiction and intrigue.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|One of the best games I have! I love make-up games like this. It is so much fun! The make-up is amazing! If your looking for a fun make-up game I recommend this game.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this game is really cool because its fun and I learn a lot about all the fishes that are swimming
B00BEIYMAG|1.0|What is a \\"true story\\"? Inception is a story, and as far as we accept that it's a story, there's a truth to the events. When we watch the movie, we are all witnessing the same story, and therefore, we can agree on objective facts about the story. There are characters. They have names. Events happen in a particular order. These are all truths, and so something must exist beyond the fiction for us to call a \\"true story\\". I have no doubt in my mind that the Warrens, those fantastic hucksters, have woven a narrative surrounding this family and some possibly difficult times for them. The question, however, is whether that story, which is itself a truth, accurately reflects reality, or if it was spawned from the imagination with little or no help from reality. That's an important question, even more than just asking \\"Is it a good horror movie?\\", because now the movie is requiring us to suspend our suspension of disbelief. Anytime I watch a horror movie or play a scary game, I have to temporarily disconnect myself from the world I know (suspend my disbelief), otherwise I will never be immersed enough to achieve catharsis, and the whole experience will be a waste of my time. Indeed, the effort on the part of the creator will be a failure as well, as this is the entire point of storytelling, insofar as I can tell. Because The Conjuring is claimed to be a story that accurately reflects reality (members from the Perron family and the remaining Warren both assert this), I now have to prevent myself from suspending my disbelief in the movie, instead suspending my belief in reality (which is considerably harder to do because I have a lot more experience in reality than I do in the Warren's distorted, funhouse mirror version of it).<br /><br />**Spoilers here**<br /><br />The Warrens are a religious people. Their take on the supernatural has a distinctly Biblical tone. The plot could only seem reasonable to the Biblically inclined. I would even say that it's an embarrassingly badplot, even compared to other religiously themed horror movies, which almost always fall on the poor side of a genre that typically produces poor material to begin with.<br /><br />***Last chance spoiler alert***<br /><br />The primary antagonistic entity is a witch. Yeah, a witch. One of the \\"first to be condemned in the Salem witch trials\\", to paraphrase Loraine from the movie. The witch sacrificed her newborn to Satan, and then committed suicide, which gave her spirit a great deal of physical power (of course.... of course). There are some other ghosts that make a brief appearance, all victims of the witch's power to make a mother kill her child. This is what witches do, no doubt, and clearly those fundamentalist maniacs running the witch trials were right to murder two dozen people - there was a real witch! She actually got power from Satan, and 200 years later, the Warrens were there to finally save the day, God be praised! So, in order to suspend my disbelief for this movie, I have to accept not only the Warrens' version of events, but various Christian doctrines and the \\"prosecutors\\" of the Salem witch trials. As a result, rather than scaring, or even interesting me, this movie just had me rolling my eyes. Often times, such movies will at least allow a character to go through a crisis of faith, and then I can find value in it - either they lose it entirely, or they regain it with a new understanding, but regardless, the character develops in some way. No so for this shameless faith-fest, where not only does the nasty witch get defeated sans character development, but it's a simple Christian ritual that saves the day, as though there could be no other possibility. True story!<br /><br />**End of spoilers***<br /><br />Aside from the inherent ridiculousness of the plot, the movie is generally lame in every other dimension. The scares were typical, uninspired rip offs of every other haunted house movie. This is likely because so many movies we're familiar with today are themselves ripping off the Amityville horror, which is another true fiction from the minds of the Warrens. The acting was generally awful whenever it called for an emotion other than 'frozen in terror''. The dialog is clunky and as difficult to believe as the rest of the film, and it certainly felt like the actors had better things they could be doing with their lives at the time. Characters were cardboard cutouts that stood in for anything we might relate to as a human being, but being so thin, fail to inspire empathy. To be sure, the worst part of the movie is the lack of any real progression from the characters. A true story must still be a story regardless of how well it reflects reality, and for a story to be a story, we have to find the characters sufficiently believable. Instead, no one had any personality, which is surprising for characters based on \\"real\\" people. No one changed. No one grew, or learned, or became anything different by the end of the movie. Every face in the film is an empty vessel, and watching them was both painful and boring.<br /><br />For those of you who are wondering whether to watch this movie, chances are good that no amount of bad reviews will put you off. You're either too bored to care, or you're a horror junky and will watch even the crappiest of the crap. If you're a fan of the Warrens, you've probably already watched it and won't be reading this review. If I can sway you from this film, then please accept this warning and go watch something worth your time. The Exorcism of Emily Rose is a good one with overt Christian themes, if that's your thing. The Innkeepers, the Woman in Black or Sinister could fulfill your supernatural needs much better. If you can't find a movie that will be a suitable replacement, then think about a new hobby. Music, photography, chess or stamp collecting would all be a far better use of your time. Failing even a new hobby, try just knocking yourself unconscious somehow. Anything is better thansitting through the latest tripe from James Wan, and certainly better than giving more money to the Warrens. The only truth to this story is that the story is so truly bad, and told is such a lackluster, empty and vapid way that a potentially entertaining horror movie becomes a frustrating exercise in reconciling your view of reality with a liar's tale.
B002EWD0I6|5.0|Loved this dvd so very much.  Not only are the characters perfect, but so is the scenery as well!  I will be happy to have the entire set.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I watched this movie when I was very young. I only faintly remembered any thing about what happened in it but I had the very STRONG memory that it was REALLY good. So I purchased it. It completely met my high expectations! It is truly a great movie.Hayao Miyazaki is brilliant! I highly recommend it. The story is well thought out and the art is beautiful
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great puzzle game, it constantly makes you look and think about the potential  solutions. Would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes challenges.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  Can't wait to see the movie.  The ending leaves you wondering...Will read more of her stuff.
B00006EXDM|5.0|This was a Father's Day gift for my husband...he plays it everyday on his way to work and on his way home. Puts him in a good mood !
0375836675|3.0|The novel kept my interest until the conclusion, which I thought was something of a cop-out.  The sudden change of heart and mind of Audrey seemed unlikely, given the build-up of her character throughout the novel.  Perhaps this was a nod to the author's<br />young adult readers.
B00ECUARO8|1.0|Turned it off After five minutes just not what we like to watch.  A expensive mistake!!!!  I guess we are just PG watchers.  Another person said okay for over ten years old.  I certainly disagree.  Waste of money for us.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Simple to use and it does one step beyond simple math. And best of all, it is free to use
B008OOYALE|2.0|I have to agree that this IS THE BEST dragon app, however, I wish it was  a little more exiting. I don't know why but it got SOOOO boring SOOOO fast. Like I played it for ... Eh... a month ? And then I was like &quot;I'm over it !&quot; My brother said (Weird face) &quot;Half a star&quot;
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|You can control Netflix or youtube from a laptop or tablet.  I have a PC with Windows 7 and an IPAD with the latest IOS both work well.  Also you can stream from the Chrome browser services like Bloomberg live.  The only tricky part is making sure to download Google's Chrome browser.  For my setup I plugged Chromecast into an HDMI port on my TV and plugged the power cord into a UBB port also on my TV.  There is a 110 volt adaptor included if you do not have a USB port for power.  I use the wireless internet service in my house.  The device take the video information directly from your wifi.  In my situation the video was greatly improved to HD instead of the video capability of the PC I had previously used which was connected by video and audio cable.  This is a step up from using a PC or a set top box.  The price is great too.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|My kids, boys and girls, 6 to 13 loved the movie.  Very uplifting, good messages, something I really enjoyed as well.  Go Marvel.
B00D3LA71K|5.0|\\"Mud\\" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: Two boys, Ellis and his friend Neckbone, who find a man named Mud hiding out on an island in the Mississippi. Mud describes fantastic scenarios -- he killed a man in Texas and vengeful bounty hunters are coming to get him. He says he is planning to meet and escape with the love of his life, Juniper, who is waiting for him in town. Skeptical but intrigued, Ellis and Neckbone agree to help him. It isn't long until Mud's visions come true and their small town is besieged by a beautiful girl with a line of bounty hunters in tow.<br /><br />The cast led by Matthew McConaughey (as Mud), Tye Sheridan (as Ellis), Sam Shepard (as Tom) & Reese Witherspoon (as Juniper) is brilliant. The directing & story & screenplay by Jeff Nichols is brilliant.<br /><br />The music by David Wingo is brilliant. The cinematography by Adam Stone is brilliant. The film editing by Julie Monroe is brilliant. The casting by Francine Maisler is brilliant. The production design by Richard A. Wright is brilliant. The art direction by Elliott Glick is brilliant. The set decoration by Fontaine Beauchamp Hebb, set dressings by Mitchell Crisp, Henson Flye, Matthew Martin, Joey Santoro, James Smith & Karen Young is brilliant. The costume design by Kari Perkins is brilliant. The special make-up effects design by Matthew W. Mungle & Clinton Wayne is brilliant. The special effects supervised by Everett Byrom III is brilliant. The visual effects supervised by Jason Schugardt & coordinated by Zafar Janjua & Anastasia Von Rahl is brilliant. The stunts coordinated by Mickey Giacomazzi is brilliant.<br /><br />This is a brilliant, well-made and well-done drama that is entertaining and intriguing. It is also an interesting movie, thematically and visually. Matthew McConaughey gives his best performance to date, thus far, as Mud and Tye Sheridan gives a star-making performance as Ellis. Jeff Nichols has directed his best film to date, thus far. This is one of the bestmovies of the summer season and one of the best movies of the year, if not, the best movie of the year, thus far. This is also an early Oscar contender for Best Picture and many other nominations, as well.

B00EAZTONU|3.0|At least in the USA (and France and Germany??) you have the option of buying this, In the UK (the home of Tolkien) good old Warner haven't released this statue set. Which is pretty disgusting of them. and the price may seem a lot to some of you but when we pay a lot more for general DVDs/ Blu Rays in the uk then $59.99 seems an ok price. Does anyone know if the discs will be region free as my blu ray will only play B's
B00A81MV3U|3.0|Im always a little wary about these Hollywood films being toted and talked about by critics as though it were the coming of the Lord. So I wasn't disappointed by this film because I had low expectations to begin with. Bradly Cooper is one of my favorite actors. I loved his last film, the one that is like a splice between Total Recall and Inception. Jennifer Lawrence, however, I am not crazy about. I didn't find her role in Winter's Bone to be all THAT. It was an ok film. Not shocking, enthralling or mesmorizing at all to me. Obvious, however, yes. She was good in the Hunger Games, but I think its true what they say, &#34;You're only as good as the actor in front of you.&#34; And she had a lot of actors in front of her that day. I know, you could say the same about her role up against Bradly, and you may be right. Sometimes he isn't that great either. But this isn't one of those times.<br /><br />In this role Cooper is just being released from a mental hospital after the nervous breakdown he suffered due to the discovery of his wife's infidelity with one of Cooper's co-workers. On the day of his release, Cooper decides he is going to get his wife back and make things right again by being positive, truthful and compassionate to the needs of others, as he was none of these things in his marriage before the breakdown. He meets Lawrence's character at the dinner party of a longtime friend, whose wife decides to tempt fate by trying to set up her sister (Lawrence) whom is grieving the loss of her husband with Cooper. The dinner is a disaster, both Lawrence and Cooper spend the evening discussing which medications they have been taking. An awkward moment arrives and Cooper has to excuse himself. Lawrence follows in pursuit, hits on Cooper, is denied, slaps him and then exits. It was funny but I also felt their tension, confusion and awkwardness. I have had moments like this. I am bipolar and recently experienced something similar at a dinner party. I hate dinner parties. I hate parties.<br /><br />The problem with this movie is that I thought that was the best part of it. After that, it just tries too hard. Cooper, I thought did a good job though in conveying the hardships of an mental illness when involving relationships. The scene in the attic bedroom when he comes unhinged and the cops are called was meant to be funny Im sure, but to me, it was real. And it was frightening. I've been there. So props to Cooper for a job well done.hate parties.<br /><br />The problem with this movie is that I thought that was the best part of it. After that, it just tries too hard.

B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|It is scary, but I got all the pages on the first go! I highly recommend this game. The controls are simple and its scary. Great game
B003WJQ74E|5.0|People who complaint about the way its written dont understand that it is intentional , that goes with the story<br />They should read the entire book . As it progresses you get the hint of the writing
B001BANK32|5.0|This was the first book I read by Steven King . It is a great book. I'm reading it again now and it's even better.
1416914285|5.0|Also reviewed on my blog Vintage Bookworms. ([...]<br /><br />I read City of Bones for the first time back in 2009, so this wasn't my first time reading it. I never continued on with the rest of the series, even though I loved City of Bones. Reading it for the second time was just as enjoyable as the first time, especially after four years! I forgot about a lot of the things that happened, so it was a great refresher to re-read it so I could continue the series!<br /><br />I don't really know what to say about this book; it's absolutely amazing. It was just as intriguing and compelling the second time around reading it than it was the first time. The world may contain a lot of the same type of supernatural/fantasy beings that are in a lot of other books in the same genre, but Cassie completely makes them her own and everyone in this series has a certain place. The Shadow Hunters, which work for the Clave and kill Demons and anything that breaks the Clave's law. The \\"Downworlder's\\"such as the vampires, werewolves, fairies and every other creatures you can imagine.<br /><br />Don't want to go into more detail on that in case of spoilers, so I'll stop there. But the world is amazing and real and vivid and you just don't want to stop reading.<br /><br />And the characters. Phew. Some of them make me want to smack them, but it's only sometimes and besides that I really kind of like all of the characters. Even the villain, which I'm not going to say his name, makes me like him. Well, not really \\"like\\" him. I hate him. But I hate him so much to where it's a good thing because he seems real. I have such strong emotions to each character!<br /><br />Overall, City of Bones became a favorite book when I read it the first time around, and it's definitely still up there on my list of favorites this second time around and I'll definitely be coming back for another round with this book later on in the future after I've finished the series. Great story line, great characters, completely unique and enjoyable and one of those books you just can't put down, and the writing is amazing. Cassandra definitely knows how to tell a story.<br /><br />I can't wait for the movie! Comes out in 4 days! (Note: This review was written in August, but may not be posted until September!) I may post a review of the movie too later on. :)etely unique and enjoyable and one of those books you just can't put down, and the writing is amazing.

B007OLYPW2|5.0|One of my favorite books of all time.  Parallel stories as literary scholars in the present pursue a previously unknown relationship between writers you will swear you have read.
B008MAI0WK|3.0|It's a good book, for what it is. However, I find is short on technical details and long on how to do the basics, such as downloading and configuring software packages.<br /><br />I find online user forums much more applicable to that task.  I just think you could spend your money more wisely.

His skin is designed well to show bumps under his chin and different sized horns on his head and body. The rider has blond hair and holds a spy-glass in one hand and a sword in the other. A very great addition to any dragon collection.

Have not read the Book , i don't have preconceptions.<br />Great Story , acting, Cinematography and BBC in UK who made this 2 Part Drama and Love story its well done.<br />If like Downtown Abbey you like the the period is mastered on the Screen. As fan on History the WW1 scenes are well done. I wish PBS could make movies like this.<br />Great Movie for lady's with Love Story  and for Guys with Action and Grit of WW1.  This Great Blu Ray Movie and keeper as we say.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|His descriptions of the other side are compelling. His experience is similar to other NDE's , but his scientific explanation of why his brain couldn't have produced them adds weight to the theories that NDE's may be trips to the next life.

159463176X|2.0|After reading Hosseini's last two novels, I thought this one would be at least comparable.  A major disappointment, to say the least.  The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns were two awesome novels and this one lacked any depth or real interest in the characters.  Too many disjointed plots and skipping around to really make any kind of connections with the characters.  Decades of time literally pass on a single page and the reader is left to try to figure out how earlier mini-story lines are related to the one you are currently reading.  There were several great possibilities for much more in depth and interesting story lines, but they were never developed.

B003YL4LYI|4.0|I thought it was a good read. I was expecting a LOT more from A Dance with Dragons just like everyone else. When the next novel comes out, I will certainly take a look at the reviews before I buy because the reviews on this book was completely on par with what I thought after reading.

B00DHNBPA6|4.0|It's  darker version and a Gorier version, but worth watching. Expect interesting, but not &#34;amazing (How much did you spend to rent this?)&#34;
B0050DIWFC|2.0|Don't read this! The first part of the book is very interesting actually. It will hold your attention to make you want to know is Jacob the killer or is he not the killer. Is there more to the story or is this just being framed? Then towards the 250th page you start to wonder if your curiosty can push you through the book because it is so dragged out. Long story short, I did not finish the book. The first half was decent and then it just gets really boring. There is no action, the climax is long awaited but it seems like it is never coming. If I knew that it would be so easy for me to just stop reading when it got boring then I would not have bought it. I could finish 50 shades of grey and I thought that was the worse book I ever read but this book takes it to a whole nother level. If you can power through the pain of boringness and maybe get to a good ending then by all means you should get it, but me.. I couldn't so I would recommend not to read this book
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|I had high hopes for this movie and it was okay at best. Visually striking, but with weak plot and an anti-climactic finish.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Feedly has become the go-to app for organizing RSS feeds since Google Reader took a dirt nap. Feedly is easy to organize, easy to look at and is great at saving stories for later. Give it a try while there's still a free version.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I enjoyed this book tremendously. It took me a little while to understand who was who, but once I did, I could not put it down. This is a story about a situation any woman could find herself in. You find yourself growing stronger as Cathy grows stronger.
B004H83IM8|4.0|So I really love Mike Myers and the first Austin Powers movie. My siblings and I have been quoting the movie for years and the zany, British 60's music is totally awesome. The second movie starts out really funny and then somewhere in the middle, we all started to get really sick of the film, (I think it was around the part where Dr. Evil sings with Mini Me). It's like, &#34;Okay, is this film over yet?&#34; We all felt it was getting really lame. The chick who plays the heroine is such a bad actress--she really annoyed me. By the time we finished watching the third film, we pretty much hated Austin Powers. It started to become obvious that instead of being funny, they were just being disgusting and vulgar--that kind of comedy can only take you so far before people get sick of it. So, even though I'm glad I finally have the 3-film set, I'm also glad I didn't spend too much money for this product because I probably will wont get much use out of the last two films. STICK WITH THE FIRST MOVIE PEOPLE! As far as the discs and case go, I was really surprised that they put the first two films on a disc, (with sides A and B) and then had the third movie on it's own disc. Seems like they would've put the first movie on a disc by itself since it's the most popular. Also, the two discs don't match each other, but I guess that doesn't really matter. The case has a disc flap inside and the whole product arrived in fine condition. Overall, this product is a great purchase for what you get--I just didn't really like the last two movies.
B0063GORYU|3.0|The game is great. Maybe it's me but trying to move cards often results in the stack jumping to the wrong place, which results in excess moves which results in a higher move count. This definitely is frustrating.
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|This was a game my husband purchased. He must really like it because he steals my kindle fire to play it several times a week!
B000FC1AGG|5.0|I was looking for a light funny read to wile away my summer days. This was my second Book by Kinsella. The premise is funny as is the interaction between the character. A few of the British terms threw me, but it didn't slow me down. I can't wait til i have more time off to read another.
B00129H7VS|5.0|I've wanted this series for such a long time because I love watching &#34;Band of Brothers&#34; when it's on HBO but it was always too expensive to buy +in the stores. Then I found this product on Amazon for such a great price and it was even on Blu-ray! I jumped on it. First of all, the series itself is absolutely amazing. It's filmed well, written well, great scenes, shots, sets, superb acting, the music great, etc. By far the best WWII drama I've ever seen. I love the story lines in each episode and how they are based on real events that happened as you follow Easy Company through the war. For someone like me who is not a huge WWII buff and doesn't know much about it, this film really gave you an idea of what it might have been like and showed you so many different aspects and angles of the Atlantic-side of the war. It takes you all over Europe and the scenery is absolutely amazing! I loved the veteran mono logs before each episode--hearing these old guys talk about their experiences really made the whole story so much more real and gave the series a sense of reverence, respect, and foreboding. I have several favorite episodes, but my all time favorite is, &#34;Bastogne&#34;. I loved seeing and feeling the war through the eyes and emotions of the combat medic. As a disclaimer, I would warn viewers not to watch all ten episodes really close together--because it can get really depressing. I mean, individually, the episodes are great with excellent drama, action, humor, and tension. But we are talking about a real war here and Easy Company took a lot of hits, emotionally and physically. The episode where they discover the Holocaust work camp is a really tough one to take--if you're sensitive to cruelty and human suffering like me, maybe read the content synopsis beforehand so you know what you're in for. THIS SERIES IS DEFINITELY NOT SUITABLE FOR CHILDREN! I would say maybe a mature 15-year-old could handle it. Other than that, this is a really great mini-series. The special features are totally awesome and I loved the timeline and map features on each disc that allowed you to follow Easy Company through each episode--that was really cool and useful if you are interested in how these individual events and battles played a part in the overall picture and how they affected the war effort. I also was excited to see that subtitles were available! Sometimes it was hard to understand the dialog with all the different accents and background war noise. Watching the series with subtitles really clearing up some of what was going on for me. The discs come in a long, cardboard and plastic casing that folds accordion-like and fits nicely in this durable, heavy metal box. There is also a flap that holds a pamphlet about the series. The box is easy to open and is secure when closed. I was very pleased with the packaging. Overall, a great product and well worth the price!
B0013ND30M|1.0|I was having trouble with the disc.. Would not play on the ps3 and the ps3 would make lots of noise with it in and the screen turned black. Played on my DVD player and it skipped the entire 5 minutes I could get it to play or the screen turned black. The disc has no scratches.. And upon reading reviews, other people seem to have this happen.. Very upsetting.. Also, it is not a two-disc thing. It comes with one disc and a floppy case. Wish this would've worked out.. Very disappointed.
B001EBYM8A|4.0|I've seen it before.  Bought it to up grade from Laser Disk.  It's a much better picture on Blu Ray than it was on Laser Disk!
B00BMQDM10|3.0|Not upto the expectations at all ! I Liked Sofie Kinsella's other books much much better...I am so so disappointed!!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|It's probably the funnest game out there, it's not just running around eating everything, you have to try and survive as a shark and get to unlock new sharks and items.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I like the way that the main character (Jack) analyzes situations and then follows thru with appropriate action.  Also he has a unique outlook.
B0090SI582|5.0|The Wolverine is NOT like other x-men movies.  Or other superhero movies for that matter.  Rather than being a showcase of special effects and seeing how convincingly a city can be destroyed, this movie is the PERSONAL story of Wolverine.  It is a character driven movie, with plenty of action which is also used to move the plot forward.  This movie is great for those who like emotional drama, as well as those who like action or thriller movies.  The Japanese setting is also well used, as the culture and locations actually play significant roles in the movie.  There is romance and some light moments as well, though this is a fairly dark and gritty story.<br /><br />I highly recommend you give this movie a chance.  It is artfully crafted; certainly enjoyable on a surface-level, but if you really read into it (maybe watch it a few times) you will also see just how well-crafted the movie is and how much thought went into it.  The first time I saw it I thought there were a few  \\"loose\\" aspects of the movie (though I still loved it).  By the third viewing though, I realized why certain things were the way they were, and gained even more respect for this quality film.

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I am excited for the rest of the story at some point, but I'm left feeling disappointed with this one. I originally gave a higher rating and didn't say much, but the more I think about it, the more mad I get! Selling someone a trilogy and then deciding to stretch it out into more books is like selling someone a puzzle with a bunch of missing pieces!! You're bound to annoy people that way. As I was reading the book I felt underwhelmed with the entire story...too many people that don't matter...but it is still annoying when there is no ending to their stories. I would have gladly bought more books as spin offs for the other characters, but to drag Eva and Gideon out even more is a terrible way to get your fans to buy more of your books.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I actually avoided reading this for a while due to the immense media hype.  But am glad I finally took the time to read it.  A twisting plot which I couldn't have predicted at all.  No spoilers here so I would recommend you read it.

140006922X|5.0|Zealot is unquestionably well-researched scholarly work made accessible to the lay person.<br /><br />Zealot not only examines what is written in New Testament scripture, but more importantly provides a fascinating explanation of ancient Palestinian culture, Roman rule, and Judaism.  Jesus Christ was nothing special; just one of hundreds if not thousands of apocalyptic preachers running around the area spreading fear and sedition in equal measure at the time.<br /><br />Aslan's work provides the proper context within which the scriptures were written.  He allows us to truly understand the meaning of the scriptures and in doing so shines an amazing light on the birth of the most popular and repressive religion the world has been afflicted with thus far.<br /><br />As usual, atheists tend to know FAR more about religion than religionists themselves, and for those of us who are interested in the truth this book is a must-read.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|Fantasy is not my thing but I was curious as to where the story was headed.  Was it a dream or reality??
B009ZQJ1G4|2.0|This movie drags.  This show is an insult to intelligence.  I have lost points watching.  Try to do better next time!
B008SAZHLQ|4.0|I enjoyed  the book but th  ending was somewhat disappointing, it was a typical teenage romance novel- on the other hand I would recommend  it
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Nice app. It keeps you thinking around plenty of time. I hope you guys create soon more rooms to escape from!!!
B000JCSPG0|5.0|Absolutely loved this movie. For anyone who is in love with the prospect of an Egyptology/Sci-fi film, it does the trick.  The acting is good and it's a delight from beginning to end.
B009HEMW4W|1.0|This movie skipped and lagged my son eas unable to watch it. Not do to internet connection all his other movies played just fine :(
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love it - has audio.  I can listen while busy with house work or driving in my car.  It is great.
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|Peter Jackson so thoroughly knows the world of Tolkien that he makes immersive worlds beautiful and fun - all in the spirit of the author. Despite the length (2:50) , the pace of the movie was not slow, it moves well between action and humor, as it blended the world of the Hobbit with the lore from Lord of the Rings.
B0027MJU00|5.0|...and impossible to put down until you know the truth. The main character Libby does her best to be disliked, in her complete frankness about her weaknesses, her steaming rage and her unpleasant character, as she guides us in her private journey (admittedly started  only for the sake of money, not for the sake of justice - she's not good enough for that), towards the truth about the massacre of her family, while at the same time, through flashback episodes told in the third person, sometimes centered on the tragic figure of the mother Patty, other times on the disturbing character of the brother Ben, we descend into the hellish buildup to that horrible night. Graphic, full of blood and senseless, intolerable cruelty and violence in some episodes, the book is so well written, unsentimental and at times humorous and funny, full of psychological insight, that I don't hesitate giving it 5 stars and recommend it highly.
1611748755|5.0|Great.  Everything about this movie was first class.  Met my expectations.  Shared this CD with my mother and her friends at her retirement home.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|My 5 year old can play this game and he loves it. We both play it and he wins all the time. And it amazes me.
0451169514|5.0|I watched It a long time ago when it aired on tv. I always wanted to read the book, but put it off because I'd watched the movie (and because its over 1000 pages long). Well, recently I decided to take the plunge. I wanted to see if I liked the book better than the film. They're both great, and there are things I like about each better than the other. Yes, 300 pages could have easily been deleted and it would have flowed better and moved faster. Early on, when King went into monumental detail about Stan's past, kind of bored me for a while. He could have described it in a few paragraphs instead of several pages. I know King gets annoyed when people complain about him overwriting. Not always, but sometimes he does. I find it amusing and interesting that Carrie, his first novel, was one of his shortest and fastest paced novel. Carrie rocks. It rocks. The Stand rocks. That's my biggest problem with Stephens books though, he goes into too much detail sometimes.<br /><br />Aside from a little too much detail, there's one other issue I had about It that made zero sense. (Small spoiler). Toward the end of the book, there's a scene where the kids had an orgy. Why? It completely went against their characters. I didn't buy it and couldn't believe it. I liked the overwriting of stan more than the orgy scene. It was just thrown in there, I felt. King got me into the characters' heads and hearts so well, when the characters did what they did, it made no sense at all. It ruined the book a little, but I still felt the book deserves 5 stars, because the characters were very real and three dimensional. I loved them all (although Richie got on my nerves sometimes). And then there's Pennywise, an awesome villain. Some descriptions literally gave me chills the way many Lovecraft  stories often do.  I won't give them away, I'll let you get scared on your own. So if you're new to Stephen king books, and want to read a great one, It is It. If you want to try something shorter, try out Carrie or The Mist. I don't think you'll be disappointed.rie or The Mist. I don't think you'll be disappointed.
1781162646|5.0|I would recommend  this one.  I don't read a lot of Stephen Kings book's but this one I'm throughly enjoying.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love the game cant seem to put it down. addictive and fun cant wait to see what the next challenges are going to be. fast pace exhilerating good for all ages.@
0062255657|5.0|I enjoyed this book immensely. I haven't read any other of this author's works so I can't offer a comparison, but that's just as well, isn't it?<br /><br />What I love most about this book was the very ambiguous nature of the theme. What *was* this about?! At times I thought it was the escapist imaginings of a boy in an abusive home. Then I thought it was a story an innocent boy had created to protect himself from a tragic accident that took the life of the girl who lived at the end of the lane. Or, was it simply the over-active imagination of a bookish boy? Yet I kept wondering, was this the horror and confusion felt by a boy suffering from childhood schizophrenia?<br /><br />Or, was it a story about a truly magical world<br /><br />Was the nostalgic man visiting his childhood home remembering what was real, or imagined? Or both? And what makes a memory real in the first place?<br /><br />I suppose I'm not too upset at the prospect of reading this little book over and over to discover my own truth of the matter. To be honest, I hope I never discover that truth.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|For this game for my girl friend and she really seems to enjoy this game very much.she can't wait to get in to the game more.
B004OO4UFY|5.0|This is a great album.  I had newer heard of The Heavy before until I was researching the a theme song.  Once I sampled the other songs on the album I was impressed and purchased the entire album.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|This game is the BOMB, i love it and it really keeps your brain thinking and wondering where to go next. Again AWESOME!!! Need more of these games.
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|Have loved all the Royal Envoy games on my PC. Now I can frazzle myself on the tablet, too! A bit trying to go back to the early version since so many improvements have been made on the Campaign version for the pc. One question for the fabulous folks at Playrix ... how do all these villages survive without any ladies? Just sayin'. Please drop everything else and just keep making the RE series for any and all platforms. Loooooove this game!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Really fun, but there aren't enough levels. I need more than 10! Game does say they will have more levels soon.
B00CZAYNOC|3.0|I love the first three albums.  The music just seemed right from the moment you hear it while this album I can listen to, nothing grabs me from it as a must have.
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|Brings me back to the good old days when games was FUN. The newer games that is out now have NO chance on the good OLD games. GREAT!!!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|You can make anything you want in this game. For instance, I made the Great Wall Of China.(Didn't look to shabby). This is a game u will love! You will get your money's worth!
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I've heard so much about this series I just had to check it out for myself.  It is wonderful.  The cast is great but Maggie Smith is amazing!!!  Very talented and her timing is impeccable but again they all play their part quite well.  I was told if I like this series I would also like The Midwives -- also set in the London area.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|CrossMe has been my favorite game from day one. I was disappointed when I completed almost every puzzle but bought a new phone a few months ago and started CrossMe all over again. looking forward to new puzzles being added.
0470424656|5.0|Definitely the book is very technical and real situations exemplifies details that help better understand and apply a valuation study.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|The intricate story, tried and true over so many years, is faithfully portrayed by marvelous actors in settings that we can only wish were real.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|This is an amazing game, especially because it's free. I love the multiplayer feature and the boss battles. The only problem I have is that sometimes it freezes and resumes with me dead... I am sure this glitch will be fixed in future updates. The way the game sets the the scenes in the beginning was really cool and the dialogue perfectly fits the characters. Other than the glitch, I would suggest it to anyone!
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Bought this for my brother as a bday present. My 18 year old niece got her hands on it and he hasn't seen it since! May have to buy him another one.
B001HMSFFC|1.0|Mostly it's just &#34;Being Reckless and Immature Both Sexually and Financially in the City&#34;.  Even that though could be somewhat entertaining done right.  This movie?  Ugh, it's like a bad high school reunion where everyone is pretending to have fun but obviously miserable.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|Effectively acted by a few of the characters, especially the Giants, this violence-filled fairy tale makes for a good bed-time story.  Just don't ask why the giants really must kneel to the glowing crown, or why the crown glows in the first place.  Don't ask why the land in the clouds doesn't cast a shadow over the earth, or wonder if there are any female giants.  Great effects, harmless fun.
B0014H32MG|5.0|Wow this book completely blew me away! Definitely secured a spot as one of my favorite books. I Loved it.
B0019LY5IM|4.0|I tried to watch all episodes of Lost but missed some here and there.  The Complete 5th season allows me to catch up on the episodes that I missed.
B00BHU9BV6|5.0|I find it surprising that this movie has so many negative reviews.  I can maybe understand them if you were coming to it wanting this movie to be a simple, Hollywoodized historical romance, but this is so much more.  I would put this movie on a fairly short list of truly worthwhile movie adaptations (alongside Atonement, William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet, Hamlet (with David Tennant), Adaptation....etc).  It's not at the very top of my list (see Atonement).  But it's definitely on it.  I found this be a beautifully entertaining rendition of the spirit of Tolstoy's work using rich symbolism to capture both that distinctly distant and simultaneously intimate feeling of 19th century Russian literature.  (Random aside:  Just because a book looks big doesn't mean the movie adaptation needs to take as long to watch as the book was to read.  A good movie adaptation takes into account that a picture can speak a thousand words and fully embraces its medium.)
B00BSBVLF8|3.0|There's a reason there are so many Cirque productions.  They are beautifully choreographed and amazingly well performed by people who simply must come from another dimension.  The poetic storyline makes little sense, so just sit back and feast your eyes on the beauty of the sets and people and their athleticism.
0440423228|5.0|The art is great!! I can wait for the 3rd one to come out!! If you are a fan you'll like these.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Amazing book and I thought it really caught my attention and I loved the details and I also loved the plot
B009WUAK2M|3.0|Lots of big name actors and action, but very little substance.  I didn't make it through the whole thing -- just wasn't entertaining enough to waste my time.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I don't have a whole lot to add to the many positive reviews, other than to say I have zero complaints about this case. It's light-weight, sturdy, easy to set up for video viewing. Attaching and detaching my Kindle Fire HD 7\\" from the case is a snap, and it's very flexible for either horizontal or vertical viewing. I like its solid feel when you close the lid (pausing/turning off the Kindle). I ended up getting the orange color because it was $10 cheaper than the other colors offered. One final note: I love the elastic strap that keeps the cover tightly closed.
031236198X|3.0|Book #70 Read in 2013<br />Our Iceberg is Melting by John Kotter<br /><br />This book uses a fable involving penguins trying to find a new iceberg home as a way of showing how to make change in the workplace.  Loved the fable and the penguins.  Some good discussion could be had using the fable to springboard how change can be done within a business/organization.  But really I just wanted to read about the penguins.<br /><br />[...]
B001LXIDVS|5.0|Love it!Great for all ages!  Back when movies were truly family quality. Back when movie were movies and not all computerized.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|As a teacher and introvert myself, I found this book very informative and insightful.  Easy to read and apply to everyday life.
0988262592|5.0|I met Gene and got my copy of this book at RallyOn! in early June.<br /><br />I'm kicking myself for waiting so long to read it.<br /><br />It is a truly inspirational (although fictional) account of transforming IT or, for that matter any development/operational project to meet customer needs.<br /><br />It tells the story through the fiction, leading you down the road to understand that there is and needs to be a balance between process and agility and guides you in ways to determine where your own bottlenecks are and where you can improve.
B0015AARJI|5.0|My granddaughter specifically asked for this item for her birthday, so she was very happy that I had gotten the right one.
B0046B1KHG|4.0|Reminded me somewhat of the old Looney Tunes with Road Runner and Wiley Coyote in some parts.  Good clean fun.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|It's funny, has a lot of action, great actors & actresses who seem to be enjoying themselves, and ***lots*** of bullets get fired. What more do you need?
B0063M22QO|4.0|I enjoy mahjong and now can play it everywhere even on my kindle! Thanks for feeding my passion. I was getting tired of shooting piggies.
B00EEXST2K|4.0|Amanda Syfried was surprisingly good in this role. I had not seen that porn movie Deep Throat before. I preferred this \\" behind the scenes\\" story. I enjoyed it.  It is important to continue to bring domestic violence and abuse towards women to light as much as accurately and as often as possible. Well done!
B00005JPNY|5.0|Yes it was written for kids but it's easy to slip back into childhood and be caught up in the story line and the imagery.
B00AFY2SQK|5.0|This is the best organic chemistry book I have seen. I got the 1st edition in print, and I read chapters from it whenever I needed a refresher...I use it all the time as a reference too, as well as using it for explaining concepts to others. When the 2nd edition came out, I got it for my Kindle. Works very well on a Kindle. Many chemistry/physics/math books have a problem with equations on a Kindle (and other electronic readers), but with this book they took the simple approach and the whole page image is scalable. Makes it much easier to focus in on an individual concept. It's a snap to move in, and easy to go back to full page again. Very nice. I highly recommend this book.
B004LQJOY2|4.0|The film is entertaining on its own, but the filmmakers pulled some themes from The Threepenny Opera (Brecht's socialist critique of capitalism). This explains the otherwise odd choice of Mac the Knife as the opening/closing credit music. As social commentary, it does a good job of juxtaposing Turturro's powerlessness with Feinnes' privilege.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|So far not too bad, wish we had the first person view for the events.  I also wish the appaloosa and grays actually changed their appearance like the paints do, otherwise take the option to do so off.<br />Otherwise, the game seems interesting and something to do to waste time or relax.
140006922X|5.0|An amazing true history lesson.  I've had so many &#34;well, of course&#34; moments while reading this book.  Though I was raised in an evangelical community where the Bible was always present, I was never taught about Jesus the man only Jesus the Christ.  Quite an eye-opener for me.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|ONE OF THE BEST BOOK I've Read in a long The plot was good the history to the point I like the foundation of the first book
B0026KX5PO|5.0|This movie reminds me of old movies like The Postman Always Rings Twice.  A good psychological study. I will watch it again soon.
B000P0J06K|5.0|I liked this movie because of the great actors and the appearance of the &#34;newest&#34; batmobile, also to see Gotham City!
B00CEF014E|5.0|Dana checks herself into a mental hospital for a voluntary 5 day stay while suffering from a deep bout of depression. When her time is up and she's released, she heads out for a stay with her sister, Zoe, at a hippie compound.<br />From the moment of Dana's release things are carefully worded so the reader is drawn into the mystery of Dana's \\"boyfriend\\". Several people encounter her along the way, and there is a hint of a second traveler, but no one including the reader actually sees him. For that reason, when he goes missing no one believes he exists and Dana begins to question her own sanity.<br />The commune is everything you picture at the word, a ton of people living in one place, living off the land, and a bit free in each other's state of undress. Right from the first moment of her arrival, things seem strange about the community, and it's not just the free love. The longer Dana stays and the more she reveals about her boyfriend, Tyler, you begin to wonder what is real.<br />Is Dana crazy or are the people of Rainbow Collective preparing for the Solstice?<br />On a personal note, this book was full of suspense and mystery but the most horrific moment for me was when Dana runs through a swarm of gnats and can no longer breathe. Ugh!<br />Really though, this was an awesome book and totally deserving of 5 stars.<br />**As with most of my reviews, I received this book in exchange for an honest review**
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|Clearly being a die-hard BSB fan; I have to say this is one of their best albums ever! Now I'd do a track-by-track review; but I'll just do a short one by saying which tracks are my favorite on the album!<br /><br />Clearly the title song In A World Like This is my new all time favorite song; not because they play it a lot where I work, but its an instant hit like I Want It That Way! Permanent Stain is my second new all time favorite song, (should be BSB's next single); plus it ranks right up there with Shape of my Heart, which it sounds much like it! Those may be the only 2 stand out songs; but I also like the songs Breathe (which is also catchy as ever), Madeleine, One Phone Call, and Soldier, (since my sister is overseas in Afghanistan, bless her heart)! :')<br /><br />But his has to be one of the BEST BSB albums since Never Gone & This Is Us! :D
B009WUAK2M|3.0|I think this movie would have had potential for at least 4 stars if two things would have happened:<br />1) Arnold Swarzenegger or Bruce Willis wasn't in it (terrible acting), and<br />2) If someone decent would have written the script. Every line was a bad pun, a line from another movie, was predictable or was just induced eye-rolling. Yea.... we get it.... you were all big action heroes once. You don't have to keep reminding us which movies you were in with the movie lines written into the script. Besides... you already used them all in the first installment of this script-murdering series.<br />And by the way... in the first movie, they totally wasted Jet Li's talent so I'm not surprised (yet still disappointed) that he's not in the second one. They had all that talent in their reach and all they showed of his ninjarie was \\"implied ass-kickery\\" due to bad camera angles, two-second shots from each angle and crappy editing. Anywho... there ya have it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use it almost daily and I love the pull down screen.<br />It comes in handy. Love this app. It one of the good ones.
B00E8B1358|4.0|Gotta love the Rock!  Dwayne Johnson is one of the most under appreciated actors ever.  Great action, even my wife like it.
B003954I9C|5.0|I have always loved the Backstreet Boys! When Brian went solo, I loved his solo Christian album! When I downloaded Howie's solo album, I loved it instantly! But AJ's solo album is just as super cool & awesome as the other boys albums! The song Teenage Wildlife is my favorite song on the entire album, (first heard it when I saw NKOTBSB in July 2011); along with Have It All and London! I think AJ is the bad boy of the group, and he is so cool... I love him! :D
B0074PNCRM|5.0|This book is the only book to have ever made me cry. It has affected me somehow. Its weird.  Can not get over how this book left me with a feeling or happiness and sadness mixed together to make something so perfect. But oh wow Augustus Water is the most desirable character. He is sexy, smart, gentle. I shall cover be searching for him.  Such a sad tale but
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This game is really fun and almost just exactly as the real game!! Better than any other game app! (:
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I COULD NOT GET PAST THE FIRTS 20+% OF THE BOOK.  JUST NOT MY CUP OF TEA! THE ONLY BOOK FROM AMAZON THAT I HAVE ARCHIVED.
B004LWZW9C|1.0|I'm a lawyer in Miami. This is a review. I wrote it because I wanted to share my experience of watching this movie. My wife made me watch it. I just gave you a scooch of the experience of watching New Year's Eve, a movie overstuffed with characters who exposite who they are, what they are doing, and their motivations. The result is a sad spectacle of A and B list actors almost painfully going through the motions with stilted dialogue, explaining to the audience at every turn exactly the implications of the plot developments. \\"We're not sure if we'll be able to fix it.\\" \\"But we must fix it before midnight!\\" \\"We want to have the baby right after midnight so we can get the prize money!\\" I mean, are you kidding me with this dialogue?<br /><br />To sum up, I really hated this boring and pointless movie and didn't care about what happened to any of the characters at all. There was one short scene in which a woman was mean to an aspiring actress server that was well done. Right after that there's a speech with a woman holding a dog with no less than three continuity errors involving the position of the dog. (My wife pointed this out. I was proud of her. It's the kind of movie where you notice these kinds of things, as they are the most interesting aspects of the movie.)<br /><br />As a sidenote, earlier in the day I watched [[ASIN:B00BEIYN3M We're the Millers (Blu-ray+DVD+UltraViolet Combo Pack)]], which was incredibly hilarious and well done. Watch that instead.<br /><br />Another note: whoever was able to assemble this cast deserves some kind of award. A shame they were all squandered. (Caveat: Sofia Vergara is amazing as usual.) It's kind of like one of those yogurt places where you can get all kinds of toppings. Amazing toppings, but the yogurt is actually dog poo. (Spoiler alert: the dog poo is the movie.)
