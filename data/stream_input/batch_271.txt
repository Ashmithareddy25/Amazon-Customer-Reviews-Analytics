B00006JIA4|5.0|3 discs, 17 songs each, 51 songs.  The Platinum Collection supplants the gold Greatest Hits I & II CD along with the third greatest hits CD that came out later.  But is uniting them justifiable?  For Queen completists, this is the best thing barring a box set collecting all their albums together.  For me, the sound of Freddie's voice, backed by the operatic backing vocals of the others did it for me.<br />On the first disc, all the familiar tracks that have been played to death on radio are here.  The perennial classic, \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" leads the disc.  The disc ends with another all-time classic, the overplayed \\"We Will Rock You\\" and its companion track, \\"We Are The Champions.\\" which will be heard as long as America has sports events.  Then there's \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\" and \\"Bicycle Race.\\" \\"Flash\\" is a campy but fun track from Flash Gordon, and I always had a thing for the skiffle/50's rock of \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love.\\"<br />Two Highlander songs are on disc two, \\"A Kind Of Magic\\" and \\"Who Wants To Live Forever.\\"  The classic David Bowie collaboration \\"Under Pressure\\" is also here.  \\"I Want It All\\" is a hard-driving rocker from The Miracle.  A quick note:  I was at NMSU when Freddie Mercury died, and my colleagues Nicholas and Frank speculated that \\"Who Wants To Live Forever\\" and \\"The Show Must Go On\\" took on new meanings, as we figured that Freddie knew he was dying and had stoically accepted his fate.  The same can be said for \\"Too Much Love Will Kill You\\", on disc three.<br />The third disc should not, repeat, be denounced as a plate of warmed over leftovers.  Far from it, most of them have Freddie Mercury on vocals, whether with Queen or solo.  Elton John proves himself worthy of subbing for Freddie in \\"The Show Must Go On,\\" a tragic anthem that fit both Freddie and Princess Diana.  The mix of \\"Under Pressure\\" isn't that bad either.  And the anthemic \\"Princes Of The Universe\\" from Highlander is thankfully included.  The hard driving (pardon the pun) \\"Driven By You\\" proves that Brian May has got what it takes to be the new lead singer should he and the other two decide to make an album as a threesome.  And the inclusion of Wyclef Jean's take on \\"Another One Bites The Dust\\" is tolerable.<br />My personal favorites:  \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\", \\"Under Pressure\\", \\"The Show Must Go On\\", \\"Who Wants To Live Forever\\", \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\", \\"Flash\\", \\"I Want It All\\", \\"Headlong\\", \\"Somebody To Love\\", and \\"Driven By You\\".<br />The history and chart successes of each single, along with the picture of each single album cover in the booklet really helps out.  I had to laugh at the members in drag on the \\"I Want To Break Free\\" single.<br />If one has the gold Queen double CD along with the third greatest hits volume, this collection is superfluous.  However, for those who want a crash course in Queen, this is ideal.iven By You\\" proves that Brian May has got what it takes to be the new lead singer should he and the other two decide to make an album as a threesome.

B000000HRP|4.0|To remember what Collins used to do, and do so well, I submit for your consideration Brand X, a self-indulgent prog experiment sold in some circles as \\"jazz\\" if that makes you feel smarter or if you just hate Yes and Gentle Giant. The 70's twang in these songs isn't nearly as dated as say, Camel, but it's omnipresent all the same. This is a nostalgic romp into what people used to do when they had the time, and damn the consequences. Of course, sooner or later we grow up and write... for Miami Vice and MTV. It's amazing that music survived the 80's.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I just wanted everyone to know this is the best album I have bought in years. It is formed from the ashes of Rage Against the Machine and Soundgarden. Audioslave is an album that you can just pop in and listen to, unlike many band out there. Cornells voice and lyrics are still rocking as ever, and the power of Rage stands like a pillar of musical power that entertains you all the way on your musical journey. This band effects you in the way that you want to start a band after listening to it. The album sounds not anything close to the demos. Great album, do yourself a favor and pick it up.
B00006M183|4.0|From \\"Ten\\" to \\"Binaural\\" Pearl Jam's albums success have dropped. But as their albums progressed they got more mature and talented. Hey, it's evolution baby. \\"Riot Act\\" is the next phase of evolution. Sounding mostly like a sister cd to Binaural, Riot Act shows you more of the mellow yet more musical side of Pearl Jam. Before with albums like \\"Ten\\" \\"Vs.\\" \\"Yeild\\" and \\"Vitology\\" their sound was riding on the hooks of their singles. Now with Binarual and Riot Act they're riding on the ingenuity of the flow and build of the album. Listening to \\"Riot\\" is a different kind of experience because it puts you in the middle of a Pearl Jam jam session. The sound is so vibrant you can feel like you're there standing in between Mike McCready and Stone Gossard as they duel off in a guitar swamp. The album may not be built on single tracks but it does have a it's great moments like tracks like \\"Can't Keep,\\" \\"Save You,\\" \\"I Am Mine,\\" \\"Get Right,\\" and \\"1/2 Full.\\" The most offset track, well the second most offset track on the album, \\"You Are\\" sounds like something Mike picked up off of Tom Morello. But Eddie Vedders baritone vocals coat it with a real Pearl Jam feel. The most offset track on the album is the minute long \\"Arc\\" which just makes you think, \\"wait, what?\\" Riot Act shows you the more mellow side of Pearl Jam that really brings out their playing talent as brilliant musicians. 8.5/10 Highlights: \\"Can't Keep\\" \\"1/2 Full\\" \\"Thumbing My Way\\" \\"Save You\\" \\"I Am Mine\\"
0375414053|5.0|For every woman who is a working mom, this book speaks to you.  Not all of us can relate to the business trips across the ocean, but I don't know anyone who doesn't struggle with the fact that they leave their children with a babysitter everyday to go to work to make money to pay the babysitter...<br />Funny, tear inducing, sad in places, this book left a place in my heart.  Very seldom does a book just reach out and grab you the way this one did me.  I was upset that it ended.  My one criticism would be that the book seemed a bit rushed in the end.
6300181553|4.0|My dad was always making sure I knew that the song &quot;White Christmas&quot; originated in this film, and not the Crosby/Kaye movie named &quot;White Christmas&quot;, so that's the first trivia question answer about &quot;Holiday Inn&quot;. The other interesting tidbit is that the hotel chain &quot;Holiday Inn&quot; was named for this movie! Seems the owner saw the movie and thought it was a good name for the new hotels he was opening up, and presto! There you go.<br />It's an easy enough plot line: Bing and Fred used to be partnered with a gal engaged to Bing, but she throws him over to be with Fred. Bing, a performer fed up with working so hard,  retreats to a farm and eventually dreams up the idea of an inn which is ONLY open on holidays, giving him the rest of the year to loaf around. Aspiring entertainer Marjorie Reynolds shows up on Christmas just on cue to be serenaded with &quot;White Christmas&quot;, and things look pretty cozy for them pretty fast. But complications arise when the now-jilted Fred turns up at the inn on New Year's, and the gal chase is on again, but now after Bing's new star/girlfriend. Jealousy plays a few tricks on everyone before every Jack gets the proper Jill by movie's end. <br />A few of the other reviewers say that the film is marred by the Lincoln's birthday number Bing leads in blackface. While I agree that the segment unfortunately makes the movie one with a limited audience in today's more racially charged atmosphere, I think a bigger problem with the movie is...Bing himself! Yep, I don't think Bing is a very nice fellow in the movie, even though Fred is supposed to be the cad, as one reviewer put it. When Bing gets wind of Fred's interest in the new gal as a dancing partner (before any protestations of love, mind you), Bing immediately begins to dissemble and lie to prevent Marjorie Reynolds from having her big break. His proposal to her on Lincoln's Birthday is somewhat lackluster, and then when Fred asks him about the engagement, Bing backpedals and says basically that he's not engaged. Uhm, that kind of behavior would make Bing a bum, not a hero. Let's face it: he deserves to have his girlfriend walk out on him! Even when he finally goes to Hollywood to win Marjorie back, it's only to cramp her style and make her give up her burgeoning movie career to return to his lazy lifestyle at the inn. There should be recriminations for the Bing character, and there are not.<br />Lest you think that I hate &quot;Holiday Inn&quot;, let me assure you that that's not the case. Bing always is a good performer, and Fred makes even the most difficult numbers seem effortless--check out the firecracker dance on July 4th! It was a bit wild to see the superpatriotic song of the Freedom Man, done by Bing with his big ole Uncle Sam hat because of the sudden interpolation of the armed forces footage, culminating in images of MacArthur and FDR. Just in case anyone was doubting whether the film came from the war years, y'know! All of us watching the movie thought it a shame that Marjorie Reynolds didn't really catch on, because she's quite cute in many shots and she is more graceful with Fred than the other lady who earlier jettisoned Bing. <br />Final verdict? &quot;Holiday Inn&quot; is pretty good still, though the blackface number may offend some viewers and Bing's character is not exactly a white hat himself. Have a happy holiday with Bing and Fred down at the inn!
B00006YXEK|5.0|This album is beyond 'Good' - it's truly great! Without a doubt the best release of the year; not only because of the obvious reason! But, because George, during his final days, crafted and recorded honest songs without expressing a dreary sadness of his condition - rather he shows grace and leaves us with songs that are inspirational and simply...'good'.<BR>Lavish in guitar and beautifully produced (without crowding the simplicity of the material) songs like 'Pisces Fish', Vatican Blues', 'Rising Sun' are gems and classic George. His humourous nature is there and his love of instrumentation that marked his legend is used theoughout the album...the ukelele and a thread of indian ensemble encompass this CD. He records his version of 'Run So Far' originally written for Clapton's 'Journeyman' Album and covers 'Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea'.<BR>This album may be a bit 'Posher' than George wanted but as Jeff Lynne said; \\"the songs were too good to be left like demos\\"
B00006RU5B|5.0|Very rarely does an album with such high expectations ever live up to those expectations.  Very rarely, if ever, does a so-called \\"supergroup\\" ever sound anything near super.  Well, this one does both.  I was sure that I'd be at least slightly disappointed with this CD since I was/am both a huge Soundgarden fan AND a huge Rage Against the Machine fan.  I grew up w/ both of these bands in heavy rotation in my CD player.  Well these guys have managed to sound at times NOTHING like either band and at times EVERYTHING like both bands - and it ALL works.  Some songs, such as the single \\"Cochise\\" and \\"Set It Off\\" have the classic Rage grooves combined w/ Cornell's searing vocals to produce a \\"best of both worlds\\" sonic production.  But the songs that stand out the most are the completely original-sounding, surprisingly emotive tunes such as \\"I Am The Highway\\" and \\"Like A Stone\\".  The 14 songs on this CD range from flat-out jams to almost ballad-esqe beauty.  Tim C. and Brad Wilk are, as always, the tightest sounding rhythm section in rock and perfectly complement Cornell's vocals (which honestly surprised me).  Of course, the highlight of the CD is probably Tom Morello's guitar playing.  We all knew he can make more noises w/ his guitar than a rack full of effects and turntables, but he also shows wonderful restraint at times by staying w/in the confines of the song.  And that's the bottom line:  These are GREAT SONGS.  Don't listen for Soundgarden (go buy Badmotorfinger if you must).  Don't listen for Rage (go buy Evil Empire if you must).  Just take in the great new ORIGINAL band that is Audioslave, and be rewarded.

B00000AFDW|5.0|Even if you are not a KISS fan, and just a fan of good solid rock and roll, this album is a must for you. I am a huge fan of KISS and never thought that I could like an album of theirs better than Love Gun.  I think that Pyscho Circus may be just that.  The title track, Within, I Pledge Allegiance..., Into The Void, We Are One, You Wanted The Best, Dreamin', and Journey Of 1000 Years, are all FANTASTIC!  And that is 8 of the 10 tracks.  The Peter Criss ballad is good, although I do not know why they had to do a ballad.  Something along the line of Hard Luck Woman or Strange Ways would have been perfect, but who is complaining.  The only song that I am not a huge fan of is Raise Your Glasses, but if 9 out of 10 are fantastic, you cannot beat that.  The bottom line:  BUY THIS ALBUM AND CRANK IT UP!!!!
B00006YXEK|5.0|The DVD to this box set is a gyp.  Its 7 minutes long and you can see the whole thing on the Capitol Records web site for free.  The poster is nice, but its folded a bunch of times to fit into the box and its certainly not suitable for framing in that condition.  It also comes with a &quot;record company&quot; sticker, hardly essential and a guitar pic (WOO HOO).  Honestly, this album is a 5 star album, this &quot;limited edition&quot; excluding the album is a 1 star package...Save your money and buy the regular edition
B00006LSM3|4.0|The guitar that can instantly be recognized as George Harrison winds through these tracks, along with his wit and spiritual themes. If for no other reason that the great lyrics and the wonderful guitar treatments, this CD should be added to any Beatle fan's collection. George seems so comfortable with himself on this CD. One might even say 'at peace' but, then, he may not have known for sure this was going to be the last recording.
B00005IC2H|4.0|This is great background music. Relaxing, not too stimulating. Some excellent guitar textures, very subtle. Good music but rather aimless and meandering. It's really cool that they sing in their own made-up language. Ingestion of serious mind-altering drugs highly recommended for listening. Then again most people who listen to this are pretty messed-up without drugs. LOL
B000009EAD|5.0|I used to see ads for Iced Earth in magazines and just blow them off as another [bad] nu-metal band. Boy was I wrong!!! Being a fan of \\"old school\\" metal bands like Iron Maiden and Judas Priest, I have no tolerance for bands these days that try to call themselves metal. Iced Earth is not one of these bands. I recently bought \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" with the live album, \\"Alive in Athens\\"; they are now the best two albums I own. SWTWC is a great album start to finish. Let me take you through the tracks.<br />Burning Times:A great album opener! Killer rhythm.<br />Melancholy(Holy Martyr):This is a beautiful ballad. Great music and lyrics. This is now my favorite IE song.<br />Disciples of the Lie:Don't you hate it when a good album has one song on it that you just don't like. I usually skip this one.<br />Watching Over Me:A heartfelt ballad about a friend of Jon Schaffer's that died in a motorcycle accident. The live version makes you wanna cry.<br />Stand Alone:Good rhythm, and the lyrics have a good message about thinking for yourself.<br />Consequences:I love the acoustic guitar rhythm in this song. This one also has a good message.<br />My Own Savior: Pretty good song. It's got your generic metal lyrics. I like the chorus though.<br />Reaping stone:I like the intro a lot, but the rest of the song doesn't really fit the tone of the album. Reminds me of Metal Church<br />1776:It feels good to know that at least one band can still pull off a good instrumental. It's short but damn is it sweet.<br />Blessed Are You:A song with a beautiful acoustic verse and a killer chorus rhythm. I love the acoustic lead fills during the verse. Great lyrics too.<br />Prophecy:The last three songs are worth the asking price alone!!! They are all based on a concept of an evil one coming to earth. This song is awesome start to finish!!<br />Birth of the Wicked: An awesome song about the birth of the wicked one. This is what true metal is!!!<br />The Coming Curse:The best song onthe album!!! It starts with a piano intro that sets the mood for an excellent song.<br />Well that's it. I suggest if you are a fan of old metal, but want something new to listen to, get into Iced Earth. I've heard their other albums are great too, and can't wait till I get my hands on em'.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I like others didn't know what to make of this cornell/rage mega band. Well... they rule!... the opening track cocoise is as kick butt as you can get. Some other stand up tracks (to me anyway) are \\"like a stone\\", \\"exploder\\" and \\"shadow of the sun\\". Fact of the matter is all the tracks are rockin'. You get with this album what you don't get with a lot of others, more bang for your buck. It might take some rage fans a little bit of time to get use to cornell's great power voice but after awhile you'll mos def get use to it. Get this album and just blast it on wherever you listen to your music. Audioslave = bad band name, the members of Audioslave = kick butt rock!.
B00005JK8K|2.0|I found this movie to be a major disappointment.  The acting was terrible even by Nicolas Cage.  The guy who played Ben Yahzee did a pretty good acting job, though.<br />The battle scenes were just terrible.  The Japanese apparently couldn't hit the side of a barn while Cage takes out 3 standing out in the open from 75 yards with a hand gun.  Many of the Japanese soldiers just ran up to get stabbed or shot.  The bombs were too fiery; not realistic and I know as a former Artillery Officer.  The bit where Yahzee and Enders trick the Japanese into thinking Enders is a prisoner; get real.  A total joke.<br />On a bright note, I thought the cinematography, especially of the Arizona Desert with the bluffs was awesome.  I'm glad that the Navajo were given credit for their service in WWII.  It's just too bad that it couldn't have been a better movie.
0060934719|2.0|I love the ideas.  A man chasing after a fallen star to claim the heart of his beloved is a great idea, and I really wanted to see it play out more.  Unfortunately, the characters are highly wooden and everything seems to tie together much too neatly by the end (and much of it was highly predictable). Also, this Faerie world had wonderful potential for letting the imagination run wild, even if held within the confines of fairy tale type stories.  Many of the bits I really enjoyed (like the tongue twister elf who aided him, or the secret castle society) were just not fully explored and exploited to bring a sense of fullness to the work.  In comparison to Neverwhere, which seemed rough but very original, this comes off as fairly bland.<br />Where Gaiman is weakest is in the control of bare bones prose, especially with the dialogue. I can appreciate his desire to hold onto a sense of the fairy tale through simplistic prose, but it only came off to me as highly commercial and not at all artful.  Much of it, in fact, reads like a treatment for a graphic novel, and it still needs to rely on strong images to help bring the full magic of  the story.<br />It seems Gaiman's ulitmate purpose is to use the form of the fairy tale to tell us a slightly new type of story.  Unfortunately, compared to other writers like Gregory Maguire with _Wicked_ or even himself with the Sandman and his short fiction, this work falls a good bit short.
B00004XPPC|5.0|This is a must-see film for anyone who wants to even pretend to be 'up' on film history or attempt to pass pronouncements on current films.  David Lean crafted one of history's best cinematic experiences with this 1957 film.  Alec Guiness is great as the 'leader' of a group of British POW's under the supervision of a Japanese war camp superintendant.  The prisoners have been forced to build a bridge over the river that bears the film's namesake.  Less an action film than a drama, BRIDGE OVER THE RIVER KWAI gives us fascinating characters and shows us how they change over the course of the film.  In the end we have learned much about each of them, and no one is quite what he seems to be at the beginning.  While there is action, this is almost more of a character study in how humans bear up under extraordinary circumstances. <br />Highly recommended.
B00005JH7D|4.0|Marcus Miller is one of the best bassists around, one of the best ever. He ranks with Vic Wooten, Alain Caron, Jeff Berlin and John Pattituci as being one of the best bass players today. But, as opposed to those mentioned, Marcus' musical frame is more mainstream-oriented. This CD is a brilliant display of his virtuosity and creativity on the instrument. What made me give this album 4 stars and not 5 is the overproduction. It is basically a smooth/funky Jazz cd. If it was a sax instead of a bass, I would not listen to it. But, because I am a bass player, and Marcus, like I said, is one of the greatest, I do listen to it because it is required listening for a bassist. But I would recommend to him to adopt a more organic approach instead of relying so much on synths and drum machines. Get a group of great musicians and let them wail along with you and record it live in the studio. I think I would then give such a cd ten stars if I could. He has got the talent, the creativity, the knowledge to make absolutely amazing music, but his technological inclinations render his music a bit dull, repetitive, and cold. But in the right mood, and in small doses, this album does satisfy.
044022425X|4.0|\\"Drums of Autumn\\" was a fantastic book...though at times sad... I can tell you that in order to apprecaite this story, you MUST read it as part of a series. While I enjoyed getting to know Roger and Brianna better, I have to admit that a part of me mourns the youth of Jamie and Claire..all of those years that they lost!!! Well, at least theyre together now...another thing that got to me was the decision that young Ian comes to in this book..however I cant deny that it was completely in his character to do as he did....anyways, if you love the \\"Outlander\\" series as much as I do..then you really MUST read this book...I think youll be glad you did.
0552137030|5.0|So what do you do knowing that the Earth only has a few days left? Sit back and let the bad times roll? Never! This novel is the most brilliant piece of work I have ever read; a wonderfully paced journey through Earth's final days before the apocalypse. The jokes are original and imaginative, the characters sensational and unforgettable.<br />Aziraphale, the angel, and Crowley, the demon, have found themselves in right predicament. They've been on Earth since the 'beginning' and have more than a little soft spot for the place. Enemies for so long that they have become friends, Crowley and Aziraphale enter the race to save the world from a misplaced Antichrist. Featuring a wonderfully eccentric cast including the four horsemen of the Apocalypse (who ride motorcycles and wear jackets proclaiming them the 'Real' Hell's Angels), the Witchfinder Army, a satanic hellhound with an identity crisis and familiar faces from both Heaven and Hell.<br />Intelligent, witty, and chronically hilarious, this is by far the best novel I've ever read. For the fans of Pratchett, Death is very reminiscent of the ever popular Discworld series and the writing style is the perfect blend of both authors. Full of insight and cutting observations on life, this novel will likely become one of your time-honored favorites.
B00005JKG9|3.0|First of all, let me go on the record as saying that Glengarry Glen Ross is one of my all-time favorite films. The acting is nothing short of astounding. Each actor (particularly Jack Lemmon) is at the top of their form. This is an actor's movie. There's no special effects, chase scenes, superfluous love story subplot, or pat ending. It should be obvious to anyone watching this film that it is based on a play -- specifically, David Mamet's Pulitzer-prize winning play of the same name. Mamet also wrote the screenplay, which is full of the fiery brilliance he always brings to the table. This is not a film for the timid. The language is raw and crude. The film takes no prisoners and I love it.<br />The film takes place in a real estate office, where cutthroat salesman do \\"cold calling,\\" basically selling land by telemarketing. It's a brutal business (we've all been on the other end of that phone call and usually end up hanging up on the salesman), and the people these guys work for are brutal as well.<br />Case in point: during an early, crucial scene, Blake (played brilliantly by Alec Baldwin) tells the gathered crew that the top prize for highest sales is a Cadillac. The second prize is a set of steak knives and the third prize -- \\"you're fired.\\" The speech is a sadistic, humiliating version of a pep talk, all macho brags and venomous insults. He dangles the new contacts, or \\"leads,\\" in the faces of the salesmen. \\"They're for closers,\\" he tells them. These guys would kill for the good leads, and Blake knows it. The scene was written especially fo the film and Baldwin eats it up. It's easily the best thing I've seen him do.<br />Jack Lemmon plays Sheldon Levene, the office's oldest employee. He used to be the best one around (they call him \\"The Machine\\"), but he's been on a bad streak lately and desperately needs his luck to change. His daughter's in the hospital and is unable to pay her medical bills. Al Pacino plays Ricky Roma, the current hotshot. His way of befriending a potential client in a bar and gaining his trust is odd, but effective (his opening monologue is totally insane, but thoroughly entertaining). Kevin Spacey is the office manager who will not bend the rules for anyone, much to the rage of the office. Ed Harris and Alan Arkin round out the rest of the salesmen. Harris plays Dave Moss, who has the world's biggest chip on his shoulder. Arkin is George Aaronow, who desperately needs to land a good sale. Most of his role consists of reacting to Harris and Pacino, but he's very good.<br />The day after Baldwin's talk, the salesman come to work to find the office robbed. The new leads are missing. Probably an inside job. It could have been anyone. Everyone is questioned by the police and everyone is insulted that they are considered suspects. Ricky is mad because the robbery may have screwed up his latest sale, putting his ownership of the Cadillac in jeopardy. Also, last night's client comes looking for him -- he has second thoughts. The way Ricky tries desperately to blow off his client while still playing the salesman is creepy and brilliant. Lemmon is amazing as Levene -- I've never seen desperation played so well.<br />Having said all that, I, along with the rest of the GGR fans, have been waiting years for this film to arrive on DVD. Especially since it's been promised as a \\"two-disc special edition.\\" What a disappointing package it turned out to be.<br />Well, let's be fair. First of all, the film. It looks great. It sounds great. They did a great job with the film itself. But don't promise a loaded special edition and then give us something as lame as this. The only commentary track on the widescreen version is director James Foley. He only speaks during three scenes. The other commentary tracks are only available on the full-frame version (on disc two) and are not scene-specific.<br />The extras include \\"Magic Time,\\" a tribute to the late Jack Lemmon, which is well-meaning but could have been a lot better. It does, however, end with a clip from Lemmon's appearance on \\"Inside the Actor's Studio,\\" which is sweet.

B00006V9A0|5.0|I have never been a true huge fan, and i cannot attest to own all of the albums, but one thing i know for sure, this compilation comes only short of the true greatness of Nirvana. Where are &quot;Polly&quot; and the rest of great tracks that ive heard before? For all i now, this should have been a double cd set. Also, a &quot;single of you know youre right&quot; was supposed to come out about a month ago, but never did, leaving the true fans, which own every single album (and singles) to buy the &quot;best of&quot; compilation with only 1 unreleased track. If you tell me this is just another way to squeeze out those dollars. Next thing up is the box set with all of the albums and 1 rarities album, which will make true fans spend more than they need to.  <BR>The best thing about this compilation is that it gives easy access to those who do not own the records to the big hits of the band, and gives the younger generations a taste of what true rock was a decade ago. And of course some of the greatest tunes froo the beggining of the 90's. <BR>As for me, ill be waiting for Vol. 2, and sincerely hope that the record company thinks of Nirvana's true fans the next time...<BR>and by the way, &quot;You know youre right&quot; rocks!
B00006RU5B|4.0|Cornell's chords (vocal) rock & Tom Morello's guitar kicks... the Rage and Sound Garden influence are there, but there's also a new more mature, but still fresh, sound.  First Cd since Tool and SOD that made me think \\"... a right\\"<br />On a related note check out my friends band at ... ...
B000002IU9|5.0|Powerfull, if you don't know heavy metal, hear this album, this is heavy metal, true belivers...
B0000542D2|2.0|Anyone with a 5.1 setup should read David Ranada's review in the December '02 issue of Sound &amp; Vision prior to purchase. This version has a &quot;remixed and enhanced&quot; soundtrack. Nobody would put up with a colorized DVD of this film, yet that's exactly what they've done to the audio. As Ranada said, all this version does is drive up the price of the original MPI version.
B00006YXEK|5.0|It`s been ages since George gave us something new (ok, there was \\"Horse to the Water\\" last year), but that was a just a taste of what he`s been building up to. This is a full, powerful album, and a worthy epitaph to his career. Thank you George. You still got it, and always will. :)
0385484518|5.0|I was first introduced to this book in my sociology class at college.  At first I wasn't too interested in reading the book but I wanted to give it a try.<BR>  <BR>  I started to read the book and was amazed how interesting it was.  I couldn't put the book down.  I had started reading the book at work and finished it later that evening.  <br />  The best part of the book was that it is a true story.  I think for me knowing this I found the book wonderfull.  Morrie's views on life and death gave me a postive outlook.  I wish everyone could read this book just to get an optomistic view in life, for everyone to take the time out to find the simple things in life important.<br />  I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to others.  It may help a lot of people deal with death in their personal lives as well as addressing lifes complexities.
B00005BL2A|5.0|I gave this album a five star because DM is now over 20 years old and still making quality and honest music. Hands down. It's totally normal that this album doesn't have the glory of the Violator or Music for the masses days. That days are over, not because DM doesn't have nothing more to say, but because they are grownups now, with families and turbulent past, their minds and emotions have changed since then. You will NEVER ever hear anything like Violator, Music, Reward, Celebration again - Alan isn't the only case. They have changed, matured - whatever that means. You can sense that.<BR>On every album you can hear their thoughts and see their progress. SOFAD was the culmination that ended it all. Then came Ultra, their darkest album ever - album that instantly killed and burried the glamour and craziness of SOFAD deep underground, with only desperation and a little hope left. Sister of night was now the only saviour.<br />But hopefully the guys have menaged to heal themselves and Exciter shows three men that have healed the wounds physically, but the disasterous (post)effect are still present. There's no willingness nor time to go on the same road ever again. SOFAD permanently ended a DM period that we used to know. That's called a life - ups and downs that you cannot even imagine.<BR>Martin seems rather happy now, so does Dave and Andy. When you are happy you don't think a lot, at least not about some &quot;true&quot; stuff that make music and other arts really moving and extraordinary (that could explain why Ultra had one of the best lyrics Martin has ever written). That's why, I think, Martin had some real troubles making the new songs. Add the 20 years of fame and great albums that you try to top of and the panic is there.<br />All I know is that I had some bloody good time at their concert in Prague 2001. When the show was over I was stunned - I saw that Exciter was real - honest product with normal limitations.<BR>After all these years Depeche Mode can still make the best concerts, Exciter songs sounded AWESOME live and we could all sense their good vibes and energy after all they have been through.<BR>Thank you Depeche Mode!
B000069AUI|5.0|That I like every single song on it.  IMO, there is not a bad song on it, which is worth the cost of entry alone.  A great addition to an collection.
B00006CXSS|5.0|An intimate look at the men who gave their lives so the world can be at peace--this documentary-movie definitely salutes them. I'd give this 10 stars. <br />This movie is not just something one must own, it's a gift one must pass on so others will learn and remember.  Kudos to the makers and actors of this film and thanks for giving us a way to keep the spirit of these brave men alive for the next generation!
0385508417|4.0|I liked the book.  It flowed nicely and didn't take forever to read.  I walked away happy that I'd taken the time to sit down with it.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Mulholland Drive is a trip into the bizarre, or a trip into a bizarre mind.  A perfect example of what movies can do, and how they can challenge us.  Brilliantly written and relayed to film with the same expertise.<br />The first amazing point to make is that this movie started out as a television show!  Canceled by ABC before it even aired once.... dummies (no wonder they have the lowest rated big network: no guts)  And then brilliantly reshot in places and made into one of the most brilliant and challenging films in recent days by DAVID LYNCH (Twin Peaks, Blue Velvet, The Straight Story).<br />It's a complex movie.  Every single shot.  Every single setting piece has complexity and deeper meaning.  Each scene, camera shot, character and line of dialogue has a deeper and darker meaning then what is on the surface.  Take some time.  Really pay attention.<br />The brilliance of the movie is that, through all the double-meanings, twists, turns and confusion.  It all works, and it all comes full circle and explains itself.<br />The main selling point for this movie, in my opinion, is the brilliance of the actors involved.  LAURA HARRING and more specifically NAOMI WATTS were phenominal.  Both deserved oscar nominations (which Harring did get one), and WATTS deserved to win.  Not only did they play complex characters, but they fleshed out numerous personalities from one extreme to the other.<br />This movie was nominated for numerous oscars and deserved to win!  It deserved far more recognition than A BEAUTIFUL MIND.
B00005IC2H|5.0|Sigur R&oacute;s are the best new group these days.  In my opinion, Rock & Roll as we all love it, is seriously on its last legs.  I think the last great rock group was Nirvana.  Today's \\"rock\\" that fills the charts and airwaves is senseless turned-up pop.  In the void that is left open, new groups with new ideas and innovations and styles step in to fill it.  This movement is called Post Rock.  Get into it.  It may never fill up the radio or charts, but its not meant to really, and it doesn't care.  Anyway, at the head of this movement are bands like Godspeed, Fly Pan Am, and (my favorite) Sigur R&oacute;s.  Sigur R&oacute;s come from Iceland and strive to bring the beauty of their homeland into their music.  They succeed at it, very very well.  Svefn-G-Englar is an unquestionable masterpiece.  I will never tire of that song, and I listen to it about 3 times a day (it is 9 minutes).  Some interesting innovations of Sigur R&oacute;s are: They are Icelandic (may not seem like an accomplishment, but how many Icelandic bands do you know of that are big like them?  Yeah besides Bjork.), their singer sings in falsetto, he plays his guitar with a bow (as much as it sounds like it, they did not rip this off of Zeppelin), all their songs are at least 6 minutes, and they pointedly do not sing about romantic topics.  But that does not describe the beauty of the music.  I do not know if that can be done.  Sometimes when I listen to Svefn, it makes me want to cry its so beautiful.  This may be the best-spent $... of your life if you buy it.  So buy it.
B00006YXEK|5.0|I don't own everything George ever recorded, but I do know that this is contains some of his greatest songs. The lead-off track, \\"Any Road\\", even sounds like an outtake from the Traveling Wilburys sessions. In fact, since Jeff Lynne produced both projects, the album has a similar (crunchy) feel to the Wilburys' records.<BR>The content is a little more dour than one might expect from George, but this is in fact quite optimistic for someone who knew he was dying. There is a mixture of sadness and acceptence that permeates the songs, which are all top notch. The special limited edition offers a poster and an inconsequential DVD on the making of the album, which is really for die-hards only. Either edition, however, is a fine addition to the collection of any fan, no matter how casual.
B00005JKG9|5.0|first i must admit i didn't see this movie in theatres,i saw it about a year later on cable and was completely blown away.the performances,directing,story,all of it,trying to pick a favorite  actor in this movie is like trying to guess who's gonna win the lotto it's impossible.<br />i recently bought the DVD after waiting forever to get it and i love it,sure there are some things that could have been better but hey i'm just glad to have it on dvd finally.<br />i highly reccomend this movie,but if your not into talky dramas (neither am i) you may want to rent it first.<br />This movie is a MUST see.
B00006LSM3|5.0|I was a little afraid to listen to this album. Most posthumous albums seem to be stuff that was picked from the cutting room floor and patched together or half finished work filled in with studio musicians. I was pleasantly surprised then to find 'Brainwashed' to be a well conceived album with George Harrison sounding vibrant and full of life. The music at times is reminiscent of 'The Traveling Wilbury's' with lots of acoustic guitar and sparse instrumentation. George knew how gravely ill he was at the time these songs were written and they're full of introspective reflections on life. It's the most substantial piece of work he's done since 'All Things Must Pass' and it's head and tails above anything McCartney has done in decades. My only complaint is Jeff Lynne's mixing which is always over produced. He's shown some restraint here, but it's still got that ELO sound in spots.<br />I would highly recommend this album to any Beatles or Harrison fan.
B000005GWE|5.0|Some collaborations between jazz giants seem to have been disappointing for whatever reason. John Scofield and Pat Metheny have such distinct approaches to jazz guitar, who could have foreseen what such a project would end up like? They may well have staked out their own territory at left and right speakers and just dueled off one another, but this stuff works incredibly well as a *collaboration*, a perfectly enmeshed meeting of two great minds of music (how's that for alliteration?)<br />John and Pat take about an equal share of songwriting. Some of John's best tunes are here showcased, such as the knowing, easy swing of the title cut, the lovely ballad \\"No Matter What\\" (he can sure do those too!) and the catchy, accessible \\"Everybody's Party\\". The two of them play in unison so well, it sounds like a single guitar run through a chorus effect or something, but then one of them will snag some witty harmonic aside in there somewhere and remind you that in fact two different guitars are playing. Beautiful.<br />Pat's placid acoustic numbers like \\"Message to My Friend\\" and \\"Quiet Rising\\" blend in the mix pretty well, and it's nice to hear Sco fitting into that context too (in fact, Amazon.com says that this recording date made Scofield finally actually buy an acoustic guitar, and the acoustic album _Quiet_ resulted a couple years later). Which is not to say that's the only thing Pat brings to the table. He rips it up in the energetic \\"The Red One\\", wherein he takes a solo with his distinctive \\"synth-guitar\\".<br />The rhythm section of Stewart/Swallow is impeccable. I love those little Chinese cymbals Bill Stewart uses to punctuate certain songs. Bassist Steve Swallow (always choosing just the right note instead of walking his fingers off trying to find it) and Scofield have such a history, they play perfect together. Terrific album, sterling quality all around, highly recommended.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina shows her vulnerabilities and bares her soul on this album.  People need to stop focusting on her clothing or lack thereof and listen to the messages in this album that touches on everything from double standards that exist in society, empowering women, domestic violence, love gone sour, etc.  At least she's got the guts to stand up for herself and embraces her individuality, but people are giving her flack for not conforming.  This album shows more of her great vocal range and singing ability.  Hands down the girl can sing and no one can take that away from her.  She can blow Britney, Mandy, Jessica and all those other pop princesses out of the water. Go cop the album.  It's well worth it with its R&amp;B, Latin, pop, rock, etc. edge.
B00006IUNN|2.0|How disappointing!  I expected the true story of the Windtalkers, and what I saw was a war movie with a white guy as the hero.  Did the Nicholas Cage character even exist?  Some of the fight scenes could have been shortened in order to give the background of the Navaho, how they were put into Indian schools as children and punished if they spoke their own language, how they struggled with whether or not to become code talkers, how they set up the code, and their life after the war.  Some day someone should make a movie about the Windtalkers.
B00006RU5B|4.0|It's not exactly &quot;rage against the machine&quot;, and it's not exactly &quot;soundgarden&quot;, yet in both the backgound music and in the vocals of Chris Cornell, it adds up to a very good mix. The whole album is well done and shows true tallent (that is almost expected from guys like this). Not all the songs are wonderful, but the ones that are are a joy to listen to. Tom Morello and Tim C. have kept their same jazz fusion style mostly (including those funky guitar effects that we love so much), and Chris is still, undoubtedly, is one of the best vocalists in rock. The politics have completely gone along with Zach (though perhaps i've missed a couple metaphors) and are replaced with Chris's poetry about simple day to day life. Of all the courses Tom, Tim, and Brad could have taken this was probobly the best. I still miss Zach, his energy, and the political messages. Though rage only managed to do 4 albums, I still think they were one of the best bands ever, and rage's essence will be missed. Audioslave is a good effort. it's not better nor worse, just different.
B00006YXEK|5.0|George Harrison's solo work was sporadic, both in it's frequency and quality, ranging from the awesome \\"All Things Must Pass\\" to the pretty good \\"Cloud Nine\\" to the dismal \\"Gone Troppo\\". It makes it a bit of a gamble buying any album he recorded, and one has to worry even more when the album was completed posthumously, by his son and his close friend. One worries even more when that friend is Jeff Lynne, whose recording history has tended to showcase very heavy handed production techniques.<br />All these worries are unfounded. The album is a joy, the last statement by a man who had found an inner peace and happiness. One might expect to be listening to this album within the context of Harrison's recent death, but in fact, that context falls away with the sheer pleasure of listening to the material here. <br />\\"Any Road\\" is a wonderfully relaxed song, turning a spritiual journey into a pleasurable jaunt. \\"Brainwashed\\", the title song, is actually perhaps the least of the songs here, though still pretty good - it's just that Harrison wasn't a great song-yeller in his later years, and it shows on this track. <br />It goes on, and is just fantastic. <br />The bonus dvd is a 7 minutes making of video that is scant on details, rich on observations of the man at work. It has been available on the net for some time, and is not critical to the package. Nor are the sticker, poster, or guitar pick. Frankly, the standard issue of this album should more than be adequate for most people. <br />Enjoy!
B00006RU5B|5.0|I was waiting forever for this cd, and although I had downloaded the demos online it was nothing like the actual cd.  I was extremely pleased with how their first cd turned out.  Although some Rage Against The Machine fans might miss the political lyrics by Zack De La Rocha (Rage's former lead singer), Chris Cornell more then makes up for Zack's absence.  Songs such as 'Cochise', 'Set It Off', and 'Gasoline' are amazingly crafted and sounds similar to Rage Against The Machine but more improved and mature.  Chris Cornell's voice and lyrics can be both soothing and piercing (in a good way).  Tom Morello, as expected continues to show why he is one of the most innovative and talented guitarists in the world.  And not to forget Tim Commerford who still continues his, mastering of the bass.  Brad Wilk on the other hand seems a little more reserved on this album; which isn't bad at all.  His presence and precision is perfect on both the hard and mellower songs.  One of the most stand out tracks is `I Am The Highway' a beautiful power ballad that you might not expect coming from the three former members of Rage Against The Machine.  After listening to this cd it becomes apparent that Chris Cornell is perfect for this band and this band is perfect for Chris Cornell.  This isn't Rage Against The Machine and it isn't Soundgarden; its better, more mature, and just an amazing cd.  I highly recommend it.
6303379214|4.0|In most of the reviews I've read on this movie, people point out the highlights of Robert Downey, Jr. and Marisa Tomei, as they should. Both of the stars of this film are definitely worth watching (however cheesy they may get). What people also recognize is Bonnie Hunt in a fabulous best friend role that you will make you think of your best friend.<br />The other great parts of this film are some of the supporting actors. Fisher Stevens is hilarious as Kate's roofer husband who can't believe his wife is in \\"It-ly\\" as he pronounces the ever so romantic country. People also neglect mentioning Giovanni (Joaquim De Almeida), the man who tries to woo the married Kate (Bonnie Hudson). He does the perfect foreign playboy role. And, of course, you've got Billy Zane in the cast to mix things up. <br />The cast all complement each other and this is one of those movies that girls should really watch together to bond. Guys will think its ok since it does have some funny parts. Overall, this is a chick flick but its a very good chick flick.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I have not heard an album so diverse, exciting, heavy, masterful, etc. in many years!  The members of Audioslave (comprised of Chris Cornell, Tim Commerford, Tom Morello, and Brad Wilk) have said in recent interviews that they have a special chemistry together and if their first record is any indication, that special chemistry is going to set the music world on it's head!  From the opening track (and first single) \\"Cochise\\", Audioslave rips through the tracks with wailing guitar solos, masterful bass and drums, and soulful lyrics.  This album is an absolute necessity for rock/metal fans of all ages!!
B00006RU5B|5.0|Rage Against the Machine has adopted a new lead singer and a new sound for their first release under the &quot;Audioslave&quot; alias.   Make no mistake: they still rock incredibly hard.  But new singer Chris Cornell has a bit more soul to his voice and fewer political messages to deliver than did Zach de la Rocha.  Cornell's lyrics are emotional and introspective, and his singing ability allows the band to experiment with melody in ways that Rage could not.  &quot;I am the Highway&quot; and &quot;Getaway Car,&quot; for example, are a couple of very melodic and pleasant tunes.  They're also a bit less percussive than the old Rage songs.  But one should not get carried away comparing Audioslave to Rage Against the Machine.  Both bands have a terrific sound.  Audioslave has composed some great rock songs, and they throw in quite a bit of musical experimentation.  For instance, check out the tension-building guitar work at the beginning of &quot;Cochise&quot; and &quot;Set it Off.&quot;  Or check out Cornell's voice work at the very end of &quot;Show Me How to Live.&quot;  It sounds almost middle eastern(?).  Or perhaps Indian?  In any event, this an exciting album, and it's packed with more than an hour's worth of solid music.
B00006RU5B|5.0|The tracks start with a song that has been out for a while called Cochise. It is a good tune, but in my view is out of place on this CD.<BR>The second track Tell me how to live is as powerful a statement that Chris Cornell has made since Soundgarden. The next song Gasoline has a good a bass line that has ever been recorded. The next few songs continue a strong musical statement. By the time you get to I am the Highway, which is a ballad you know you are onto something with this CD. The remaining six songs are very poweful. The guitar work by Tom M is brilliant an dinventive and Cornell has continued his ascent as a songwriter with lyrics that show a progression that continues where Euphoria Morning left off. A great start for what I hope will be a long term venture.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers will probably play as a curiosity piece for those who've heard a lot about it, but know next to nothing of the miniseries' story or ambitions. Some might just dismiss it as another in a long line of war films, which would be too bad. Band of Brothers is among the best war films I've ever seen, and don't let the made-for-TV label dissuade you. This may be a miniseries, but few films have achieved the epic scale and attention to detail this work creates.<br />The miniseries' focus is on Easy Company, elite paratroopers fresh out of training and ready to make their drop over Normandy pre-D-Day. They're led by Lt. Richard Winters, a young, but intelligent, clear-headed officer who proves effective in the heat of combat. The film concentrates on Easy Company's journeys and battles through war-torn Europe, as well as the men themselves, and the growing effect war inflicts upon each of them.<br />As Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks' second collaboration, Band of Brothers is a monumental achievement that approaches Saving Private Ryan in its ability to place you in the heat of combat. This miniseries isn't quite as successful with character development, mainly because the huge cast makes it hard to tell some people apart, especially when their faces are covered with dirt and grime, a consistent sight you'll get used to here.<br />But the attention to so many details (including the characters) is what makes Band of Brothers a triumph. Most notable is a scene not long after the parachute drop, when one of the members of Easy Company encounters a German prisoner, who's actually from America, but fights on the opposite side because of his ethnic background. There's even a fairly in-depth description and meaning behind a flower that a dead German soldier has pinned to his buttonhole, a historical detail I was never familiar with (see, TV does teach you stuff).<br />Most of the series is concerned with the camraderie among the members of Easy Company. And despite acast of relatively unknown actors, there's not a weak performance throughout. As Richard Winters, Damien Lewis excels, displaying the admirable qualities that made this man so respected and beloved among his men. It's a superb performance, and hopefully it's the beginning of a great career for Lewis. The other standouts in the cast include Neal Mcdonough as an initially gung-ho soldier who undergoes the greatest transformation after he's shot in battle, Donnie Wahlberg as a thoughtful private who's quickly promoted through the ranks, and Matthew Settle as an enigmatic soldier who's so calm in the heat of combat, he almost becomes a living legend.<BR> <BR>Puncuating the moments of character interaction are the battle scenes, which are numerous, graphically violent, and often ferociously intense. Given the miniseries' 10 hour running time, you should prepare yourself for probably more battle action than any war film you've ever seen. The combat presented is harrowingly realistic, often resembling Spielberg's own work in Saving Private Ryan (methinks the fact he served as executive producer here is the main reason for all the similarities). The standout segment is the drop over D-day, sporting the most hair-raising aerial combat I've ever seen. The sight of paratroopers desperately trying to make their jump as flak threatens to down their plane is among the most terrifying sights I've ever seen.<br />The other battle sequences focus on infantry combat.  The miniseries does an excellent job of conveying rigorous gun battles and ubiquitous artillery.  These scenes display a fair amount of clever strategy, particularly when Easy Company tries to disarm several German artillery sites, and do an excellent job of showing the difficulty of fighting in a variety of different settings (small towns such as Carentan, as well as snow-covered forests and villages). <br />The production values are all first-rate. The special effects are mostly outstanding and the miniseries truly has the look and feel of the time period. Without a doubt, every penny of this 125 million dollar budget was well-spent.  Less successful than the production is Michael Kamen's score, which is actually pretty good; there's at least one adrenaline-pumping, rousing theme, but the music threatens to turn into schmaltz during the quieter moments.<br />While dramatically powerful, Band of Brothers is never quite emotionally devastating (unlike Saving Private Ryan, which is what makes BOB slightly inferior to it), with perhaps the exception of Part 9, which focuses on the discovery of a concentration camp. It's eerily disturbing, horrific, and every bit as graphic as what was featured in Schindler's List. Band of Brothers is flawed, but its pros by far outweigh the cons. This is an experience not to be missed.
B000002BYD|5.0|I've been a fan since I first saw Eddie fall from the rafters during their first show at the Off-Ramp and this is by far my favorite album - A must have if your new to Pearl Jam and trying to figure them out...........
B00005QCVY|5.0|TWO wonderfully great holiday feel-good movies were produced in 1947, yet one remains virtually unseen. If you ever get the chance to see, \\"IT HAPPENED ON 5TH AVENUE,\\" make sure you do not miss it. This movie could easily become as popular as, \\"It's A Wonderful Life.\\" The movie was directed by Roy Del Ruth and stars Don DeFore, Ann Harding, Charles Ruggles, Victor Moore, Gale Storm, Alan Hale Jr. and ...I don't know why it has never been put on DVD or VHS, but is surely deserves to be and if I knew how to pressure someone to get the job done, I surely would. If you get a chance, you MUST see it and if you do see it you WILL want to see it every year thereafter or own it on DVD...GUARANTEED!
B00006M183|5.0|I still remember being mesmerized while watching MTV in my fraternity room in San Diego and seeing Eddie falling from the rafters at the Off-Ramp (same guy we would see playing with local bands here until he left to go up North) in the ALIVE video - needless to say I've been hooked ever since.  I always have that excited childlike emotion when I know PJ is releasing a new album.  I've listened to Riot Act at least 15 times now and I am definitely hooked once again.  Can't wait for the tour; can't wait for the new bootlegs; can't wait for the B-Sides album next Spring; can't wait for the next DVD; etc., etc.,....... As far asreviewing Riot Act - I'm not a good enough writer to explain it...In my humble opinion, Pearl Jam is saving Modern Rock `n' Roll.  There is nobody that can touch them in songwriting, talent and live performances.  This album just proves it once again!
B00006SFLV|5.0|This show brings me back to such good times....
B00006J3T4|4.0|emotions are all over the board--mine, his,everyone's.At one minute happy, then melancholy.How can this guy keep this up??He's breaking my heart.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Whoever said that Rock will just keep getting duller and duller is wrong. Audioslave improves upon many areas of the bands former bands. I think this CD is a lot better then any of SoundGarden's or Rage Against The Machine's music. There music is a unique blend of grunge, mellow rock and great guitar riffs. Overall this CD is a must buy.
B00005JKCH|5.0|finally a decent superhero movie came out spiderman is a new breed of entertainment its really fun to watch its all aboat a young high school student who gos to a feild trip and acidently gets bitten by a spider he feels sick at first but then he discovers that he can do all sorts of things crawl up walls webswing and so on from there his story unfolds but it is truely a good movie the only thing i hate about it is that the cgi spiderman is shown the same time in two scenes if u watch the scene where spiderman is rescueing the baby and then the scene where spiderman is chasing uncle bens killer then u will notice anyways this movie is great
B00006RU5B|4.0|Tom Morello's chunky riffs, definitely not as threatening as Thayil's efforts from Superunknown, but with more edge &amp; funk infused. Chris Cornell's impassioned, scornful screaming, easing to laconic in reflective passages. <br />A partnership made in music heaven, surely. <br />Cornell returns to the punk-edged howling of 'Outshined' in the opener 'Cochise', followed by the stretched tight riff of 'Show Me How To Live'. A theme of fire runs throughout the album, in the lyrics, the cover art, and the blazing musicianship of Morello, Wilk and Commerford. These guys definitely have a creative spark. 'Gasoline' fuels the flame, Commerford's bass growling underneath Morello's masterful, signature delay fx. <br />From the fury of the opening 3, the album never fails, turning up great songs as well as grooves to chill to after a big night out. <br />Cornell is fresh, not rehashed, and though I've not heard much of Rage's catalogue, this definitely sounds new and inspired by a musical marriage that would have made many happy had they stayed together. <br />This album's a stayer. The music moves.<BR>Get it. You won't regret it.
B00006M183|5.0|Pearl Jam chose to forgo its usual high-energy opening-track rocker on \\"Riot Act. Instead, the band led off the album with the inspiring \\"Can't Keep,\\" an organic, low-key tune about pushing boundaries. \\"Save You\\" follows with a rip-roaring vengeance, and certainly qualifies as the aforementioned high-energy rock tune. Overall, \\"Riot Act\\" does not fit a mold or a constant sound; the songs are fairly diverse, which makes for an interesting album. What's more, the tunes on \\"Riot Act\\" are great and, as usual, heartfelt. The towering, somewhat sugary \\"Love Boat Captain\\" is not my cup of tea for a Pearl Jam song, but that's OK; many great tunes follow. The jangly and tuneful \\"Cropduster\\" reminds me of early R.E.M, as does \\"Green Disease\\"; \\"Ghost\\" and \\"Get Right\\" are straightforward, guitar-driven anthems that PJ fans will find impossible not to enjoy; the dark but bold and catchy \\"I Am Mine\\" is Eddie Vedder at his songwriting best; \\"Thumbing My Way\\" is a quiet, introspective acoustic gem that Pearl Jam often seems to make room for on its albums.<br /><br />Drummer Matt Cameron might have stolen the show with his groovin' mid-tempo rocker, \\"You Are,\\" which mixes funky guitars, smooth drums and a sense of mysteriousness and psychedelia to great effect. The lyrics are cool, too. Speaking of abstract psychedelia, \\"Help Help\\" by Jeff Ament, one of the more unique PJ tunes ever written, has it in spades.<br /><br />\\"Riot Act\\" winds down with four excellent, very different songs. \\"Bushleaguer\\" is Vedder's rant against President Bush. The lyrics within the song, though harsh and not exactly flowing, come off as poetic (\\"With onionskin plausibility of life/And a keyboard reaffirmation.) The subtle sound of the song, similar to Ament's \\"Help Help,\\" belies Vedder's fed-up lyrics. \\"1/2 Full\\" is blues-based and raw, with searing guitar work and lyrics that bleed emotion. The short and hymnallike \\"Arc\\" displays Vedder's formidable voice in all its baritone glory, and is the perfect intro to the stark \\"All or None,\\" which begins soft and ends with a blazing guitar solo. Once again, Vedder does not sound happy on the song.<br /><br />The greatness of \\"Riot Act\\" (and of Pearl Jam) is its songwriting diversity -- everyone contributes music and lyrics. Pick this one up if you want to hear this great band firing on all creative cylinders.\\"All or None,\\" which begins soft and ends with a blazing guitar solo.

B00006LSM3|5.0|I was drawn to this album through a review that I heard on NPR, and was thrilled on the basis of that review. Don't expect a maudelin, half hearted work by an artist enfeabled by disease, and bitter.  Rather this is a compendium of joy, with songs written by a man who is content, has nothing to prove, knows that his time on this plane has run out, and faces the future with peace, and contentment, and confidence. With a strong confident voice, it runs the gammut from \\"Any Road\\", (Think Traveling Wilburys), to a final mesmerizing Eastern chant as the final cut, \\"Brainwashed\\" comes to a gentle close. Georges slide work is impeccable, emotional and as pure as a clear stream. As a musician, I am both in awe and inspired.  The album was completed by Georges son Dhani, and his friend, Jeff Lynne, and follows Georges request that it not be \\"posh\\" It isn't....it is pure.  Dhani plays guitar with his dad, with beautiful harmonic result.  This is a CD, that I will draw joy and inspiration from, and when I have finally worn the CD out, I'll purchase another copy. Impressed? That is truly an understatement.  This deserves a \\"Best Album\\" Grammy.  Thank you George, for leaving us this gift.
B000002OX7|5.0|I mistakenly thought that \\"Who's Next\\" was a greatest hits album when I first played it on my turntable in the fall of 1974-it set me back a whopping five dollars and twenty-five cents back then. And the reason for my mistaken belief was that EVERY song on the album was simply FANTASTIC. And when I told a school friend of my listening experience, he informed me that it was a 1971 studio release of original songs, and I was simply STUNNED. \\"Baba O'Reilly\\", \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\", \\"Song Is Over\\", et al, are just beautiful, imaginative and intelligent songs that, for me, brilliantly superceded the many radio airwave-worn songs of Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Bad Company and other overrated bands at the time. \\"Who's Next\\" profoundly won me over and proved to me that The Who were a superior, gifted and infinitely talented quartet who in numerous ways, easily equalled that other rock quartet known as The Beatles in terms of songwriting-thank you, Pete Townshend-and easily surpassed The Fab Four in terms of sheer musicianship. And as for today's acts-Pearl Jam, Sound Garden, Oasis-fuggedaboutit! They don't even come close, and never will. \\"Who's Next\\"-buy it, own it, immerse yourself in it, scream about it! Cherish it.
0743216458|5.0|What Stephen Ambrose does so well in his historical accounts, is bring a story to life. There is no point in his stories where the reader feels like he/she is just glazing over historical facts. Ambrose presents history in the way it should be presented. The reader feels like he/she is along with the soldiers in Normandy, Bastogne, Germany and everywhere in between, but Ambrose also gives historical background so the reader perfectly understands the war and all its happenings. One of the ways Ambrose brings the story to life is that he tells through sources and soldier accounts, what was actually going through the soldiers head when he was staring down the barrel of a german luger or heaving a grenade. The story begins with training and ends with the looting of Hitler's Eagles Nest but then Ambrose goes one step further. At the very end of the book, he takes a few pages to recount what has happened to the soldiers of the 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne in the past half century. Even if you are not a World War II buff, this is a great book to enjoy.
B000005KQT|5.0|This is it! THE collection of Little Walter's tunes that has entered the very soul of harmonica blues. You will listen to this album again and again, from start to finish. Personally, I am a big fan of all the great bluesharp masters; i.e. Junior Wells, James Cotton, both Sonny Boys, etc., but this album is my favorite. Also the quality of the recordings are great for its time. You will not be disappointed. If you like harmonica blues, get this album!
B00005JLD2|4.0|'Rabbit-proof Fence' tells the story of three Aborigine girls who were taken from their home and were transferred to a special school, where they could learn the manners of white people. That was part of a bigger Australian Government plan to 'assimilate' half-caste children into the white community, a plan monitored and executed by the Chief \\"Protector\\" of Aborigines. Soon the three girls would commence on a long journey back to their home.<br />This is a story that given to the wrong hands, could easily have turned into a Hollywood melodrama. Still, Phillip Noyce, mostly known for his action flicks, like 'Patriot Games' or 'The Bone Collector', keeps his direction simple and true. He cares for his characters and uses his visual skills in the right direction.<br />He has the help of a nicely assembled cast, that in its majority consists of amateur actors. The three girls, playing the lead parts, and especially Everlyn Sampi as Molly, are impressive. The only big star of the movie is Kenneth Branagh. He succeeds in making us believe that the Chief \\"Protector\\" of Aborigines truly believes in his task. He feels responsible for those kids, and genuinely thinks that driving them away from their homes is for their own good. David Gulpilill as the aboriginal tracker sent to find the girls, does not have to utter many phrases, but gives a solid performance, mostly based on his facial expressions.<br />The cinematography is gripping, thanks to the breathtaking Australian landscape. The music, written by Peter Gabriel, is right to the point. Still at a few points I would prefer it, if the volume was just a notch lower.<br />My only objection to the movie is its duration. I know and feel that the girls were like birds in a cage, while at the boarding school. Still, I was not totally convinced, by the scenes of their stay there, that they would decide to escape so abruptly. I know and feel that the road back to their home is a tough one, full of obstacles and challenges. Still, I sensed that something was missing in the way that it was depicted, something that would probably enhance the drama, and absorb the viewer to a greater extend.<br />Concluding, 'Rabbit-proof fence' is a movie that you should see. It tells beautifully a heartbreaking story, while never going over the top with sentimentality. In any case, don't forget to bring your hankies with. They might be useful.
B00006LSM3|5.0|Many of these songs are fit to be on All Things Must Pass.  Some of my favorites are \\"Stuck Inside A Cloud,\\" \\"Marwa Blues,\\" \\"Looking for My Life,\\" and the great cover \\"Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea.\\"  It seems fitting that after a long hiatus, George would pass away while finally making music again.  This is proof to me that he was put here to make music.
B00006LSM3|4.0|It's hard to look at this album objectivly, especially given the circumstances under which we're getting it. Fortunately Brianwashed is a very good album, and something of which George would be proud of.<BR>Some of the songs on here can rank among George's best work, the standouts being \\"Rising Sun\\", \\"Stuck Inside A Cloud\\", the cover of \\"The Devil and the Deep Blue Sea\\", and the title track. I know George would hate to hear it, but the album is very Beatlesque in places, there's also a strong Dylan influence on several tracks. <BR>My only real grip with the album is that they should have kept the original title Portrait of a Leg-End, that's only a small grip though, and it has to be said that this is a fitting tribute to a musical giant. Cheers George!
B00005JKCH|3.0|I liked this movie.  I used to read Spiderman all the time in the paper.  It tried to touch on too much all at once.  It should have developed the characters more, since it is obviously set up for a sequel.
B000069HK2|5.0|It's practically against my religion to compare two emerging bands, however I have to say that they have a similar sound to the band Thursday, as well as other bands. The vocal change from the alternative singing to the metal yell is apparent in both Cd's and therefore elicits some comparisons...The Used however is a very melodic (forgive me for using this horid term) screamo band which in my opinion gives them the upper hand.<BR>The lead singers got your customary rock voice (although I must give him performing credit as well as mention his awesome joker smile) and there are the customary heart ache and outsider rock lyrics...this album is your customary rock album,however well done. There's nothing wrong with kind of sounding like other bands. There are so many bands coming out nowadays, I believe it's impossible for anyone to have a new sound. So to be a good band...you just gotta be a good customary rock band...and they are. A cars a car and they all look similar...but that doesn't make them all bad does it... <BR>I must say to their credit that I have yet to grow tired of \\"The Taste of Ink\\" despite having heard it hundreds of times. It's still a great catchy radio rock song...and I love it and I love this cd,I can listen to the entire thing without skipping a song which says alot... I say buy it while it's still at the emerging bands price.
B00006C79E|4.0|Saint Etienne is a very underrated band in the mainstream.  However, I agree with an earlier customer review.  I thought that \\"The Sound of Water\\" was setting the tone for what I where I was expecting Saint Etienne to go in the future.  This is a little bit of a letdown after that excellent 2000 entry but it has some enjoyable moments.  It also has a few ho-hum moments.  In some respects, it harks back to their pre-\\"Continental\\" material.  Fans of the earliest Saint Etienne will probably be very satisfied.  The spoken drop-ins are back on this one.  They haven't used those for a while. It hops on songs like \\"Action\\" and \\"Shower Scene.\\"  \\"The Way We Live Now\\" is mostly instrumental until it climaxes with Sarah's irrepresibly breathy vocals. The title track is also pleasant. I suspect fans will still come out in droves and buy this one.
B000002JSP|4.0|You gotta watch the quiet ones, John Paul Jones had the strings, synths and organs going on with this disc. When I hear it, it takes me back to 16, when I first listened to this disc. My only complaint about the production would be that Roberts vocals are so into the mix that alot of the time, you cannot understand what he is saying....but want to. &quot;In the Evening&quot; is the opening track with the music that Jimmy was working on for Kenneth Anger's movie that never got further than what you hear in the first minute, and sets the tone to be mysterious and unclear at first listen. &quot;Carouselambra&quot; is a very cool tune that sounds and feels like a story of conquest and victory.<br />&quot;Fool in the Rain&quot; didnt make it to my favorites list and &quot;Hot Dog&quot; was a poke of fun at country, nothing more. All in all, I would have to say that &quot;All of my Love&quot; and &quot;I'm Gonna Crawl&quot; have the most depth of feeling in the presentation and intention for the listener. This is a good disc and does have its place for any music collection. Enjoy.
B000002J1B|5.0|The Gates Of Delirium, around the 17 min mark. Jon Anderson starts singning &quot;Soon, oh soon the light&quot;... I've had this album for more than 20 years now and this very passage still sends shivers down my spine each time I listen to it. I envy those who will buy this CD and hear this song for the first time. This is the reason why I love music. Buy this album. If you don't like it, listen to it until you do. If you still don't like it, you're hopeless :-)
B000002JSN|5.0|Led Zeppelin rock! This album was recorded at Headley Grange and was, for lack of a better term.....a working album and almost every track was recorded from the speed of thought. Physical Graffiti is one of my favorite albums. If you are the kind of person that doesnt mind hearing a great disc over and over again without getting tired of hearing it, this is for you. You get everything and the kitchen sink with this disc, acoustic imagery in &quot;Bron-Yr-Aur&quot;, hard driven blues in &quot;The Rover&quot;, emotional stirring with &quot;Ten Years Gone&quot;, Indie/Blues/vocal orchestra in &quot;Kashmir&quot;, and music that just makes you feel like getting up and dancing around the house like &quot;Boogie with Stu&quot;, &quot;Black Country Woman&quot; and &quot;Down by the seaside&quot;. There are so many different influences with this group that just made the music work....whouda thought? I wish I did that well in chemistry. This is two of the desert island discs IMHO. Try it....
B00006LSM3|5.0|This is by far the best album to ever come from George Harrison, which is entirely fitting for his last album. The content is brilliant and the intimacy with which it speaks is beyond description. Thank you George for all you gave to us!
B00004XMS0|4.0|I've been a big fan of the Warner Bros. Batman series since I was a little kid, seeing the original in theaters. I felt compelled to buy this box-set because of all of the memories and nostalgia, and the fact that 3 out of the 4 movies are excellent and I wanted to be able to watch them in all of their glory on their best format: DVD. Now, as far as special features go, look elsewhere. Most box-sets usually include a bonus disc with extra stuff on it, but that is not found here. The most you will get for extras on the individual DVD's is production notes and cast & crew bio's. But still, if you are a fan of the movies, you should own this set because all 4 of them look (and sound) absolutely stellar on DVD. It's a nice upgrade from those jurassic era tapes I used to have (I still have the original Batman tape, the one distributed in 1989, Talk about lousy quality!). Each disc comes with both standard and widescreen format, which is a plus. As far as the movies themselves go? Well, we all know what a waste Batman & Robin was. It pretty much killed the series and really, it has no redeeming features, even though it is nice eye candy on DVD. Batman Returns is my personal favorite, it is extremely dark and twisted and all of the actors (Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito, Michelle Pfeiffer, Christopher Walken) are excellent for their roles. The whole story revolves around tragedy. A lot of people don't like this movie because it is too grimy and gritty, and really, it's not for everyone. For me, it just works. Batman Forever was when Tim Burton stepped out of the director's chair and Joel Schumacher (8mm, Bad Company) took his place. I actually like this film. It's a nice combination between Burton's signature darkness and Schumacher's comic-book-like flair and style. Batman is the original, and although it has it's flaws, it still stands as one of the best super-hero movies ever made. Overall, I would have to say I am pleased with this box-set, aside from the throw-away Batman & Robin and the lack of special features, it satisfies.an & Robin and the lack of special features, it satisfies.
B0000542D2|4.0|Just received the DVD and....Wow!<BR>The interviews are really inspiring---you really get the idea of what was going on. Just wish that they put in more interviews with Sir George Martin who's my ultimate hero.<BR>For gearheads, the advantage of DVDs giving ice-clear freeze-frames for you to examine is a big plus.<br />And the movie itself......Wow again!(No wonder they call it the &quot;Citizen Cane&quot; of R'N'R movies even if there are stupid and primitive moments in today's standards.)
B000002AZ8|5.0|With the release of Vitalogy, Pearl Jam takes on a new direction toward obscurity.  After the two extremely popular, rock anthem, grunge records, \\"Ten\\" and \\"Vs.,\\"  Eddie Vedder and company have made a rather impressive attempt at growing beyond the grunge roots that made them what they are today.  This record is amazing, and main-stream enough.  But, you can feel the winds of change coming in the new material. <br />There are some extremely strong songs on Vitalogy.  The first single off the record, called \\"Spin the Black Circle\\" was rather punk-rock, very different than most Pearl Jam.  The B-Side was the better of the two tracks on the single. \\"Tremor Christ\\" ended up being the bigger radio song in the long run, as the single did not do all that well.  It was strange to see what they released as singles from the record.  Next was \\"Not For You,\\" a rock anthem, very Pearl Jam.  It's B-Side is a non-album, improv track called \\"Outta My Mind.\\" The final single released was a great song called \\"Immortality,\\" Its B-Side, a cover of \\"Rearview Mirror\\" from \\"Vs.,\\" by a band called \\"The Frogs.\\" <br />The strange thing about the record is the songs that weren't released as singles.  \\"Betterman,\\" \\"Corduroy,\\" and maybe even \\"Nothingman\\" were great songs that found their way the radio even without the backing of Epic Records.  They are some of the strongest songs on the LP, they could have easily done better than they did with a little marketing.  <br />Though, it does seem, that Pearl Jam does some of this to themselves.  A band, troubled for some time, with internal shake-ups, squabbles, and an ongoing battle with Ticketmaster, seemed to be allergic to the limelight.  This record came out in the middle of the aforementioned strife in the band's history.  But, even though all of this was going on in the life of the band, they managed to create a rather high quality piece of the work.  <br />This record is a pivot point in the band's history.  It is a must-have for any Pearl Jam fan, and a great record for anyone who likes grunge era music.  Pearl Jam is one of a mere few bands who still remain and are active beyond the days of grunge. Their brilliant evolution is the only reason they have survived into the twenty-first century.  This album is the beginning of said evolution.<br />epc
B000063V8T|5.0|Spock returns in &quot;Unification Pt.2&quot;...an episode dedicated to the memory of Gene Roddenberry. Other quality episodes include, Time's Arrow Pt.1, Cause &amp; Effect, The Inner Light, &amp; The First Duty...which is now a required training video for our armed forces!
B00006CXXU|5.0|To the morons who diss this album you obviously do not appreciate the complexity or diversity of music.  I cannot believe that anybody would trash this CD & those who do, well, screw yas.  Oh, & stop the Britney comparison.  There is no comparison. Not to diss Britney, because I do like her & buy her albums; however, Christina's music contains so much more emotional maturity/depth & substance along with her soaring Angelic voice.  This album consists of intense emotional & inspirational lyrics, musical charm, & captivates you with it's magnetic ability to appeal to the hearts & passions of her fans.  It's a life story that we can all relate to in one way or the other.  Also, I can't believe that people are so uptight about her new found sexuality. Wake up, have you seen TV - look at every other female celebrity it's all over the place.  Oh, & look at all the male artists. Most of the time all you see are butt cheeks & boobs/cleavage hanging out everywhere & nothing is ever said.  She's not 16 anymore.  Loosen up people.<BR>I am 32 years old and absolutely in complete and astonished amazement over this album.  It leaves you breathless with overflowing emotions.  I felt myself starting to cry during \\"I'm Ok\\".  Christina has truly done it this time - she is the epitome and true essence of a musical artist.  Anybody & everybody of all ages, musical interests will find their own personal niche in each song & fall in love with this CD.  It's comprised of rock, pop, blues, r&b, a lot of soul, & her voice \\"soars\\" to the Heavens.  Every track on this album is spectacular & unique comprised of intense emotion that reflects Christina's new womanhood and maturity.  Nonetheless, although this CD is lengthy with 20 tracks it maintains its momentum throughout it's entirety, very unlike many R&B albums which tend to become boring with the same repetitive rhythms just to fill up space.  This is definitely AMA & GRAMMY material.  This is one of the best albums I have ever heard & well worth the long wait. & thumbs up to her involvement in writing & producing it.  Christina is in a class of her own & should by far never be compared to her other pop counterparts.  Oh, & to reiterate - so what if people are offended by her stripping down - she looks beautiful - your only young once - & with her talent, who cares.  One last thought, the somewhat sexually energized single DIRRTY is by no means a reflection of the album.  If I were Christina I would have chosen from any of the other tracks as the first single.  If your 5 or 95 years old, GO BUY THIS CD - IT'S, AN EMOTIONAL RIDE & A WONDERFUL MUSICAL MASTERPIECE.
B00005JKCH|4.0|Tobey McGuire plays Peter Parker...a teenager bitten by a genetically altered spider and becomes Spiderman. Great SFX, AWESOME soundtrack, good plot...could've done without the unrequited love scenes. William DeFoe plays the Green Goblin who discovers Peter's secret and tries to destroy him &amp; the ones he loves.
B00000I8NC|5.0|This work is unlike anything you have ever heard. Don't expect crashing metal or purely instrumental classical or straight rock, this music is alternative in the true sense of the word.<br />First of all, it is just two tracks, Moya and Bbf3 (strange already?) each of which is above 10 minutes in length. Each track has movements, repeating themes, slow sections, energetic sections, all tied together with an absolutely amazing progression. I don't know how they do it, but each track seems to flow so smoothly from one part to the next that it totally takes you in. Depending on your current tastes in music, you might consider this progression glacially slow for a rock song, or too speedy for a classical piece, but remember that it is neither. I personally feel that the progression is perfect, neither too slow nor too fast, lingering on each theme for exactly enough time to get explore it properly and develop it, then having a smooth, beautiful transition to the next.<br />OK, enough of this technical stuff, how does this music make you feel? There is definitely an emotional quality to the music. Calling this music depressing would be like saying the Golden Gate Bridge is orange. I mean, yes, there is definitely an element of depression, sadness, and loneliness, but to say that is all is missing an entire aspect of it. There is also some glimmer of hope, and incredible tension and excitement at some points. &quot;Inspiring&quot; also comes to mind, though not in a typical way. The lyrics (if they can be called that) in the second track are an interview with a man who I think you will agree is very...weird. But the way the music is arranged it seems like it is responding to what he is saying in a most peculiar way...even though at first listen it may seem like there is no connection.<br />If you can't handle anything with tracks longer than 3 minutes, this is not for you, but definitely try this CD if you want to hear something completely different, inspiring, musicallybeautiful, and thought-provoking.
B00000K19E|5.0|The Matrix is a definite eye popper because the action sequences and visual effects are seamingly unmatched by any other movie (aside from the Star Wars series). The Matrix also asks the questions, &quot;what if you woke up one day, and your life as you knew it was never truly a real life?&quot; I really don't like to give too much away when telling people about the Matrix because I've found out that when you tell them about the story, they always come back with, &quot;that's O.k. I've seen Dark City before&quot;.<br />Don't get me twisted, Dark City is very good, but the Matrix is really different from it. This one won't disappoint you at all. The Matrix is definitely worth buying and adding to your collection because it's a great Sci Fi movie, Action Movie (lots of fight scenes and martial arts) and the story keeps you very intrigued. Cool movie 5 stars, check it out!
B0000646UN|3.0|I bought this DVD after stumbling across the glowing reviews of the movie. I'm not Finnish but my wife is of Finnish descent so I thought it would make a nice addition to our DVD collection.<br />The DVD itself is pretty much barren of any extras. There are no trailers, no commentary, no different sound tracks...no anything but the movie itself and scene selections. The disc is only in Stereo, so if you're looking for Dolby Digital 5.1, you're out of luck with this release. Additionally, the film transfer is fairly grainy. Considering the movie only 13 years old, they could've done a better job.<br />On to to the movie itself - It's a classic example of a David and Goliath story. A handful of Finnish soldiers defend their country against a horde of tens of thousands (maybe hundreds of thousands - they never really say) of Russian troops.<br />The disappointing thing about this movie is that the tacticts of how the Finnish defended against such incredible odds are never really shown. It was a simply a matter of holding position as long as possible against the advancing Russian soldiers. I would like to have seen more of what strategy was involved in holding off the Russians. Matter of fact, if I didn't know it was a true story I would have a hard time believing it.  One thing to note, as others have noted - Talvisota is not for the squeamish. The depiction of what can happen to a human body during a war is, I would guess, fairly realistic and might even be a little disturbing to those with a weak stomach.<br />All-in-all, I give the movie 3 out of 5. It was good...but it wasn't great.
B00003CWN3|5.0|Boys Don't Cry is based on the true story of Teena Brandon (or Brandon Teena). It's about a young girl who is gay in the south and she meets a girl and they fall in love, even after she funds out that Brandon is a girl. It's a very touching story, a very compelling film and a great movie in general.<br />But here's the hard part...<br />The final 15 minutes of this movie are EXTREMELY difficult to watch (because of a rape scene). I first thought that this was a great drama (unfortunately for me being ignorant to the story)  and I figured that it was just going to be a good movie and really nothing else. For me, I personally couldn't get the last 15 minutes of this movie out of my mind for weeks. Trust me, I was that disturbed about it.<br />But I don't want anyone to pass up this movie because it is a great movie and Hillary Swank showed why she won her Best Actress with this one. That and this movie is a lesson to anyoone to be tolerant. Seriously, anyone should appreciate this movie and everyone should also see this because it will teach you to be more tolerant in life and to appreciate the life that you have.
B00006LSM3|5.0|A strong set of new music from a still talented (to the end) legend of rock music.  If you have enjoyed any of George's music in the past, you will like this even more.<BR>Thank you George for making the past 38 years of my life so much more than it might have been.
B000002KMY|5.0|I remember first hearing the title track on the \\"Heavy Metal\\" soundtrack as a youngster and being blown away.  What a riff and what a voice!... I was hooked from that point on and have loved pretty much anything Ronnie James Dio has done since then.  Though the CD is only 40 minutes long (as most were back then), every cut is a gem! (I would much rather hear 40 minutes of excellence than 70 minutes of mostly filler).  Things get off to a blazing start with \\"Turn Up the Night,\\"  a song that gets your blood pumping in the morning.  If this song doesn't get you going, you should really stop listening to music, cuz you just don't get it.  Great use here of sludgy Sabbath (\\"Over and Over\\" and the awe-inspring \\"Sign of the Southern Cross\\"), medium tempo groove (\\"Country Girl,\\" \\"Slipping Away,\\" \\"Voodoo\\") and the aforementioned fast paced songs.  You'd be hard pressed to find a hard rock CD with this much quality, so do yourself a favor and stop listening to fools!...
B00005AQE8|5.0|It is generally considered that 2Pac made three classic albums during his short but extremely productive career: Me Against The World, All Eyez On Me, and Makaveli. <br />All Eyez On Me is the second of this great trio of albums, and it stands as one of the greatest landmarks in hip hop history. This is one of the most complete rap albums ive ever heard. It displays all sides of Pac, as poet, a revolutionary, a thug, and an MC. He flipped commercial tracks like How Do U Want, California Love, All About, and Thug Passion, and indeed this is his most commercial album. But dont let the singles fool you. There is plenty of raw material here as well. You get some of Pac's grittiest songs, such as Ambitionz As A Ridah, No More Pain, Cant C Me, When We Ride, and 2 Of Amerikaz Most Wanted. There is a display of poignancy as well though [what would a Pac album be without the deep songs?], with Life Goes On, I Aint Mad At Cha, Heartz Of Men, and one of his best penned songs ever, Only God Can Judge Me. What more can you ask for?? However, its not just the great songs that Pac has on here, but the production is super-solid, some of the finest west coast production ever.....right up there with Doggystyle. And Pac's charisma is in top form on this album. <br />This is sort of a concept album of Pac's views and observations of the people around him, whether it be friends, enemies, women, or the police. It doesnt have quite the emotion or autobiographical form of Me Against The World, or the passion of Makaveli [his best ever IMO], but this remains a testament to how complete of an MC he was, and it remains a standard by which all other commercial/street albums are judged by. It is also the biggest selling rap album ever, having sold over an incredible 10 million copies to date, and it still sells alot today.<br /> It does have some filler [there are two or three songs I could do without], but not much, and this still remains the best hip hop double cd ever. This is a great albumto listen to, no matter what kind of mood you are in. If you want party songs, they are here in abundance. If you want deep songs or raw songs, they are here as well. I recommend All Eyez On Me to any true fan of hip hop, whether you're a veteran who has never picked this album up before [though this is quite unlikely] or a newbie. Classic album.
B00006J3WH|5.0|It's a must for any and every serious Buffy fanatic and highly recommended since I love to hear Buffy sing every day!:)
B00006RAKP|5.0|Many songs from this greatest hits album are great and are some of his best work. But still many of his top 40 singles are missing from this brilliant compilation. Those singles are:<br />Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds, Pinball Wizard, I Feel Like A Bullet ( In The Gun Of Robert Ford ), Grow Some Funk Of Your Own, Part Time Love, Mama Can't Buy You Love, Song For Guy,<br />Sartorial Eloquence, Nobody Wins, Chloe, Blue Eyes, Empty Garden,  Kiss The Bride, In Neon, Who Wears These Shoes, Wrap Her<br />Up, A Word In Spanish, Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters Part Two,<br />Healing Hands, Club At The End Of The Street, The Last Song, Simple Life, and Candle In The Wind 1997. Still even with exclusion of these classics, the album shines.<br />Songs like Your Song, Levon, Bennie And The Jets and Honky Cat have left great impressions on our lives. And who can<br />possibly deny that Nikita is one of the best synth-pop ballads of<br />the 1980s'. And who can't say that the finger-snapping I Don't Wanna Go On With You Like That is a great dance song. Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting has some of the best guitar licks ever put out on record. Island Girl is a great reggae/funk mixture that just wants to make you boogie. Someone Saved My Life Tonight is a stinging damnation of the hardships endured in a marriage. I'm Still standing is the definitive anthem to all the people who came out strong after battling all the demons of life. Don't Go Breaking My Heart with Kiki Dee is most definitely the best duet ever. I Want Love is a song that proves that love is hard to gain but easy to lose. This Train Don't Stop There Anymore is a denouncement of the pressures of a successful career. This album's candle shines.
B0000457HB|5.0|This is a wonderful collection of Barry's work. From the early days of \\"I'm gonna love you just a little more babe\\" right through to the recent release \\"Staying Power\\". It really is a magical journey of the music by one of the world's finest performers.<BR>The icing on the cake are the tracks included by the magnificent Love Unlimited Orchesta,many of which include Barry's amazing growled introductions ( check out \\"Baby Blues\\" ).We should also pay tribute to Barry's co-arranger the late Mr Gene Page who helped create that lush Barry White sound. YOU MUST HAVE THIS!
B00006RU5B|5.0|The voice of Soundgarden and the Strings of Rage against the machine.. 2 talents great together, too bad they broke up before the album came out. Album is full of Morello's riffs and Chris cornells great voice. A must have for any Rage or Soundgarden fan...
B00001OH7T|4.0|\\"Disco Sucks\\" was my attitude when Young Americans was released; and it still is.  But I could not help liking Bowie's take on the Philadelphia sound.  All these years later, it still sounds good.  Glam rock, it ain't.  Neither is it experimental electronica.  As Bowie's take on soul/disco, Young Americans deserves more respect than reviewers usually afford it.
B00005JKDR|5.0|If you think you're going to buy this for your kids, think again. This is a movie that will hook a viewer in seconds. It has the most important ingredient of any film, a great script. <BR>   Critics seemed to think that Monsters, Inc. was more kid oriented than Pixar's previous efforts ( Toy Story; Toy Story 2; A Bug's Life), but try getting up and walking away when it's on. You have to own the DVD so you can pause when you need to.<BR>   Pixar has a phenomenal record in the movie business so far: It's batting 1,000.
B000066NW0|5.0|Great job for a first CD.  Very catchy tunes, and she's only 17!
B00006LSM3|4.0|First of all...the song list on this album is incorrect...one of the best cuts on the album isn't listed here...Pisces Fish...but George has been getting the short end of the stick for years.<BR>Great album by a great human being...Thank You George !
0385484518|5.0|I thought that Tuesdays with Morrie was a beautiful book. I would recommend this book to people who enjoy a sweet, happy feel good book, or to someone who has lost someone in their life or is in the process of losing a loved one.
B00005JKL8|4.0|Other reviewers are too critical of this movie and Owen Wilson. Of course he's not a world renowned actor. Who were you expecting, Tom Hanks? Wilson was a writer and filmmaker first, which is probably the only way he got in the spotlight. But can you honestly deny that the guy is hilarious? Everything I've seen him in is a riot. He just plays himself in every role he's done. In interviews he's the first to admit that he doesn't have much acting talent. I mean the guy was a English major in college. For him becoming a high-paid actor was probably never on the forecast back in the minimum-wage earning days. However, he does have a charismatic presence on screen, which is probably why he's not broke like many actors. Now Behind Enemy Lines probably isn't worth buying, especially if you have high standards for your collection. But, like most Hollywood cinema these days, it is entertaining and so it is worth renting or catching on TNT in 3 or 4 years. A good movie, not a great film.
0151008116|5.0|Beautifully written. A real testatment to the human spirit and certainly the best book I've read in a long time.
0316666343|4.0|It WAS a quick read . . .because the characters were well drawn, three dimensional, and engaging.  You know a book is good when you get mad at characters for making stupid choices, worried that a character will get hurt, and hope that the characters will be able to work things out in the end.  I disagree justice was not served -- it was, just not in the Hollywood sense. Interesting and thoughtful perspective on the grief process told from a different point of view.
B00003CWL6|5.0|...about the greatness of this film?<BR>It's an incredible movie, one of the most incisive and insightful of our time.  Decades from now, we'll remember this as one of the finest films of its time, a defining feature of the turn of the millenium period in America.<BR>Only problem: seems odd that this is described as a &quot;dark comedy,&quot; though it has humor, the humor is overshadowed by the &quot;dark.&quot;
B00003CWTI|4.0|MAGNOLIA is not a film for everyone. In fact, anyone who disapproves of foul language, long films, or frogs should not even consider this film. However, if you can look past these things, you'll find a deep, and great film. For a walk in a rocky garden of sin, buy MAGNOLIA today.<br />MAGNOLIA is the story of nine people in the Valley. Each is having a bad day, and yet, they are all somehow linked. We have characters ranging from likeable Jim Kurring (John C. Reilly)to the vulgar and hateful Frank Mackie (Tom Cruise). The characters are each memorable. The film also has standout performances by Philip Baker Hall, Jason Robards, and Melora Walters. Through various plots we become familiar with the characters, and if we can make it through three hours, we see how they are linked.<br />The soundtrack by Aimee Mann is wonderful. However, like any film, this one has flaws. The language is excessive as is typical of P.T. Anderson films, parts do not make sense, and certain scenes are underacted. Anyone familiar with Anderson's films will see familiar faces and themes. For anyone not familiar with Anderson, the film will be different to say the least. My suggestion is that you rent the film first. If you like it, then buy it. Also, look for symbolism and hidden themes. And above all, enjoy this flowery film.
B00006LJ72|1.0|Enya is by far the worst musician ever.I think the last thing we need is an Enya box set.All of the \\"music\\" on this box set is horrible and will have you reaching for that stop button on your CD player in no time.if you enjoy good music,then stay away from this CD at all costs.But if you like terrible music,then the Enya box set is destined for your CD case.
0553801481|5.0|Those of you who have yet to read much of Robin Hobb's work are in for not merely a treat, but a veritable banquet.  With her usual eloquence and imagination she breathes riotus, abundant life into the world of the Farseer dynasty . <BR>     Her novel opens with Fitzhugh Chivalry holed up on the edges of a civilization that teeters on the edge of anarchy.  Fitz has been ill-used and has spent the last 15 years recovering from his trials and wounds and attempting to find meaning in a life beset with much pain and heartbreak.  He is forced by old loyalties to aide his few, remaining friends in recovering the Farseer heir from the jaws of a magical plot.<BR>     As is usual for most of her books, this is not a novel to race through from one exciting battle to another.  A reader will want to sip, sniff and savor the depth of feeling and description that Robin Hobb so ably imparts to her works.  There is action aplenty, but I know of no other author able to develop characters, plot and bring a sense of wordly coherence that write in this genre.  She is, in my view, the best current writer of fantasy and this book goes far in cementing her in that position. Hurrah!
0140437711|4.0|I like most of the stories in this book (a merger of 2 separate anthologies) but some are quite bad. Still tho, I like Holmes and he gets plenty of room here to show off his skills.<br /><br />These stories are presented in chronological order of their publication in 'Strand' magazine and follow immediately after 'A Study in Scarlet' and 'The Sign of Four'. Tho their timelines bounce around all over the place and it's hard to keep track.<br /><br />My fave stories would be 'The Speckled Band' or 'The Engineer's Thumb'. Both of which are from 'Adventures'. The only story I really enjoyed from 'Memoirs' is 'The Silver Blaze'. Many of them seem to be rehashes of his older plots.<br /><br />Tho highly regarded in the literary community I find Conan-Doyle's writing style to be confusing and inappropriate. As most of you know the stories are told from the point of view of Watson, Holmes' sidekick. But his narration of the events takes a backseat to very, very lengthy dialogues (which are mostly overwritten monologues). The narrative shifts back and forth and all over the place. It's not uncommon to see '''\\" before a typical line of speech. If you get lost, don't worry...I did too. The story 'The Musgrave Ritual' especially is badly told, plain and simple.<br /><br />Plus Watson's function in most of this hardly ever reaches out of 'The Casual Observer'. All he does is witness Holmes' crime-solving techniques. Which usually only last a couple of pages as most of each story (typical length 21 pages) devotes about 13 pages to set-up. Hardly well balanced is it?<br /><br />The last story 'The Final Problem' isn't even a mystery at all and just seems like a badly thought-out excuse for Conan-Doyle to kill of a character he felt totally indifferent about. Even tho the public loved Holmes. Why Moriarty is seen as a massive villain is beyond me because he hardly does anything at all.<br /><br />The overall quality of the short stories is average. The full novels is where Holmes and Watson REALLY have something to other than fool around in low-level stories. You'll definitely be interested in some of the stories in this certain edition, but they lack meaning or purpose.<br /><br />This particular edition comes with extensive notes at the back with numbers for each story to help clear up any confusion. Some of them are helpful for when you are reading and the rest give away plot points and ruin some of the developments.<br /><br />As I am a Holmes completest I stuck it out and finished every one of these stories. If you are too then I'd recommend this Penguin edition over the others. They seem to always print the best copies of Holmes.nd Watson REALLY have something to other than fool around in low-level stories.

B00006IR5S|5.0|If you liked the movie then you'll definatly like the soundtrack it has almost every song from the movie and it's even better than the first soundntrack!
B00005OAIE|2.0|I do not understand all the hype this guy has received. The big problem with this CD is not, as the Amazon.com reviewer quite correctly (and humorously) point out, the pretentious, \\"look at my deep thoughts\\" coffehouse lyrics.  With John, it's as another reviewer pointed out, the same \\"look at me ma\\" jazzy chords. Unfortunately, they're not some of the cool jazzy chords that most rock's peppered with, but the entire CD is one terrible smooth jazz chord after another. This isn't musical complexity, it's pseudo-jazzy blandness.  The only people we have to thank for this kind of nonsense is John Tesh and Steely Dan (although Dan actually tried something new from time to time).
B00005JL96|3.0|Although the theme of this movie is excellent. I feel Disney rushed it to get it out and make money. They did not take the time to keep the beautiful theme they were trying to instill. They created strong characters and wrecked them with too much violence, words such as \\"stupid\\" and others and I think really for a small child this is not a great film. My 7 year old neise even had problems understanding the whole ending. I was hoping this would be as heart-flet and warm as it seemed like it wanted to be. I believe Disney just rushed the idea instead of playig it out a little longer. The theme is good, but I think it was poorly written. Like I said too much anger/violence. The sister kicking the car and calling someone a stupid head right off on the first of the movie kind of gave me a bad taste with my son sitting next to me in the theater. I think this would be better for ages 12 and up. Also if Disney took some of the language and action out and made it more loving like the original theme. It IS a great theme and great way to share and think it just was not played out right! Too rushy!
B00006RU5B|5.0|The combo that is Audioslave is amazing,  Killer Riffs and Killer Vocals and Lyrics, Audioslave slows down on few track here such as Getaway Car, Last Remaining Light, I am the Highway and Like A stone, and they pull it off.  Listen to this with an open mind, try not to compare to RATM or SG.  ITs hard not to, but this band is neither.  Its Audioslave and its brilliant.   An Absolute most for any music lover, especially one that loves the seattle sound. I'd say its the best hard rock record or 2002, since 2000 and of 2003.  ITs amazing CORNELL RETURNS WITH A FURY>!!!!
6305878323|5.0|My son finds it hillarious that this was one of my favorite movies when I was his age. Recently we have both started to try to find things that we both liked at different times. like a common ground. Although, when he first watched it he just wanted to watch Dick VanDyke make funny faces and we continually had to keep rewinding to those scenes, now he enjoys the entire movie and even collects Mary Poppins stuff, which is hard to find. But we are all in on it and it makes it like a scavenger hunt, who can find what. He even got a signature from Dick VanDyke himself. We both feel that he did not get enough credit for his rolls, but this is still truley a classic and a bringing together for all ages.
B000002KCI|3.0|Zuma is definately a good album. I would give it three and half stars in all reality. Songs like Barstool and Don't Cry. . . are some of the best neil young you can get. Other tracks seem lost on this cd and don't it allow to work as a whole album. Nice, but not worth 5 stars. . .

0684833395|5.0|Joseph Heller's Catch-22 is one of America's greatest works of literiture.  It is a funny, powerful, sad, and ironic portrayal of war.  I'v never read anything quite like it.
B000002UB6|4.0|I really love to listen to this album, but that doesn't mean it's the best Beatles album.  That honor probably falls to Abbey Road, but Let It Be is much more interesting and a better reflection of what was really going on with the Beatles at that time.  If you check out the huge Beatles Anthology book (as I just did), you'll see that LIB was recorded first as well as filmed, then handed off to Phil Spector in disgust.  Then the Fab Four and George Martin realized they needed to do a real, old-fashioned studio album like people expected from them.  So yes, Abbey Road is certainly a better-sounding, better-produced album, but thanks to the magic of CDs you can easily jump over the dumb cuts on LIB (like the title song and Long &amp; Winding Road) and just listen to the Beatles having fun and making music.  I don't hear the hand of Phil Spector as much as everyone else seems to (except on those two cuts), otherwise it's just the four lads having fun together for the last time.  And just to note, One after 909 refers to catching a train after the one that leaves at 9:09 and is a darned catchy song.
0800132343|5.0|You definitely want the director's cut and you definitely want the version with subtitles -- the dubbed version is ludicrous.  And you definitely want this movie.  It's GREAT from every perspective -- the story, the acting, the photography, you name it.  The direction and photography are particularly outstanding -- any number of shots will stick in your memory, which in my experience is rare for a movie.  I was surprised to learn from one of the reviews below that this was originally a 6-hour mini-series, because it certainly has the look and feel of a Major Motion Picture.  Regardless of whether you think you like \\"war movies,\\" you will be enthralled by this.  It's extremely realistic and intense and will have you rooting for the German crew even if you're a gung-ho patriotic American.  It really isn't about World War II or \\"Germans vs. Americans.\\"  It's about the human drama of a group of men trying to do their jobs and stay alive under near-impossible circumstances.  This is one of the VERY few movies that I actually consider worth owning. ....
B00000099Y|5.0|I must admit that this is my favorite Tool album so far. I am a huge Tool fan, and according to some other reviewers out there, that fact alone classifies me as unquestionably dim-witted (oh, excuse me while I wipe that slobber off of my keyboard).  However, if you are new to Tool's work, I highly recommend this album.  It will give you a taste of the evolved Tool.  If you happen to be &quot;dense&quot; enough to enjoy it, go for the gold and go all the way back to Undertow and see what you think of their older work.  You'll hear the difference!  Hard Alternative fiends need to try this out.
0486282147|4.0|\\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" is among the most famous of the Sherlock Holmes stories overall, and certainly the most famous of the four Holmes novels. Perhaps this is because of its ingenious plot premise. In this story, the famous deductive detective and his friend Dr. Watson are called upon to investigate at Baskerville Hall, a remote country mansion where the new heir to the property fears for his life. Apparently an old family legend has come true, and a horrible hound who haunts the moors is thought responsible for the deaths of the previous landowners. I know of no more chillingly atmospheric and mysterious setups for a mystery than this one. Unfortunately, large portions of the book feature yawning gaps in which Holmes himself does not appear, and we are forced to subsist on less interesting characters. Still, it *is* a Holmes story (fans of Holmes were delighted when this novel first appeared, since it was the first new Holmes story in some years, the author having previously killed off his famous hero in \\"The Final Problem\\") and the mystery is a good one, featuring red herrings, suspicious goings-on, and clever sleuthing by the great detective. The climax of the tale, when it finally comes, is as exciting as any Conan Doyle ever wrote. A must for mystery fans.
B00006LSM3|3.0|George Harrison will be best remembered as the lead guitar picker for the band of bands, the Beatles. \\"Brainwashed\\" is a testament to his greatness as a songwriter. Upbeat pop nuggets like \\"Any Road\\" and \\"Vatican Blues\\" get you out of your chair for a dance. \\"Looking for My Life\\" plays out like a familiar Stones Lick. I thought Eric Clapton was playing lead on \\"Run So Far\\" until I checked the album notes. \\"Between the Devil and the Blue Sea\\" is a 4+ minute ticket to Hawaii. All in all, \\"Any Road\\" is a fun coda that ends the career of a rock and roll giant. Although it lacks the killer single like \\"Got My Mind Set on You\\" from his 1987 \\"Cloud Nine\\" LP, its overall content is as solid as ever. And, \\"Brainwashed\\" features the best guitar slide work I have heard since the days of Duane Allman.
0790731479|5.0|When this movie first came out about fifteen years ago, my father owned a video store and every Wednesday night was \\"Beetlejuice\\" night. I'm older now, obviously, but I still cannot get enough of this movie. <br />Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis play Adam and Barbara Maitland, two Connecticut yuppies who die prematurely in a car wreck. Within a couple weeks, their home is overrun by an ultra-trendy New York City family, Charles and Delia Deetz, and their Goth daughter, Lydia (played respectively by Jeffrey Jones, Catherine O'Hara, and Winona Ryder). Adam and Barbara want their house back, and attempt to scare the Deetz's out of the house by wearing sheets and even by possessing them over dinner, making them sing and dance to Harry Belafonte's \\"Day O.\\" Those attempts fail and enter Michael Keaton as Betelguese, \\"the afterlife's leading freelance bio-exorcist.\\" The movie is dark without being scary and funny without being ridiculous. <br />In my opinion, one of the real gems in this film is the late Sylvia Sidney as Juno, Your Case Worker. Sidney was pushing eighty when this film was made, but turns in a great performance as the embittered equivalent of an afterlife social worker. Love how the smoke from her ever-present cigarette comes out of the slit in her throat. <br />If you've never seen this movie, see it. If you have seen it but don't own it on DVD, get it. The picture quality is better than ever.
B00006LSM3|5.0|This album is the proper remedy for the proper time: a spiritual, beautiful album (forty five minutes, remember folks?). It's just a wonderful album....just shy quality-wise of \\"all Things Must Pass,\\" better than just about everything else except: \\"Cloud Nine.\\"
B00006RINF|5.0|Lacuna Coil have always been one of those bands that I had noticed, paid attention to, and really liked one or two songs from, but never bothered to listen to anything else from them.<br />Now that \\"Comalies\\" is out, I'm kicking myself in the butt for not falling in love with them sooner.<br />From the opening melodic crunch of \\"Swamped\\" to the album's final few minutes, \\"Comalies\\" redefines the silly term \\"goth\\" into something much more powerful and mature. What that word is, well....I don't know. And I don't care!! LC's new effort is everything you could ever ask for in atmospheric, beautiful music - serious, melodic, harmonious and talented. <br />If I had to pick a favorite song, I'd actually feel like I'd be neglecting the rest of them. This album is by far a top contender for best release of 2002, and contains music that transcends preconceptions and defies all belief. All in all, a nearly flawless work of art.
0738206679|4.0|barabasi does a great job of bringing you up to speed on current networking stuff, really focusing on the great strides that have been made in the past decade or two from all sorts of fields. my only complaints about the book were that it's not technical enough, doesn't have enough technical pointers (citeseer is your friend), and really stops at \\"hey, everything follows a power law!\\" but that's appearantly barabasi's schtick, power laws and scale free networks, i'll have to look elsewhere for what the implications for that finding really are.<br />overall, a good introduction for the curious mind, but not nearly technical enough.
B00005QIPH|1.0|I can't stand this new breed of image rock bands. What an appalling fad, leaving millions of otherwise knowledgeable music fans deluded. Such fans will wait for their new album with baited breath.. while the strokes are too busy looking 'cool' and ready to collect their paycheck. great marketing... but utter drivel. please avoid. so that when this band are forgotten about in a couple of years you don't have the embarassment of finding their cd in your collection and remembering you were one of the sheep.
6302101743|3.0|This was a fun movie to watch when it came out and it still is...Once again Harryhausen comes through with flying colors on the dinosaur stop motion effects. The cast and music are pretty decent as well. James Franciscus turns in a good performance. The music is a catchy tune and although it is not as good as a western like Magnificent Seven it is done well... I hope they put this on DVD because I will get it along with anything else Harryhausen worked on.
B00006LLLN|5.0|I've loved listening to Alison for 15+ years.  This is the best CD yet....like being at a concert.  Jerry Douglas is incredible, as is Union Station.  This is by far my favorite CD.<BR>Only one song missing would make it better for me....&quot;I Will&quot;.<BR>A must have for any Alison fan.....
0767847431|3.0|First let me say I own all of Harryhausen's movies. I love his work so if I seem a little critical on a couple it is only because I know how great he can be. This movie may not be Harryhausen's best stop motion animation, but it is still a fine film. The hair on the centaur seems to move a little odd and the motion in the Centaur and Griffon fight scene is not as natural looking as the skeleton fight scenes in \\"Jason and the Argonauts\\". Otherwise this movie is very well done and packed with creatures. I especially liked the job he did on the magicians familiars. It entertains and has good locations and a decent cast. Those fans of Tom Baker in Dr. Who will enjoy him as an evil magician. It is good Saturday afternoon fare for the entire family. I recommend it to anyone that enjoys movies like \\"The 7th Voyage of Sinbad\\", \\"Clash of the Titans\\", \\"Willow\\", and \\"Krull\\". I bought this on DVD in the Sinbad Collection set and I am very happy with how well the transfer to DVD was done.
B00006J3WH|4.0|Any BTVS fan would stake each other to get their mits on this CD.  No &quot;Buffy&quot; fan is complete without having this CD in their collection.  Just listening to it makes you relive the musical goodness all over again.  I wished they had kept some of the dialogue in the tracks, e.g. Sweet's line after he finds out that Dawn's sis is the Slayer.<br />The added bonus of this CD is the vivid instrumentals from such classic episodes like &quot;Restless&quot; and &quot;Hush,&quot; where the music made a louder statement than the scripted dialogue!<br />If you're looking for more Buffy music, I'd also check out the CD that was released in 1999.
B00006RU5B|2.0|For anyone that's familiar with Rage Against the Machine's or Soundgarden's music, this review will be difficult. Being a fan of both, it was hard to distance those prior projects from this new material. After a few listens, I was disappointed.<BR>    <BR>There's no doubt that respectively each band member is great at what they do but this CD ultimately sounds/feels uneven and without passion. Most of the music sounds noticeably restricted and the vocal work is generally uninspired.<BR>   <BR>Chris Cornell does a better job on the tracks that have a decidedly Soundgarden vibe. On tracks like \\"I Am the Highway\\" and \\"Set it Off\\" he is in his element. On tracks like \\"Cochise\\" and \\"Show Me How to Live\\" that have more of a Rage feel, Cornell's voice seems out of place. He seems to want to scream past the music. The best examples of the two styles are on \\"Shadow of the Sun\\" where for 4  minutes Cornell is in his comfort zone. When the song enters Rage territory he can't seem to find his way.<BR>   <BR>I think it's on the tracks \\"Gasoline\\" and to a slightly lesser degree \\"Exploder\\" that the Audioslave ideal comes closest to fruition.<BR>  <BR>If Audioslave plans to stay together as they say, I hope they are able to realize their potential on their future releases.<BR>  <BR>In the end for me, this CD just strengthens the lament for the loss of Rage Against the Machine and Soundgarden.
B00005YW4H|4.0|The only thing that stops me from giving Miss Jones FIVE stars is that after awhile, it all sounds the same. But there are some exemplary tracks:<br />*Don't Know Why (great song, LOVE it LOVE it LOVE it!)<BR>*Cold Cold Heart (i've never heard the original [i'm a young'un] but I do like Norah Jones's version)<BR>*Feelin' The Same Way<BR>*Shoot the Moon (rates up there as one of my favorite tracks. It's a nice song to kick back and relax with)<BR>*Turn Me On (I got to sing this song in jazz band so I'm in love with the song. I can't find enough words to describe it...I LOVE THIS SONG. Again, it's a shame I haven't heard the original)<BR>*Painter Song (This actually has become my favorite track on the CD. It's got a great accompaniment (sp?))<br />Overall, I don't know much about jazz, and I don't believe in comparing artists to another because each has their own sound but I can say this. If Norah Jones does just a little more tweaking to her sound, she'll have a long and successful career ahead of her.
0131103628|5.0|this obviously is not the book for beginners,neither is it the sole property of experts.what it requires is a simple overiew of the language before getting started.<BR>but if youre looking for prog excercises,dont even think of this book for excercises ,think of it as a book for technical hints and tips,and go no further..
0385484518|5.0|It was a good good that sad towards the end. I wouldnt have read the book if it wasnt for my Marriage and Family class at Cypress College. The book makes you want to visit people you care about that you have forgotten about. I would recommend this book to others if they like emotional stories. It makes you appreciate people you could lose someday a little more.
B00006YXEK|5.0|The Special Edition is an excellent package of a very touching and personal album.  Some of George Harrison's finest writing and guitar playing is complemented by the succinct production and accompaniment of his son Dhani and Jeff Lynne.  Also featured is long-time collaborator drummer Jim Keltner who first appeared on All Things Must Pass 30 years ago.<br />The songs only get better with repeated listenings.  While the album is billed as &quot;George Harrison's Final Studio Album&quot; with 11 originals and one cover tune, we are left wondering about the remaining 13 tracks of the 25 he was supposed to have been working on prior to his passing.<br />Along with reports that he was preparing his catalog of recordings, including the Dark Horse albums, for re-release in enhanced editions like 2001's All Things Must Pass I certainly don't believe we have heard the last of George Harrison.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Nothing fancy here.  Edward's use of the hammer-on &amp; hammer-off technique has been copied by every guitarist since this 1977 release.  The 'instrumental' &quot;Eruption&quot; is the most aptly-titled song ever.  And to think that Ed did it in one take.  Their cover of the Kink's &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; will make your skin crawl and get you blood flowing..........any fool who thinks he/she has a complete library of timeless rock without this album is truly a fool.
B00005B4GU|5.0|God bless Radiohead. Amnesiac is a phenomenal record. <BR>Frankly I'm reluctant to shower such praise on anyone, because eventually when they tour it'll all be football stadiums. But I'd be remiss if I didn't openly share how great Radiohead is. They deserve all the success they can muster, because I totally dig their music. Please, to Radiohead: don't mess with what you are.....stay the course as a unit. You are certainly greater as a sum then as parts individually. Life would not be the same without Radiohead. This should not be pressure put on you, but merely praise. I trust that you will continue to bring us years of music ahead of it's time, yet timeless.
6304697961|5.0|This is an amazingly scary movie! The BEST stalker movie! No Friday the 13th (well the first one at least) didn't rip-off this. Definately one of the scariest movies ever! Texas Chainsaw Massacre is probably the scariest slasher, but this is definately number 2. This is a very scary movie that I enjoyed alot, and I'd definately recommend this movie to horror or non-horror fans alike.
B00004YW6I|5.0|PJ Harvey as an artist is one of those people that come along only once in a blue moon. She is so honest and open, not afraid to show us her flaws. However I ask myself, what flaws? Well then again, she is only human so......<BR>What I think of this album is purely personal and I can't expect that just because I like, errr, couldn't live without this album is not indicative of what someone else might think of it. First, living in New York does give you a perspective of what was the impetus of these songs which might not mean that much to someone not from here. However, the themes of this disc are really quite universal.......love, admiration, sharing a simple moment with someone you adore. Ever heard the Depeche Mode song &quot;Blue Dress&quot;? That is where less is more, and this album is that way. PJ draws from the rock book of catchy melodies and heartfelt sentiment that is a winning combination. She uses her wide range,  vocally, which has always been a strong point for her, and without question adds to  catalog seldom rivaled by anyone else current. Funny how she would have enlisted the vocals of Thom York: someone else whose band is unrivaled these days. <BR>Without referring to specific songs in this, suffice it to say it's even all the way through, and I'll gladly await the next offering from PJ. God bless her. One more thing.....suffice it to say that when PJ Harvey is eligible to enter the rock and roll hall of fame, she'll get in immediately. She's just that good. If you want to take a chance on a record, get this.....odds are you won't be disappointed. If you don't like it, consider it Your Misfortune, and try again.
B00005YXZH|5.0|This album has some really amazing songs, and a few that are not so amazing. About 75% of this album will blow you away. The songs sound great, the production by Jim O'Rourke is nice, and the album sustains nicely. This album is not a perfect achievement though. I'm the man that loves you is an annnoying song. Ashes of American flags is novel at first, but it's not one that will keep you coming back to the album. The last two songs, are average as well. That being said, the rest of the album is so incredible that it still earns a five star ranking and gets my vote for album of the year. It's also fun to listen to this album and to catch all of the little &quot;Pavementisms&quot; on this record. Pot kettle black is very Pavement.
B00000K19E|5.0|OK- the special effects are groundbreaking but people talk about The Matrix SO MUCH for one reason:  it is one of those rare pieces of art that will change the way that you look at the world.  Period.  The movie has provided a clear code for looking at &quot;Reality&quot;.<br />This is modern myth making.  Concepts like &quot;the matrix&quot; &quot;gatekeepers&quot; and &quot;having your energy vampirized&quot; and &quot;waking up&quot; are so well exemplified in this story and so applicable to THE REAL WORLD TODAY that the timing seems perfect...and planned.  <br />Companion reading:  Children of the Matrix, by David Icke. See how far the rabbit hole goes...
B0000640VO|5.0|From the very beginning, Amélie shows itself to be different from predictable American blockbusters.  Its opening sequence, the retelling of the salient points of Amélie's childhood (according to her delightfully skewed view), draws the viewer into her sweet little world with its clever script and beautiful cinematography. We learn all about her parent's small quirks; her father, for instance, hates the feeling of wet swimming shorts sticking to his legs but thoroughly enjoys polishing his shoes to a deep shine, while her mother detests the wrinkled hands that come from bathing too long while finding great pleasure in empting out and reorganizing her purse. Amelie lives in a world where everyone can be categorized by such small but vitally important facts, and every little deed has its own reward.  Amélie spends her days in two activities, for she is both a waitress and a doer of good deeds. A decided introvert, the heroine delights in interesting ways of relating and interacting with the world which might not occur to the more literal minded. Much of the film is spend detailing the whimsical ways she discovers and carries out the most fantastical wishes of those unrecognized worthies that live around her. And in the midst of her small philanthropic acts, Améile thinks about about the mysterious man whose photo album she acquires when it falls right off his pannier, and plans how she might get in contact with him. The end, of course, is no surprise to anyone except Amélie; though expected, it lacks not one bit of charm, and the seducer becomes the seduced in a beautiful turn of roles.  The Paris shown is not a gritty city but rather the City of Lights as the dreamers might see it, and the enhancement of reality is perfect for the new view of the world it gives. We might see the world through Amelie's eyes, and thank goodness for it: I never knew the world could look this bright, nor the colors so sharp and dazzling. The little integration of computer animationthat does occur is both unexpected and seamless, delighting in its whimsical nature. This movie is a treasure from all perspectives, and I look forward to seeing both past and future efforts from director Jean-Pierre Jeunet.
6305014140|5.0|without a doubt my all time favourite manga movie, in fact probably one of my favourite movies of all time!<br />Excellent artwork, awesome fight scenes and a wicked plot - i mean what more could you ask for from a manga movie? If you are only going to ever watch one manga movie in your life time, then this is the one to watch!
B000002J2B|3.0|I was never really crazy about this album, but I find that the more times I listen to it, the more I like it.  It's still not as strong as other albums, but I have no complaints.  I always found it interesting that Tony Banks loved this album so much.  I think now it's because a great deal of this album is from his keyboards and personal contributions.  You don't get the classic drum riffs from Phil Collins that we all know and love, but this album is more of a &quot;feel&quot; or &quot;spiritual&quot; album.
0790729652|5.0|Like I've mentioned in other reviews, I've been a comics fan for most of my life. This movie came out a little after I was born, so I don't remember seeing it before now. Boy, was I in for a treat.<br />The movie starts with a Gotham family being robbed on their way home from a night on the town. We see a shadowy figure watch the whole thing, then skulk away. We then see the two perps, counting their stolen goods, when this shadowy figure confronts them. It's Batman!<br />The beginning is enough to make any Batman fan squeal with delight, and for average movie fans to enjoy. The plot centralizes around Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton), who saw his parents murdered right in front of him many years ago, and how he becomes Batman to  rid the streets of Gotham of the evil that claimed his parents lives. It also focuses on Jack Napier (Jack Nicholson), a mob man ratted out by his own boss. Falling into a vat of chemicals on a botched espionage mission (at Batman's ahnds, no less) he becomes the Joker, a deranged madman.<br />Keaton does an excellent job as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. Although not physically intimidating, he has a wonderful screen presence. Nicholson was the true star of the movie, playing the Joker in a manner that was very true to the comics and should delight all fans. Kim Bassinger does well wth what she's given as Vicki Vale, a photographer who comes to get snapshots of Batman and ends up dating, who else?, Bruce Wayne.<br />Tim Burton's artistic vision is what makes this movie so powerful. Being a budding comic artist himself, he's able to appreciate how a panel of a comic should translate to the screen. This movie could have failed miserably if it weren't for him.<br />Overall, this movie not only pleases Batman fans, but the general public. I give this my highest recommendation
B00005LQ04|5.0|This film from Italian director Dario Argento, a brilliantly vibrant, Neo-Expressionist horror fable, stylishly tells the tale of an American student studying in a strange ballet school overseas. Suzy travels to Germany to begin her study of ballet, but upon arrival she is only met with a series of absurd events. First an expelled girl from the school is murdered, and the blind piano player is killed by his own watch dog, and even maggots drop from the ceiling! Suzy's friend is suspicious and says the school is run by a coven of witches, and try's to escape but is killed. After visiting a psychiatrist who studies the occult, she decides to find out once and for all the truth of the school.<br />This film is creepy in its story, visuals, music, and direction. Sharp red, blue and black colors fill the screen, giving this film an almost surreal feel. The direction is amazing, very stylish, and captures the murders and other scenes in very intelligent scary shots. This is what horror is about, and is a must see for any fan of horror. I love the strange visuals of this film, the spooky music by Goblin, the colorful and baroque sets, and the horrifying scenes of the deaths, that are done in such a brilliant and creepy way, make this film feel more than a B-movie. For fans of horror, 5 stars.
B000065U1N|5.0|Few can say they have witnessed the horror of war or the bravery of those who serve.  Hollywood has tried again and again to educate us citizens on this but usually give in to the $$$ and show us what we want to see.  This movie however is one of the few that actually tries to bring the audience as close to raw war as possible in order to enhance our understanding of it. If you want a fictional story set in an actual war or maybe even a love story on the side then this movie is not for you.  War is not pleasent or fun and should not be portrayed as such, (Pear Harbor).  If you think you already know all there is to know about what happened over there and how it affected both nations then get over yourself, because you probably dont. <BR>     This movie is a little hard to follow the fist time through but has exellent visuals and leaves most that watch it feeling sad, empty, and maybe a little proud; which I think is a good tribute to those of any country who give so much and recieve so little thanks.
B000022TSH|3.0|Jack Nicholson stars in this film as Jake. Roman Polanski directed this film to a Best Picture nomination. Jake is a private investigator who is hired to find out if the head of the LA Water District is cheating on his wife. This simple job leads to a full blown investigation into murder, cover up, family secrets, missing person, and more in a twisted scandal.<br />The story is complex so you need to pay attention at all times. There are a lot of twists, and we only slowly discover things as we follow Jake throughout the film investigating. Two scandals are investigated side by side: a personal family one, and a water business one. This film has a lot of film noir characteristics, so if your a fan of noir, mystery, investigations, scandal, that type of stuff you will love this film. The film is a mix of suspense, romance, and detective work. For some it may be a bit too demanding, and somewhat slow. Also I feel the whole scandal could have a been a bit more interesting, but in all it is well thought out, and put together. Besides that, the acting, directing and script are all very good. 3 stars.

B00006AW2J|5.0|BEGGARS BANQUET is a true classic that many people say is the first of a string of classic landmark albums, and I cant say I disagree. The album starts off with SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL, which will forever stand out as one of the greatest, if not the greatest rock epic of all time. Its sinister sound and dark lyrics slapped all the flower child dead in their faces. NO EXPECTATIONS, and DEAR DOCTOR are the next two songs that prepare us for what is to come, a mixture of country and rock on most of the album that the Stones pull off greatly. STREET FIGHTING MAN is an angry political song that describes what the world would see happening in the streets of Chicago in '68. PRODIGAL SON is a foot stomping country song that is also a great one. STRAY CAT BLUES shows the Stones first true influence, it has a bluesy sound to it. Song for song this is a great album and it is a true rock classic. Lets drink to the SALT OF THE EARTH.  With the added bonus of being remastered, we can get a true sense of how great this album sounds.
B00004RE7D|3.0|Star Trek III: The Search For Spock picks up were the previous Trek film left off: Kirk discovers that he must retrieve the remains of Mr. Spock from the Genesis planet so that his Katra - his living spirit, embedded in Dr. McCoy's mind, may be reunited with his body. This is a decent Trek outing, not up to the level of the second film, but certainly better than the first. Like the second film, the highlights generally revolve around the often-amusing dialogue, my favorite bit from which (occuring during a cool hand-to-hand combat scene between Bill Shatner and Christopher Lloyd) gives this review its title. If you're a fan of any of the ST series, you'll want to see this one.<br />As for the DVD: in yet another of Paramount's &quot;make the consumer buy as many products as possible&quot; ploys, they have, of course, released the Special Edition DVD AFTER releasing the no-frills single-disc version, which is the version reviewed here.<br />Rating (1-5 star scale):<BR>Film: 3 stars<BR>DVD: 2 stars<BR>Average: 2 1/2 stars
B00006AW2O|4.0|12 x 5 is the second album the ROLLING STONES released back in the early 60's. Once again we are treated to their interpretations of some classic rock and blues songs, mixed in with a few originals. The band is showing off their blues influences on this one and they pull it off well. The songs on this album that deserve a listen to are: AROUND AND AROUND, CONFESSIN' THE BLUES, EMPTY HEART, TIME IS ON MY SIDE, GOOD TIMES, BAD TIMES, IT'S ALL OVER NOW. These songs are the standouts on this album. After this, I think the album loses some steam, but not all that much. I think on UNDER THE BOARDWALK, the band seems alittle out of place, I alson think this is true on SUSIE Q. Those two songs aside, I think that this is good album and shows off the early STONES in fine form.
6305910189|3.0|The makers of Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan remembered something that seemed to be almost completely lost upon the creators of the first Trek film: one of the main reasons Trekkies loved the original  Star Trek was that it was FUNNY. As has been said many times before, TWOK is much more in tune with the sensibility of the original series than its predecesor, which plays more like Stanley Kubrick's 2001 than anything from the original series. TWOK's got it all, friends: tight direction by Nicholas Meyer, nifty special effects, and (of course) big laffs.<br />This (single-disc) DVD, unfortunately, is nothing special - widescreen transfer, 5.1 surround sound, theatrical trailer... and that's about it (though I see that there's a 2-disc Director's Edition out which looks pretty kewl).<br />Final rating (1-5 star scale):<BR>Film: 4 stars<BR>DVD: 2 stars<BR>Average: 3 stars
B00006AW2G|5.0|LET IT BLEED is another in a line of classic albums from the Rolling Stones, and this is a must have for any rock music fan. The albums starts off with the eerie sounds of GIMME SHELTER, which happens to be my favorite Stones song of all time. LOVE IN VAIN is an old Robert Johnson blues song that the Stones cover and make there own. COUNTRY HONK, is a two-steepin version of HONKEY TONK WOMEN that the Stones pull off quite well. Every song on this album is a bona fide hit,but probably the song that really shows the Stones at their best is YOU CANT ALWAYS GET WHAT YOU WANT. This album has it all: rock, blues and country that in later albums the Stones would merge together to make them the Greatest Rock n Roll Band in the world. Dont forget to listen to MIDNIGHT RAMBLER which comes off as a companion piece to SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL, and MONKEY MAN which is a classic song that the Stones have taken to playing in concert once again. If all these young pop bands want to know what real music is, this is a good album for them to start with. 30+ years since it was released, this album is still revelent and should be required listening for any other bands that want to know how it is done.
B00006RU5B|5.0|The collaboration between Soungarden's super-duper frontman and Rage Against The Machine's groovemakers pays off in a b-i-g w-a-y. This album contains songs that are reminiscent of each of the former bands styles, but they seem entirely fresh due to the added dynamics that each of the former musical factions participants bring to each others tables. While Zack De La Rocha brought a lot of the rage to Rage, his political/activist jibber-jabber was too preachy and ubiquitous to the point of being annoying. Cornell's harmonious vocals and range allow Ye Olde Rage Boys to explore musical territory they were unable to with De La Rocha behind the mic. Some songs are so melodic and beautiful that I'd have never guessed that members of Rage were the ones who created them. These melodic tunes add just enough of a break from the harder stuff, that they seem that much more thundering when you do hear them.
B00006EXCC|4.0|AFTERMATH is one of the best albums the ROLLING STONES have ever made. I am reviewing here the UK version, which has alot of great songs. This album starts off with 4 classic songs that have ever been made: MOTHER'S LITTLE HELPER, STUPID GIRL, LADY JANE, UNDER MY THUMB. These 4 songs alone are worth the price of buying this album. After these songs, there are still some good songs, DONCHA BOTHER ME, GOING HOME, FLIGHT 505, are songs that deserve a listen to. HIGH AND DRY, TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT are songs that also get a good rating by me. The sound on this remastered disc is awesome, I think you can really hear the difference over previous releases. So I think that you will appreciate this album and not be disappointed in adding it to your collection.
156895557X|5.0|To be quite honest, I have never liked reading. Whether it is for school or for \\"pleasure\\", reading has always been a chore to me. However,Tuesdays with Morrie completely changed my view on reading. For the first time in a long time, I actually enjoyed reading. The book made me feel like I was actually in the room with Morrie and Mitch during their Tuesday meetings having a conversation with them. The book not only inspired a love of reading within me once again, but also taught me so many lessons that I know I can apply to my own life. These are lessons that I will take with me and cherish forever. <BR>This book really inspired me to live my life to the fullest. It'll enlighten and give me insights on dealing with life. <BR>This book motivates and somehow changes my perspectives in life.
B00006LSM3|4.0|Run! Run!! It's the return of the ELO snare drum! Aaaaaa!!!  Actually, once you look past Jeff Lynne's irritating production style (and, to be fair, he has mostly been kept in check this time) this is a really enjoyable album. A fitting farewell postcard from George, if you will. It is full of his usual melodic touch, good will and warmth. There may not be another Something here, but Pisces Fish, Run So Far, Never Get Over You and Stuck Inside A Cloud carry a similar sublime vibe. Then there's a good Travelling Wilburies imitation called Any Road and P2 Vatican Blues which is cut from the same  cloth as For Your Blue. Honestly, you won't find any bad songs here, so I'm gonna stop listing.  Is this album on par with All Things Must Pass? Of course not, but not that many albums are. Bottom line is, you will enjoy it.
B00005U11Z|5.0|Anyone how ever listened to a Journey song will be thrilled to see that not only does the new front man Steve A. fill the shoes for this group with a voice that carries its wieght in gold but also to experience a chance to hear some of the best musicians ever to perform live.  A mix of old songs and new.  It plays in our house all the time.  Go see them in Concert they are in a major good groove.
B00006LSM3|5.0|I picked up this CD not sure what I was going to get!  When a CD comes out after an artists death, many times, you get an album that sounds like it was pieced together.  Some recorded while the artist is alive and other parts put together by his \\"friends\\".  NOT WITH THIS ALBUM!!  It is a pure George Harrison album.  Doing what he does best writing honest songs from his heart and soul.  <BR>The album is produced by George Harrison, Dhani Harrison and Jeff Lynne.  You can hear Jeff Lynne's style come through on this one.  To me, it picks up where \\"Cloud Nine\\" left off.<BR>Top 5 Favorite tracks:<BR>1. Stuck Inside A Cloud<BR>2. Looking For My Life<BR>3. Brainwashed<BR>4. Any Road<BR>5. Pisces Fish<BR>R.I.P. George
B00006RU5B|4.0|It's 1992 all over again. Ten years ago, Nirvana graced the charts, Soundgarden's Chris Cornell screamed with passion and intensity on radios across the country, and Rage Against The Machine blew away listeners with its hard-rocking, complex, chaotic sounds. Today, it seems, history is repeating itself. Nirvana has a new hit CD, Cornell is still screaming his head off, and Rage is still rocking hard. Only this time there's a twist.<BR> <BR>Soundgarden is no more, and singer Zack de la Rocha has parted ways with Rage. This combination of circumstances is what allowed Audioslave to come to be.<BR> <BR>Featuring Cornell on vocals, Audioslave creates a sonic onslaught aimed directly at the listener with their debut self-titled album. Ex-Rage members Tom Morello (guitar), Tim Commerford (bass), and Brad Wilk (drums) provide huge chunks of hard rock riffage for Cornell to cry, moan, and wail over. Morello, as always, is especially brilliant on the album, creating noises with his guitar that would make Jimi Hendrix turn green with envy.<BR> <BR>As a whole, Audioslave leans much more towards hard rock than the hip-hop and funk-laden grooves of Rage Against the Machine. The album is loud, powerful, and hits hard. Cornell sings here with conviction unheard since his Soundgarden days.<BR> <BR>The album begins with what sounds like a helicopter along with a steady, hard drumbeat. That \\"helicopter\\" is Morello's guitar, which soon explodes into the hard-rocking sonic frenzy known as \\"Cochise.\\" The song, which is pure headbanging fun, is a tribute to a great Native American chief.<BR> <BR>Morello explains, \\"Cochise was the last great American Indian chief to die free and absolutely unconquered. When several members of his family were captured, tortured, and hung by the U.S. Cavalry, Cochise declared war on the entire Southwest and went on an unholy rampage, a warpath to end all warpaths. He and his warriors drove out thousands of settlers. Cochise the Avenger, fearless and resolute, attacked everything in his path with an unbridled fury. This song kinda sounds like that.\\"<BR> <BR>Other headbangers on the album include \\"Set it Off,\\" which is simply rock mayhem, and \\"Bring `Em Back Alive,\\" reminiscent of Black Album-era Metallica, minus Kirk Hammet's mindless guitar wanking.<BR> <BR>There's more to the album than pure headbanging, though. One of the great things about the record is its use of dynamics. On several tracks, notably \\"Exploder,\\" the verses are delicate and intricate, and all of the sudden the choruses just, well, explode out of nowhere with raw bombast, allowing the songs to simultaneously portray both dark, mellow moods, and more aggressive emotions.<BR> <BR>Besides \\"Cochise,\\" the real gem on this album is \\"Like a Stone.\\" The song features extremely refined guitar work from Morello, which perfectly blends retro and modern styles in order to create a mood that gradually shifts from dreary to hopeful.<BR> <BR>The only track on the album that really misses is \\"What You Are,\\" which features absurdly loud guitars in the chorus that drown out the vocals and sound too melodious, which doesn't quite fit with their heavily distorted sound.<BR> <BR>The songs on the album don't seem to flow as well as they could, but \\"What You Are\\" aside, they are all very good songs, with deceptively complex arrangements and a variety of emotions expressed. So if you want an album that flows like a river, telling a musical story as it goes, Audioslave may not be for you. But if you want an album that is sure to satisfy any headbanger's craving for pure, unadulterated, bombastic hard rock, look no further than this album.
B000025H0Q|5.0|A timeless masterpiece if ever there was one, Bryter Layter includes some of the best songs this poet/genius has ever recorded (&quot;Norhtern Sky,&quot;Fly,&quot; and &quot;At the Chime of a City Clock&quot;).  There's no question that all Nick Drake material is essential, but this could very well be the best place to start.  Drake's influence is flung far and wide, but to date no one has managed to capture sadness in such a perfect, stoic, powerful way.
B00006JDVV|4.0|When it comes to Science Fiction and Fantasy movies, a wide sector of appeal can't realistically be expected. Perhap \\"Matrix\\" had the widest appeal in the modern, digital effects era because of its crossover into rather serious social and political issues. \\"Reign of Fire\\" is basically a dragonslayer movie taken out of the misty mystical magic of the Middle Ages and put into a setting that starts in present day London, but ends in the stark setting of a Mad Max-like, post apocalyptic England. There is a dramatic continuity between the young boy who first sees the resurrected dragon, and their face to face confrontation years later.<br />Unlike \\"Dungeons and Dragons\\" that had winged serpents that could only be defeated by transcendental magic, this story has heroes, starting with the young boy's mother, who are in succession fatally brought down in their struggle with the fire breathing beasts until there is only one left standing...the dragonslayer.<br />Those of us who have since childhood watched movies like this where an ageless monster spreads havoc and abject destruction on an otherwise stable civilization know the storyline. So for those who know the story, the question is what does this new telling bring. Well, I thought it has some interesting qualities. I liked the dramatic tension between the hide-and-survive mentality as embodied in the Bale character and the kill-the-beast mentality embodied in the McConaughhey character. The digital capabilities are exploited to provide some some uniquely exciting scenes in this movie. My favorite was the skydiving Archangels and their bait and chase of a flying dragon...that was new and cool. I watched it in the DTS mode, and the sound images amplified the story unfolding visually. My favorite audio image was the sound of the male dragon making unseen high speed passes in the darkness over the ill fated convoy to London.<br />After \\"Dungeons and Dragons\\", my expectation for a movie of this type was not very high, but Ienjoyed \\"Reign of Fire\\" much more that I had anticipated. This is a movie for Sci-Fi/Fantasy freaks, and in its genre, I think it is well done. The 1981 \\"Dragonslayer\\" is still ranks as the classic, but \\"Reign of Fire\\" is worth watching and forming your own opinion. I came upstairs from by basement theater telling my wife it was much better than I expected.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Not a HUGE Rage fan, I too was skeptical about the collaboration of Chris Cornell and the three members of Rage.  WOW, was I blown away!  In the faster/harder songs, it is interesting to hear a fabulous combination of the unmistakable guitar/rhythm work of Rage and vocals that take me back to early Soundgarden.  The slower songs showcase the depth and creativity of Chris Cornell's solo work, as well as his soothing lower vocal range, which is like if silk had a sound.  And once again, as with every project Chris Cornell is involved with, this album shows that Cornell has by far the best rock voice ever.
B00006RU5B|5.0|this is perhaps one of the best albums made in the last 5 years.  it is excellent on so many levels.  Chris Cornell's voice is great as always, tom morello's guitars sound awesome, and tim and brad are, as always, incredibly tight.  if you like rock, get this album.  you will not be dissapointed
B00006J3T4|5.0|Most artists coming from the 80's tend to disappoint in their latest recordings. The quality seems to degrade. But that's not the case with this album or Sailing to Philadelphia. It might not hit you in the face the first time you listen to it, but lend enough ear and it grows on you. Most of the songs got that smooth Mark Knopfler voice, guitar and feeling that so unique. My favorites are Devil Baby, Quality Shoes and Ragpickers Dream.
B0000025T6|1.0|This album is about a time in Bruce's life when he longed to pump his fist, but circumstances prevented him from doing so.
6301016289|5.0|I really liked this 1980s classic.  It very accurately portrays the wild, amoral, hedonistic capitalism of the day, which is anything but religious or prudish.  I wonder how it came to be that stockbrokers ended up in the same political bandwagon as the Bible Belters.  The movie portrays capitalism's weak spots only too realistically, the unfortunate thorn to a system which, if managed properly like it is in modern Europe, can work well to deliver widespread prosperity and social justice.  But American politicians haven't gotten the right formula yet thanks to the guys you see in this film.<br />Michael Douglas's voice and demeanor work wonders to create the classic greed-addicted corporate raider who wreaks havoc with the markets and in the process gains control over the future of thousands of workers.  You won't find many references to Nike, Microsoft, or Starbucks here due to the time lapse since.  But many older investors will remember all the businesses named in this movie.  [name here] plays an intelligent newbie who has all the savvy moves down in no time, but maintains some sense of social justice and democratic values to the end, which are a driving force for one of his &quot;revenge&quot; moves that you'll see if you watch it.  <br />Douglas's speech in the shareholder meeting is excellent but misnamed:  it should be Ambition is Good since excessive Greed leads to a deterioration of workers' living standards and an eventual collapse of the economy, like what happened in the 1920s and what is happening today on a smaller scale.  But he points out very directly that the desire to achieve and receive a &quot;badge of honor&quot; is the driving force behind human creativity.  Even so, as this movie points out, injustice is deeply entrenched in the system and the method of corporate governance over workers is completely undemocratic.
0896762173|5.0|I would have loved to had seen the pieces of the garment drawn in their pattern shapes, but otherwise an excellent book with much detail written about each garment. Only other problem was that sometimes the writer's handwriting about the details on the drawings were a bit hard to decifer.
B00003CXI1|1.0|Harry Potter is such a wiener.  If he wasn't so talented he wouldn't have a girlfriend. <BR>I give this movie a 1 out of a possible 5 stars.  I wouldn't give him any stars but he's so damn talented.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|To call Battle of Los Angeles rap metal is a disservice. Fred Durst and Wes Borland can only wish to have the talent and chemistry that Zach and Tom had on this album. Accept no imitations, do not call this album anything other than it is: it is Rage at the apex of their career and it is the loudest, meanest, strongest album I have ever heard. Don't bother trying to categorize it.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I love this movie, my 17 month old loves this movie, and my husband loves this movie! Good thing because we've had to watch it at least 25 times since we bought it. The details are incredible and soo real, they way the fur blows on Sully in the blizzard to the way Boo runs along picking up cheerios just like a toddler would. This is a great family movie, even if we didn't have a child, we still would have watched it. We loved Shrek and in comparison, this one is way better! Soo glad we spent the money on it.
B000002UC5|3.0|Paul's first album after the Beatles, Mccartney, was mismanaged from the beginning.  That's not to say that there aren't bright spots to it, but overall, as a breakaway solo album Mccartney has to be considered weak.<br />First, several of the songs were written during the later Beatle years and considered unsuitable for release: Teddy Boy, exhaustively rehearsed during the Let it Be sessions, as well as Hot as Sun and Every Night.  Though I enjoy the song Every Night, it still makes me wonder why such a prolific writer as Mccartney would have to use these holdovers.<br />Secondly, the album is padded out with multiple instrumentals like Valentine's day and Momma Miss America (as well as Hot as Sun Glasses.)  Instrumentals are fine for what they are, but the average listener has little interest in jamming in the car to them.  Come on, Singalong Junk?  You can't tell me that isn't album padding.  And that Karreen-Akore?  That was the type of thing that the Bealtes tried to discourage Lennon from doing because it wasn't commercial enough, yet here Paul sticks it on his album.  How many people really sit through that ...?<br />Third, the production qualities ....  The whole things sounds like it was made in somebody's basement (and I think some of it might have actually been done in Paul's living room!)  And let's face it, Paul can drum, but he is not a drummer.  The backbeat on this album is plodding and weak.<br />Finally, deserving of it's own seperate mention, is the pitiful waste Maybe I'm Amazed turned into.  We're there a Beatles around, Maybe I'm Amazed could have turned into a number one single.  With Ringo putting on a competent drum beat, John and George providing decent Harmony (instead of just a passable one by Paul and Linda) and George doing his thing on the guitar, the song could have been incredible.  Instead, it wasn't even released as a single (that honor went to Another Day, a cute but inferior song.)  Paul tried to rectify the situation by recording an improved version live and releasing it durning the Wings Across America era, but in 1970 is was still stuck at the back of Mccartney.<br />Overall, Paul's work on this album would have fit great into a Beatles album, because he would have only had to contribute four songs: Maybe I'm Amazed, Every Night, Junk, and That Would Be Something.  The rest would have discarded.
B00006LSM3|4.0|This is more a really well-crafted album than a brilliant album. But it is very very well-crafted with wonderful compositions, well executed. It's obviously bittersweet buying it and listening to it, and I'm trying not to let me feelings about George let me overpraise this. (Hey, George even answered one of my questions in an online chat not long before his passing!! I'll always cherish that fact!) Anyway, one wonderful thing about this album is JEFF LYNNE DIDN'T RUIN IT. I don't think I'm alone in thinking Jeff Lynne turned CLOUD NINE and the two \\"new\\" ANTHOLOGY Beatles songs into mediocre ELO sounding songs. George told Jeff \\"I don't want this album to sound too posh.\\" So Jeff knew not to ELO it up too much, and he DIDN'T. Dhani Harrison perhaps kept Lynne on a short leash, too. As a result this album sounds clean and ORGANIC. When listening to this album, you can almost imagine George in the corner of a pub with a small band playing you these songs as you sip a beer by the pub fire. Considering what George was enduring when he wrote and recorded this album, it's impressive how warm and upbeat most of the songs are. There really isn't a stinker on the whole album.<br />Some of my faves on the album are ANY ROAD, and (as a Pisces myself!) PISCES FISH, LOOKING FOR MY LIFE, and BRAINWASED. And I love the 1920's tune BETWEEN THE DEVIL AND THE DEEP BLUE SEA. If any of you wondered (like me!) why George had Tiny Tim sing \\"Nowhere Man\\" on the Beatles 1968 Christmas Fan Club record, well, George is almost doing a Tiny Tim himself when playing ukelele and singing on BETWEEN THE DEVIL AND THE DEEP BLUE SEA! I love it. <br />Some of you may buy this album out of sentiment, but I think you'll find yourself listening to it for pure pleasure.
0385474547|5.0|This is a beautiful book, and I must point out I was disturbed by some of the reviews, obviously left by highschool students bored and surfing the web.  Let me say this: just because you do not understand a book, does not make it bad.  I'm not sure you understand this, since all reviews that said \\"this sucked\\" tended to be accompanied by statements such as \\"I couldn't follow the story\\".  What happened to the days where people were ashamed to reveal their incredible stupidity, rather than reveling in it as a source of pride?<BR> Anyone who is interested in learning about African precolonial society will enjoy this book.  Someone said something about the hero being sexist-if you read the book more carefully you would see that Achebe is not praising those characteristics.  He thinks that his hero has serious character flaws and by no means is he presented as \\"exemplary\\".  That's exactly why he is such a compelling character: he is deeply flawed (like everyone) but is also a tragic hero, like Macbeth and others who, despite their problems, are sympathetic.  Okonkowo is juxtaposed to characters who show that men and women in other African societies do act as equals, something he has trouble understanding.  His own personal pride and flaws lead to his personal tragedies long before the colonists show up.  I shouldn't read these reviews, they are so disheartening.
0385484518|5.0|I must admit I would have never read this book if it wasn't mandatory for my sociology class. <BR>I really enjoyed this book it made me step back and take a look at my own life and re-think a few things. Morrie's outlook on life would give anyone meaning to the things they take for granted. <BR>Their is life after death, we just choose not to deal with it.
B000067CPX|5.0|This may well be the best album the Pepper's have put out.  I haven't been able to stop listening to it for more than 2 weeks straight.  Every song is a new twist in the RHCP story, and they all merit credit.  I love how they keep their garage band roots and still rock, while taking the music to a another level in so many ways.  They have matured into one of the best bands ever, and they really have figured out the mystery of making great, awesome, incredible music.  Good job guys.
B00006RU5B|5.0|i'd been hearing about this project for the last year and a half or so, and never thought this album would see the light of day.  Then, a month or two ago i heard the first single, &quot;cochise&quot; on the radio.  &quot;Cochise&quot;, to me musically, sounded a bit in the led zepplin meets 90s hard rock vein.  It took me a couple of listens but, the song has grown on me, and i'm hooked on it now.  After hearing &quot;cochise&quot;, i figured the album would sound pretty much the same, but, not all of it does.  That's one of the great things about this album, it's diverse, but without completely straying from being a rock album.  There are rockers, like &quot;cochise&quot; or &quot;set it off&quot;, and there are more mellow (but not quite 'soft'), emotionally written songs such as &quot;shadow of the sun&quot; and &quot;i am the highway&quot;. <br />Chris Cornell has NEVER been part of something that sounded bad or half-assed, in my opinion.  This man is incredibly talented both vocally and with his ability to write music and lyrics.  This album, for Cornell fans, should dissapoint no one.  If you liked his solo album Euphoria Morning (or even his work with Soundgarden) you'll likely fall in love with this album (especially the song &quot;i am the highway&quot;, i love this song).  <br />Audioslave is definately a rock album...it's like a mix of Chris' solo work and Rage Against the Machine's  blended together to form some really good, unique music.  This is one of the better albums i've bought in the past few years, and, with writing as good as this, and the talent these guys bring together, i hope they continue to put out more Audioslave music.
0786867973|5.0|This is my favorite cookbook, even though it had more sweet than savory dishes. All of the recipies i have mad out of it worked out perfectly, i especially liked the Cheese danish, coconut macaroons, The best blueberry muffins EVER!, raspberry lemon muffins, apple walnut cake among some,and the Gateau Breton (its all about the butter, so do use a good quality, like a french butter) is soo easy yet its the best cake in the world for me.
B00006NSZ5|4.0|It might not be a hood classic but this will be one of the many collaborations that will be remebered. Eminem really shines on the mainstream track \\"lose Yourself\\". This is one of many cd's that you should add to your collection. Especially with the banga \\"wanksta\\" by 50 cent and the new york king jay z's \\" 8 miles and running\\" feat beans. Cop this joint or you will be missing out on a tyte cd fa sho.
0786868694|5.0|I have made various recipies of Nigella's from the Cheese danish (bettter than bakery bought) to her lemon risotto and everything looked, tasted adn worked out perfectly for me. This book is no exception. The photographs are beautiful, true works of art, the recipies are exactly as those from her tv series.<BR>Honestly, all the food she presents is impressive, yet not intimidating when it comes to actually making it. I love this book, and im sure anyone out there will be a fan of it as well.
B00006YXEK|5.0|At the time this review was written, the world has been without George Harrison for about a year. With the loss of John Lennon, the heart of the Beatles was departed. Now it is safe to say that the soul of the Fab Four is nothing more than a memory.<br />Brainwashed features a George Harrison freer and more relaxed since the early Beatle days. Prometheus unbound could not have been more emancipated from the shackles of  pressure and concern as to how an artistic work would be received.  This album just might be George's best work ever, and is definitely a wonderful goodbye to those who loved the man and enjoyed his music. I admit a tear or two passed between the tracks.<br />Both Jeff Lynne and Dhani Harrison deserve kudos for a job well done in production. What had begun with The Traveling Wilburys and Cloud Nine continues and is more than mere ear candy.<br />Jeff Lynne, who was the driving force behind the original Electric Light Orchestra, can be heavy handed with his direction, but I feel he handled George's songs with care. Listening to Dhani Harrison-and seeing him physically on the enclosed DVD-is haunting. Dhani's resemblance to his father is uncanny...especially when thinking of the George of the early Fab Four days.<br />All the songs are worthy, but two deserve special mention. \\"Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea\\" is a wonderful song that George Harrison did with Jools Holland. Listening to George play a song he thoroughly enjoyed-but did not compose-is a definite treat. Nothing more screams the true George Harrison than does this excellent performance. \\"Run So Far\\" was a song George contributed to Eric Clapton's monster album Journeyman in 1989.<br />Brainwashed does a good job of embodying all that made George Harrison such a delightful, special singer, composer and individual. About the time Jim Croce died, an old clich&eacute; made the rounds-Heaven must have a hell of a band. Now, I truly think it does.
B00004NRWH|5.0|This would have to be my favorite Nickelback album by far. I think it's ridiculous that this album, along with Curb, didn't get the recognition it deserves.<BR>But it is now, thanx to Silver Side Up.<BR>A previous review had said they sound like all other rock bands. In my opinion their lyrics, their style, Chads voice are all amazing and something I've never heard before in any other band.<BR>This albums lyrics are written mostly metaphorically. It isn't until Silver Side Up that Chad starts to write more openly.<br />I dont know if this is strange or not but I had (it got stolen) this CD and the disc was purple. My friends say they've never seen purple ones before and that they're all yellow and black.
B00005JL78|1.0|How does this movie get such good reviews from critics?  I suppose it helps to have Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise's names attached.  But let's call it like it is - this movie is lousy.  It was so boring, I was praying for it to end.
076790592X|5.0|I'm no one to take any advice about life from. I'm only a young man, beginning my life, a university student from Australia studying in Japan, don't know too much at all. The other reviews that I have just read are really amazing - they really do sum up the book, please have a read of them after you finish with mine.<br />This is an amazing book. One of my best friends - my librarian, when I graduated from high-school, gave me this book. It really is a lovely read. A book that really does sum up the beauty of life, and the beauty of living, in the most beautiful words that will be recognized through the power of your eyes, and will be understood in your brain, and then transfered to your heart which will act as blood - it will tingle your body and really make you appreciate the life you live. It's a great book.<br />There is no need to explain the story, there is only need to say that you ain't read any book, until you have read this one. A heart-warming 5 star story, to say the least. Enjoy the read.
B00000HYXB|5.0|This was the first Blind Gaurdian cd I got, I remember it so well. There's this guy I know, we call him Crazy Metal John. He drives a Buick, plays a B.C. Rich, and is a black belt in karate. 6 feet something tall, wears a trench, this guy is metal. Anyway, we were going down to the store and he says check this out, he pops in this cd. I was blown away. This is unlike anything I've ever heard other than Iced Earth, another great power metal band. These guys are super power metal in my opinion. There have been a lot of Queen comparisions, but I just dont see it. The only similarities are the operatic style of singing. But you see, what makes this cd so unique other than the power of the vocalist is that it is based on a book and has all these dialogue tracks between each song or so. Some are like little instrumentals, some are characters from the book (The Silmarillion) talking to each other. It fits so perfect. First and fav. Blind Gaurdian cd to date. Buy this cd and you will be very happy. Oh, and I hope you can understand my babble, but that shows how awesome this cd is. SO JUST BUY IT ALREADY!!

B00006L7XQ|5.0|When I was a child in the sixties, my father had always played country music on the stereo in our home.  Oh, he bought the first Beatles records and Rolling Stones singles but I remember first and foremost, Country Music on the radio--actually listeneing to Del DaMontro on AM Country station in NYC.  My Fathers love for this music was soon a part of my life...Johnny Cash was the mainstay.  Now, many years and JR Cash records later and American I, II, III played on my stereo, this American IV puts it all together...\\"The Man Comes Around\\" is about JR Cash himself in a way...and about each of us during our own lifetime.<br />The music is crisp, the voice is, well, the VOICE.  Thank God and man for Rick Ruben.  He must have had JR records in his house too, all those years ago.<br />God Bless JR Cash

B00000DHZJ|5.0|Wow I am totally amazed at how Jimi Hendrix plays the guitar. And he is also a creative lyrical genius. His imagination is very high peaked and keen. He is and always will be the innovator of creative ways to use the electric guitar. He even played with his teeth!! My favorite track is definetly Voodoo child because he is just bad on that guitar I am telling ya. If 6 was 9 is also a really good song and has really trippy guitar sounds in it, toward the ending of it. If there is anyone out there who does not like Jimi Hendrix it is only because they dont appreciate original inovative,creative music and thats the bottom line. Peace.Love.Happiness
0385508417|5.0|I loved reading this book for it made you wonder what was going to happen next.  It made you think if this would really happen if you tried to Skip Christmas.

0553260111|5.0|Wow. This novel packs a puch. With it's eccentric plots, twist and turns, this is one of the best books I've ever read. I don't know why some people gave it one star. I love this book!  The movie was a disapointment, but if you want a great book, read this!
0800177177|1.0|I know I'm pretty much alone in saying this but I really didn't like this movie.  This movie really feels like it fails to go anywhere.  This movie doesn't know what ideas it wants to convey or who it wants it's characters to be.  Is Dracula a bad guy or a tragic figure?  We'll never know for sure except well... when he looks ugly he's evil and... it's scary... isn't it??? This movie trys to scare you and trys to show you romance and as if it weren't bad enough it couldn't make up it's mind... well it fails at both.  The creatures in this movie are more corny than scary such as Dracula in a very fake looking bat-form.  Characters are so undeveloped, we have no insight into any of their personalities (except Lucy) and  the performance by Keanau is flater than usual and Anthony Hopkins gives us a huge disappointment.  His character is as goofy and senseless as this whole movie.  The \\"beautiful\\"  scenery and photography can't even save this film, even if it truly was beautiful.
0451527046|5.0|I had previously read \\"Dr Jeckle and Mr Hyde\\" and was impressed. <BR>So I recently picked up \\"Treasure Island\\" and was surprised to find out it was a kids book--written for kids. This book is amazing. Its also amazing what happens to the kid, Jim Hawkins, in this book. He even says so to Long John Silver when hes cornered. Quite the experience; quite the capable lad. <BR>Fast paced, believable, action packed. <BR>Jim, the son of an inn keeper, meets up with a pirate. And that pirate finally gets tracked down by others of his kind, which means Jim gets mixed up in their business and lands himself a treasure map. He shares the info with a doctor and the local squire and they set sail unknowingly with the previous pirates old crew. There is trickery and mutiny afoot. These are no gentlemen pirates, especially peg-legged Long John Silver. This is where you get the pirate lingo that has been used by our everyday public. Its great to go back to the beginnings of \\"shiver me timbers\\" and \\"sixteen men on a dead mans chest, yo ho ho and a bottle of rum\\". <BR>When they get to \\"Treasure Island\\" all their plans, and the pirates go awry. Jim proves his resourcefulness, bravery, daring and childishness all along the way.<BR>Excellent tale. You will enjoy it. Its got everything for a great adventure. And a skeleton, too!
1577311523|5.0|Every now and again, a book comes along to remind us of how simple life is<BR>and how complicated we make it with our minds.  In \\"The Power of Now\\",<BR>Eckhart Tolle converses with his readers about what it is to shift from a<BR>thought-based and time-based view of life to a being-based life.  It's a<BR>simple idea:  there is no moment but now, and when you get into this<BR>moment of now, the past and future have no power over you.  If a mental<BR>grasp of this concept could get people into the present  and keep them<BR>there forever, we'd have a lot more enlightened people on the planet.  To<BR>that point, when a student in the book tries to insist that the past and<BR>future are real, Tolle replies: \\"You  haven't yet grasped the essence of<BR>what I am saying because you are trying to understand it mentally. The<BR>essence of what I am saying here cannot be understood by the mind.  The<BR>moment you grasp it, there is a shift in consciousness from mind to Being,<BR>from time to presence.   Suddenly, everything feels alive, radiates<BR>energy, emanates  Being.\\"<br />What people can do, Tolle suggests, is to practice getting into the now -<BR>by feeling what's happening in their bodies, by noticing their own<BR>thoughts without holding them as true.  Everything that is precious about<BR>life is in the Now.  Eckhart's presence is powerful and palpable in this<BR>book.  As I read it, I felt worries and concerns about things I can't<BR>control just drop away.  I can't explain this phenomenon, but as Tolle<BR>says, the mind can't hold the moment.  The daily practice of being present<BR>is key, since each day brings new challenges to remaining centered.
B00006HBUB|2.0|Good 'ol Scooby and his Mystery, INC. cohorts. Brings back a lot of fond memories from long ago when I would regularly watch the old cartoon. Still fun today. Sadly, anyone who remembers it fondly like the way I and millions of other people do, won't find much to love with this new, live action adaption. It's souless and uninspired. The actors here all seem to be game for the kiddie action this film is full of, and they all do their best. However, it can't salvage the film from being anything more than a bright, overdone movie for little kids who don't know much about the history or the old cartoons. The plot is as light and unconvincing as the TV show, but here it goes - The gang split up and go their seperate ways after a case. They are all reunited two years later when they are contacted to come to an exotic island called Spooky Island, where odd, supernatural things are occuring. Gee, your kidding?. While there, the gang realize that a lot of people on the island come there normal, but they soon start acting rather oddly. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know what's going on or figure it out. This isn't anything new. The mystery of what's going on, who is doing it, and why they are doing it has always been as shallow as a kiddie pool. This new movie doesn't change that formula. The cast is fun and seem to be enjoying themselves. They make the most of what they got. Matthew Lillard, as Shaggy, is the best of the bunch. He really was a perfect choice for the role and he really brings the old cartoon character to life. Linda Cardellini as Velma did another fine job. She is obviously not as nerdy or unattractive as the old Velma, but she does an adequate job with the character and all of the ' jinkies ' she always has to say. Freddie Prinze, jr. is, well, he's Freddie Prinze, Jr. He really doesn't do anything with the character and doesn't do anything new or different to make anyone think that we're watching anything else but a same old Freddie Prinze, Jr. performance. Sarah Michelle Gellar. I love her. She is extremely talented, but she is wasted in a thankless role that doesn't have any character to it. It's a shame. She is so breathtakingly smart, tough, and talented in \\"Buffy\\", but all of that is wiped away in the vapid character of Daphne. Too bad. She is so much better than this. Comedian Rowan Atkinson of \\"Mr. Bean\\" fame also stars. There is also a rather odd cameo by Pamela Anderson here that just doesn't fit. The film is colorful and will sure entertain the young 'uns, but the adults who grew up on and loved the original will be bored and saddened with this new incarnation. The movie is never really funny, except for some things here and there(a certain scene with smoke coming out of the van comes to mind). It would've been great if the writers used more of that kind of comedy. Something more like a hilarious send-up like the big screen \\"Brady Bunch\\" movies. The movie, in one scene, resorts to low brow potty(i.e. 'farting') humor that just shouldn't of been allowed in this type of a movie. Okay, I got a tiny chuckle out of it, but it was wrong. In the end, this is a film that will no doubt be enough to satisfy the little viewers, but the older ones looking for a better homage to a beloved cartoon of long ago will be extremely disappointed. Not very good.
B00006RU5B|4.0|I am a semi-new Soundgarden fan. I picked up SuperUnknown a few months ago and loved it. I then bought Down on the Upside and didn't care for it as much. As for Rage, I don't own any of their albums, but my friend listens to them all the time.<br />I echo everyone sediments that Audioslave does indeed ROCK! The lyrics and vocals are great, probably because Chris Cornell didn't play guitar on the album, he focused on the song writting and singing. As for the guitars, it's the same grand led zeppelin inspired riffs and strange videogame sound effects that you have come to know and love from rage.<br />Altogether, I really like this album. Its only faults are that some of the songs sound similiar. I found myself trying to sing along with a song, only to find out that it was a different song. Other than that small complaint its a very good album. If you like Soundgarden or Rage it deffinatly warrants a purchase.
B000002NBY|5.0|I would give this CD ten stars if I could.  <br />I bought this CD years ago when it first came out and used it as background music while studying for finals and writing my Master's thesis.  It has not left my top ten favorite list since.  I have, on occasion, played the CD when entertaining friends, and those who haven't heard it before inevitably ask me who the artist is and where can they get a copy for themselves!<br />Paul Simon is brilliant.
B00005LOUS|1.0|I can't believe they took a good classic into something SOOO dumpy! First of all, this should be a kids movie, but the language, the jokes, etc is adult. The story is just terrible.<BR>If I'm not mistaken, I thought the original story was, that the Whos didnt care for presents, but being together as one, being like a large family.<BR>In the beginning of the movie, they're talking about presents as being the important thing for Christmas.<BR>NOT recommended for kids, due to language, adult jokes, scenes they play, etc.<BR>NOT recommended to anyone, due to a bad story, bad jokes, dull gross parts.
B000002G7G|4.0|This is not my father's Velvet Underground. Literally--I played some of this album for my dad, and he couldn't believe this collection of small, pretty, listenable songs (except \\"The Murder Mystery,\\" which hasn't aged well and cost the album a five-star rating) was by the same band that recorded the \\"banana\\" album. Actually it's NOT the same band; John Cale is gone, and he took with him much of the original lineup's white-hot fury. Enter the loose, jangly guitar and subdued bass of Doug Yule, which compliment Lou Reed's lead lines so well. Of course the quirky, sensitive, deceptively sophisticated Sterling Morrison / Maureen Tucker rhythm section is still there, and all together the four of them make a sound that might be held together with twine. It's rough, it's delicate, it might fall apart at any moment--but it's there for now. The songs aren't flawlessly executed by any means -- these aren't virtuoso musicians or studio wizards -- but their sound is that of the eye of a hurricane: beautiful in its tenuousness. <br />For me, though, it mostly comes down to the songwriting. Lou Reed grows a heart and plays the thinking man's Paul McCartney, lacking Mac's sublime melodic gift but making up for it with one of the best senses of wordplay in all of popular music. Consider this moment from \\"Some Kind of Love\\":<br />\\"And of course you're a bore,<BR> But in that you're not charmless\\" <br />I suppose John Lennon could have written that. Maybe. But he couldn't have sung it with the playful, androgynous sneer that is the key to Reed's delivery in this and most of his best songs. It's the irony that's the point here. <br />But \\"Pale Blue Eyes\\" eclipses them all for me; at this point in my life (I'm 21) it's my favorite song from anyone. Much has been said of Reed's doing so much with so little in this song, and that's a large part of it. Pure chords (I, ii, IV, V, vi) and a sparse, endlessly fetching arrangement (that guitar chime! that tambourine!) seem to leave Reed's shaky voice without much support, but that's the charm. For a vocalist who tends toward shouted, spoken, and sneered acrobatics rather than singing, holding the white line of \\"linger oooonnnnnnn\\" is a precarious place, but to me that just proves he means it. Yes he's painfully out of tune at times, but they didn't fix it. That's painfully honest.<br />And what about those words! Lou Reed is one of my three favorite lyricists (the other two are Tom Waits and Bob Dylan), and I don't believe he ever much surpasses the simple poetry of \\"Pale Blue Eyes\\":<br />\\"If I could make the world as pure<BR> And strange as what I see,<BR> I'd put you in the mirror<BR> I put in front of me.\\"<br />Tell you what, Mr. Reed. No mirror necessary; just give us this song, and this album, and we'll be more than happy with the glimpse you give us into the pure, strange world you see.
0790729628|4.0|My previous theory was that Mr Scott changed his movie because he wants to be taken seriously as an Artist, (hence the over-blown, bombastic style that made Hannibal a lesser film). I was heartened to read below that this \\"director's\\" cut was actually assembled by the studio, and that there may be a more developed version that retains much of the narration. As good as this cut is, THAT'S the version I'd like to see...<br />I think people like the version without the voiceover because it's more mysterious and arty, and it disguises that fact that Blade Runner is basically a sci-fi version of a 40's detective movie. Sure, the voiceover grates a few times, but cut that out and you STILL get the police chief saying \\"Talk about beauty and the beast - she's both,\\" which is probably the worst line in the movie, and you still get the superfluous and awful dubbed dialogue in the snake shop.<br />You also get one important piece of new footage: the unicorn dream. The problem with this insertion is (1) it is stuck seemingly at random into the middle of what was originally a smooth tracking shot with continuous soundtrack, and (2) the insert makes no sense in context and has nothing at all to do with the rest of the film...This scene would have been originally been excluded from the film because it doesn't fit the overall structure - sure, the added meaning makes some people feel deep, but on the other hand it invalidates what would otherwise be the main problem of the movie, which is Deckard's grappling with his feelings about killing creatures who might be \\"human\\". Instead it's a trick ending: \\"Turns out he was a robot all along!\\" which has nothing to do with the rest of the film.<br />As you can tell, I have mixed feelings about this version, but of course it's still a great movie - it's Blade Runner, for God's sake! And it'll do until something even better comes along...
B00006LLLN|5.0|You've probably heard this a thousand times, but if you like bluegrass, and you liked the soundtrack to \\"O Brother Where Art Thou,\\" you MUST pick up this live double-cd. The sound quality is ultimate perfection, no annoying audience noise during the songs, the musicianship is immaculate, the melodies are beautiful, and the harmonies are utterly fantastic. The music will make your heart pound, it even may bring a tear to your eye...I kid you not. Alison Krauss' voice is angelic, and Union Station's music and harmonies just create this unbelievable wall of sound. It's truly a gorgeous cd. Some of my favorite songs on here are Choctaw Hayride, Cluck Old Hen, Everytime You Say Goodbye, and Forget About It, Stay, Take Me For Longing and A Tribute to Peador O'Donnell--outstanding dobro work. But really this whole double-cd is great and I always listen to it all the way through. It cheers me up, makes the day seem a little brighter. I'm not exaggerating here. Buy it for yourself. Buy it for your friend. Buy it for your folks.
B00006RU5B|4.0|It's worth a listen, if you dig Chris Cornell's vocals, which most people do.
B00006LSM3|4.0|Hey it's hard to sink in that George won't have anymore albums/cds out anymore...I always enjoyed his songs...after awhile they ceased to be songs in the stature of something or my sweet lord...but they always remained honest...and a sense of realness to them...nothing's duller than a guy/gal trying to write a formula hit album...that holds up here with his lastest post-humous record...I must say Jeff Lynne has done another fine job as a producer...he's done alot of good work with George through the years and this one I feel was mixed very well...Also I must say I enjoyed the many slide guitar solos that George is so famous for throughout the many years...also I enjoyed his spiritual lessons to imply for my own life...even though he was a man of great renoun...he still felt the same things other human beings feel..feelings of abandonment...feeling lost...wondering what it's all about...like there's got to be something bigger and/or better than this...I won't give specifics since i've only been throught the album once...I just have to recommend this...it ranks behind...all things...and right up there with his better works...i don't think ranking his albums is necessary but this one is very good...it's a real album it was not slapped together...to make a cheesy christmas sale...this is a real album and very much a George Harrison Disc...If you have any George Harrison discs this one would be very well worth having as well!!
B00003CWTI|5.0|stunning movie, three hours of luxurious movie pleasure.  make sure you watch hard eight as well, it aint as flashy but it's just as good
B00006JDVV|2.0|I saw the trailers for Regin of Fire and thought: cool - a movie about dragons and fire!  that should be fun.<br />Well, yeah, the concept is great, but the execution was terrible.  If they weren't going to make the plot even remotely interesting, the least they could have done was make the movie wall to wall action, ya know?  Seriously, kicking dragon butt for an hour and a half would be entertaining when you are in the mood for that sort of thing.<br />Special effects were not all that great.  Didn't stink, but not good either.  A lot of really interesting ideas and concepts, but none of them explored at all.  The movie seemed like one big brainstorming session - a lot of good nuggets, but nobody bothered to pick out the good ones and expand them into a good moive.
B00006YXEK|4.0|Wow!  The final word from George Harrison.  I still can't believe it.  I eagerly awaited the release of this album, as I'm sure many of us did, and I feel it was well worth the wait.  Only time will tell how it measures up to my very favorite Harrison albums (George Harrison, Cloud Nine, and All Things Must Pass), but it is definitely high on the list - at least up to the standard of Somewhere In England, which is a very good album.  I received the CD tonight, and have already listened to it several times.  I think my favorite tracks so far are \\"Rising Sun\\", \\"Never Get Over You\\", and the achingly beautiful instrumental, \\"Marwa Blues\\".  The latter brought tears to my eyes on the first listen - it's George's georgeous weeping guitar at its very best, and I think it may be not only my favorite track on the album, but one of my favorite \\"Harrisongs\\" ever.  It also contains a quote from a Beatles song, but I'll leave it to you to guess which one when you hear it.  The charming ukelele number \\"Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea\\" brought a smile to my teary face, and something about \\"Rocking Chair in Hawaii\\" recalled \\"For You Blue\\".  This album is pure George Harrison, from the beautiful crying guitar, to the sometimes light-hearted, sometimes biting wit, to the bluesy/rockabilly riffs hearkening back to George's roots, down to the familiar mysticism and voice that Harrison fans know and love.  If you love George's solo work, you will love this album.  Listening to it (finally!) is a comfort and a catharsis, and I'm so glad it's finally here, although I'm also sad that there will never be any more.  George, wherever you are now, I'm sure I speak for other fans besides myself when I say that we love you and we'll never get over you.
B00006LSM3|5.0|Having largely ignored most of George Harrison's ouput except &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; and &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; and the occasional song, it is great to hear such a moving and timeless mix of songs.  This is an album out-of-time, one which could be enjoyed by any age and during any era.  Even without being a religious or even spiritual person, I enjoy the 'at ease' vocals that give me a sense that all is well in the world.  Mixed with spirit, clever and classic lyrics, and George's comforting vocals.  George, always being my favorite Beatle, continues to be awe inspiring and a talented and cherished treasure that will be enjoyed for decades to come.  This album is simply beautiful, only such an immense musical career could put out such an album...thank you.
B00006NSGX|5.0|Experiencing Clapton's emotional range and authenticity on &quot;Bell Botom Blues&quot; alone is worth the entire price of this album.
B00006LSM3|5.0|In his posthumous release \\"Brainwashed,\\" George Harrison shares 11 new original songs, and offers a worthy conclusion to his wonderful career.  We are very fortunate to be offered such a great peace of art nearly a year after his passing.  The album is replete with his trademarks: the slide guitar, beautiful melodies, an appreciation for country and the blues, and even the ukulele.  In this final recording George is introspective - \\"Looking for my Life,\\" and \\"Pisces Fish,\\" -- yet flippant, strumming the ukulele on \\"Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea.\\"  He is optimistic in reassuring the listener \\"If you don't know where you're going, any road will take you there,\\" on \\"Any Road,\\" and yet he is pessimistic, offering a list of social ills on the title track \\"Brainwashed.\\"  <BR>  <BR> George picks up where he left off with the Traveling Wilbury's -- a super group which among others included Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, and the co-producer of this album -- Jeff Lynne.  Similar to his work on John Lennon's unfinished songs, (Free as a Bird, and Real Love), while working on the Beatle's Anthology, Lynne, with the help of George's son Dhani, is successful in crafting complete songs around the demos George left behind for him. <br /> The album is very strong - there is not a weak track.  While not the epic that is his piece de resistance \\"All Things Must Pass,\\" \\"Brainwashed\\" is triumphant, and certainly one of the peaks of his career.  The release of \\"Brainwashed\\" in addition to the recent re-release of \\"All Things Must Pass,\\" is a fitting conclusion to his career -- they are among the best works he has produced.  Among my favorite songs are \\"Any Road,\\" \\"P2 Vatican Blues (Last Saturday Night),\\" \\"Marwa Blues,\\" \\"Stuck inside a Cloud,\\" and \\"Rocking Chair in Hawaii.\\"  <br />   \\"Any Road,\\" with its joyous melody and great harmonies, invokes memories of George's days with the Wilbury's.  \\"P2 Vatican Blues,\\" with its slide guitar fills, is reminiscent of \\"I Dig Love,\\" from \\"All Things Must Pass.\\"  Well known for his practice of eastern philosophy and religion, George reminds us of his beginnings, noting that he is an \\"ex-Catholic.\\"  \\"Marwa Blues,\\" the album's only instrumental, is beautifully accompanied -- the backing strings are similar to those featured on the great Beatles song \\"Strawberry Fields Forever.\\"  In the DVD available with this album, Dhani says that \\"Stuck inside a Cloud\\" is his favorite track.  Few would disagree.  Its joyous guitar riff reminds me of his work on songs such as \\"Far East Man,\\" from the album \\"Dark Horse.\\"  \\"Rocking Chair in Hawaii\\" is a wonderful return to the inspiration of the beginning of rock and roll-- the blues -- you would think that the Rolling Stones recorded this delta blues number 30 years ago.  <br /> In summary, this is a wonderful album.  Even though it's been 15 years since George's last original album, Cloud 9, was released, it was worth the wait... I only wish that he hadn't waited so long to start recording again.  But it looks like he had saved many wonderful songs over the years to record -- we are blessed to be offered such a wonderful collection music after his passing.  Hopefully we will soon see a DVD release of The Concert for Bangladesh.  If you enjoy this album I recommend the aforementioned \\"All Things Must Pass,\\" along with \\"Living in the Material World,\\" \\"Darkhorse,\\" and the \\"Traveling Wilbury's.  Thank you George, and thank you Dhani and Jeff for finishing the job.
B00000DLVA|3.0|This CD isn't too awful. It actually has a few great tracks on it. However, if you're a Cardigan fan, purchase with this in mind: the sound in radically different from their earlier albums (all of which I enjoyed much more than Gran Turismo).<BR>Once you get that straight, you can appreciate this Cd for its artistic merit. But you'll probably be a little dissapointed anyway.
0451203933|5.0|True story based on the US aborted attempt at solving another countries problems in the early nineties. Considered by some to be one of the biggest military blunders in modern US history.<br />I saw the film and just had to read the book. The film was excellent, the book covered alot not in the film.<br />All in all a story about modern day Hero's battling against overwhelming odds.

B00006RU5B|5.0|Rage Against The Machine: A hardcore rap project that changed the way we hear rap today.<BR>  Soundgarden: One of the best grunge bands that was ever put together, and started the grunge sound that so sadly dissolved by the end of the 90's.<BR>  Audioslave: A mix between the two bands, and also the best CD that has come out of the 21st century, or any century.<BR>    With Cornell leading Rage without De La Rocha, we are listening to an experiment in heavy metal grunge, something that has never been attempted before.  The band will have many skeptics who don't think the experiment will work, and I'm determined to let all of those skeptics know that they need to listen to this CD, because it will make them clear out their whole CD collection just to make room for the single disc made by Audioslave.  When I heard that Cornell had already left the band, I was extremely disappointed since I had high expectations for Audioslave (previously Civilian).  Now that the CD has come out, I am not disappointed but devastated that there won't be another CD from Audioslave.  <BR>     Rock has finally come back, and in that same instant, has gone.
B00006RU5B|4.0|reading these reviews there are some valid points....im a huge rage and sg fan..ill admit i was at first disapointed....but you really have to let this one sink in.....songs like gasoline.....exploder will hook you....read the lyrics get into it.....chris experiments with his vocals on this one...and tom is tom....coming with some awesome riffs....you radio guppies wont like this album....for all you others itll be a treat
B00007BHOE|5.0|This is the DVD where they hooked up the mini camera's to their jumpsuits and tour across the world. So you can their point of view during the show. I dont know what other features are on it, but I already pre-ordered.
B00005JKLZ|1.0|This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  I do recommend that you go to the video store and rent the video, just so you can see how bad it is for yourself.  I'd say that if you compared this movie to Plan Nine from Outer Space, Plan Nine wins hands down.  If you want to know the story of the movie or whatever, just go get the older one, its much better.
B00006RU5B|5.0|In their previous incarnations, Chris Cornell and the three from Rage Against the Machine both suffered from non-support.   Commerford, Wilk, and Morello were handicapped by a lead singer who could not sing, and Cornell was a singer handicapped by a band with no range.  When I first heard about this project, I thought this sounded like a marriage made in heaven, and much to my delight, it is exactly that.  Audioslave may well be the best album of the year 2002, it certainly is the best album that any of the 4 musicians has ever been involved in.<BR>  This disc rumbles to life with the very first song-- Cochise.  This Rage-sounding song starts off screaming, and my first thought was that this disc would sound like Rage with a much better singer.  Nothing could have farther from the truth.  The next song &quot;Show me how to live&quot; sounds a great deal like classic Soundgarden, only with a better rhythm section.  Next a screamer &quot;Gasoline&quot;, and then a slow and bitter rant to an ex-lover &quot;What You Are&quot;.  When Cornel spits out the words, &quot;and if I go away, you`ll find another slave&quot;, in a rant of self-loathing, you know he is going to be screaming soon.  The guitar work by Tom Morello is unearthly here, he hits notes that just shouldn`t be possible.<BR>  Throughout the remainer of the disc, Audioslave has heart rending ballads, screaming rants about religion, odes to the past, and everything in between.  This is truely a mature and well thought out album of work by some very talented and savvy veterans of the music wars.  Choosing to end this disc with the unearthly &quot;The Last Remaining Light&quot; was a brave move, you walk away with Cornell's voice still echoing in your head, wanting more.
B000002LR3|5.0|Released over ten years ago, Screamadelica still sounds fresh today.  To these ears it stands as one of the best albums released in the ninties.  However, looking at it on paper it looks like it should have been a total failure. Primal Scream had been a noisy rock band who suddenly veered into dance music. Equal parts techno, gospel, circa 68 Stones and spacey dub, it move in several different directions, yet somehow manages to cohere.  There is no shortage of great tracks, with MOVIN' ON UP(gospel meets Let it Bleed Stones), STEP INSIDE THIS HOUSE(techno cover of the 13th Floor Elavators!), DAMAGED(like a long lost bluesy outtake from Beggar's Banquet), LOADED(cool Peter Fonda sample) and HIGHER THAN THE SUN(ambient dub worthy of The Orb)among the standouts.  Released the same year as Nirvana's Nevermind, this release stands at least as tall as that seminal album.  In time it may even eclispe it!
0440237688|4.0|The Giver, is a great book, about a twelve year old boy named Jonas. Jonas lives in a utopian society where everyday activates are all characterized by sameness. In the community there is no such thing as pain and there is no fear, no hunger, and no war.  In a community empowered by The Elders, Jonas is assigned to be the next Receiver. The Receiver's job is to receive ancient memories of old civilizations from The Giver. The memories include war, pain, hurt, hunger, and love. The memories of these feelings have never been experienced before by Jonas. Jonas divises a plot to escape the community and travel to a place where \\"real\\" life exists. The Giver is a great book that will keep your attention. It is hard to understand a world without these feelings, but Lois Lowery does a great job illustrating what it would be like.  She also gives you a greater appreciation of the feelings that we experience in life.
B000067CPX|5.0|I was first introduced to the RHCP with \\"Under the Bridge\\"; I loved that cut, but hated the rest of the album as I'm not a real hip-hop, headbanger kind of guy.  I got reaquainted on Californication and now I must say this is some of the best music I've ever heard (I'm 48 years old so I've heard a lot!)  Every track brings out something new and there are the unmistakable Beach Boys and Beatles influences throughout as well as some guitar work reminiscent of the early Clapton days - there's even a mini Moody Blues riff on \\"This is the Place\\".<BR>       \\"Universally Speaking\\" opens abruptly with a Phil Spector-like wall of sound and is easily my favorite cut on the album.  There's really nothing I don't like and Anthony's vocals are simply hypnotic.  John's guitar work makes his sound so unmistakable - sort of like hearing the Edge - you KNOW it's U2.  Simply a fabulous album that you will play to death!
B0000029DD|5.0|Listening to Jeff Buckley's 1994 masterpiece \\"Grace\\" I can't help but feel terrible sadness at knowing this is the only major album we will ever hear from him. He could have been the next Springsteen, or the next Woody Guthrie. But we will never know. All we have is this one album, this one beautiful, wonderful album. \\"Grace\\" is a collection of songs, some original and some covers, that were a powerful showcase for Buckley's talents, i.e. his godly voice. On songs like \\"Dream Brother\\" and \\"Lover, You Should've Come Over\\" Buckley's soaring vocals lift the listener to a higher plane for a few moments. They pull you to a world where nothing exists but you and Jeff. But attention must be paid to some of the arching themes of the album. The cover art features various clocks and keys around pictures of Buckley. What are these pictures saying? Maybe it's a message. \\"Grace\\" seems to be a concept album about mortality and love, about people striving for connection with time ticking against them. It's almost as if Buckley knew his time was near. On the title track \\"Grace\\" (one of the few candidates for the best song ever written) he sings \\"Oh if it's my time we both might go tommorrow\\" and \\"I'm not afraid, afraid to die\\". Was he aware of his own mortality-a musical Owen Meany? We will never know, just like we will never know what Jeff Buckley would have become to music. But all we have is the mysticism of \\"Mojo Pin\\" and \\"Corpus Christi Carol\\", the regret of \\"Last Goodbye\\", the all-rock bombast of \\"Eternal Life\\" and \\"So Real\\", the drowsy flow of \\"Lilac Wine\\", and the absolute majesty of \\"Hallelujah\\". A love album set in the world of modern-day youth, \\"Grace\\" is a bright shining light in music, a eerie miracle that cannot be ignored. It is essential.
B000006045|5.0|From the opening \\"Angel,\\" filling one's head with many evocative images of loss, death, and passion, the impression comes that this CD was intended to become the background music to millions of films to come (and such its destiny has been in \\"Matrix,\\" \\"Stigmata\\" and \\"Snatch,\\" so far as I can remember).  The music is deeply sensual and chock full of imagery, the pulse of \\"Teardrop\\" resembling a heartbeat, \\"Inertia Creeps's\\" tribal drums evoking some sort of primitive passion and lust.  The buildup in most songs such as \\"Risingon\\" and \\"Group Four\\" resembles the cascade of inevitable occurrences leading to an important plot event.  Darkly obsessive and varied mood music, perfect for any occasion or feeling.
B00006LLNU|4.0|ok this album isn't as good as thier first, but they still bring me to tears everytime. this album is like an unattainable orgasm, with each song you get closer and closer to that final gush, but then he pulls out.  there's no climax. either way, it's a good album.
B000068PQ0|4.0|Though I consider myself a strong fan of theirs (now), my experience is almost wholly limited to this and &quot;The Soft Bulletin,&quot; though I've heard other songs of theirs here and there, so bear with me.  Comparing this to &quot;Bulletin&quot; and my music experience in general, this is a wonderful and very clever album in many ways.  If you're looking for the same sort of bombast as &quot;Bulletin,&quot; look elsewhere, but the same musical inventiveness is still evident.  When you listen to it multiple times you start to sense the discordant musical styles throughout: bouncy pop on opening &quot;Fight Test,&quot; semi-bleak techno on &quot;One More Robot,&quot; rock on &quot;Yoshimi Pt. 2&quot; (strangely enough closest thing to Bulletin on here IMO), epic sorrowfulness on &quot;Are You a Hypnotist,&quot; and Beach Boys-ish harmonies on &quot;Do You Realize??&quot;.  That and &quot;It's Summertime&quot; come off as a bit smarmy and not as genuine as the entirety of &quot;Bulletin&quot; and the rest of the songs here, but they still contain wonderful melodies and are very listenable in their own right.  Overall, the vibe created by this record resembles REM's UP, and in a way seems the same kind of maturing, transitional record that's eventually off-putting, but soon grows on you if you give it a chance.  Hopefully it won't become as chided as that release.  My biggest complaints are that I wish they varied the tempo a bit and that they more obviously carried the battling robots concept through the entire record (It's kind of goofy but personally I liked it).  Still a terrific record, and I'll have to pick up their earlier releases one of these days :P

B000069AUI|5.0|Finally, a group of artists who have substance both lyrically and muscially.  This type of integration is few and far between among most of the current day artists. I like all the songs but specifically Warning Signs and Green Eyes.  Excellent mood music.  Get it.
B00006X06U|5.0|Joni Mitchell's TRAVELOGUE is a stunning, superlative work. <br />Capitalizing on the success of her last album, BOTH SIDES NOW, Joni has had 22 of her own pieces arranged for full orchestra by Vince Mendoza. Joni admirers probably need no further urging, so I encourage people who may not be familiar with Ms. Mitchell but love both traditional orchestral / jazz arranging and/or poetry to pick this up.<br />If you *are* familiar with the original versions of these songs, it may be a little jarring to hear them arranged in such a manner at first. Once getting past that, there is no question this is an album of startling reinterpretation. Never before has the poetic nature of Joni Mitchell's lyrics been so powerful or crystalline clear. There is never a musical arrangement that overwhelms her crucial words. It all mixes together flawlessly.<br />Every track from start to finish is a winner. However, my personal favorites are \\"Hejira\\" (with a gorgeous string arrangement taking the place of Jaco Pastorius' brilliant bass work on the 1976 original), \\"Amelia,\\" with dreamy, soaring strings and horn in place of Joni's guitar, the haunting \\"Love\\" and the perfect jazz of \\"You Dream Flat Tires\\" and \\"Be Cool.\\" <br />The packaging for the album is quite elegant & beautiful. We're treated to a full color booklet featuring various paintings of Joni's accompanied by lyrical quotes from appropriate songs. The 'Enhanced CD\\" portion accessible in a CD-ROM (via Disc One only), contains even more. Joni's latest paintings are featured in a \\"gallery\\" to browse through. <br />Also on the CD-ROM, you can read the lyrics to each song (from either disc) on it's own page and hear that song concurrently. You can't listen to all 22 songs in continuity using this feature (you have to keep clicking back or ahead), but it is amazing that so much material is housed on one CD. There is also a separate black and white booklet for the lyrics alone. <br />As someone else stated, this is music that demands attention. Be in a quiet spot when you first listen; I guarantee you will be moved. Treat yourself to this incredible journey through Joni Mitchell's life and world....and if you haven't already, pick up BOTH SIDES NOW as well!
B0000028RR|4.0|she made me listen to this album at least 20 times. i now have the song Township Rebellion in my head. It is the worst song on the album but the best. It is an incredibly mad song. if rage againts the machine made the song Township Rebellion in a serious quest to make good music than they are mad and could possibly benefit from counselling. <br />i now like all the songs because they all drive me insane. especially the one where Zac keeps shouting about american dreams at the end.<br />if i ever TRIED to make an album which is mad it probably would not come out as mad as this. but this is a good album so i am not being horrible to rage against the machine fans. i am not generally a fan of rock music but i like this.<br />if i ever saw Zac De La Rocha carted away by men in white coats i would not be surprised. not at all. he makes very scary music. <br />i will never buy my own personal copy of this album because it would confuse me to my core. guaranteed.
B00006RAKP|4.0|Anybody buying this CD will certainly be happy to have a collection beginning with &quot;Your Song&quot; and stretching through the 1990s, making this the most comprehensive of the numerous Elton John compilations available.  Unfortunately, there are numerous ommissions.  It is perhaps understandable that early album tracks like &quot;Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters&quot; and &quot;Harmony&quot; are not present here.  However, it would have been better to have dropped some of the lesser 1990s tracks and included &quot;Empty Garden&quot; (probably Elton's most emotionally charged record, with the possible exception of &quot;Someone Saved My Life Tonight&quot;), &quot;Blue Eyes,&quot; and &quot;Mama Can't Buy You Love,&quot; all of which are better than, say, &quot;Written in the Stars.&quot;  (Unlike some reviewers, however, I don't miss &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.&quot;)  In summary, you should buy this compilation, but also plan on picking up &quot;Greatest Hits 1976-1986&quot; to fill some gaps.  Those bemoaning the absence of &quot;Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds&quot; should buy the CD of &quot;Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy,&quot; which includes it as a bonus track and is one of Elton's best albums in any case.
B00004YW6I|5.0|I love this album and i love to listen to it when i drink Tetley tea because i love Tetley tea. If you do both things at the same time it is amazingly fun. The best song for me to listen to is 'the whores hustle'... there is only one song i dont enjoy to listen to and that is 'the mess we're in', it is a great song but unfortuanetly the person who broke my heart is a Thom Yorke fan so i cannot listen to it as it ruins my day. maybe one day i will get over him and listen to that song and enjoy it. i have no hard feelings against Thom Yorke he is lovely. i have all the great songs to listen to while drinking my tea. it isnt quite AS good as is this desire though because is this desire has 'the river'.
B00006RU5B|5.0|That disgusts me. I see three stars on this list , but these people are expecting this cd to be hype-on-all-tracks like rage was. You have to listen to it instead of waiting for something to happen like a big riff. This is the kickin'est cd i have ever heard, and the track &quot;Shadow on the Sun&quot; is probably one of , if not THE standout track of them, but i agree that every track stands out. I can only wait for the next one. <BR>        I seriously believe that Soundgarden fans can appreciate this more, SG being my favorite band.<br />...what's all this about the vocals being poor?...only a hyped-up rage fan. (Hear exploder and light my way)
B000002UWF|5.0|Been to many Italian weddings in my time, and, while listening to this CD, I was reminded of why Italian weddings are so much fun. Louis Prima and his band jump, jive, and wail on every track, and there are 26 on this collection. Everyone seems to be having a great time, and Keely Smith, Prima's very talented wife, belts them out with the best of them on this very satisfying CD. <BR>There's a hint of many musical styles here, including Dixieland, Jazz, Popular, and Lounge. In listening to Prima sing some jazz standards, including &quot;Basin Street Blues,&quot; &quot;I've Got You Under My Skin,&quot; and &quot;St. Louis Blues,&quot; you can hear how another New Orleans-born jazz master, Louis Armstrong, influenced him. It was Armstrong, one of the 20th century's musical pioneers, who virtually invented jazz singing (and scat singing). Prima takes that style in a different direction, with Sam Butera and The Witnesses providing the rollicking music. Of course, Prima's &quot;Just a Gigolo,&quot; &quot;Oh Marie,&quot; &quot;Buona Sera,&quot; &quot;Angelina Zooma Zooma,&quot; &quot;Jump, Jive, and Wail,&quot; and &quot;Sing, Sing, Sing&quot; are included as well. A must have.
B00006LI4S|5.0|This DVD is amazing. Classic songs reworked into a more intimate setting. For that review that said this doesnt sound like Pink Floyd, ITS NOT SUPPOSED TO! ITS DAVID GILMOUR! <BR>The music on this dvd is mature, very moving and emotional. The Floyd material is worked into such an amazing setting. If hearing PF with upright bass and a cello isnt interesting, then I dont know what is.
B00005JK8K|1.0|Windtalkers is a movie with exceptional potential.  You've all read about the plot, and it's limitless possibilities for drama and excitement.  Unfortunately, in this age of \\"Band of Brothers\\" and \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" realistic-WWII dramas, Windtalkers blows.<br />First off, the main crux of the movie concerns the battle for Saipan.  Saipan is a tropical island that was crucial to the Allies' Pacific effort in driving the Japanese back to their home islands.  John Woo shows us scenes of aerial bombings over the Saipan war theatre that rival those in Saving Private Ryan, but midway through the film, we obviously lost some funding for special effects or travel, because the battles are obviously taking place somewhere in California.  I felt like I was watching a remake of \\"M.A.S.H,\\" with the fake props, rebuilt enemy garrisons, and obviously well-used ATV roads in the Cal desert.  In fact, I saw so much sagebrush that I was hoping high students were watching, for fear that their already clouded understanding of geography would be further muddied.<br />Then there is the acting.  The gentleman who plays the Navajo windtalker (Beach?) does a great job.  In fact, he is the only bright part of the film.  Nic Cage seems to be going after an Oscar in the first five minutes of the film, but looks like he would rather escape to his movie trailer during the remainder.  I would be interested to see what movie he was set to film next, because he is obviously concentrating more on that.<br />The other characters are cliches that are predictable and nauseating.  Casting is an issue.  Who casts some guy with a stumbling French accent to play the platoon leader and commander?  And where was the possible love-story between Cage's charcter and the nurse going?  Why was Christian Slater in this?  His character isn't pivotal, and could have been played by anyone.  <br />Had Windtalkers come out, say, five years ago, it might have been decent.  But with Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers paving the way before it, it simply can't stand up.  In fact, it doesn't even come close to the historical accuracy and brilliant acting in both of those projects.
0441172717|4.0|I found this book to be quite confusing. Evertything happens very fast and then cuts to a different seen. However, I thought that it was a very well written sci-fi novel. It is full of action and suspense. It also delves very deep into religion and philosphy.  I thought that the characters were written in very good detail which is, in my opinion, the best part of the book. This a book that I would not recommend for many people. I would only recommend this for science-fiction readers that also have an interest in philosophy. Overall, this was a very well written novel and interesting novel.
1878424319|5.0|This small book is a tiny wonder. It points out four simple tenets to live by in order to turn your life around and embrace happiness.<br />At Christmas, I bought 10 of these books and gave them as gifts to my ten closest acquaintences. Some may not read this right away, for you only learn or hear when you are ready. There will come the day when curious they pick it up and read it. THEN they will understand what a real gift it is!<br />It is a short read with examples of each agreement - all the better to understand exactly what is meant. I highly recommend all of Don Miguel Ruiz' books but start reading with this one.
B000068IEU|5.0|In 1972, Wes Craven and Sean Cunningham wanted to make a horror film that would go further and be more horrific than any movie made to that day. They succeeded.<br />Two girls go out to a concert and on the way, bump into a group of escape convicts while trying to buy drugs. The group drive the girls to a nearby forest, rape, torture and kill the girls. The group then find a house and stay the night, without realising that their hosts are the parents of one of the deceased. The parents take their revenge in extreme ways.<br />That is basically the summary of the film - but the power in this film is in the viewing and for the 92 minutes, you are very much alive, on the edge of your seat and cannot tear yourself from the screen. This film is vicious, intense and every bit as extreme as you've heard (probably more so). <br />The real power of the film is the way in which its made - handheld cameras and excellent performances make you feel like you're actually there, watching it all for real, a helpless bystander to the gruesome tortures inflicted on two young girls.<br />Ultimately, for me, this is a 'perfect horror film' - it delivers all that it promises and stays with you long after you've watched it. <br />This DVD edition has a stack of extras as well as a fully uncut remastered print, so if you want to see this film, then definately buy this DVD - it's the best available. <br />Be warned though - it's no easy ride and probably will give you nightmares..<br />Enjoy!
B000068IEU|4.0|here we go again. another fine performance by the facially challenged David Hess. and THIS time he actually did the musical soundtrack. during the interviews David Hess said that people in  NY were afraid of him after seeing the movie and his likeness on the poster. Hmmmm, couldnt be that they were afraid of his ugly face, now could it?NO WAY! not an actor of David Hess's caliber. while this movie doesnt contain enough close ups of his leering looks (such as the screaming at the end of HOUSE ON THE EDGE OF THE PARK, or the roaring screaming face on the HITCH HIKE cover) he does play a likeable psychopath. and thats always a good thing. Whatchoo gonna do, when Hess-A-Mania comes staring right at you?!?
B000069AUI|5.0|When I heard Parachutes a couple of years ago, I wondered whether this band would have ever produced such a good album. This album is a smacking answer to my question. Not only is this album as good as Parachutes, but its also much better, melodically, lyrically and musically.<br />From the very first track to the last track, this album is flawless. Even after listening for the first time, I realised that this album is a masterpiece. Songs like 'In My Place' and 'The Scientist' are examples of songs that really come straight from the heart, and this is, in my opinion what makes this album so great. <br />Two other songs which stand out on this album are Politik and the title track which are both 5-star songs with such beauty that they just make you want to lay down on your bed with your headphones and forget about the rest of the world.<br />If you invest in this CD, you won't regret it.
B000002I6T|5.0|Listen to the other 30 or so people who have raved about this classic. They're right. Its a moment in time, never to be repeated, that will haunt you for the rest of your days. <br />There's nothing else like it.
B0000025OP|4.0|&quot;Planet Waves&quot; seems to have slipped into black hole between Dylan's late 60s oddities (&quot;Self Portrait,&quot; &quot;Nashville Skyline&quot;) and his so-called return to form with &quot;Blood on the Tracks.&quot; However, &quot;Planet Waves&quot; is a teriffic CD, the ONLY studio album recorded with the Band, and has a lot more to recommend it than the perennial favorite &quot;Forever Young.&quot; Indeed, it sounds like a Band record, in the best possible way, with Dylan integrating working seamlessly with the band as they had been doing for a number years--just not on record.<br />The songs are also strong, from the opener, &quot;On a Night Like This&quot; to the &quot;Wedding Song&quot;--one of Dylan's most heartfelt. A true winner. If there is any detraction it's this: did he have to record &quot;Forever Young&quot; twice?
B00006LSM3|5.0|But not before George gave one more gem to the world. He's passed on, but his music resides in an immortal realm: a number of these songs will enter Harrison's oeuvre of magical, mystical, spiritual, and cynical commentaries on our very existence.
B000002LGA|5.0|I discovered this album watching the half hour alternative video show they used to have on MTV.  I'm glad I discovered this little gem of an album.  Yes, Lou Reed says his lyrics instead of singing them, but that's okay because the music behind his voice is good.  His lyrics are on the Roger Waters power scale and this album ranks up there as one of the best.  It is a good portrait of the 80's.
B000003TA4|1.0|I hate Nirvana so much it's not even funny. One reason why I hate them is because i used to be a green day fan and i still have some green day spirit in me. If Nirvana didnt come out with Nevermind then green day would be so much more famous. another reason why I hate them is cause there music is so damn annoying. <BR>the only song i can even listen too without pukeing is teen spirit and i still hate that song. Rage against the machine now there's a good band. Zach de la rocha is one if not the best musician i have ever heard. sure the rest of the band isnt that special but they fit in perfectly. the only person i like in nirvana is david grohl because the foo fighters are pretty good. listen it's fine if you like nirvana, a lot of my friends like nirvana i just hate them. Listen to nirvana if you must but I strictly dont recomend it.
B000068TPN|5.0|I didn't like this movie on my first viewing.  I was pretty depressed at the end of it because I was thinking of these motivated soldiers that were being screwed by the politicians from the beginning.  Then I went to see it with my mom and I saw it in a different light.  It is not your typical Vietnam War movie.  The soldiers are actually motivated.  The officers are not portrayed as glory seeking medal hunters (except for one).  The soldiers aren't high on dope.  The Vietnamese actually were portrayed as humans.  All in all, a very well done movie.
B000002UAO|1.0|Norwegian Wood and In My Life are good songs - give John Lennon credit.<br />The rest of this album is very forgettable, populated by You Won't See Me, Word, Michelle, Girl, Run For Your Life and the awful What Goes On. <br />The Beatles were in transition here, as the Fab Four sound was evolving into that to be heard on Revolver and Sgt. Pepper. This album is kind of a low point.  1-star.
B00006SFBD|3.0|Orchid, Morningrise, My Hearse.., Still Life, and Blackwater Park-all 5-Star albums which in their whole demonstrate the artistic aggression and sheer emotion abundent in the creative sphere of Opeth.  Now comes Deliverence.  Boring, redundant, and if i had to guess, rushed through.  The beauty of opeth is that they can merge so effectively, death metal with progressive accoustics, the result being numerous epic ballads that cannot be classified as music but rather a listening experience.  There is none of that on this album.  while I consider myself to be a death metal fan first and foremost, it is strange that I should bash this album so much but I just think that it has gone so downhill from their previous releases.  The bad thing is that there are no changes throughout the music which makes for a very dull listening experience when the songs are ten to thirteen minutes long.  What little accoustic interludes are evident are boring and lack a natural flow and fail to add any atmosphere to the music.  Also lacking are the clean vocals which sound drowned out and just thrown in for the sake of throwing them in.  However, this is not a bad album to speak of it is just disappointing.  There are some nice guitar leads and solos combined with very grindy riffs, one being the almost sludgy progression through Master's Apprentice which had a Morbid Angel feel to it.  There is still a good bit of melody which is another sigh of relief for fans such as myself of the whole Sweedish Melodic Death Metal Scene.  This album is to be followed in March by Dmanation, which is to have all clean vocals and a scarce amount of electric guitars.  I am looking forward to hearing that but i am sure that unon hearing it will conclude that by merging the two albums together it could have been the next Orchid, meaning that it could have been better.
B00005QG9J|5.0|This Cd is outstanding like all of the other Incubus cds. Each one is special and has its own sound that you will never forget. Here are all the songs from Morning view and a little bit of my opinion on them.<br />Nice To Know You 9/10 - The chorus is catchy. I like how it goes from slow to pure rock. It is sort of long though.<br />Circles 7.5/10 - I sometimes skip over this one, but I guess it is not that bad. It has great sound effects.<br />Wish You Were Here 10/10 - The opening to this song is the best part. Throughout the whole song it makes you feel realxed, happy, and a little sad. I love this song! Sounds like the beach.<br />Just a Phase 9/10 - The intro is a little long, but the lyrics are creative. I love how at the end the mood of the song turns angry and loud from its more mellow start.<br />11 AM 8/10 - This is a great song to listen to when you wake up, because that is sort of what it happens to be about. <br />Blood on the Ground 8/10  -  Has a more hard rock sound to it. This is an angry song with meaningful lyrics.<br />Mexico 7.5/10 -  This song is very slow. The guitar does sound good though.<br />Warning 9.5/10 - I listen to this song when I am upset and mad. It has a good message in it. I love the lyrics.<br />Echo 8.5/10 - The beginning sounds like the beach and is soothing. It is a cute love song.<br />Have You Ever 9/10 - The song title describes this pretty much. It has a great sound overall.<br />Are You In? 8.5/10 - This seems to be a great party song. Most of the lyrics are the song title. It is catchy.<br />Under My Umbrella 10/10 - The song title may sound strange but this song is very powerful and meaningful. I love the chorus. In the song it is about not having others run your life. <br />Aqueous Transmission 8.5/10 - Very peaceful! This is taboo. It has a Middle-Eastern sound. The frog noises at the end are a bit scary.<br />Overall this sis a great cd. It is &quot;must-have&quot;.
0064471837|5.0|I picked up this book at a book fair two years ago. I didn't know what it was about, but it looked interesting, so I decided to buy it. It only took me about a week to read, and I was blown away. Garth Nix has a wonderful way with language and imagery; you can picture the landscapes and the monsters alike. Likewise, I was thrilled to learn of the existence of not one but two sequals. This is a book that you don't want to be over, you get to the end and find yourself wanting more. It is an amazing read and one of my favorite books.
0316921173|3.0|As I understand it, Wallace wrote this book as his college thesis (by chance, my roommate had classes with him at Amherst). This made perfect sense to me as I plodded my way through this formidable tome. There is no doubt that we are dealing here with a brilliant mind, of absolutely astounding range and razor sharp wit. And a fine writer, who has great command of the language and a stupendous vocabularly. However, it seems painfully clear to me that he focused way too much of his energy on creating an original post-modern novel and not enough on developing a truly engaging story. This is not to say that I was not interested. I was. But I can't say that I really cared about or empathized with any of the characters in any profound way. <br />I'm no stranger to long, complex and non-linear fiction writing. Indeed, I welcome the challenge and originality of it. However, only so far as the characters and story are not sacrificed for the benefit of the form. Unfortunately, the 21 year old David Foster Wallace fell prey to this. From what I've heard (heard, mind you, as I have not read any of his later work), his subsequent writing is far superior to this in it's coherence, whether linear or non-.<br />One of the other reader reviews mentioned that after you finish the book, if you go back and reread the early sections, previously insignificant-seeming passages take on a whole new meaning. I agree with this and it is a rather clever phenomenon. However, it does not make up for a really average story and overdone post-modern themes. <br />OK, I won't ramble on. Basically, I think this book is overrated in general. And I'd prefer on any day: Pynchon, Doestoevsky, Tom Robbins, Umberto Eco, Herman Hesse, or Michael Chabon.<br />(Actually, regarding the latter of those above: I think Chabon is what Wallace and Jonathan Franzen would be if they would just loosen the reins a tad on form and let the story unfurl a bit more effortlessly. Indeed, Chabon's writing, while complex in its own right, comes across as elegant and effortless, and offers up richly developed characters that you can almost touch. Whereas, with the other two, I get the feeling they're desperately trying to control something all the time.)<br />But
B00006J3WH|5.0|I've become a big fan of Buffy, just starting in September, I watched most of the 4th season, all of the 5th and 6th, and I love it!! The musical episode, which what this cd is based on, was so funny! Anyways, here's the track review.<BR> The track list on the cd is different, here it is:<br /> 1. Going Through The Motions: 10/10 Gellar sings this one, with some vampires from the show, and a victim, really cool song!!<br /> 2. I've Got A Theory/Bunnies: 9.5/10 The whole group, even Willow combines to make a great song! Enya's part is so funny, for Bunnies, cause she's so afraid of them!<br /> 3. Mustard: 7/10 Okay, as funny as this is, it's not worth any better, too silly!<br /> 4. Under Your Spell: 10/10 Great song by Tara(Amber Benson), sang to Willow(Alyson Hannigon)!<br /> 5. I'll Never Tell: 10/10 This is so funny! By Xander(Nicolas Brendon) and Enya(Emma Caufield)!<br /> 6. Parking Ticket: 7.5/10 Better then they got the mustard out, but it's kinda bad, unknown woman sings this song!<br /> 7.

Something To Sing About: 8/10 This is the actual version, kinda good, I like Buffy's better, it's so much funnier.
B00003CX5P|4.0|The Good Things  *Smashingly good special effects.  *Cool battle scenes.  *Cool racing scene.  *Probably the best lightsaber duels ever made.  *Imaginative settings.  *Excellent music.    The Bad Things  *Pretty awkward acting.  *Long and slow-moving when there is no action.  *Parts of the story seem unlikely.  *Seems childish in some ways.    Now that my excitement over this release is over, I can look at this film objectively and say that it is probably the worst of the series.  Good special effects can't even mask the poor acting and the awkward storyline.  It is moderately enjoyable, and is somewhat essential to the series, but it is flawed.
0780627024|5.0|I love this movie! This is where I just fell in love with Reese Witherspoons acting. She's now my favorite actress. I'd never noticed her before this. She is superb! The movie makes you think about what is important and what we take for granted. It's not so deep it ruins everything. It is a real feel good movie! I LOVE IT!
B00003CX5P|5.0|The one thing that probably killed this movie was the expectations.  I myself partially expected a lot of stuff to happen right off the bat - but I was still amazed at the detailed array of special effects.  I think most other people weren't fazed, and even these days I've been thinking that this film does have a few flaws.<br />The biggest negative thing of this film is Jar Jar Binks, of course.  His antics can be embarrasing (but fortunately, this gut-wrenching feeling wears off after the trillionth time it's viewed.  I even have to be honest when I say that some of his goofiness is a bit funny...maybe mesa turning Gungan.  Doh!!!)<br />But the film itself has a good amount of action and adventure, witty (but sometimes flatulent) humor, and well orchestrated fight scenes.  The special effects are supreme for its time, and add a great amount of detail and flare to the space battles, the vast variety of aliens, and the immense ground battles.  The lightsaber duel between Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Darth Maul is probably the best of the entire series.  The music score for the film is splendid.  The characters are well established (the TV spots on the DVD set actually embellish the characters).  The story line is well-crafted and sets up the next films rather well.<br />This DVD set includes extra footage reinserted into the feature.  It's not much, but still adds to the grandure of the film.  This disc set has some splendid deleted scenes (completed just for this release), and some interesting documentaries and galleries.<br />I'd say that despite its almost childish style, THE PHANTOM MENACE inaugerates the Star Wars series with gradure, a large scope, and a good story.  It's the start of a new era in Star Wars films.
B00006YXEK|4.0|In spite of Macca's regular releases over the years this one seems to have more of the feel of a new Fabs release then any since the early 70s. I think all Fab fans and Harrison devotees desperately wanted this to be good and I for one have not been disappointed. I know at times it sounds a little to Wilbury / ELO for comfort (eg Any Road & Rising Sun in particular) but I can live with that as basically we have 11 new well crafted & sung Harrisongs.<br />As to be expected George does not pull any punches lyrics wise  you do not need to listen too carefully to hear the mans messages and philosophical thoughts, but George was rarely one to use his songs for the simple I love you type of message (in fact I think the only set of lyrics in this category on the album are those written by Hoagy Carmichael, Devil & Deep Blue Sea). Some are even funny, eg Vatican Blues.<br />I know you can argue that its easy for someone in his position to preach but why not; at least his message is a bit more meaningful then much stuff released today.<BR> <BR>Musically the album is a treat, the songs themselves are at least very catchy, and at best very good eg Pisces, Brainwashed itself, Stuck Inside A Cloud. Youll soon be humming most of them after only a few plays. Georges voice comes across nice and clear on most tracks. Obviously difficult to know exactly where George left of and Dhani and Jeff Lyn took over (Devil & Deep Blue Sea being I think the exception where its all George and his chums like Jools Holland, Joe Brown & co) but mostly I think they have done a good job.<br />If this turns out to be the last word from George then I am very happy with Brainwashed. <br />God Bless You George, rest in peace.

B000001GQP|3.0|This is supposedly an overall excellent rendering of Carmina Burana. I happen to have 3 different recordings of C.B. including this one, so I have had the chance to compare the 3 side by side. I like C.B. a lot because I used to sing as a baritone in a choir that participated in several performances of Carmina Burana. Dieskau is no doubt excellent being one of the top lieder baritones in the world. But at least in my humble opinion, he is not as good as Jonathan Summers in the EMI recording with Ricardo Muti conducting C.B. That doesn't mean Summers is a better baritone, but for Carmina Burana I think his voice does sound better. While still being a soft and beautiful voice when needed, he has much stronger and powerful fortes than Dieskau when needed too, way much more character, and those are very important aspects of the baritone part in this piece.<br />On top of the excellent performance by Summers, Arleen Auger (in that same recording with Ricardo Muti conducting) sings arguably one of the most beautiful and effortless \\"Dulcisimas\\" ever sung. In comparison, the soprano in this Jochum recording screeches a horrible Dulcisima. Also, Ms. Auger's long note in \\"Amor volat undique\\" when singing \\"Cordis in custodiaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...\\" is arguably one of the longest and most beautifully steadily and effortlessly uninterrupted notes ever sung. The soprano in Jochum's recording stops in the middle to breathe, as pretty much all other sopranos in the world do (actually I haven't yet heard any other recorded or live performance of any other soprano singing that note all the way without stopping in the middle the way Auger's does). Ms. Auger makes the complete soprano role in Carmina Burana seem to be the easiest and most natural thing to sing in the world, when it's an extremeley hard challenge for any soprano. You have to listen to these two recordings, Jochum and Muti, one after the other to hear the difference between not just a comfortable, but a perfect soprano voice for the role, and one that is clearly struggling to produce the highest note in the Dulcisima, making it sound way less than pretty.<br />The volume levels in the Ricardo Muti recording is the only significant drawback. The orchestra in several ocassions sounds way too loud. The singers do perform excellent performances as I've already mentioned, and I think the choirs as well, but their volume levels got recorded quite low with respect to the orchestra, not appropriately balanced in that respect. The recording engineers messed up this pretty bad, you need to have your remote at hand when listening to the EMI-Muti record to keep the playback volume under control to either not hurt your ears when the orchestra goes loud, and to really enjoy the solos when their turns come up.<br />I personally prefer the sound of the tenor in the Jochum recording than in the Muti one, but that is the least important solo in Carmina Burana, lasting only a couple of minutes, and it's just a humorous role (voice of a duck getting roasted). Overall sound balance Jochum's recording beats Muti's, but solo performances in my opinion clearly go the other way around.<br />I think if you really love and enjoy C.B., it is a good idea to consider getting at least 3 recordings: this one conducted by Jochum, the one by Muti, and there is another good one conducting Andre Previn. I've read that one is also highly praised, but I haven't had a chance to listen to it (planning to get it very soon to add it to my Carmina Buranas).<br />In any case, make sure you stay dead far away from the C.B. conducted by Eugene Ormandy. It's very dissapointing in most musical aspects, at least compared to the Jochum and Muti options (putting aside volume issues in the case of Muti). I have a SACD player so I made the mistake to buy the E.Ormandy C.B. in SACD format, it was a complete waste of money. Unfortunately it was in Best Buy, no return policy once the disk package had been opened.<br/>Conclusion, this one by Jochum is a good way to go, but not the only one, and not the best one for certain aspects of Carmina Burana, in particular the soprano. I'd suggest don't stick to this one alone. You would be missing to much sound beauty if you don't listen to (at least) Arleen Auger and Jonathan Summers at the appropriate volume level in the EMI recording, Ricardo Muti conducting.
0679737456|4.0|This is a memoir by one of the first black female students at an elite prep school in New Hampshire, in the early 70's. The biggest psychological issue that come clearest through in this book, is the author's feelings of severe insecurity about operating in this rich white academic environment. She was ambitious to outshine everybody, of whatever race at the school and she ended up a neurotic mess, full of deep dissapointment that she did not. The author makes her deep confusion clear as she struggled with guilt about wheather she was betraying her working class black background to partake in the immense luxuries provided by the school. All the while so many hardworking working class people, like those she knew growing up, were deprived of that which the rich white snobs at the school took for granted. She seems to feel longer guilty about all this; she's proud of who she is and what she's gone through. Also of interest is her apparent deep fear of her white classmates, even though she developed many friendships. <br />One gets the impression that the author may not, when she published this book, have completely resolved her feelings. <br />For the most part, this is a well-told story (except towards the end). I particularly liked the contrast between her artistocratic life at St. Paul and her life when she came back to her working class home for the summer before senior year and worked at the Dinner. There she met Booker, the pot-smoking, tough-guy head cook and reveals him to be a tragic figure.
0792840461|4.0|I love this version of the movie! Why you may ask! Because my grandfather is in it! Yes he only has a small part but hey its something ill never forget about him. He plays the security guard who was  seen walking down the stairs. He worked for Shawmutt Bank in Boston, and they were shooting a scene there at the bank and needed an extra to play the part but were running low on budget so  my grandfather did it for free. I love this version of the movie as well as the new one- but this is unforgettable to me!

B000002UAX|5.0|For any lover of music, let alone a Beatles' fan, the White Album is a MUST HAVE. After a couples of years of experimenting with eastern experimentational music, the album features the Fab Four back to their rock'n'roll best. The double CD has a vast range of songs; short and long, fast and slow - there isn't really a structure to the album. It contains world-famous hits that everybody knows, like 'Birthday', 'Revolution' and 'Back in the USSR'. McCartney songs like 'Blackbird' and 'Martha my Dear' are among the most beautiful of Beatles songs ever written. But my favourites are Lennon's 'Sexy Sadie' - about the Maharishi's supposed love affair with a minor, and 'Happiness is a Warm Gun' - a song composed of five different parts about drugs and sexual desires amongst other things. 'The Continuing Story of Bungalo Bill' and 'Rocky Raccoon' are classics too. Go out and get it!
B00006LIRI|3.0|Well, the Greatest Hits chosen are debatable, but save for Mysterious Ways, they're all pretty good.  Really like the new &quot;Electrical Storm&quot; song.  I don't agree with the remixes from &quot;Pop&quot; being put on, but oh well.  I had to get it because I love U2 and want all their albums.<br />If you are a big fan, I imagine you'll get this version, just &quot;to have&quot; it, with the B-Sides and the DVD, but for all others, I would recommend getting only the single disk greatest hits.  <br />Frankly speaking, the B-Sides STINK and the dvd is a bit of a yawner.  Nearly all the B sides are boring Zooropa remixes!  Too bad there were not many outtakes from All that You Can't Leave Behind.  The dvd is not really produced, just a bunch of scenes sloppily slapped together.<br />So I'm a bit disappointed.
B00006JIA4|5.0|I dare you not to be a Queen fan after buying this CD set. This is probably the best Greatest Hits compilation I have ever seen. It includes all their best work, without leaving one or two of the best songs off, so that you have to buy a whole other CD just to get them, a novelty in today's market. Queen had a very unique style, created by four very talented men. Freddie Mercury, particularly, is one of the most talented rock singers I've heard. His untimely death was a great loss to rock music, curtailing what should have been a successful career continuing through today. The music Queen created has something for everyone, from rock 'n roll anthems, to dance flavored pop, to easy listening ballads, to swelling show-type tunes.<br />All of the songs in the collection are good, including nothing that could be classed as \\"filler\\". Disc 1 contains their hits up to about 1980, while Disc 2 covers their eighties hits, all of which are pleasantly representative of their era. I even like the unpopular \\"Greatest Hits 3\\". I like the samples of the band members' solo work, and the covers/samples of Queen's music by other artists, the standout of which is \\"Somebody to Love\\" by George Michael + Queen. I even like the remix of \\"Under Pressure\\", and I am someone who doesn't like remixes (especially when they do it to a favorite song), but this one is actually good, and contains some vocal variations from Freddie. And since I'm feeling kind today, I'll even say that the Wyclef Jean number on \\"Another One Bites the Dust\\" is interesting, and shows Queen represented in yet another form of music, hip-hop.<br />This is a great collection that is also a great bargain, especially for those new to Queen who want to sample the best stuff before diving into their pockets for the rest of the catalogue. So buy it, but be careful, because Freddie Mercury and Queen have converted me, and I'm now compelled to buy the rest of their cds; You just might feel the same!
0316666343|3.0|The book just doesn't deliver.  A hugely dramatic beginning, the rape, described in a way that one can't help but feel the horror and pain, and then - nothing.  The family and friends have to get on withy their lives, and it just drags and drags, because we don't really care about them, in the way we cared for the young victim.<BR>What was all the hype about?
B00006LSM3|2.0|Much has been said about George Harrison's \\"stock\\" sound, which began to appear in its completed form around the time of the 'Dark Horse' sessions. Though some fans of the Beatles I know are driven away from the solo Harrison stock sound, I prefer to accept it and then evaluate Harrison's work within that framework. The Harrison stock sound is very much evident here, which at this point should not be surprising. Harrison himself conceded once in an interview that his approach to his own material was to be likened to a pair of pants; pants are what they are, no reason to reinvent \\"pants\\" in such a manner that they lose their functionality and thus their usefulness and purpose.<br />What did surprise me, however, was the musical flatness of the material, especialy for a project which Harrison must have conceived as his final statement, expecting it would be a posthumous release. <br />The cd is dominated by mid-tempo numbers, all of which occupy undistinguished melodic territory, even in relationship to each other. I knew there was something wrong when I found the best track to be, by far, 'Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea', a nice cover of an old standard, but which of course cannot be attributed to Harrison's own writing talents. <br />The album finishes with a homage to Harrison's long-standing involvement with Eastern mystic religion, fading away with Harrison chanting lines of Krishna, in an obvious attempt to leave the listener his parting thoughts as to what was most important to him in his waning days. <br />Personal document, yes. Distinguished Harrison worthy of his own vast talent, no-- 'Brainwashed' is a musically flat piece of work  <BR>which I find a weak and disappointing way for George to have gone out. Even Harrison's lesser-known works such as 'George Harrison', and 'Extra Texture' surpass this one.
B00006CXXU|3.0|While many may not appreciate Christina Aguilera's abrupt and very bizarre image flip-flop (from sugary blonde virgin to lady of the night in 90 seconds flat), this album deserves to be judged separately, simply because it is one of the most uneven, eclectic, experimental, and interesting albums released this year. <br />01.  Stripped (Intro) *:  A rather pompous Aguilera informs us that she's \\"sorry you can't define me/sorry I break the mold\\".  Which is, of course, a pardox, because Christina has, in fact, compiled her new record out of spare parts from Pink's M!ssundaztood, Alicia Keys's Songs In A Minor, and, yes, Britney's eponymous third album.  This intro certainly does not break the mold -- it is completely average, as intros go, and entirely useless.<br />02.  Can't Hold Me Down ***:  Seemingly a hip-hop version of Destiny's Child's  \\"Independent Women, Part I\\", this is an intriguing cut simply because it showcases Aguilera's ability to adapt to hip-hop.  Rather bland \\"girl power\\" lyrics, though.<br />03. Walk Away **:  A power ballad.  Christina oversings this one, her voice sounding strained in some sections.  It sounds about 10 years too late.<br />04. Fighter **:  An interesting foray into modern rock, but sounds a bit overblown and overproduced.  Aguilera is no Pat Benatar.  <br />06. Infatuation ***:  A slinky Latin dance beat envelopes Christina's warm vocals in this knockoff of Madonna's \\"La Isla Bonita.\\"  Catchy.<br />08.  Loving Me 4 Me ***:  Aguilera sounds most at home on this track, a slow, jazzy ballad.  She abstains from oversinging.<br />09.  Impossible ****:  This Alicia Keys -penned stunner sounds unfinished and unpolished -- and is all the better for it.  It's a jazz song, a torch song, and a ballad, featuring exquisite vocals and a nice guest spot from Ms. Keys.<br />11.  Beautiful ***:  Sounds like every \\"what's on the inside counts\\" ballad that has preceded it, but enjoyable to listen to.<br />12.  Make Over ****:  A wonderful slice ofretro 60s power pop.  Sounds like a fusion of Madonna's \\"Beautiful Stranger\\" and Tommy James and the Shondells.  Addictive.<br />13.  Cruz **:  Average power ballad.<br />14.  Soar ***:  Gospel influences this sweeping ballad.  Beautiful production.<br />15.  Get Mine, Get Yours ***:  A sexy R&B song.  Incredibly carnal, almost excessively so, but still an enjoyable listen.<br />16.  Dirrty ***:  More successful at what it sets out to accomplish than most would like to admit.  A very harsh and uncompromsing backbeat frames this club track, the first single (and first failure) from this album.  It's well orchestrated but ultimately soulless.<br />19.  I'm OK *:  Christina took the 'abused as a child' cliché and combined it with a guitar and solemn vocals.  Completely out of touch with the rest of the album, this feels very exploitative and very insincere.<br />20.  Keep On Singing My Song *:  An interminable six minute showcase for Aguilera's often needless vocal gymnastics, similar in theme to \\"Soar.\\"<BR>  <BR>Aguilera is beginning to learn the value of subtlety, but she has not yet understood the value of selection when it comes to producing an album.  At 77 minutes (!), this album feels epic in the wrong sense of the word -- half of it might have been excised and the result would have been a more concise, focussed, and thematically resonant work.  As it stands, she deserves credit for her experimentation, even if a lot of it should have remained unreleased.
B000002UAU|5.0|Maybe I'm a little biased because it was my first album, but I think this is the best Beatles CD. Sgt. Peppers contains some of the best and most famous  Beatles songs ever written. As soon as I heard that crunching guitar solo to start off the opening track, I was completely hooked. It then leaps into the magical 'Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds'. 'Within You Without You' is my favourite eastern-flavoured Beatles song. 'Lovely Rita' is fantastic, one of my favourites. But the best is saved for last, with the brilliant and haunting 'Day in the Life'. Superb album.
B000001ELR|5.0|Gene and Paul engineered the Bass and Drums on this album to break anyones eardrums who listened to it.  It is in reality the first metal album of KISS's and one of the best ones IMO.  Very powerful songs on this album, only one soft ballad (I Still Love You, but its a good song as well).  Tracks 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 will leave your ears begging for mercy.  A Must Have.
B000005RTG|5.0|Ritchie Blackmore left the band in 1974, but before he left he recommanded to his purple friends the great TOMMY BOLIN.<BR>And great he was.One of the finest, original and diversified guitarist of all time-check his solo albums teaser and private eyes or Billy Cobham's Spectrum.<BR>Blackmore's departure left a big open door to COVERDALE and HUGHES love for funk, we certainly are very far from IN ROCK or even BURN, but still the music sounds great, different but great.<BR>And even with Blackmore gone, this album is somehow heavier and more consistant than STORMBRINGER.<BR>Comin' Home, Drifter, Lady Luck, Dealer rock like hell.I Need Love, Gettin Tighter lean more towards the funk side.<BR>You keep on moving is a masterpiece-once again the magic of Coverdale and Hughes voices join for the best.<BR>This time around and its road companion Owed to G, a slow piano-vocal track and an instrumental playground for Tommy, are quite unusual for Purple but make their point.<BR>COME TASTE THE BAND is the only studio album with BOLIN, it was full of promises...well at least it makes it unique and unforgettable.
B00006JDVV|4.0|What I expected: a newly made, somewhat flashy, B movie<br />What I got: a newly made, somewhat flashy, B+ movie<br />  The effects are really good despite what some of the reviewers have stated. The realism of the Dragon's movements are pretty natural and you can tell they spent alot of time with the CGI. There is a lack of visuals, but this is not a blockbuster movie, so I forgive. The problems lie in some of the peripheral actors abilities to make me believe their performances, some story holes here and there, and a lack of funding. I thought several times \\"I wish they had spent $10 million more on this movie\\".<br /><br />  With that said, I liked it alot and was surprised at how involved I had become with the story. McConaughey actually gave a stellar performance (I'm not normally a fan of him) and Bale was okay but a little forced. It's a great tale of Dragon Slayers mixed with modernism and apocalypse, enjoy. No buyers remorse so far.
1573921394|1.0|This book, along with the writings of Karl Marx, is responsible for most of the economic misery of the 20th century.  Still, reading this, along with the essential &quot;The Failure of the New Economics&quot; by Henry Hazlitt, will give the reader an excellent insight as to why Japan has failed, and will continue to fail, to get out of the moribund economic state it has been languishing in for over the past 10 years.
B00005Y228|5.0|I didnft know KYLIE until I listened to &quot;Can't Get You out of My Head&quot; on a TV show. At that time, I thought she was a new singer because the sound was very fresh and rhythm was jaunty. However, in the 80fs many of her songs were hits and they too were dance and pop music numbers.<BR>The singles &quot;Can't Get You out of My Head&quot; and &quot;Love At First Sight&quot; both rank in the Billboard Top40 singlefs chart. <BR>On this album, the track I like the best is gfeverh. This song is like a 1980fs dance/pop track. The title is gfeverh, but the synthesizer sound is smooth and cool. It is unfortunate that this title hasnft been released as a single.<BR>However, although all the tracks are dance pop, they are different from Euro beat. I think this album will please a person who dislikes Euro beat too.
B00006JDVV|1.0|I really wanted to like this movie. The previews all seem to depict a very compelling film, but his was not the case. Sad to say, but the fact that Matthew McConaughey is in it was not a redeeming quality. He does an excellent job playing his character but I found myself rewinding the dvd to listen to his line repeated times as his speech was just so in coherent.<br />The special effect in the movie were top notch, but I feel the need to point out several obvious flaws which ruined the movie.<br />First off, where is all this fuel coming from for these tanks and the chopper? I am no expert on the fuel consumption of tanks in the U.S military, but I've been told it is about 4 gallons per mile.........and I did not get that backwards either. In adition, I don't think I need to speculate on the fuel comsumption of that chopper. Not once in the movie did I see anyone refuel ANYTHING, nor did I see any supplies being carried, stocked, or unstocked by the general and his men. Remeber when Matthew McConaughey first gets to the castle and states his men are low on supplies and ammo....well they didn't have squat in the castle either.<br />Also, they are fighting a race of intelligent dragons that seemingly feed on ash, which is why they fry everything to a crisp. We all gotta eat, but ask any biology teacher why things burn. When you burn a piece of wood or a tasty human....the burning is actually a release of energy from the decomposition of the material being burned. When all the energy is comsumed, what you have is carbon ash, the base element of all life on earth. Now think about this-If a creature eats carbon ash, what energy is there to metabolize from it? This was nothing more than an excuse to make the dragons hostile and an insult to anyone with a middle school education. I also cite the numerous times the dragons seems to fry everything with their napalm breath and then just fly away. Like aren't you hungry?<br />Why is the male dragon so easy to find? I mean whygo to London to kill him. Seems all you have to do is head towards London and he comes and meets you 60 miles out of town. I think the sole male dragon in the entire species would be spending more time propagating his race than fighting humans. The poor female dragons must be so bored not getting in on the action. Seemingly, the male dragon seems to be the agressor to make the movie end that much quicker because it would take too long to find him.<br />Well, enough bashing for me. I did seriously enjoy 1 aspect of the movie. The inventive way they thought of to fight dragons with modern day military vehicles and aircraft was well though out and pretty darn cool I must admit. Besides this, the movie pretty much sucked.<br />That's my 2 cents. Cya!
B00006G8LB|4.0|Yet another comic book hero makes it to the big screen. Several years back there was talk of James Cameron directing a feature based on the SPIDER-MAN comic after all the hype of his megabudget pukefest TITANIC. Finally this year the movie was made flesh under the direction of Sam \\"Evil Dead\\" Raimi, who is no stranger to comic book territory having directed DARKMAN.<BR>I was pleasantly surprised when I saw SPIDER-MAN. Apparently this is loyal to the comic book (I've only owned 2 SPIDER-MAN comics in my lifetime), but what you get is so much more than a live action graphic novel.<BR>Tobey MacGuire is perfectly cast as the nebbish high school student Peter Parker who is bitten by a radioactive spider and as a result inherits spider- like powers which he finds he has to use to save his city from the wrath of the menacing Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe, in another effectively slimy performance)-whose secret identity happens to be that of one the man at the local paper he works for, which also assigns him the Spider-Man story.<BR>And of course there's the foundations laid for Parker's relationshop with MJ (Kirsten Dunst). Excellent visual effects and a story in which the characters are given a chance to develop without compromising on the expected stunt seqences make SPIDER-MAN one of the best comic book adaptations ever made. Plus you get to see Dunst in a wet t-shirt. Huh huh huh.
B0000029DD|2.0|I bought this CD because I heard &quot;Hallelujah&quot; on &quot;The West Wing&quot; and really loved it. Still do, but the rest of the CD is either so so or noise. For those who think he has an amazing voice, have your hearing checked, as his voice is average at best.
B00003CX5P|5.0|I love the star wars series. This is one of my favorites because of the pod racing. It also has great sound and makes it feel like your there watching the race. This is a great movie!
B00005RY7X|5.0|This album is one of the best I've ever encountered.  The lyrics are simple and easy to memorize, and most of the music tends to sound alike (in many the same ways that dance music tends to blend together) but in this album, you don't care.  It is just fun to let go and listen to.  The shift from keyboards to drums on Ready to Die is tailor made to have you head start banging in time.  I caught his live show this past month in Spokane, WA and I will absolutely make every attempt to see him on every tour.  I've never seen anyone genuinely have so much fun every time he takes the stage.  I was excited to see him on Saturday Night live, but watching him on TV is absolutely nothing compared to actually being on stage singing the songs with you arm around Andrew.  I've never seen anyone sing with a fan on their shoulders until this show.  The guy puts on the greatest show on the planet and everyone should see it.  I know casual listeners who are hooked on Andrew WK (and I mean they have to have an IV of I Get Wet plunged into their arms at all times).  I can't wait until the new album, and I will be in line for the party when that comes out.  Rock on Andrew WK and live life to the fullest everyone.
B00004THAY|4.0|From the opening notes of the first ever B.B. King and Eric Clapton duet album; you can tell that it has power. You hear the unmistakable guitar techniques, and vocals of probably the 2 greatest electric blues artists ever. From the dynamic opener; 'Riding With The King', to the acoustic effort: 'Worried Life Blues', you would think that this would be one of the greatest blues albums ever. <br />Well almost; there are some washed down clunkers on here: 'Marry You', 'Help the Poor'; but you can just skip through thoughs two. But the rest of the record shows a brilliance and strength that is sadly forgotten in most contempary music.
B00003ZA8Y|4.0|Telarc SACD is a very good recording. 5 stars.<BR>Previous reviewer wrote,&quot;Not having been exposed to Monty Alexander previously, I was worried this cd would be &quot;elevator&quot; music- unpalatable piano renditions of an artist that I very much like.&quot;...and then said he was pleasantly surprised.  I was not.  Elevator music compared to the real thing. 3 stars.
B00006M183|5.0|Upon first listening to Riot Act, I was overwhelmingly disappointed. I didnt know what the hell I was listening to. To me, it didnt sound like pearl jam. I love PJ too much however to just chaulk RA as a terrible album. Then it hit me... As I began to read along with Eddies lyrics I was moved to a place not since visited since the days of Vs. Not that this album sounds anything like Vs., but Eddie was finally singing about personal stuff again. About love lost, and love found. About how ... up politics are. Finally, the emotion of PJ was back. The album is one of their longest, with 14 full-tracks and the beautifully sung 1 minute \\"ARC\\". It rocks, it mellows, it moves, but most of all, it has emotion in it. PJ's heart was in this album, something that had been missing from the last. Buy this album! You will not regret it!

I've seen Radiohead live before on this tour, and can say that all the songs here are done(to my liking)better than their original renditions...especially the title song and 'Spinning Plates'. My only questionable critique of this is that it should have been longer and included some of their past great songs, however, those like me who love the direction in which the band is going, will love this......and those who love great live performances will love this.
B00005MNP7|5.0|Eat to the Beat is my favorite Blondie recording because it was a return to their punk roots! After the huge sucess of Parallel Lines &amp; it's slick production, this was so refreshing! The styles range from punk to pop to anthem, with the title track, Union City &amp; Dreaming! The vocals are as only Deborah Harry can deliver them, beautifully!!
B00006CXSS|5.0|I wanted to watch this mini-series when it was released on HBO, but couldn't seem to work my schedule so that I could watch each part of the series.  So, after I missed the first part, I decided to wait until it came out on DVD.  It seemed like a long arduous wait, but the product released made it all worthwhile.  <br />Not only is this mini-series one of the most exhilarating war stories ever told, it is told by the courageous men of Easy Company themselves. When you watch and listen to the veterans talk about their experiences (at the beginning of each part) and then watch the story unfold as they go through basic training and end the war at Obersalzberg (Eagles Nest), you feel a certain gratitude towards these men and the sense that the words \\"Thank You\\" just aren't enough.   <br />You will see how brotherhoods are formed, the cruelties of war (yes, we were cruel also), and many of the sad misfortunes that go along with war.  This isn't just a mini-series for entertainment purposes, it's a documentary. <br />The six DVD set comes in a collector's tin and folds out with five of the DVDs that have the ten part story on them and one additional documentary DVD.  I promise you, buy it and it will be something that you watch over and over again.
B00005R8FI|5.0|Mick Taylor's decision to quit the Bluesbreakers for the Rolling Stones in May 1969 consolidated John Mayall's reputation as a mentor for new talent, but left him without a band. His response was to recruit two experienced session musicians - Jon Mark and Johnny Almond - and to use them, and remaining bassist Steve Thompson, to push his music into new areas of jazz-blues fusion. Dispensing with a drummer, he immediately put this \\"revolutionary\\", and in the end short lived line-up on the road, recording \\"The Turning Point\\" at the Fillmore East only two months later.     Viewed initially as a gimmick, the lack of drums was in fact key to the clear, intimate sound Mayall was seeking. Structured to allow virtuoso playing, his highly atmospheric songs are driven along by the bass and acoustic guitars, with instrumental solos emerging from and gliding above their intricate backing rhythms. Mayall's vocals, guitar & harmonica underpin some excellent blues and R&B, while Almond's inspired sax & flute breaks lift several numbers into the realms of pure jazz. As the Melody Maker commented at the time, \\"the range of sounds and moods they obtain is staggering\\", but the group's most remarkable feature is their seemingly effortless interaction and the drifting, almost distant, feel this stimulates.     The ecstatic response of the New York crowd mirrors my own reaction on seeing the band a few weeks earlier in the slightly less exalted surroundings of the Slough Adelphi. Standing in a circle, with simple lighting, low amplification, no drummer and one member (Mark) seated on a canteen chair they seemed small and insignificant. But when they played, they just soared, taking the audience with them. To capture their unique style required a live recording and \\"The Turning Point\\" does just that: showcasing them in superb form as they create beautiful, enthusiastic, and often highly introspective music that stands out across time.     And, for those who've already discovered the delights of this quite superb album, this remastered and extended version includes three additional tracks from that same magical night, two of which rank only marginally behind those that made the original cut and one - \\"Don't Waste My Time\\" - that's as good as anything else on it.
B00002E23E|1.0|I did not care for this DVD although I am a great fan of the group. The audio sucks so badly that I took it off and traded back in. It is not possible for me to be so nostalgic that I can listen to simply anything. <br />If you love Led Zep -- no holds barred -- go ahead. If you want decent audio from your HTS, don't! It'll remind you of buying those egregious ATCO vinyl pressings.
B00006JDVV|3.0|Reign of Fire is a descent post apocalyptic tail directed by X-Files alumnus Rob Bowman.  The story begins in present day London where a boy named Quinn participates in the discovery the underground resting place of a once dormant dragon.  Fast forward about 20 years where dragons have overrun the world and Quinn is the leader of a small community of survivors held up in a castle somewhere in England.  Mathew McConaughey and his band of dragon slayers arrive on their way to London to kill the only male dragon, thus eliminating the species.  Testosterone levels are high as the two leaders clash.  The real stars of the movie however are the dragons.  They are described by their creators as having the movements of a cheetah, the skin of an alligator, with elements of birds and cobras.  The final product is ultra cool and in my opinion worth the price of admission.  The DVD transfer is sharp and crisp.  The Dolby 5.1 track will exercise your speakers, particularly when the dragons appear.  Extras are limited to a brief documentary on the dragon effects, the pyrotechnics, and a conversation with the director.  Despite is faults it's a fun movie.  Hardcore fans of monster movies and special effects will want this one in their library.  Others may want to give it a Saturday night rental.
B000000WG4|4.0|I would have liked to give this five stars, but I didn't enjoy the second part of this album.  I think it was in the way it was recorded.  The first part was done in a week I think, while the other part was done during different sittings for a few months.  If anyone is going to get a kick out of this masterpiece, then they are going to find the most value in part one.  <br />  Like two other full album songs that I like, Jethro Tull's &quot;Thick As A Brick&quot; and &quot;A Passion Play&quot;, I like how the music was written, and how it was based on a classical style of writing than the normal way during the early 70s'.  <br />  The music has constrasting sounds, while an organ is playing a dreamy wave, a guitar is sounding very rigid.  The two are put together well because their is no cover up to this.  <br />  On my last note, I find this album to be more relaxing than freaky and other emotions like that.  So try out this album, because everyone deserves to hear a song over 20 minutes once in their life.  If you like part two, that is great, but I think the way it is described in how it was written, the first part seems to be the more enjoyable and inspired piece on this album.
B00000K0T8|5.0|this album is by far a classic,Tony Starks introduces a whole different outlook on life love and economics.Ironman in this case means to stand the trials of life and the streets not a comic hero,fish sums up the whole albums direction similar to the way Gza's gold did for liquid swords if you an advid thinker Ghostface Killa's iron man is masterpiece.
B00002E23E|1.0|I did not care for this DVD although I am a great fan of the group. The audio [is so bad] that I took it off and traded back in. It is not possible for me to be so nostalgic that I can listen to simply anything. <br />If you love Led Zep -- no holds barred -- go ahead. If you want decent audio from your HTS, don't! It'll remind you of buying those egregious ATCO vinyl pressings.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I have owned this disc for a year.  And I am still not tired of it!  My first exposure to John and this fabulous album came last November when I was shopping for a gift for someone in a music store, and I happened to catch the end of &quot;St. Patrick's Day&quot;.  I asked the clerk behind the counter when Dave Matthews had made this record, and she answered by fetching me RFS.  And I haven't stopped listening to him since.<br />This album is as complete as one could ask for.  Starting with &quot;No Such Thing&quot; you pick up on John's unique guitar and clean, unpretentious lyrics.  The lyrical mastery that John presents on other tracks like &quot;My Stupid Mouth&quot; &quot;Your Body is a Wonderland&quot; and &quot;83&quot; are sinple yet catchy, and straight from the heart, and that is when without even trying you begin to identify and associate yourself with these songs.  &quot;Back to You&quot; and &quot;The Great Indoors&quot; are great songs that paint a very vivid picture in your mind with the words and haunt you with the melody, and although &quot;St. Patrick's Day&quot; is a perfect way to end the record, it also leaves you wanting more.<br />For those who have seen John live and also for those who prefer acoustic guitar, &quot;Inside Wants Out&quot; may be a better release to start with, but for everyone else &quot;Room For Squares&quot; is a complete work destined to become a benchmark in American pop music, no matter how many short-sighted, self-righteous online critics pan it.
6305508550|5.0|this is by far the best comedy ever created. i wtch it at least twice a week... at least. look, as everyone said, the movie is extremely quotable, hilaroius sand real,. etc. but please guys, dont make reviiews giving away all of the bloody funny spots. you'll ruin it! for ur own good, do notlook a the review made on nov. 21 titled mike judge kin of comedy, its horrible, its a movie critic gone to giving away secrets... peace
B00006RU5B|5.0|Audioslave's self titled debut featuring ex-members of Soundgarden and Rage Against The Machine is simply put: A classic.  Chris Cornell's vocals sound great and Tom Morello is a riff machine.  There are 14 tracks here and not a clunker in the bunch.  Buy this record now and you will be the owner of one of the best rock albums in a decade.  Thank you Audioslave.
B000006U44|5.0|One of the sweetest and sexiest albums ever made, in my opinion.  On this album she's the wacky, gorgeous genious chick next door, blowing minds as she bangs out her dreams on the piano and sings like she just doesn't give a damn.<br />Also one the most kick-ass ensembles of supporting studio musicians you will ever hear.  Kick-ass in a wonderfully subtle way.  We're not talking Motorhead here!<br />An amazing debut for anyone, let alone a nineteen-year-old.  I hope that someday soon, she puts out another album like this, with the warm, almost-live sound of her voice and piano.<br />We'll see.  In any case we'll always have this.
B00003CXIP|5.0|Stand By Me is one of my favorite films.  I have seen it so many times I know every line.  And yet every time I watch it I still enjoy it.  There is something about it I can't quite put my finger on.  Perhaps it reminds me of a time when life was more simple.  The film is about boys, boys at that age when they are discovering the world, and discovering the world with their friends.  Maybe it's the innocence of Stand By Me I love,  maybe it's the fact they swear a lot, or maybe it's the adventure, maybe it's that they all cry, or maybe it's that Vern can't remember the secret knock, whatever it is, it's masterful.  I love this movie.<br />The story is beautifully simple.  It's 1950's small town USA (but it could be anywhere) and four boys discover they know the location of a missing kid their age.  They all lie to their parents so they can go find him.  The following day they set off down the railroad tracks to find him.  They think they will be heros, and they will, but not for the reasons they think.  <br />Perhaps I'm not really doing the plot justice by oversimplifying like that, but trust me, this is a great film. It may be the best film made about boys at this age.  To me it is the best.  The cast is superb.  When I watch this film I don't see performances, I see people.  Wil Wheaton is Gordie. River Phoenix is Chris.  Corey Feldman is Teddy.  In fact, even today when I see Jerry O'Connell in films I yell Vern.  You get the picture.  Also, I have to mention Keifer Sutherland, who is simply amazing as Ace, the teenage villian.  I am still afraid of him.  Richard Dreyfuss, despite few scenes, delivers a strong, subtle performance.  The film would be lost without his haunting narration.<br />Rob Reiner is one of the best dierctors of the 80's.  I really believe it.  Between This is Spinal Tap, The Princess Bride, and this film, he made three classics.  I think Stand By Me is his best work.  The performances he was able to elicit out of his young cast is phenomenal.  This is what a true director can do.  The scenic backdrop of Oregon also gives the picture a sort of harmony with nature that captures the tone perfectly.<br />Stand By Me is a personal film.  Reiner and King have combined their boyhood expieriences to create a true vision of young men on the brink of manhood.  One classic scene after the next, it is one of my favorite pictures.
B00006CXXU|5.0|cuz christina is a pop princess who makes happy popcorn music. This album has none of that. Actually I've been a fan of Christina since \\"Genie\\" and I liked her first album. This album is as diverse and dynamic as they come folks.<BR>Can't Hold Us Down- this album is about Eminem and Fred. I love the lyrics like \\"that for sure is not a man to me slanderin' names for popularity\\" cuz i don't like em and his name callin is gettin old. 5/5 <BR>Walk Away- Amazing vocals. Very soulful but it's a bit too long. 4/5<BR>Fighter- This is \\"the\\" rock song on the album and it does indeed rock. 5/5<BR>Infatuation- Cute Latin song with a catchy chorus. 4.5/5<BR>Loving Me For Me- Reminds me so much of Mariah's \\"Underneath the Stars\\" or \\"Fourth of July\\" or \\"Bliss\\". Smooth and whispery. An ok track. 3.5/5<BR>Impossible- Great song. Love Alicia, love Christina, love this song- 5/5<BR>Underappreciated- Meh... 2/5<BR>Beautiful- I like this song even with the radio overplay. 5/5<BR>Make Over- This reminds me of Shakira's \\"Ojos Asi\\". This is the kind of song I would have never thought she'd sing. Cheers to her. 4.5/5<BR>Cruz- WOW!!! Love this song!! Everything about it is great. My favorite song from Christina. 6/5<BR>Soar- Kinda preachy. It's ok. 3.5/5<BR>Get Mine- Very nice sexy song. Love the vocals and the little talking part in the middle. grrrrrwwwll! 5/5<BR>Dirrty- A fun upbeat song. Redman is awesome. 4.5/5<BR>A Voice Within- Incredible song. There are so many dynamics to it from the whispery start to the choir to the high notes and to the Mariah Careyish ending. It sound like a Meat Loaf style power ballad. Amazing! 5/5 <BR>I'm OK- This album ain't over yet cuz this song is also amazing. Linda Perry can do no wrong!! There is so much emotion in Christina's voice you'd think she's crying while she was singing. 5/5<BR>Keep On Singing- This song sounds too much like soar. It's kinda blah but people seem to like it. 3/5<BR>What? Your still reading this review? Get the album already!!!
B000001FS3|5.0|Didn't waste any time as I first listened to this album shortly after it was released in March 1987. I was anticipating its release after the Amnesty International Concert back in the summer of 1986. Needless to say I wasn't disappointed.<BR>     I was involved in the music scene in the metropolitan area back then struggling to make some headway in an alternative band. I remember many bands (at least those opposed to glam hair bands of the era) were strongly influenced by U2 at that time.      <BR>     U2 had come a long way even from their last album at the time, &quot;The Unforgettable Fire.&quot; They had matured musically in leaps and bounds from that album, and I never would have thought that possible back then.<BR>     How influential was the album on a local level? In 1988, I trained at an old time boxing gym in Jersey City that was home to some world champions and contenders. There was this club fighter by the name of Rip Rettig. He was sparring with a guy -- I don't recall the other boxer's name -- and he was not having a good day. I remember Rip being on the ropes, and through his mouth piece, he started singing part of the refrain to &quot;Red Hill Mining Town.&quot; On the ropes, singing...<br />&quot;I'm hanging on.&quot;<br />And he did.
B00006RAKP|5.0|very simply put this elton album has all the hits you know and love........its a must for anyone who owns cd's.  5 stars!!!
B00006L7XQ|5.0|&quot;The Man Comes Around&quot; is brilliant.  His version of &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Waters&quot; (done with Fiona Apple in a supporting role) gave me coldchills, and his version of Nine Inch Nails's &quot;Hurt&quot; keeps running through my head.  He does The Beattles better than The Beattles, The Eagles better than The Eagles, and Depeche Mode, well, better than Depeche Mode.<br />Buy it now.  You won't be disappointed.
B00005JKWJ|5.0|Wesley Snipes stars as the title character in the sequel to the 1998 movie of the same name.  This time around the story and the movie are more gritty and horror oriented, but Snipes is still fighting his own demons and the vampires.  You need not have seen the first Blade to see this one, both movies stand on their own.  Blade teams up with a vampire crew this time to fight the evil, scary Reapers and destroy this creepy strain of vampires before they get out of hand.  The DVD is full of extras....be sure to watch the deleted and alternate scenes with the director's commentary!  Guillermo Del Toro, the director, is funny and insightful and does an excellent job on this movie, and the commentary.  There's also plenty of behind-the-scenes looks at the movie that will keep you busy for about as long as the movie is.  Overall Blade II is fun, scary, and entertaining.
B00006M183|1.0|I have been a Pearl Jam fan from the beginning and lately I've been buying their albums with his mindset: &quot;OK so the last album was disappointing, but this one is gonna be their return to greatness.&quot;   This is what I've been saying ever since Vs.  I'm still waiting.   They haven't been great since Vs. and they haven't even been good since Yeild.  Vedder lacks any emotion in his signing, his vocals and especially his lyrics are at best sub-par and all of the songs sound stale.   There's only one or two songs that have hooks that you'll actually remember.  The only thing that makes this album even listenable are Mike's solos, which Thank God have once again returned.<BR>Bottomline: If you like this album you either hear things I don't or are a hopeless diehard who will love anything they put out.   It's probably the later.   My advice is to skip this one and wait for their live show, which hopefully hasn't deteriorated as much as their albums have.
B00001OH7O|5.0|and my favorite Bowie album.  Pre - Ziggy Stardust, we have here none-the-less the very musicians who would become the Spiders from Mars.  Some of his British folk leanings are evident here but they're unlike anything from that scene.  These songs are pretty wierd - and pretty unique. <br />I won't ramble on about each song as others have done that well enough on this forum.  I will say that &quot;The Bewlay Brothers&quot; is my favorite song.  Bowie's intricate wordplay is wonderful and the howling chorus with ringing acoustic guitar is haunting.  The end of the song sounds like a scene from the movie he did some time later called &quot;Labrinth.&quot;<br />Rycodisc put out some great additional tracks on their Bowie re-releases, but the ones included here will mostly be useful to hardcore fans who collect such things.  <br />Unless you insist on his harder rock n' roll stuff, this could be considered his best album ever.
0553577123|5.0|Not many diarys become classics of literature. The only two others that come to mind are: Mutiny on HMS Bounty, and Walden.<br />This was written by a young girl. Yet, it has all the lasting grace of Twain or Dickens. When I first read this, I thought Anne Frank would have been upset that so many people have read her personal diary. I later learned that Anne had started to edit her diary, as she wished for it to be published after the war. I don't think she would have minded anyway, if she could see how many people's lives have been changed by this classic. We see Anne Frank as a poster child for the victims of Hitler's evil. I think many have realised the tragic, and this book hits home. Like Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath, it shows how people struggle to overcome their oppression, and live on in our hearts.
0790731479|5.0|I like Tim Burton movies in general.  But this is a good one too if you're just into movies.  It's funny, and has great visuals (for the time it was made).
0316096199|4.0|I was intrigued to read Lucky after being blown away by Sebold's \\"Lovely Bones\\". She did not disappoint with autobiographical \\"Lucky\\". I had to remind myself repeatedly through this book that it wasn't fiction...this was someone's life. I winced and was made uncomfortable...pushed out of my comfort zone with Sebold's description of her rape. I stood along side her as she stood up to the scrutiny of her dysfunctional family, her friends and the hardened police detectives. I celebrated when she came out the other side of this horrific ordeal. I recommend this book to anyone willing to step outside their comfort zone and walk along side Sebold as she goes to hell and back.
B000000WCX|5.0|This album deserves 5 stars for being such a bold step forward.  The techno beats combined with stellar instrumentation (guitar, piano, etc.) are exilerating.  The entire album is quite listenable, but the standouts really stand out: \\"Little Wonder,\\" \\"Battle for Britain (the Letter),\\" and \\"Dead Man Walking.\\"  The latter was my anthem for quite a while when I went through a depressed period. The lyrics \\"and I'm gone/like I'm dancing on angels/and I'm gone/through a crack in the past/like a dead man walking\\" I used to rejuvenate my outlook and clear my mind of past troubles.  Like dying and starting over.  Thanks Bowie. Great album.
B00000K19E|5.0|IN the 1990s there is not a single better sci-fi movie. I can't wait for Matrix 2 and 3
B00006RU5B|4.0|It rocks.  The mesmerizing blend of Cornell's soulfully tortured voice mixed with Morello's chords.. and the rest of rage... the first album since Tool Aenima and SOD's Toxicity that has really made me stop and think &quot;that's f''n music&quot;.... buy it!
B00006YXEK|5.0|For all of those who loved him, with or without those other 3 lads from Liverpool, they lost a friend last year when old George took flight. As he would plan it, he made sure he left us with a GEM. Brainwashed is a last journal of a great musician coming to terms with his life in which all of us could only wish to do in our time. See song no.7 \\"Stuck inside a cloud\\" and listen very carefully. Jeff Lynn, and George's son, Dahni made sure it was the first single to be released on the album to give all of us an isight into the great Beatle's head at the time of the recording. Every song is a winner, and so is the package...poster, DVD, signed guitar pic, and the album art is very tasty. Don't miss out on this one! Although George left producer Jeff Lynn with instructions for a \\"non-posh\\" release, even modest old George would have been proud. I feel him smiling every time I listen to this blissfull farewell.
0425152251|4.0|To anyone who reads this book- Prepared to be confused, changed, and dumbfounded.<BR>This book is both strange- you don't read too many books where the main character ends up reading the book- and will make you do strange things- I actually cleaned up my room because of this book.<BR>The abrut changes (I will say no more about them now, so as not to spoil the book) halfway through the books serve to emphasize the nature of the book, and make the reader doubt their own existance- are we but shadows on a cave wall?<BR>Ah yes, a reponse to an earlier reviewer's remark- that the characters are flat? Remember, a great deal of the book reads like an (interesting) textbook. Sophie needs to be a bit flat, so she can ask the questions to help the reader understand what is being said.
B00005JL78|4.0|Before I begin, I want to make clear that this is one of the best films I've seen this year. Unfortunately, Speilberg took a masterpiece and made it a good film. Typical to Speilberg is the necessary ending in which things are resolved. This formula worked well for some of his past movies, but was ill needed in this film. I am curious as to how many people feel that this film would have been an unblemished masterpiece had it ended with Cruise being place under arrest and Max Von Sydow getting away with the crime. Sure this would not have garnished as many repeat viewings but it would have left me with the unsettling feeling of how wrong the system they had really was. The last half hour reminded me of the old hollywood days in which it was required for the villan to pay for his villanous acts.<br />This film had the potential to be untouched by similar genre films, but instead allowed itself to be bogged down to please the status quo.<br />I have to mention...the scene after Cruise had the eye transplants and the \\"spiders\\" were searching the building is one of the most intense and superbly shot scenes I have seen in a long time
B00005Y228|5.0|This is definitely a great album. Although the first song &quot;More More More&quot; is a SORE disappointment(kinda sloppy, I think), the rest of them are just FEVERISH!! The video of &quot;Come into my world&quot; is really original and really well-made. My personal favourites in this album were:<BR>1. In your eyes.<BR>2. Come into my world<BR>3. love at first sight<br />I guess music does not get better than this!
B000065V41|3.0|This is my absolute favorite \\"Christmas Carol\\" adaptation. What makes the Muppets so great is their versitility --they can be used to tell any story, and this proves it. Kermit is Bob Crachit, Gonzo is Charles Dickens (a brilliant touch) and Academy Award-winner Michael Caine is Ebenezer Scrooge. The songs are as touching and as funny as any Muppet production in history, and Brian Henson is doing his father proud, helming these classic characters the way he has.<br />The only beef I've got is with Disney's production of the DVD -- NO WIDESCREEN VERSION! Blast it, why are we still being subjected to fullscreen? TVs are going to be widescreen in a few years anyway -- the same people who whine about black bars at the top and bottom of their screen now will be whining about them on the SIDES then... The movie is nearly perfect. Five stars. The presentation is what yanks it down to three.
B00006L9ZT|2.0|I must disagree with anyone who suggests that Levine's conducting is no good. I find his interpretation in this cycle absolutely astounding! Few conductors, past or present, is able to have such a complete mastery of this difficult score, and Levine has it in his blood. He is here supported by the Met's orchestra in top form. What more can one ask?<br />However, I must voice my dissatisfaction with 2 aspects of this production. The first is the bland direction. I like traditional stagings. But traditional stagings don't mean that the stage directions have to be as unimaginative and static as what we see here. The same can be said of the sets, which are a little too rigid from a visual perspective.<br />But it's the singing that is most disappointing. No one would reasonably expect that the singing here can compare with the best of the past. Yet, much of the singing here is uninspiring and, in one crucial role, less than competent. I'm referring here to the inadequate Brunnhilde of Hildegard Behrens. While her silvery top register do give pleasure, her patchy voice often ruins Brunnhilde's phrases. In my view, she's overparted. Siegfried Jerusalem, though slightly past his prime, is much more satisfactory. However, Lakes and Norman disappoint as the Walsung twins, as they're not that suitable for the parts, both physically and vocally. Morris is, by contrast, a commanding Wotan. <br />On the whole, I can give this set only 2 stars, most of it being earned by Levin and the orchestra. The other aspects of this production is, honestly, not that up to standard.
0316666343|2.0|The writer had a wonderfully unique premis but failed to capitalize on it.  My book club (10 women) read it and we all thought that it had been over hyped.  It wasn't awfull - just not great either. The first chapter is a &quot;10&quot; then each one that followes is less until you are realy happy to see it end.
B00006X06U|5.0|I taken a few days and many hours to listen to this album. I was familiar with Joni Mitchell's work and had seen her in concert but had purchased only one album previously (Both Sides Now). My impressions of this album went from really strange, to absolutely beautiful, and now are at simply magnificent. I simply can't get the words or tunes out of my head. Take the time to listen and you will be rewarded. There might seem to be moments when \\"Sex Kills\\" sounds like something out of a Bond movie but I think it is more that we are in a strange landscape. I can't think of another performer who has choosen to reinterpert their songs in this fashion. This is sort of the counterpoint to all those unplugged albums which were so popular a few years back. In the end, the key as to the how or why this work was made really seems to lie in \\"The Circle Game\\" that Joni appears to be playing.

0060229357|5.0|This was probably one of the first books that \\"captured\\" me. I read it when I was in early grade school, probably second or third grade. It was one of those rare magical reading experiences. A few years ago I found a copy at a garage sale and bought it for my daughter. Even though she was older that I was when she read it, she also loved it and found it captivating. I definately recommend this for any child.
B00004XQP4|5.0|Green Day's \\"Warning\\" is very mature compared to their past albums. Like every band, you have to grow up sometime along with your music and times. These guys know what ... they're doing reguardless of what people say about them.  Minority is my favorite, it's a stand-out song!! It rocks!!! Buy this album, it's great and WORTH IT!!
B00006IR5S|5.0|John Williams' film scores have always been so adored by fans that they become instant classics and this album is no exception!  His music is somehow teetering on the edge between contemporary and nostalgic.  I did enjoy the first soundtrack but never felt the need to buy it.  This album, though, has a way of reminding me of childhood, yet the sounds are all brand new.  <BR>Williams' music for this film seems to take the listener from thrilled, elated, and inspired to petrified to furious to heart-broken.  But no matter the heart-string pulled the music is phoenomenal and will be enjoyed by all - Harry fan or not!
B00003CXV4|5.0|Men will be diappointed to see Keanu Reeves in anything other than an action adventure film, so they will dismiss this movie right off of the bat. Ignore them.  Send the guys to Hooters or a sports bar, and sit around alone, or with a girlfriend or two to watch this. Men hate the vunerability displayed in a strong man, as they feel threatened by it, but women will be touched by it.<br />Typical for a chick film, get the kids out of the house, as you need to be able to hear the dialogue to get the movie.<br />Yes, it does require suspending some disbelief, but so do many things in real life! The ending is horribly wonderful and wonderfully horrible. I won't give a spoiler. You will laugh at the silliness, and cry at the sadness.

B00006RU5B|5.0|I was a huge fan of Rage Against the Machine, so I was disappointed when Zack de la Rocha left. However, when news of Chris Cornell joining on to create a new band, I was very excited. After many months of hard work, Audioslave was born. This album is the fruits of their labor. The change of singers makes a big difference, as Zack's rap/rock is gone and Chris's more forceful rock takes its place. The lyrics are less politically charged, but still meaningful (such as \\"Go and save yourself/take it out on me\\" from Cochise). <BR>Cochise, their first single, is definitely the most popular song at this point...Definitely check this CD out if you like rock... this CD is a must buy. Highly recommended!

B000002Q7Y|4.0|Its reasonably common knowledge that Kerry livgren was not in the band at this point of Kansas, with that said this CD POWER proves to be an 80`s classic. Walshes voice is at the best I`v e ever heard him , Ehart`s drumming particularly on (Musicatto) is outstanding. The inclusion of Morse proves to be just the direction that the band needed at the time. Ok I know this CD is no Leftoverture or Point of know return, but I got this on vinyl in the 80`s and compared to the other stuff that was coming out from variouse bands back then, it is a 4 star recording. It starts of with the kicking...Siluouttes in disguise (this song shows Morses talents off) and then onto Power (a good standerd song) followed by All i wanted, (it had hit written all over it) onto Secret service (an Alan parsons style progressive song featuring The Philharmonia orchestra, onto Not alone anymore (once again showing how good Morse is) this brings us to the stand out here, Musicatto ( a fantastic progressive instumental)that fades into the beautiful Taking in the view (best slow kansas song since dust in the wind) the next two are catchy rockers Three pretenders and Tomb 19, and finaly a super balad that is so strong and shows Steve Walsh`s voice of at his very best ever , Cant cry any more. The recording of this is ahead of its time, Digitally recorded and mastered to insure highest audio fidelity. Therefore play this CD loud.

B00006YXEK|3.0|You go into this, most likely a lover of George Harrison, hoping against hope that it won't sound like a Jeff Lynne album. And your hope will turn to resignation. Don't get my wrong, I kind of like the \\"Jeff Lynne\\" sound -- and even enjoyed a few spins of the return of ELO CD he put out last year -- but for crying out loud, Jeff, it is not applicable to everything. Why must we be subjected to your vision of \\"plush\\" rock with every project you do? A great producer brings out the best in his players and helps them flesh out THEIR artistic vision. Yes, there are notable exceptions, say, Manfred Eicher of the ECM label, for example (and for you eclectics), but, mostly, a producer with an identifiable sound across artists becomes a drag. This, unfortunately, is pretty much a continuation of the Traveleing Willburys/Cloud Nine formula, and, folks, those records were made a long time ago. The songs, with listening, hopefully, will begin to distinguish themselves from those efforts, and there are striking standouts (you'll know them right away), but George is clearly in high spirits and form on the \\"Brainwashed\\" sessions and I, personally, believe they would have benefitted from a more sympathetic rendering. The songs are sent through the Lynne thresher and without even buying the disc, fans already know what it's going to sound like (if you believe me). And, to me, that's disappointing. The thrill of the new is gone because it's EXACTLY LIKE JEFF's other work. Shoot, man, this is George's coda album. It should have been done his way. As for the bonus package, it is a bit disappointing: The poster is flimsy and forgetable, the pick is a pick, the DVD is the biggest disappointment, clocking in at under 10 minutes and with a whole lotta Jeff Lynne. Anyway, don't get me wrong, there is much to like on Brainwashed and George, as I said, is in fine form, writing, playing and singing, but the stamp of the wrong man is in place.
B000002JPA|5.0|Actually I don't think this album deserves five stars. I think it deserves four. But I have seen so many annoyingly stupid reviews giving this album just one star that I will give this extra star willingly.<br />This CD holds some of their best songs to date. Pull Me Under is dark and fascinating. Another Day is Dream Theatre's best ever ballad. Actually I think it's the most supreme of all rock ballads ever written. Surrounded is an amazing track which shifts from a slow tempo to a fast one then once again to a slow one in a sudden yet continuous fashion. Metropolis Part 1 is the prologue to their best album to date, Metropolis Part 2: Scenes from a Memory. What I said about Surrounded holds for this as well, even though these two tracks are completely different. Under A Glass Moon is a superb track if you give it the time to grow on you. Wait For Sleep is a beautiful two-and-a-half minute piano ballad.<br />Unfortunately Take The Time and Learning to Live don't do anything for me, even though They tend to be too much 80s-rock for my liking. Learning to Live has its great moments though. <BR>However, it is also uselessly long.<br />This is why i think it deserves four stars, but i'm gonna give it five anyway. These quasi-gods of music deserve it. Who thinks they don't should be burnt at the stake since that means that they don't understand anything about music. I am not democratic when it comes to Dream Theatre.
0060523794|1.0|Why is it that one of the most hated CEOs of all time is being lauded in the press still? Did every person who made it rich do so by morally ethical means? Has no one read the Wall Street Journal? When I see a balanced story on what happened at IBM during the times of Gerstner, then I'll believe that someone did their homework, and wasn't out to ride the coat tails of another rich person. If you want another glamour story read this, if you want the truth, dig deeper.
0783229321|5.0|I did not think I would like animal house because I really am not a fan of cheap, crude humor, which is what I expected from this movie. However, after seeing Amadeus and thinking Tom Hulce was just the cutest and a really good actor, I decided to rent it. I am SOOOO glad I did! This is funniest movie EVER! If only school was really as much fun as it is portrayed in \\"Animal House\\"! You just fall in love with the whole gang; Bluto, Pinto, Otter, Flounder, Boone, D-day, Stork, and all the rest of the Delta's. This movie will put a smile on your face, and I know you will have as good a time watching it as the Delta's are having in it. Watch the Delta fraternity throw Toga parties, steal packaged meat, go on road trips, have food fights, spy on sororities, ruin the homecoming parade, try to get laid and act completely crazy!
B000002KYR|4.0|Yep, this is the album that broke Top forever, pushing over 8 million copies.  Gone are the simple but educated blues patterns of &quot;LaGrange,&quot; &quot;I Heard it on the X,&quot; and &quot;I'm Bad, I'm Nationwide,&quot; they've been replaced with the '80s space boogie of &quot;Got Me Under Pressure&quot; and &quot;Sharp Dressed Man.&quot;  But let's not forget to mention some of the lesser known but none the less outstanding tracks such as the atmospheric ballad &quot;I Need You Tonight,&quot;  thump rocker &quot;I Got the Six&quot; (love those double entendre lyrics), and one of my fave straight-ahead rockers that never gets a mention, &quot;Dirty Dog.&quot;  The approach on this album was certainly a novel idea for a band like Top back in '83, and no other band has really completed such a mind-boggling transition so successfully since.  I place this one up on the &quot;party rack&quot; along with AC/DC's &quot;Back in Black,&quot;  Kiss' &quot;Alive,&quot; Whitesnake's &quot;Saints an' Sinners&quot; and The Four Horseman's &quot;Gettin' Pretty Good at Barely Gettin' By.&quot;  Let the good times roll!
0385508417|3.0|Call it a warm Christmas tale or simply a farce. John Grisham has delivered a short novel unlike any of his previous works. First of all, it's funny above all. Luther Krank comes up with the idea of skipping Christmas altogether as he and his wife are caught in traffic under the blizzard. Their freshly-out-of-grad-school daughter Blair is off to Peru on Peace Corps for a year. Luther quickly preoccupies with the idea of taking a 10-day cruise to the Caribbeans with his wife Nora. Now that means no crowded malls, no jostling through grocery shop, no corny office parties, no calendars from the town police department, no fruitcakes from the fire bureau, no wasted unwanted presents, no Christmas tree, no Frosty and decorations.  But, as the Kranks are about to discover, skipping Christmas unveils incredible consequences-including being labeled as &quot;display of selfishness&quot; by their neighbors on Hemlock Street. Their house would be the only one among the 42 in the block with no Frosty and decorations which finishes with a 6th at the decoration contest. This book is a page turner but more importantly it offers a preposterous (but funny) look at the holiday chaos and frenzy. 3.7 stars.
B000069CWE|4.0|For a remix album, this CD is awesome.  I have heard many remix albums before and they [are all bad]. I loved the mix of Rap with Rock. I don't think many other bands can pull of what Linkin Park just pulled off - A great Remix Album
0812548094|2.0|Let me start off by saying this book is pretty decent in it's own right.  However, I have to agree with Jim's list of similarities.    There are just way too many parallels for me to reccommend this book.  It wouldn't surprise me if Goodkind wrote this book using Robert Jordan's notes.
B00005YUPO|5.0|My twins love all of these but they seem to really love this one the most.  just mesmorizing to them.
B00005JKCH|1.0|I used to love reading Spider-Man comic books, and was excited when I heard about a movie version of the classic super-hero.  Unfortunately, Sam Raimi's Spider-Man is just plain bad.  It's boring!  The story moves at a snails pace and the action scenes are way too short.  That wouldn't be SO bad if the plot were interesting or the love scenes half-way decent, but they're not.  This movie won't stand the test of time, that's for sure.
6304493681|5.0|Ghost in the Shell, like Akira, is really hard to follow. I had to watch it twice to make sure I got it. The animation is great, it's very textured and vibrant but it still gives off that eerie, creepy, darkness to the movie as well. There are also some very good Computer animated scenes as well.<br />It's set in the future and all humans have ceased to exist. Everyone is an android, however they are all given a slight hint of human quality called &quot;the ghost&quot;. This gives all of them human feelings.<br />Like I said, Ghost in the Shell is hard to follow. You really have to pay attention in this one or you'll totall miss it. It's still a great movie but if you're looking for an easier movie to follow, go with the classics, Vampire Hunter D, Fist of the North Star etc.
0385508417|5.0|Even though I knew that &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; wasn't in the same genre as John Grisham's previous novels, the minute I saw the title I knew I just had to read it.<br />&quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; gives John the opportunity to allow his delightful sense of humour to be shown, and also to relate to so many of us who have, at times, felt a great desire to &quot;skip Christmas&quot;.<br />From the first identification with Luther Krank as he attempts to do away with all the commercial and guilt induced trappings of the season, to the very last line, this novel captures the imagination and heart.<br />Those who could never imagine anything other than a traditional Christmas (complete with roof top decorations and thousands of cards) may have difficulty relating to this story.  But for those of us who have longed at times to just find a big hole to hide in from late November through to December 26, this book will really touch base.  Best of all, John manages to say &quot;I understand what you're feeling&quot;, and then beautifully bring everything back into focus.<br />John Grisham's skill as a writer has been showcased in his legal fiction for many years now.  As much as I've enjoyed each one, I just have to say that I really hope he'll take his readers on another delightful detour along the &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; line again in the near future.
0783222955|5.0|Author Harper Lee said she never thought of her Pultizer Prize novel to be more than a love story of a single father for his two children. It is that, but so much more. \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" is also a simple social commentary on racism, wonderfully and innocently seen through a child's eyes, and man's rejection of others he doesn't understand. The commentary, 40 years old now, remains as relevant as then. As southern lawyer Atticus Finch, Peck garnered a Best Actor Oscar for his powerfully moving performance that, as one scene elicits, also commands a deep respect of the screen character. As defense counsel for an African-American (a contemporary poltically correct term; then, they were \\"coloreds\\") man falsely accused of raping a white woman (not popular in the south), Peck evokes a sense of outrage at the injustice of his client's position. The genius of the film, though, is its perspective of Peck's screen daughter, Scout. And it is her innocent confusion in not understanding why her father becomes chastised by the white community that hopefully gets across the sublimial message that there is no understanding of any form of discrimination. Ranked the 34th best film ever by the American Film Institute, this one will remain always relevant as long as injustice based on discrimination exists. The closing scene is gut-wrenching, but the film as a whole it is truly a moving experience.
B0000028UK|5.0|Pearl Jam has taken some pretty firm stances throughout their career on several social issues.  Abortion, race relations, poverty, and the environment are just a few they have tackled throughout their time in the spotlight.  You can get overtones of this social conscience in all other music.  The concept of the broken home is also rather recurrent throughout their body of work.<br />\\"Vs.\\" is an extension of the aforementioned concepts.  It is filled with amazing, and profoundly powerful, rock anthems.  Songs like \\"Go,\\" \\"Dissident,\\" and \\"Leash\\" are great.  \\"Dissident\\" did make its way to rock radio for some time.  \\"Leash,\\" already mentioned above, is straight rock `n' roll. The first single \\"Animal,\\" was a rather interesting choice for a single.  Though I like the song, it isn't exactly radio friendly.  <br />Contrasting the rock anthems on the record was some very good melodic rock songs.  The big single off of this record was \\"Daughter.\\"  I never quite did get this song.  But, nonetheless, it is pretty good.  I think there are much better songs on the records than the ones that were released singles.  \\"Indifference\\" a slow, bass laden slow song,  has this \\"Twin Peaks\\" kind of feel to it.  It is very cool.  The song with the longest title I have ever heard in my life is one of the best songs: \\"Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town.\\"<br />This record is one of the most prolific works of its time.  It held the record for the \\"most records sold in the first week of availability\\" for several years.  Before the concept of internet presale, this record went platinum in just over a week.  It is amazing and a must have for any Pearl Jam fan.  <br />epc
B000066F6H|1.0|I liked it the first time, when it was the Kinks.
B00006LSM3|5.0|This recording is not just a farewell. It's an embrace.<BR>A sense of resolution informs every track.<BR>Here George is humorous, spiritual, ironic and confident.<BR>The songs are not \\"found\\" recordings. George was recording them at the end of his life and he wanted his son, Dhani, and his great friend Jeff Lynne to complete the album. I think this is very close to the way he wanted it to turn out.<BR>The George trademarks are here: A frolic into tin-pan alley with a cover of Harold Arlen's \\"Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea;\\" a hint of Monty Python; a dip or two into the blues; and, throughout, spiritualism.<BR>The difference between this and the rest of his albums is that he does not overstate anything here. His wit is not forced. His spiritualism is not tortured. His musicianship, as good as ever, is at one with the songs themselves.<BR>This album is a gift to the living from a man who was leaving.
B00006LSM3|5.0|Even though I have been a fan of George Harrison's music for many years, it took until the other evening to realize just how much he will be missed. His voice, his music & of course his beautiful guitar-playing. I also never fully realized (I mean, obviously I did but this album rammed home that point unequivocally) just how distinctive, not only his guitar playing was, but his voice as well. Not to mention, what a brilliant, over-looked songwriter he could be, when his muse was inspired. This album is a near-perfect example of all three of these points. Every song is a gem, filled with that distinctive twangy, weeping slide guitar sound of his, plus his (strangly moving) ethereal singing voice. He sounds very much ALIVE on this album. It was strange to be listening to it & think that he has already been gone from this mortal coil for the past year now. He certainly doesn't sound like a dying man in these songs. He sounds completely alive & well.<BR>\\"Any Road\\" is an amazing song with terrific lyrics, concerning God & features the couplet, \\"If you don't know where you're going, any road will take you there.\\" It's a deceptively simple line, that takes awhile to reveal its profoundness & complexity of thought. It's a song that many of us can relate to; that feeling of being lost & drifting. If you don't have an anchor, something to believe in, you can easily fall between the cracks of life. George seems to say that he too almost fell but luckily found a purpose, a reason for living & breathing. He seems content. We should all be so lucky. The ironic part is that, just when he seemed most content, that is when cancer robbed him of life.   <BR>\\"Marwa Blues\\" is a hauntingly beautiful instrumental, featuring more of that distinctive slide guitar of his. It is a marvellous creation, as is the rest of this impressive album. The whole album flows perfectly & is easily one of his best. It is a tragedy that he died so young but we should be grateful for the 40 years of music hegave us & it is fitting that he went out on a high note like this. And we should also give thanks to Jeff Lynne & George's son, Dhani - they are to be commended for the hard work & I'm sure, the pain & tears they must have suffered, in finishing this album after George's death (& according to his instructions). They did a beautiful job & did justice to his songs. As for George, may he rest in peace & may God bless him for all eternity.
B0000027RL|5.0|I have just written a review for PJ's latest, Riot Act, and thought since i have the time (and the CD with me), i would also write this review for PJ's debut album, Ten. To get right to it, this album signifies history along with Nirvana's &quot;Nevermind&quot; as the album that introduced the world to Seattle rock bands. ALthough, in my honest opinion, &quot;Ten&quot; would do just fine without &quot;Nevermind&quot; coming in at the same time. This album demonstrates that to be great, you dont have to have a video or big publicity to your credit( of course, &quot;Ten&quot; spawned off more PJ videos than the other albums,and the publicity was pretty big). The guys just love to make music, as you'll hear in this album. There are no junk tracks here, just great rock and roll and songwriting from  a young band who loves to play together and play well. The tracks and my opinions:<BR>1. Once- The second song in the &quot;Mamasan&quot; trilogy opens the album well. Great guitar work here.<br />2. Even Flow- The most famous opening riff (along with &quot;jeremy&quot;) in PJ's history set up this incredible rocker. <br />3. Alive- The first song in the &quot;Mamasan&quot; trilogy. Insightful songwriting and singing here.<br />4. Why go?- I love the chorus lines to this song...&quot;Why go home?&quot;. Great rocking song.<br />5. Black- The best ballad song ever done by a Seattle band, in my honest opinion. Sounds great on piano, even better on guitar.<br />6. Jeremy- With the haunting Jeff Ament bass opening, this song shows PJ's power in playing songs about a sensitive issue. Haunting, surreal, and definitely impacting.<br />7. Oceans- The first PJ song i can ever play on my guitar. Beautiful lyrics here.<br />8. Porch- My personal favorite when i'm bored and tired to sing along to.<br />9. Garden- Beautiful guitar work by Mike McCready. Wonderful lyrics.<br />10. Deep- &quot;Cant touch the bottom..&quot; love the chorus on this one.<br />11. Release- The most personal PJsong for me. Man, love everything about it.<br /> There you go. This album is every bit as essential to listen to as your own heartbeat,if i may dare say. Let's end it @ that.
B00006JUE2|4.0|Admittedly I've made something of a mini-career of Meg Ryan-bashing, and while I'm still nowhere near being a fan I find her much less objectionable than usual here.  This is one of the more charming movies I've seen in recent memory.  The premise behind it is intriguing.  Two very different individuals who would have been perfect matches for each other in another life are brought together by the still-to-be-perfected miracle of time travel.  Hugh Jackman,quite simply was born to play this role and he plays it to sheer perfection.  Any success the film may have had deservedly falls squarely on his shoulders.  <BR>Meg Ryan may have been cute 10 or 15 years ago, but her  shtick has been totally played out.  With every picture she looks more and more like an-over-the-hill rock groupie.  Still she does her best work in a while here, and she and Jackman make a charming couple.<BR>This isn't the best movie I've ever seen but I would definitely recommend it.
B00003CXAY|4.0|Like that this has the 16:9 version....looks real nice even at 480p....a 1080i version would be better, but we'll have to wait for that technology for now.  I've waited 20 years to see this again.....a movie I've never forgotten. It just makes you think.<BR>The musical score is perfection, as is most of Philip Glass' work......bought the re-recorded cd along with the Koyaanisqatsi/Powaqqatsi 2 pack offered here at Amazon.com
B00006LSM3|5.0|I got an advance copy of this CD 10 days ago, and have listened to it over and over and over, and will continue to. Some have been whining about the Jeff Lynne production. These comments  are silly. I love the production--it is so perfectly in tune with some of the most inspired songs imaginable. George developed into a true songwriting genius, with such an incredible conscious point of view. And the guitar playing has never been more evocative. An amazing gift of an album. So deep, so perfect. We love you George, and this music, and the reality of what George was about bring tears to anyone who truly gets it.
B0000025DV|5.0|&quot;Out of the Blue&quot; goes on my short list of titles I would need on a deserted island.  It's best if played from beginning to end as one entire work, instead of single songs.<br />This album takes you a number of emotions and does a great job showing off the talent ELO.

B00005AAFS|5.0|this is just an absolutely stunning album.  i had a hard time getting by the first 6 tracks they're so good.  the title track is brilliant.  a great mix of industrial crunch, electronics and strings, a truly unique and powerful sound.  my faves: sonne, feuer frei, links 2 3 4, and mutter, which is so heart-wrenchingly beautiful and powerful it made me cry.
B00005YW4H|5.0|She had me the first time I heard &quot; I don't know why&quot; on my XM radio.  Stunning voice and beautifully hip bluesy music.  <BR>I highly recommend it.
B000001ESP|5.0|Even though it's 21 years old now, this still takes the cake as the best recorded album EVER!  Have you ever heard drums sound like Neil's do on this baby, where every single beat and cymbal wash is that crystal clear?  Geddy's bass is humming all over this baby and Alex's solos (especially on \\"Limelight\\" and \\"The Camera Eye\\") just blaze with intensity.  And I'm just talking about my original CD release, not the remastered!  Like other reviewers have said, this CD rivals anything put out by other mammoth rock acts, and not that AC/DC is going into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Rush certainly should be joining those ranks.
B00005JKQX|5.0|This is the most accurate protrayal I've ever seen from Hollywood of mental health issues.  I was familiar with Mr. Nash so I already knew what the overall story was.  This might be a good idea for other viewers:  get a few facts on his life and work before you sit down to watch the movie.  I realize that some may feel \\"tricked\\" by the delusional events and people, but to a person that is suffering, these events are as real as the ones that do exist (for everyone).  Because of the casting selection for the doctor (Christopher Plummer), I think many will keep the poll open on the good guy/bad guy decision.  What you really need to understand is the level of the Science of Psychiatry at that time and the tools they had to use.  Finally, the casting and performance of Jennifer Connoly was great.  Anyone watching this should begin to understand the commitment of a marriage vow (in sickness and health).  With a partner like that portrayed, you cannot help but succeed.  When you watch this movie (DVD), save some time to talk about it after, especially with any children.  In an age where Prozac is outselling McDonald's french fries, everyone should understand Jon Nash.
B00006LSCX|5.0|I have been a big fan of Kylie Minogue in the past couple of years. It was her last album \\"Light Years\\" that got me into her brand of pop music. Her latest album \\"Fever\\" finally re-introducded Kylie to the American public once again with the infectious hit \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head\\". The  song was so undeniably catchy. It would have required the jaws of life to get the melodies out of anyone's head. \\"Fever\\" was definitely one of the best pop albums to come out in 2001 (I bought it last year as an import), very disco indeed. Just like its predecessor \\"Light Years\\", a new version of \\"Fever\\" recently came out with a bonus cd of remixes and one new song. Needless to say, I had to get it. For any Kylie Minogue fan, this is a must have. The bonus cd includes \\"Can't Get Blue Monday Out of My Head\\". That song is a combination of New Order's classic \\"Blue Monday\\" mixed with Kylie 's \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head\\". It is an unbelievable track. The two songs melded together so well. I was definitely impressed. I loved the scumfrog's beauty & the beast vocal mix of \\"Love At First Sight\\". To be honest, I am not really wild about the original version but remix is awesome. And the Fischerspooner mix of \\"Come Into My World\\" is great as well. The new song \\"Whenever You Feel Like It\\" is good, not one of Kylie's better songs but it is pretty good I think. Still it felt a bit out of place on a cd filled with remixes. Overall great addition for fans who don't want to buy the remixes separately.
B00006X06U|5.0|This is a great \\"ADULT\\" listening experience. SO<br />MANY GREAT selections of Joni songs from over<br />the years. The past few reviews say it all. I<br />had read what the Rolling Stone Magazine said,<br />\\"Bizzare\\", thats a typical response from them.<br />Look what graces their covers these days. Its<br />certainly not about musical excellence anymore.<br />So far on this collection \\"Amelia\\" floors me<br />but there are many, many gems on here. Joni<br />took her time with this set and has slowed things<br />down and draws the words out and this musical<br />setting is superb for her mesmerizing vocal delivery.<br />Joni, don't forget you promised a Christmas collection!<br />Excellent packaging all around, love the enhanced bonus<br />multi-media material on disk one you can play on the computer. Just check out her paintings!<br />This is much more than I'd hoped Joni would deliver,a classy and inspired musical journey, Joni Mitchell still has it, Wally<br />would be proud!
6304681011|5.0|This is not the kind of film you watch and forget. It has an effect whether you like it or not since it invokes a deeper reality. How much I enjoy PK Dick stories like UBIK,  the Six Dimensions from the American Book of the Dead, and films like Siesta, and The Sixth Sense. Sometimes I wonder if I am odd because I like to explore the \\"underworld\\" - which is happening all the time, even as you read this, and if you don't know what I mean or believe it, watch \\"Carnival of Souls.\\" -- (beetlejuice, beetlejuice,...)
B00004Z4WR|3.0|This is the kind of movie that people see for the car chases.  They might even go see it for the chicks or the VERY GOOD soundtrack(especially in the opening credits).  <br />They sure as heck don't see it for the acting.
B000069HK2|2.0|I find that bad emo tends to sound like Third Eye Blind with more distortion and a lot of unnecessary screaming. That's more or less what this album is. I bought it because I heard 'The Taste of Ink' on the radio and thought it was a great song. This is what I get for buying a pop album. <br />I give this record two stars because 'The Taste of Ink' is an excellent song, and because it serves as an example of what is wrong with mainstream music. Bands don't release great albums any more. They release one or two great songs bookended by 35 minutes of filler. There is no real difference between the other 11 songs, except that some are a little bit slower, or maybe feature more studio effects (I believe one song features the same kind of auto-tuner that Cher uses in one of her recent singles). The Used bring out all the stock emo tricks: screaming for emphasis, occasional incoherent mumbling in the background, and some quaint orchestrations to back up the songs with acoustic guitars.<br />Perhaps the most amusing aspect of this album is that they can't get through a song without screaming. Even the ballad 'On My Own' is embellished with screams, in spite of the fact that nothing in the song warrants them. But the screams that made me laugh the most were the ones at the end of 'Bulimic' (an eating disorder.. how emo!). They come as the rest of the song is fading out, leaving me to believe that they were aiming for a \\"Look at me, I'm screaming\\" approach to their vocals.<br />If you're really interested in listening to some emotional music, try any Bright Eyes album, or Jimmy Eat World's \\"Clarity\\" (even their most recent album is better than this ...).
B00006LSM3|5.0|It makes you think doesn't it? I mean since the Dark Horse passed on last year you have got to wonder whether or not you think the album is good because of what it contains or because of sentimentality and nostalgia. This dilema has preoccupied me since I purchaed this on Tuesday and I am sure that I have resolved it for myself.<br />I like this album for a number of reasons...for the folksy songs of George Harrison, for the pleasant sound of his guitar playing, for the Jeff Lynne ELO bit, for the skill with which George had of putting a catchy tune together, for the songs and well...because it is George and I have bought every one of his albums since Wonderwall and Electronic Sounds.<br />This album is very evocative. There are many little things within it which are reminiscent of his other albums and the Beatles. Mostly it is about god and George's deeply felt personal beliefs. The question of god of course has many facets and Catholics will pick up on P2 Vatican Blues. If you were educated by the Christian Brothers this track will have even more poignancy. It just goes to show that you can be spiritual with a good tune and not sound hectorng. Religion is clearly a very integral part of George's life which permeated every aspect of his being. The songs clearly demonstrate that his love and feelings, for family, friends and the wider world are all part of his beliefs. He displays enormous compassion and a realism which underscores the clarity of vision with which he viwed the world.<br />In many ways this is Living in The Material World II but in many other ways this album is a distillation of all of his life's work. The musicians including his son Dhani are renowned for their contributions to rock and other idioms over the last forty years or so but they are friends and peers too. This is a serious album of serious songs, but it is a little comic too (and cosmic, not taking itself too seriously and harking back to All Things Must Pass (& 2000). George also directs some criticism at the world of pop today by expressing the simplicity of making his own music with instruments not by plagiarising others.<br />As I play this album for the umpteenth time in the car I cannot help but feel that this is a beautiful testimony to a beautiful man who has brought joy to millions and given something back to the world. For those of us who were brought up with the Beatles, he has been our concience and our spiritual sky. We may not share his religious or philosophical beliefs but he has shown us that there is more to life and for that I am sure we are thankful.<br />This is an eloquent eulogy for the quiet one who has passed on and is born again.The wheel keeps turning and we all go round again.some criticism at the world of pop today by expressing the simplicity of making his own music with instruments not by plagiarising others.<br />As I play this album for the umpteenth time in the car I cannot help but feel that this is a beautiful testimony to a beautiful man who has brought joy to millions and given something back to the world.

B00006JKOL|5.0|1st of all I must warn anyone looking to buy this that the 'live' bonus tracks are studio snippets from a radio program already released on the 20th Ann. Box Set.  So forget about them, they fade out after a min. or so....however, this to me is one of Jethro Tull's most amazing lps.  the inclusion of Summerday Sands and Pan Dance only enhance it's beauty!!  Absolutely recommended!!
B00005YW4H|2.0|All the songs are the same.  Same tempo, minimal backing, similar vocal phrasing.  I respect Jone's talent, but give me some spark!  Maybe for a dinner pary or something, but for concentrated listening it doesn't cut it.  I need some soul, baby!  Maybe she has it, but I'm missing any sense of urgency or a sense that she's experienced stuff in her life.  Maybe with age or a different song selection we'll see some more energy.
B000002U9L|4.0|A lovely and silly little CD....the Labyrinth was my very first introduction to Bowie, and these songs were what gave me my taste for him.  Good music, particularly the song from the Escher room scene, &quot;Within You&quot;.  The CD is almost worth it just for that song.  Nice listening, I quite suggest this one.
B00006RU5B|5.0|This album was a long time coming.  When I first heard about the line-up, I was excited but also slightly apprehensive. RAGE were renowned for their politically uncompromising lyrics.  I wondered whether we were essentially going to have RATM Part II, with Cornell being  the the voice to launch the groups political sentiments.  Being a huge Soundgarden fan, I had hoped that this would not be the case, and that Cornell would stick to writing songs about life generally (as he's so good at it).<br />This album had also been hyped so much that it seemed inevitable that it would fail to live up to the perilously high expectations of the masses.  However, I can happily say that this is quite possibly the album of the year.  Fans of RAGE and Soundgarden alike will not be disappointed.  <br />The album opens up with &quot;Cochise&quot;, with Tom Morello creating a helicopter-effect which launches an incredibly Led Zepplin-esque, pounding song.  The next two songs continue in a similarly exhilirating fashion.  Those effects-laden riffs which epitomised the RAGE sound are still there, as are the thundering bass rhythms.  Cornell's vocals sound incredible: he has moved away from the more mellow styling of his solo album , &quot;Euphoria Morning&quot; and has reverted to his unique, vocal chord-shredding sound which earned Soundgarden its army of fans.  <br />The diversity of the group is first showcased on track 4, &quot;What you are.&quot;   Morello's show stealing solos, in which he created a plethora of amazing sounds, were always one of the biggest treats on any RAGE album.  On this song, he shows his capability of creating more subtle effects, which a<BR>slowly build the atmosphere of the song - although admittedly, he has a funky solo towards the end!  This more mellow style is explored further on &quot;I am the Highway&quot; and &quot;Shadow on the Sun&quot;, which is looking as though it will succeed as my personal favourite.  It starts with a steady verse which explodes into a gutteral, roaring chorus.  Cornell sounds incredible.  <br />I have not listened to anything but this album for the past week.  It is completely addictive; a rollercoaster of a ride which fluctuates from brutally hard tunes to more mellow song-stylings.  However, I do have a minor complaint,and that is the last two songs.  &quot;Getaway Car&quot; is far from impressive.  The lyrics border on being sappy and the song just never goes anywhere: you wait for it to take off, but it never does.  This is also the case with &quot;The Last Remaining Light.&quot;  Maybe these flaws would not be so conspicuous if they were not lumped together right at the end of the album. Perhaps if they were sandwiched between some of the other gems, like &quot;Gasoline&quot; and &quot;Show me how to Live&quot;, their failings would be less apparent.  But after the blinding ride that is the rest of the album, during which the listener is on a permanent high, these songs disappoint.  It would have been better if they had just been left out, leaving a 12 song album that puts the vast majority of other bands out there to shame.
B000002H72|5.0|...  No other band has ever captured my imagination in the same way.  ...I never wavered in my love for this album.  Surfer Rosa is great; Doolittle is a life changing experience of an album.
B00006LSM3|5.0|With all the fantastic reviews appearing about \\"Brainwashed\\" I<BR>just wanted to add one more thing: the presence of WISDOM<BR>in the lyrics.  This is especially true in the song<BR>RISING SUN------that song is chock-full of divine wisdom...<BR>and I think George should be given credit for this.  <BR>Those who study mysticism, whether Buddhist style, Kaballah,<BR>etc., will appreciate the lyrics---they really induce<BR>divine ecstasy if you can dig it.  Can you???  If not, you<BR>must be BRAINWASHED!<BR>Also, I didn't see this mentioned: the instrumental track,<BR>MARWA BLUES-----this is the most beautiful thing you've<BR>ever heard----just like some heavenly angel is playing<BR>sweeeeeet guitar just for you.  Thanks, George.  For Everything.
B00004XONN|3.0|The Bends is without a doubt my favorite Radiohead album.  It's brilliant and catchy and touching.  OK Computer is great too, but it's where the band began to take themselves too seriously and become pretentious.  Pretentious is the only word I can think of to describe Kid A.  Radiohead is a great band, but they don't need to make an album that sounds like Kraftwerk for God's sake.  Only the song &quot;Optimistic&quot; really does anything for me here.  It is good enough to take the place of that song &quot;Fitter?Happier&quot; on OK Computer that sounds like a Speak and Spell.  I just wish that this tremendously talented band would get over it's egos and make a truly great album again instead of having these elaborate literally illusions.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Chris Cornell teams up with three ex-members of Rage Against the Machine to deliver a bonecrushing rock album. With Chris' great powerful vocals and Tom Morellos hard guitar riffs, it's nearly impossible to believe that this album gets irritating. Rage fan's who crave Tom Morello's solos (In such songs as &quot;What you are&quot;, &quot;Shadow of the Sun&quot;, and &quot;Hypnotize&quot;) will not be disappointed. Cornell's lyrics and vocals mixes greatly within the album. Songs that I would recommend listening to would be &quot;Chocise&quot;, &quot;Shadow of the Sun&quot;, and &quot;Show me how to Live&quot;. For people who want another Rage Against the Machine album, then they will have to wait for Zach de la Rocha's project, but for people who want to hear Chris Cornell's voice and want a LOUD rock album, then AudioSlave is the one to own.<br />(Just to let some of you know, this is not another Rage Against the Machine album. It's a different band and has nothing to do with politics)
B00005QDW1|5.0|Despite some of the poor reviews that this album has gotten, I felt that No Doubt came through \\"hella\\" good.

B00005QGAV|5.0|While this 1991 LP hardly needed remastering, the newly cleaned up sound and production is very welcome and makes an already great album sound better. &quot;She Drives Me Wild&quot;is a Teddy Riley masterpiece that makes broken glass, car horns and heavy percussion all sound insanely musical and funky,<br />while &quot;Dangerous&quot;(the brilliant title track also produced by Riley) still slams as hard as it did a decade ago and Jackson's deep, spoken word delivery haunts you long after the track is over. Now is the perfect time for a new generation to discover the last truly great New Jack Swing LP of the 90's.

B00005OAIE|5.0|When I heard the Dave Matthews comparisons, I almost never even listened to the album, since DMB is one of the worst bands on the planet.

Go pick this one up, you won't regret it.
B000002L80|5.0|A long-time favourite of mine, \\"Little Creatures\\" is, and probably will remain, for me the finest slice of pure pop ever made. Though many would criticise the Talking Heads for doing away with much of the experimentation evident on their previous three studio albums (\\"Fear Of Music\\", \\"Remain In Light\\" and \\"Speaking In Tongues\\"), this stripping back allowed David Byrne's unque lyrical wit and great intelligence to come to the fore. Never before or since has pure pop been delivered with such hyperintelligent lyrics and sheer directness.<br />In addition, the sound quality was a big improvement on previous Talking Heads CDs - especially with \\"Speaking In Tongues\\", digital remastering of those is long overdue.<br />The opener \\"And She Was\\", a brilliantly-written tale of a woman who lost her way through drug problems, set the tone - reducing most of the instrumentation of \\"Stop Making Sense\\", Byrne was able to produce accessible music that always surprises the listener - like almost all great musicians. The gentle \\"Give Me Back My Name\\" and \\"Creatures Of Love\\" show David Byrne examining the paradoxes of life and human existence, and always questioning what most people find seemingly obvious (\\"Doctor, doctor, tell me what I am\\" being typical). \\"Lady Don't Mind\\" was a wonderful romantic tale in which Byrne always surprises the listener with his inability to describe a lover.<br />\\"Perfect World\\" and \\"Stay Up Late\\" moved a little toward the funky rhythms of previos albums, and Byrne was effortless once more in his tales of everyday family life, especially on the latter song, which was and remains the most wonderful description of a young child ever committed to disc. \\"Walk It Down\\" and \\"Television Man\\" took Byrne's lyrical genuis into much more serious terrain, and moved into even harder rhythms, with Chris Frantz rock-steady all though. \\"Road To Nowhere\\", the final song on the album, was less brittle but showed Byrne's wonderful sense of irony even more than the previous efforts, resulting in another worthy hit single.<br />\\"Little Creatures\\" has been scarcely ever rivalled as a slice of pure pop. A recording that one can listen to easily over and over without becoming tired, and a unique combination of accessibility and intelligence.fforts, resulting in another worthy hit single.<br />\\"Little Creatures\\" has been scarcely ever rivalled as a slice of pure pop.

B000002WYT|5.0|Dave Matthews Band \\"Crash\\" Album Review<br />\\"Raw Acoustic Nurture for the Soul\\"<br /> Dave Matthews Band is renowned for producing brilliant albums with sound all their own, and the newest album \\"Crash\\" is no exception.  \\"Crash\\" was released in 1996 and the title track is still in high rotation on many music stations.  \\"Crash\\" headlined a sold out American tour, and the album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 Chart.<BR> \\"Crash\\" is a compilation of motivating anthems for everyone who is taking life one day at a time.  The message it sends is one that promotes taking in all you can from your own life experiences.  The dominant theme that I received from the music is about appreciating the people and things that surround you.  It's a funny thing, but I always find myself in a better mood after listening to this particular album.  This positive realism is portrayed so uniquely throughout, even in the mellow, slower tracks.  The upbeat vision is apparent but not in the \\"artificially happy\\" sense that many popular, modern artists seem to use in their music.  You certainly won't find any nauseating, uncoordinated lyrics or melodies in this album.  The songs all sound unique, but at the same time still maintain a grass root charm.  \\"Crash\\" is a prime example of how Dave Matthews Band does not conform to the current trends set down by the media and main stream artists. This allows the musicians to be in a musical category of their own with a fan base that appreciates the music solely on the talent and not on what is being sold and forced upon them.<BR> Trying to discover a few weaknesses for this album was rather painful; however I did manage to pull out a couple.  I am not a huge fan of the saxophone and I would have to disagree with its usage in three of the tracks (Especially in \\"Let You Down\\", \\"Number Forty-One\\", and \\"So Much to Say\\").  It seemed to be placed in at wrong sections and only there to contribute long awkward notes that were found only as an annoying distraction to the whole listening experience. Another song that presented a minor glitch was \\"Two Step\\". At the beginning there is a musical introduction that leads up to the lyrics as most other songs do but in this particular case the lyrics come to late as the introduction drags on. The choices of instruments used during this overture are quite difficult to listen to for the period of time they acquire. This also occurs in \\"Say Goodbye\\" yet the sweet melody soothes the time that is spent in percussions and is found to be a more enjoyable musical experience.  Honestly I was not able to find anymore real faults with the album, except it would have been pleasurable to have had a couple more songs on the album, since there are only twelve.  Other than the faults I presented I can see no other errors in this album.<BR> The strengths of this album were abundant to say the least.  But in regards to the size limit of my review I will only focus on the prominent ones.  My favorite thing about this album would have to be the title track \\"Crash\\".  I absolutely love and adore this track!  It is one of those songs that just invoke so much emotion in me whenever I listen to it.  Countless times I have put this song on repeat before curling up to do a writing assignment.  The soothing melody and diverse instrumental selection act as a catalyst for my mind to inspire my brain to create.  Another major artistic element that I could not over look would have to be the sheer abundance of creative originality.  The sound of this album is completely different then anything else I have heard before.  It seems impossible for me to name all of the instruments that appear within most of the songs while the audio variation in this CD is impeccably refreshing.  Melodic repetition is definitely not a barrier in this album; each song has its own style.  I found the lyrics in this album to be so inspirational on such a real and personal level.   The song \\"Too Much\\" is about a man complaining about his all of bad habits and how he needs to take charge and make changes in his life. This is a common scenario for all if not the majority of us; everyone is always talking about quitting or starting something to better their lives.<BR> I would most definitely recommend this album to anyone who enjoys high-quality and originally composed music. Any Dave Mathews Band album would receive \\"two thumbs up\\" from me, but \\"Crash\\" is an obvious personal favorite of mine. The songs have the irreducible capability of setting the mood for various occasions while the melodies vary from energetic fast pace tracks to a mature lullaby style. This is the kind of CD that you don't have to worry about censoring when there are children present. After listening to this CD a million times I have  not once heard a swear word or a rude racial comment. (This is rare to find in music these days) The music sells its self without the help of racy or controversial lyrics, which can't be said for many music groups. To me this shows true talent, and the signs of a group that's music will never fade out. The album \\"Crash\\" is a modern classic that should be a prime focal point in any music lover's collection.

In \\"Hudsucker\\" they give us a magical world that hovers in time between 1930 and 1960 and fills it with Art Deco scenery, hard-bitten reporters, greedy tycoons, innocent rubes, and your favorite Whammo fads.<br />Our fable begins with the whimsical suicide of Hudsucker Industries' CEO (the always entertaining Charles Durning) and the elevation of a naive mailboy with big dreams, Norville Barnes (Tim Robbins), to his position. As scripted by the cigar-smoking corporate spinmeister, Sidney J. Mussburger (Paul Newman), Hudsucker will be thrashed by the press for its brazen stupidity, the stock will dive, the board will buy up huge amounts of it, then Mussburger will steer the company back, making everyone rich. But Norville has a better idea.<br />So does star reporter, Amy Archer (Jennifer Jason Leigh doing her best Hepburn/Russell), who like her no-holds-barred sibling in \\"Mr. Deeds Goes to Town\\" wants to get the inside scoop on the new boy in town. Determined to get the best of the hick, she sidles up to him via her new \\"job\\" as his secretary, only to find his earnestness and honesty a glaring contrast to her own shriveled morality. Soon, unbeknownst to him, he wins her heart.<br />Soon, too, his new idea for a product sweeps the nation in a fad never before seen, jacking Hudsucker's stock far out of the picture for the now angry board. Determined to stop the record profits, Mussburger engineers a fall for Norville that will surely lead to him taking the permanent plunge, just as the company's namesake did.<br />But this is a true fable, so the supernatural element enters the picture in a delightfully satisfying way. The holiday theme near the end of the picture adds to the magic, making the picture a warm way to prepare for the season.<br />Some have accused \\"The Hudsucker Proxy\\" of being all gloss and no substance, a Frank Capra or Preston Sturges film that is easy on the eye yet lifeless, but I disagree strongly. The massive set design and powerful architecture in the film only serve to highlight the concept of mankind at odds with its own surroundings, good people out of place in a world that is too big for any of them. And that is the point of good fables, that what is real are the people and their courageous, honest, sincere lives, not the settings in which they act out their morality plays.<br />So forget the horrid title and buy \\"The Hudsucker Proxy\\". And for those that are fans of great production and set design, folks, this is how it is done. Fans of fables will not be left unsatisfied, either.<br />Rated \\"PG\\" for some adult themes (like suicide and other forms of personal destruction) and a tiny bit of talk, this film can be enjoyed by anyone from young teens up.<br />(This review covers the VHS version.)manent plunge, just as the company's namesake did.<br />But this is a true fable, so the supernatural element enters the picture in a delightfully satisfying way.

B00006LSM3|4.0|The album would sound like a bit of a Beatles/Jeff Lynne (producer) pastiche, were it not for the theme \\"Marwa Blues.\\" Don't ask me why, but I get the same feeling when I listen to this hypnotic instrumental, that I got when I first heard the track \\"Free As A Bird\\" in the first Beatles Anthology album... it's as if, George came \\"back\\" to play this beautiful song. Not that I would throw the rest of the album to the trash: far from that, considering it contains the last tracks recorded by George before his sad passing, but the voice in some of the tracks really is not at George's best, which is to be expected, considering he died of lung cancer. However, this makes the whole album all the more valuable: it shows his courage and perseverance, in spite of his illness. The last track is topped with an excerpt of Indian music at the end. Enjoy, you fans... and welcome to George's cloud.
0780622553|5.0|Wow! A new film has entered the pantheon of my all-time favorites, and it zooms right into the top ten. That film is \\"Dark City\\" and I cannot encourage sci-fi/fantasy fans enough to see this film any way they can. It's superb!<br />With its roots firmly planted in the writings of Serling, Dick, and Kafka, \\"Dark City\\" weaves a tale that successfully blends film noir, German surrealism, horror, and sci-fi with the vision of Alfred Hitchcock, Tim Burton, Terry Gilliam, and Fritz Lang. It tells the tale of a man who wakes up to a living nightmare in which he not only does not know who he is, but also finds a dead prostitute in the hotel room in which he has unknowingly been living for the last three weeks. His only possessions are the clothes he is wearing, a piece of luggage, and a postcard from \\"Shell Beach\\", a place that stirs childhood memories. As he tries to piece together the life he cannot remember, he it dawns on him that he knows more than the rest of the world around him.<br />John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell - think a swarthy, young Christopher Walken) finds that he also has a beautiful wife (the lovely Jennifer Connelly - who seems to be making a living today playing women from the late Forties) and a companion in the mysterious Dr. Schreber (the unusually cast Keifer Sutherland doing a jarring Peter Lorre imitation). Pursued by an angst-ridden detective (the previously MIA William Hurt), and memories of a place he cannot reach, Murdoch tries to hold onto his love for his wife only to find that it may be an illusion. His desperate gamble to find the truth uncovers a horrific reality he could never have imagined.<br />\\"Dark City\\" is a master stroke. Every shot of this movie screams quality. The special effects are outstanding and do not overwhelm the film. The characters speak plausible dialog. Cinematographer Dariusz Wolski lensed this film even more capably than his work in \\"The Crow\\". Rarely, too, can a team work to create a world so timeless. The city and people of \\"Dark City\\" seemed trapped in an era-less reality, as portions of the Thirties, Forties, Fifties, and beyond disorientingly converge. Again, \\"Wow!\\"<br />\\"Dark City\\" is a mostly Australian production, so it had little fanfare when it hit the screens in 1998 (which may have worked in the film's favor.) It's non-Hollywood production is evident in the concept and its realization on screen. Though it is not without its borrowings; it liberally selects the best elements of such films as \\"Brazil\\", \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\", \\"Metropolis\\", \\"Batman\\", \\"Dune\\", \\"Kafka\\", \\"The Crow\\", and \\"Hellraiser\\". The latter film is one of the few quibbles I have about \\"Dark City\\". The similarity in the costume design to the Cenobites in \\"Hellraiser\\" is too close for comfort. In fact, the very first time I saw the trailer for this film I initially thought it was a \\"Hellraiser\\" sequel. The villains' costuming in their underground city is perfect,... Otherwise, the production values are superb, creating a world and mythos that seem entirely plausible.<br />And that is the power of this film. Its dystopian vision, plotline, and fully realized production make it totally unique despite its \\"where have I seen this before\\" elements. That the film industry still has original ideas bubbling under its worn surface is exciting to me as I look forward to the next film by \\"Dark City\\"'s creator Alex Proyas, who was also the vision behind \\"The Crow\\", a film this greatly resembles.<br />Interestingly, \\"The Matrix\\" and \\"Dark City\\" are remarkably similar in their basic outline. \\"Dark City\\" was the earlier film, beating \\"The Matrix\\" to the screen by almost a year. Both films are excellent, but the nod goes to \\"Dark City\\" for its more fully realized plot, better acting, and overall sense of menace. It's a more gripping film than its rival, depending more on dialogue, characterization, and sense of utter foreboding that \\"The Matrix\\" counters with more physical action and its groundbreaking special effects. Asa result, the story of \\"Dark City\\" plays out more effectively than \\"The Matrix\\".<br />\\"Dark City\\" is rated \\"R\\" mostly for nudity, violence, and intensity. The murders are never shown onscreen, though the partially naked bodies of the victims needlessly are. And mega-kudos to the writers, who in keeping with the timeless nature of the setting, avoided ALL profanity! Again, as I have always contended, excellent writing never needs to stoop to that level in most films. Still, this is a film for adults.<br />Buy the DVD, close the doors, turn out the lights and watch \\"Dark City\\" soon. It's a winner!a result, the story of \\"Dark City\\" plays out more effectively than \\"The Matrix\\".<br />\\"Dark City\\" is rated \\"R\\" mostly for nudity, violence, and intensity.

B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aguilera has really redefined herself with this CD. She has broken away from the 'pop-princess' stamp and has made a true statement. She is probably the most talented singer in modern music. The fact that Christina wrote almost all the lyrics on this album is also amazing. There are some strong songs in the CD. All of the tracks would get a '5' except maybe Dirrty, i would probably give it a '4.5' because it doesn't seem to have the passion behind it that all of the other tracks have. All in all, this is an awesome CD, and even if you swore you hate Christina Aguilera, try it. I'll bet you you'll change your mind about her.
B00006YXEK|4.0|Great to hear more from a truly unigue and creative voice. Special thanks to Dhani for putting this together. As George says himself in the DVD, &quot;real people, playing acoustic guitars, into a microphone and onto tape.&quot; I don't think he was attempting to oversimplify the process, but actually pointing out the obvious: people admire, and enjoy, music created by musicians, not machines.
B00006SFLV|5.0|I am so glad I never watched this show when it was first on, because I would have been outraged when it was cancelled. Instead, I caught the marathon on MTV - I watched every episode, back-to-back, and enjoyed every second of every episode. A couple of years later, I got into watching Dawson's Creek and was highly amused by how every single high school character talked like a college scholar. I thought that it was refreshing. But now, looking back at My So-Called Life, I realize that it was so much better than any teen drama today. Angela Chase (wonderfully portrayed by Claire Danes) is like a lot of girls in high school: shy, insecure, and in love with the cutest (and baddest) boy in school. She never used big words, she never tried to be clever or cute. In other words, she is the realistic version of a high school student. She had a wild and crazy best friend, a geeky boy across the street who loved her, caring parents, a sometimes-annoying younger sister, and ultimately the coolest guy in school as her boyfriend. A lot of people thought the Angela/Jordan relationship was a little far-fetched, asking themselves what he would ever see in a girl like her. I thought the idea of their relationship was wonderful, far-fetched or not: it showed young women that they don't have to be easy and dress provocatively to get guys to notice them.<br />To this day, I'm still amazed that this show was so short-lived. It dealt with serious issues such as drugs, sex, violence, and it dealt with them realistically. I realize now that My So-Called life was the clever one, not Dawson's Creek. This DVD is  a must-have for the many die-hard fans the show still has today. One thing is for sure: the show may have been cancelled, but it will never be forgotten.
B000002UAI|5.0|It seems to be common wisdom that the Beatles were \\"weary\\" when they cranked out this, their second LP of 1964 - a year that also featured a movie, several tours, and many hit singles and EPs. All I can say is I don't hear the weariness; growing songwriting maturity, perhaps, but not weariness. Their one-take performance of Chuck Berry's \\"Rock N'Roll Music\\" is an energetic bolt of joy that I think is even better than Berry's fine original. The other covers are fun too, from Paul's barrelhouse vocals on \\"Kansas City\\" to the gorgeous harmonies and glittering guitar sound on Buddy Holly's \\"Words of Love\\" to the carefree jam of Carl Perkins' \\"Honey Don't\\" to the lounge lizard organ on \\"Mister Moonlight.\\" George Harrison's guitar work throughout is more expert than any he had yet recorded, and his solos on \\"Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby\\" are rockn'roll at its purest. As for the Lennon/McCartney originals, I sense a depth of craftmanship that is superb. \\"No Reply,\\" \\"I'm A Loser,\\" \\"Eight Days a Week,\\" and \\"Baby's In Black\\" would have been maserpieces for any other band. For the Beatles, they're just more of the  many classics. What's not to enjoy? Enjoy!
B00005RHGK|5.0|The answer is in the movie. It is very scary, but the main characters are idiots. Oh well, at least it is scary and has a really cool bad guy. I had a probelm with the ending, but it was still good. See it!
B00006LSM3|4.0|This is a very good CD--classic Harrison.  It is spiritual, playful and thoughtful.  It's sad to realize that I will never again experience listening to a new George Harrison CD, but reassuring to know that his wonderful music will live on forever.
B00006YXEK|5.0|George's final songs indicate the immense struggle and sense of mortality he must have felt in those final months...as he prepared for the journey away from those he cared deeply for in the physical world (Olivia/Dhani). \\"Brainwashed\\" also indicates a sense of peace and excitement for his journey to meet his God.<br />The material is reminiscent of the work he did with the Travelin' Wilburys and his solo works \\"Living in the Material World\\" and \\"All Things Must Pass\\", but also convey a stronger sense of confidence in his own work.  His courage to work and leave a final gift to all of us shows that despite the trappings his soul felt being stuck in the physical being of a rock idol, he deeply wanted to reach out and touch those fans who stuck with him during his sometimes chaotic career.<br />I recommend the Special Edition which contains a short DVD with some brief, candid conversation with George as well as feelings of Dhani, Jeff Lynne and others who worked on finishing the album. It also contains a poster, Dark Horse sticker, and guitar pick.<br />George, I hope you have found peace...thank you for the gift of music and film you have left behind...and the gentle spirituality you conveyed in a world of chaos.

B000001ZS5|4.0|Jean  Michel  Jarre  is  an  artist  who  gets  ridiculed  by  some  people  in  the  music  industry . It  is  unfair  of  them  to  think  that  because  much  of  his  material  is  outstanding  and  truly  moving . This  CD  is  no  exception . Although  having  said  that  you  can  see  why  people  tend  to  criticize  him  on  this  album . There  is  a  couple  of  tracks  on  it  where  they  don't  get  the  imagination  going  and  in  the  case  of  part  5 , it  is  an  utter  joke .... a  horrible  mess  that  sounds  like  it  was  played  on  some  kid's  toy  piano . But  other  than  that  the  album  is  very  good  but  I  would  advise  you  to  start  elsewhere  if  you  are  thinking  of  buying  a  Jean  Michel  Jarre  album

0321127420|3.0|First, I'd like to say that I think Marin Fowler is awesome. I've been a long time fan of his and I really enjoy his talks and his books. So when you read this review, you can tell that it pains me to write what I have to say. I don't want to rip apart his book so that he potentially sells fewer copies - that's not my intention at all. By writing 3 books myself, I appreciate that authors don't make a lot of money for developing the book itself. Usually people like Martin write books for the experience and to generally help people. <br />That being said, many developers will unfortunately not find this book very useful. Many of the patterns Martin shows us have a lot of dependency on the platform you are using to implement the application. For instance, if you use Microsoft's .NET platform, you are going to be leaning towards a Table Module instead of a Domain Model. If you do not use a Table Module, you will not be able to take advantage of a considerable amount of functionality that is provided for you within the .NET platform. In Java, the same is true; the Table Module doesn't look as appealing if you are using EJBs, JDO or even Hibernate - you won't ever consider it. <br />Many of the patterns in the book have this characteristic described above, so architects won't actually learn anything from them. In other words, architects will not be able to take advantage of these alternate design patterns without some initial headaches that are often not worth it because the platform they use restricts and penalizes their usage. <br />Another complaint about the book is that many of the patterns are already available as frameworks. For instance, many of the presentation patterns are handled by frameworks like Struts or Webwork. In these cases, learning about the patterns that are associated with these frameworks will provide little value.  These patterns have already been discussed many times before in other books like \\"Advanced Java Server Pages\\" for example. <br />The same could also be said for persistence frameworks of O/R mapping tools. There is literally over a 100 pages (in a 500 page book) that talk about lazy loads, unit of work, locking strategies, metadata patterns and inheritance mappings. Although sometimes they are useful, in most situations the developers would be abstracted away from all these underlying mechanics using a good persistence framework or O/R mapping tool. I realize not all that the this is true, but implementing Martin's suggestions would take a month or two alone if you didn't buy anything off the shelf - that's too much time to waste. Martin should have talked more about these tools and the patterns they currently implemented instead as this is a more pragmatic approach. <br />Martin also doesn't talk about the load-on-startup servlet that can be used to store application-scoped values in the ServletContext (for J2EE systems) in his Registry pattern. This was unfortunate because many non-ejb systems use this approach. Considering the book advocates using POJOs, JDO or JDBC instead of EJBs (which is sound advice in practice for most systems), they didn't cover the registry alternates for this approach. Many of us use containers like Resin because they are extremely fast and have no need for EJB development. <br />Coming from three different environments myself (PHP, .NET and J2EE), I was disappointed that I didn't learn anything from this book. I had, in fact, learned about many of these patterns on my own, but didn't exactly know what they were called. This left me disappointed, but it's not Martin's fault. I don't mean to build me up that I know everything, but I think I've reached a plateau when it comes to designing and architecting systems - I'm good at it. If you happen to be a good designer too and you think you might want to broaden your knowledge, then this book won't help in those areas. If this book doesn't, I don't think you'll find another book that will either. So again, this isn't Martin's fault. <br />Now before you say something, Martin explicitly states in his book that many experienced designers *will not* learn much. He mentions more than a few times that this book is meant to enhance the communication between architects and designers more than anything and that it is meant to be a documented repository of patterns that we know as an industry and use over and over. I completely agree with these statements. Thus, the book has value in these regards and it will definitely help the industry evolve and mature. <br />I know I've said some negative things about the book, but let's face it - this is Martin Fowler! The quality and style of the writing is top notch and the organization of the information couldn't have been better. The explanations and examples are very clear and this book is what it claims to be. In this respect, the book should be regarded as the best in its market. <br />I would advocate purchasing this book in combination with \\"EJB Design Patterns\\" and \\"Expert One-On-One: J2EE Design and Development\\" for the J2EE developer. As for you .NET folks, I have no idea. From experience, I suspect that .NET developers will have even less use for this book since Microsoft has limited your choices about design in favour of simplifying the platform. That's one of the major differences between J2EE and .NET, and Martin can't control that either.<br />Overall, this is a good book. I give it only 3 stars, however, because of the initial problems described above.
B000001E3L|3.0|I am a huge Van fan.  Van is clearly one of the best at what he has been doing for the past 30 years.   That is were this album disappoints.  On the ablum his guests perfom what seems to be at least half of the ablum.  Not that they aren't talented, it is just that they are clearly not Van.  Also I am not a big fan of medlies.  I prefer No Guru, Poetic Champions and Into The Music.  Next will be Its Too Late To Stop Now.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers are very exciting drama.  the movie's sound is very reality and wonderful.  Actor's acting is very excellent.<BR>I think that true leadership is devoution and self-sacrifice.  Capt.

B000066NW0|2.0|Avril brings to my mind the following words by Wolfgang A. Mozart: \\"The golden meam, the truth, is no longer recognized or valued. To win applause one must write stuff so simple that a coachman might sing it, or so incomprehensible that it pleases simply because no sensible man can comprehend it\\". As a great professor (Neuhaus?) once wrote, \\"Talent is passion plus intellect\\". You are cool, Avril, but how about a little visit to the Conservatory before even attempting to write your own music? Oh, I see, you are too cool to lose your time at school!

B00006M183|4.0|Any artist with any lasting value has many peaks and valleys. They often go from being the biggest musicians on earth to cult status in just a few years. This seemingly is what has happened to Pearl Jam and as a result they are just as great a band now as they were when they released Ten. Riot Act doesn't rank as high on my list of Pearl Jam albums as some of the others but its yet another exciting album from a band that keeps moving forward with each new album. Songs such as Can't Keep, Save You, and Love Boat Captain prove that the band can still deliver memorable songs and the album should sound great live. As usual on a Pearl Jam album the lyrics are very insightful and the band's playing is exciting. Its nice to know that there is a band out there today with the musical quality of classic bands like Led Zeppelin, The Who, and The Doors. In a modern era full of one hit wonders and mediocre albums Pearl Jam is as musically adventerous and relevant in 2002 as they were in 1991.

I don't see why huge Beatles fans are disappointed with this record. This is a must for all Beatles fans!<br />I highly recommend '#1's', by the Beatles.<br />Score:<BR>99/100<BR>A+
B000002IU9|5.0|First this album has the best drums and guitar solo i have ever heard in all my life, all the lyrics are well done.<br />In the first song (well in the first eight songs) they make a combination of all their styles that they have made on their previus albums, and te rest of the songs are well maded ,metal warriors is hymn for all people how loves the metal, with ride the dragon i think is one the best songs of Manowar and with master of the wind is the most soft song of Manowar, well in conclusion this album has a very big variety of styles.<br />Well this is an album that all the fans of Manowar they have to have.
B00006AG5N|5.0|It is a pity that there are still ignorant things out there like kosmo77 who just can't accept that fact that music is universal, it is for the world. It is kosmo77 who is a racist. Nobody accuses Charley Pride of stealing the white man song, or Nat \\"King Cole stealing Bing Crosby's song. And to say that ELvis stole Mama Thornton song is contradiction. Kosmo just mentioned Elvis did not write his own materials and I thought Hound Dog was compsed by LEiber and Stoller, two white kids. This CD is Rock and Roll 101, period. Did Tiger Woods steal a white man's sport?
0316666343|5.0|This book was by far the most depressing thing I have ever read in my life. While the characters developed well throughout the story, and the plot development kept me interested, I admit I had to put it down from time to time. This was not a book to sit through in one read. The subject matter was obviously going to be tough, but I had no clue it would make me feel so sad!! So while I HIGHLY reccomend the read, I also highly reccomend a box of tissues and some Prozac to go with it.
B00005R62N|5.0|I remember when I was in 9th grade living in Atlanta and could not wait for the release of this album--yes, album,not cd--I still jam like hell to it at the age of 38.Trust me when I say this one is priceless---how could anyone not like &quot;victim of changes&quot; or &quot;Sinner&quot; !  This is Priest at their finest !  Considering the lost art of true rock this day and age....it is a MUST HAVE !
B00006RAKP|5.0|I just received the 3-disc set and have enjoyed listening to it all evening. This is a must-buy for anyone who has been a casual Elton John fan who would like to obtain a wonderful compilation of songs that clearly reflect his talents (and those of Bernie Taupin). Unfortuanately, I had not owned any Elton John albums prior to this, and now I'm inclined to acquire his individual albums. For now, I am delighted to have &quot;Your Song,&quot; &quot;Rocket Man,&quot; &quot;Someone Saved My Life Tonight,&quot; &quot;Little Jeannie,&quot; &quot;Sad Songs,&quot; &quot;Candle In the Wind,&quot; and many other tunes that are simply delightful to listen to. The CD insert is also terrific, providing a brief history of Elton John and his collaborative efforts with Bernie Taupin, replete with photos galore. This CD makes a great gift, to oneself or to others.
B00006AG5N|5.0|25 years after his death and he is still Number 1 around the world. He recently had a Top 10 hit with America The Beautiful, ELVIS The Concert has been playing to sold out houses around the world since 1997, and now here is this phenomenal compilation of beloved tunes dominating the music scene. Hey, 1,000,000,000 People Can't Be Wrong. Just his sales since 1977 is better than 5 to 1 over his next nearest competition. Sure we've heard these tunes before, but that's the point. It is to show the unprecedented artistry of the man that historians voted the 57th most important person of the last 1000 years, as well as The Artist of the Century. He'll defend that title this century as well . . . And I remember when they used to parallel his career to Pat Boone's like they were in competition . . . A whole new generation of children discovered his music this year in the movie Lilo & Stitch and 15 million people have toured his home over the last 20 years. Once this new generation absorbs this music, they will branch out and find so many more tunes by him. Until this year the mainstream had never heard the song \\"Little Less Conversation.\\" It was buried since 1967 on a panned movie soundtrack. What is surprising is how little was done to the original jam to update it. The beauty of ELVIS is that you never stop discovering him. My favorite ELVIS tune is a song called \\"Life\\" from the album Love Letters. Wait until you hear that ditty! As Alanah miles sang in the song about ELVIS \\"Black Velvet,\\" \\"IT'S A NEW RELIGION THAT'LL BRING YOU TO YOUR KNEES.\\"
B0000696ID|5.0|ET the Extra-Terrestrial is one of those timeless films that seems to reach out to the child in all of us. Magical, enthralling and spectacular special effects (who can forget that eye-catching sequence of Elliot riding past the full moon on his bike with E.T in the front basket), a generally heart warming story, immpecabble performances from its cast and lots of fun and jumpy moments to endure along the way. The film even as an adult manages to capture your emotions and the ending is sure to leave a big lump in your throat!! This classic movie makes a successful transisition to the DVD format which possibly enhances the special effects and spectacular stunts even greater and that are still vastly impressive. even by todays standards! <BR>When E.T is abandoned by his pot-bellied extra-terrestrial pals, he is quickly befriended by a lonely little boy called Elliot (Henry Thomas). Elliot proceeds to teach his new alien friend to talk, to dress up in women's clothes and even drink beer. It holds many delightfully amusing moments and what the film greatly encapsulates is a refreshing, sentimental twist to it. Positivley an exciting adventure from beginning to end. The cast also includes a young Drew Barrymore as Gertie, Elliots younger sister who quickly befriends the friendly alien too, Dee Wallace as Mary, Peter Coyote as Keys and Robert MacNaughton as Michael. The film is mesmerising when watching this as a child and E.T remains Steven Speilbergs most enthralling masterpieces. The interesting array of extra features on here is enough reason to purchase this DVD in the first place!
B00005JKCH|4.0|When going into adapting a comic to film, there are usually two routes.  The first route is the movie will be utterly disappointing and lacking any of the intensity from the book it is adapted from (see the Spawn live action film for example), while the second route is a riveting, very well put together film that carries the essence of the comic (the original Superman and Batman and the Blade series).  Spider-Man isn't the best comic adaption to film, but this long awaited movie more than delivers the goods.  Tobey Maguire is rather good and believeable as Peter Parker and Spider-Man and seems to be a great choice for the role in the future films, while Kirsten Dunst is as stunning as ever as Mary Jane Watson.  James Franco perfectly captures the personality and insecurity of Harry Osborne, while Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris are very good as well as Uncle Ben and Aunt May.  But the best casting and performance goes to Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin/Norman Osborne, he is absolutely perfect as the maniacal schizo and is clearly having a lot of fun in his role, while an almost as perfect performance by J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, who is perfectly cast and looks just like the character does in the comic.  Director Sam Raimi (director of the cult classics Evil Dead Trilogy and the original Darkman) directs with his usual stylish flair (along with some shameless corporate promotions) and is a great example of how to make a comic adapted film with a director who knows the comic...  All in all, Spider-Man may not be up there with the original Superman, Batman, and Blade, but it is more than worth a look...
630469878X|5.0|A superb road movie with a difference! Director Ridley Scott shrewdly puts himself in the women's driving seat and depicts a tale of two longstanding friends who go on a weekend spree to escape their usual, monotonous small-town routines. What they have in common is both are dissatisfied with their respective partners. However what is intended as a wild holiday turns into a nightmare. Thelma (Geena Davis) and Louise (Susan Sarandon) hit a nightclub on their first night of freedom. Louise catches the eye of a man who at the end of the night trys to rape her. Catching him just as he is about to proceed with his vicious attack, Louise shoots the man. They are then plunged into a series of adventures as they head towards Mexico, dodging the police and intending to begin a new life. It is subsequently revealed that Louise herself was raped some years before which explained why she hastily shot the would-be rapist. Brad Pitt also stars in one of his earliest apperances playing J D, where Thelma quickly succumbs to his somewhat cocky charm. The film actually seemed to be a watershed for both Michael Marsden and Harvey Kietel who both went to bigger things (including starring together in 1992's masterpiece Reservoir Dogs). Both their performances are effective in this with Marsden playing Louise's long-standing partner and Harvey Kietel as the understanding detective who is hot on their trail though surprisingly displays a lot of empathy for the fugitives situation. As the film neatly unfolds it seems to steer along the voyage of self-discovery. The rich dialogue is complimented by superb, highly effective and concentrated performances from both the versatile Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis. The ending is sure to leave a lump in your throat! There are also some magnificent, eye-catching shots of the Grand Canyon captured along the way. The soundtrack is equally enthralling including tracks from the likes of soul superstars such as The Temptations and Martha Reeves and all add to the effect of this classic masterpiece. Certainly one of the best road movies made after the fantastic Bonnie And Clyde! Whilst there are some great laughs to endure along the way, Thelma And Louise on the whole stands as a compelling and riveting drama.
B00006LJ72|5.0|Listening just casually in the past, the mesmerizing quality of Enya's voice leaves one wanting for more. This excellent collection is a must for anyone not having any of her previous selections on CD.<BR>The complete work here is worth the listen for uplifting inspiration. Enya's relaxing and soothing qualities mixed with the instrumental delight give a combination for soothing any stressful situation. Some of the selections, if never heard before can seem breathtakig. With a 4 disc collection, there is enough variety from the choir like angelic voice for the soul,  to some of the more upbeat motivational sound that help get your day back on track. Music like this is the stuff of life, which some, like myself,  may have been missing. <BR>It makes me realize why I had to buy this as a set to get a full effect. This collection should be highly recommended for anyone not haveing Enya's previous recordings at hand. As a boxed set, it has redeeming gift quality as well. <br />Enya: soothing, spiritual,  uplifting, meditational, motivational,  and plain beautiful. <BR>Voice and instrumental quality is top notch.
B00004R9A4|5.0|Directed by Robert Stevenson, Bedknobs And Broomsticks was a concious effort on the part of Disney to acheive the same blockbuster success it had acheived with the timeless, Mary Poppins. Whilst not quite hitting the heights of success Mary Poppins had endured, Bedknobs and Broomsticks is still superb all round and holds many delightful adventures that is closely as spectacular as Mary Poppins. Angela Lansbury puts in a fantastic performance as amateur witch, Eglantine Price whilst Julie Andrews co-star in Mary Poppins, David Tomlinson turns up in a variation of his character in Poppins playing the stuffy Professor Emelius Browne who quickly befriends Eglantine and the three evacuee children she is looking after. The special effects are still vastly impressive and are enhanced even more greatly by a successful transistion to the DVD format. Whats easily the biggest highlight of the film is the spectacular mix of live-action and animation. The soccer-ball match, with its striking eye-catching mixture of real people with a host of animated animals is done to absolute perfection and the whole combination gels brilliantly together making for as equally enchanting viewing as Poppins, which this film has always been compared to. Some of the songs are a litle monotonous but the film holds so many merits that it becomes easy to overlook that minor flaw. The ending is another spectacular affair with the invasion of the Nazi's and the following battle features some impeccable, well-crafted effects. Like all good classic childrens films, Bedknobs and Broomsticks holds a happy ending and on the whole the film is superb throughout. Plenty of fun adventures and amusing moments and the live action-animated sequences is masterfully done. A classic tale, loosley based on the novels by Mary Norton. Beyond that is an interesting series of features that alone makes this DVD worth purchasing. One of Walt Disney's most enthralling classics!
B00006RU5B|5.0|Finally!  It's about time somebody decided to... rock!  They say most good music is made during economic down turns.  Bring on the recession!! You sound bombastic, and I mean that in a good way!! Thank you Chris, Tom, and the boys!
B00006SFBD|5.0|Opeth have become sort of an underground metal legend in the past few years, and deservedly so.  Although their sound clearly has roots in death metal, at the same time they're willing to go outside the genre and do something completely different.  \\"Deliverance,\\" like every Opeth album, has the guttural vocals and heavy guitars that are the hallmark of death metal, but there's a lot more going on here.  Opeth use acoustic guitars and clean vocals extensively, and it works wonders.  I can't think of any band I've heard that creates such emotionally and musically diverse albums, and Opeth have done it six times now.  I'm not one of those fans that have gone ga-ga over everything Opeth has done, but any way you slice it this album is amazing.<br />Although Opeth are obviously highly skilled musicians, this isn't the most complex or technical metal I've heard.  I think Opeth's real appeal lies in their music's evocative power and in the element of melody that they bring to their sound.  Opeth have a way of playing that manages to convey a lot of emotion, whether you can make out the lyrics or not.  Sometimes the band rages, at other times they sound mournful and contemplative, but it's always obvious that they put a lot of feeling into what they do.  And since Opeth are Swedish, they have tons of those catchy, melodic guitars that give that country's metal its distinctive flavor.<br />The eleven-minute opener \\"Wreath\\" is a fine example of just what makes Opeth such a great and unique band.  Mikael Akerfeldt delivers his vocals in a rumbling, menacing death growl almost reminiscent of Cannibal Corpse's Chris Barnes, but with far more of a melodic sensibility.  And like most of Opeth's songs, it has an epic feel that few extreme metal bands can conjure up.  \\"Wreath\\" is followed by the even longer (thirteen and a half minutes) title track.  \\"Deliverance\\" is definitely my favorite song on the disc, as well as the one that I feel best exemplifies what Opeth are all about.  It starts out, much as \\"Wreath\\" does, with Akerfeldt's menacing death vocals, but then quickly switches to acoustic guitars and clean vocals.  The song ends up being an emotional roller coaster, with myriad shifts in vocal and musical style (the song also has an extremely cool outro).  That's what I like most about Opeth: they seem comitted to exploring a broad range of moods, both with their lyrics (which I'll admit I need to brush up on a bit) and their music.<br />Anyway, the next track, \\"A Fair Judgement,\\" is another gem.  I didn't really like it at first, but like many great songs, it needs a little time.  The vocals are all sung, but that's not a problem at all.  Akerfeldt's singing voice is extremely powerful and emotional, and the song expertly mixes acoustic and electric guitars, so it never gets boring.  I'm not a huge fan of soft or slow music, but \\"A Fair Judgement\\" is just plain mesmerizing.<br />\\"A Fair Judgement\\" is followed by the brief acoustic interlude \\"For Absent Friends,\\" but the album then makes a quick return to heaviness with \\"Master's Apprentices.\\"  This song is loaded with violent guitar work and some of Akerfeldt's scariest and most tortured-sounding vocals, but there's also a mellow acoustic section and a couple of terrific guitar leads.  Needless to say, it rules.  The album concludes with \\"By the Pain I See in Others.\\"  This song is in pretty much the same vein as the others, except it briefly includes some weird vocal effects that I don't recall ever having heard in an Opeth song before.  Other than that, though, it's typical Opeth all the way.<br />Okay, it's come to my attention that this review may have run a tad bit long, but I think it's a testament to Opeth's abilities that they've made my keyboard run over this much.  They're one of the few bands that I think have been able to develop a style that truly can't be imitated.  And this album may be the best example yet of just how good they are.

B00000K19E|3.0|You'd think THE MATRIX was a very special movie indeed based on all the extremely positive comments preceding this one. I must admit that it is quite entertaining and has no boring moments. It features some great special effects and is visually exciting. But these adjectives could also be used to describe an MTV music video. In fact, it seems music videos, along with Japanese animation and the slow motion action scenes from John Woo movies, were the main inspiration for this film. Throw in a science fiction plot containing lots of pseudo scientific jargon and you have a movie that is not only action packed but seems quite intellectual as well. But it is this intellectual aspect of THE MATRIX that I feel has been overrated. The film's central question, -- `Just what is reality?' is drowned out by all the action and not examined in any great detail. A motion picture that tackles this very same question in a much more fascinating manner is 1998's highly underrated DARK CITY. Both films explore similar territory, but because DARK CITY was not geared towards the mainstream by incorporating a modern music score and a shoot-em-up sensibility, it was not as popular. Like little children fascinated by bright colors and loud noises, modern audiences tend to be transfixed by films like THE MATRIX. But this movie's lasting power (like last months number one pop hit) won't be long term. Entertaining - yes, great or meaningful - No.

B00006RAKP|4.0|If you want a good deal on the greatest solo artist who ever lived, this is it. Almost everything is here including the two tracks, \\"Levon\\" and \\"Tiny Dancer,\\" that were omitted from the previously released Very Best of Elton John(import) and Greatest Hits Volume 1. The two lesser known hits, \\"Island Girl\\" and \\"Little Jeannie,\\" are also great songs included here.  Every song is a classic!  I agree with most of the track selection except maybe the epic song \\"Mona Lisa's and Mad Hatter's\\" being excluded. That song became so huge after it was played in the movie, 'Almost Famous.' It was also his tribute song to the heroes of New York City. I too disagree with the songs, \\"Lucy in The Sky With Diamonds\\" and \\"Pinball Wizard\\" being excluded here. They were not original Elton John songs, but they were excellent cover songs that sounded so much better than the originals done by The Beatles and The Who. I think these three songs should have replaced the smaller hits \\"Believe,\\" \\"Blessed\\" and \\"Something About The Way You Look Tonight.\\" It would also have been nice to include the #1 single of all time \\"Candle In The Wind 1997(Goodbye Englands Rose)\\" tribute to Princess Diana in this collection. It's a damn shame all of these wonderful classics became left out.    The album is still amazing. Disc one is much better than disc two with it spanning the greatest period of Elton John's career from 1970-1976. Everything is here ranging from power ballads, \\"Your Song,\\" \\"Daniel,\\" and \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\" to hard rockers, \\"Crocodile Rock, \\"The Bitch Is Back\\" and \\"Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting.\\" Every song represented in the first disc is Elton John during his prime. The first half of disc two is mostly from the 80's and is also good with three exceptional tracks, \\"Don't Go Breaking My Heart,\\" \\"I'm Still Standing,\\" and \\"Nikita.\\" The last half of disc two is from the 90's and is the weakest period of Elton John's career but it ends strongly with two great songs from his last album 'Songs From The West Coast', the songs-\\"I Want Love\\" and \\"This Train Don't Stop There Anymore.\\" Overall, this compilation is very essential to any Elton John fan and a great place to start for beginners. I highly recommend this collection over any other Elton John greatest hits compilation that came before.
B00000IMCW|5.0|All of the new lame horror movies are based at some point on any Dead movie such as Dawn of the Dead, Day of the Dead, Night of the Living dead, and the not so scary more comedy Return of the Living dead series. With the use of traditional make-up this movie comes alive. Only if you can look past the some what tinted orange blood. For time this came out it is excellent. Compared to todays CGI computer special effets some movie go'ers may be somewhat disapointed. But those who are never experienced the true value of what artistry Tom Savini, George Romero, and other great writers and special effect will never understand the true CULT value. If I could I would rate much higher than just 5 stupid stars...how about 100 creepy zombies.
B00000J7J4|5.0|At first glance you might think what would Carlos have in common with such a wide field of diverse talent?  Carlos could always play with just about anyone. He has shown it throughout the 30 odd years he has been ever present in music.  He influenced a whole generation of music and here he shows he has huge ears.  There is something here for everyone.  There is the signature Santana sound but when he collaborates he meets the other artist halfway as they do him.   This one deserves the accolades because it was simply the most musical recording in pop in the last few years.  Yes there are production values but there is also a loose jammin' field. Things are not set and polished to a high gloss.  Carlos wails on this one but he picks his spot and never at the expense of the pieces.   It's great to see Carlos &quot;rediscovered&quot; since he has been such an lost treasure over the years.   Yes many have been aware of him. He has his following and has played with the very very best but in this age of hype and bombast. It's nice to see someone who deserves the accolades come to the fore of pop and turn out such a successful recording.  &quot;Love of My Life&quot;, &quot;Migra&quot;, &quot;The Calling&quot;, &quot;Wishing It Was&quot;,  &quot;El Farol&quot;, &quot;Do You Like the Way&quot; and &quot;Smooth&quot; are real highpoints.  This one is keeper.
0800177177|5.0|When I first saw this film I was completely carried away with Francis Ford Coppola's dark and brooding presentation of the novel that created the modern vampire.  The visual composition, the use of color as theme, and the music overloaded my senses to the point that I barely noted the movement of the plot.  After all, I had read Stoker's tale often enough to recite it word for word.  Why pay too much attention?  Going back over the film 10 years later revealed much that I missed the first time.<br />Of course, the film really tries to capture the feeling of the book rather than be a literal copy, which may bother some aficionados.  Coppola has chosen to gradually shift emphasis from a horror tale to the tragic story of an impossible love, without ever losing either thread.  By shifting Dracula (Gary Oldman) back and forth from Rumanian hero to terrible monster, and allowing each persona to have its emotional context, he forces a foreboding dilemma on the viewer.  Dialog and narration is sparse, just enough rather than florid.  Again, nothing is allowed to distract from the building tension.<br />What completely escaped me on the first viewing was Coppola's vision of a creeping corruption that infects almost all of the characters.  British social mores fare little better than those of the vampires.  Jack Seward (Richard Grant) is a morphine addict and Lucy Westenra's (Sadie Frost) sexual intensity proves her Achilles heel.  Even Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins) is subject to eerie, almost degenerate moments.  This is a less pure, more disturbing world than that of Bram Stoker's imaginings.<br />Coppola keeps the film working on many levels - foreboding horror, grand romance, sharp social commentary, and transcendental morality play.  If love redeems, it only does so at a terrible price.  Well worth viewing - several times.
B00000IB4D|5.0|Of all the recording Santana has made over 35 years. This is his most unique.  Carlos went totally conceptual on this.   With a totally unique and new band and special guests such as Flora Purim, Airto, Wendy Haas,  John McLaughlin and Billy Cobham, Carlos expands greatly upon what he attempted in &quot;Caravanserai&quot;.   The title track is one of the most poignant and beatiful renditions of the John Coltrane piece.  You can't feel this one, you're in trouble.   Mother Africa is a percussive, jazzy, wonder of a piece. It features a driving polyrhythmic percussion section, sax solo and beautiful melody.  Flame-Sky is a fusion piece with Carlos and John McLaughlin playing off one another much in the way they did in their Love Devotion Surrender collaboration.  &quot;Samba De Sausalito&quot; is the most Santana-like of the pieces.  Then there is a the stunning &quot;Yours Is The Light&quot; featuring Airto Moreira on percussion and the melliflous crystal clear voice of Flora Purim.  Carlos performs one of his most stunning solos on this one.  It shows how closely he is listening because he doesn't overplay it but gives the piece exactly what it needs.   &quot;When I Look Into Your Eyes&quot; is also an expansive piece featuring a driving beat and Leon Thomas' lead vocal and unusual warbling in background.  It works very well.   Carlos is very selective as to where and in what pieces he will solo.   A very interesting recording.  His jazziest.  His playing was in top form here.
B00006V9A0|3.0|This compilation could've been better.  I wish they would've put more songs off of bleach (Love Buzz and Big Cheese the most)<BR>and Aneurysm and Dive.  The new songs is really good, it's perhaps my fave Nirvana song.  I know a lot of people who don't like it, but I think it's different from most Nirvana song.  It's more grunge than anything else.  And there's a different version of 'Been a Son'.  It's a less punk version.  Anyway, if you're just starting to get into Nirvana (And I should kick your \\"butt\\" if you are!) this is a good place to start.  I'd actually recommend buying the cds in order.  But if you want the new song, d/l it along with the earlier version of Been a Son.
B0000062FN|5.0|This, the third release by Santana is different from the previous three. No less energetic, equally vibrant it features a then 19 year old Neal Schon on guitar, Luis Gasca on trumpet (on one cut) and the Tower of Power horn section.  There is much to like about this recording.  It contains the fire that was present in the previous recording as well as the latin and percussive elements.  In this one the sound opens up and expands. What was hinted at in such cuts as \\"Incident at Neshabur\\", \\"Singing Winds and Crying Beasts\\" in Abraxas is once again reinterate and expanded on in \\"Batuka\\", \\"Jungle Strut\\" and the albums tour de force, \\"Toussaint L'Overture\\".   \\"Toussaint L'Overture\\" alone is worth the price of the recording.  A three movement piece which builds to an intense guitar-organ-guitar climax with Mike Shrieve propelling the band along at a blistering pace.  Schon and Santana trade guitar lines. They are fiery throughout.   The surprise of the recording is \\"Taboo\\" which is hauntingly captivating.  Greg Rolie does a great job on this piece.  It has a real midnight feel to it with equal elements of rock and fusion.  Dave Brown's bass line is a key element to this piece.  \\"Tower of Power gained a great deal of exposure at the time because of \\"Everybody's Everything\\" which is high energy piece and a departure from the known Santana sound.  This one has aged well.  This was one of his best recordings. It hinted at Carlos' many influences.  It wasn't just a rock album.
B0000033TE|5.0|My inspiration for buying this album was actually the opposite of what it normally is. I read all of the negative press and reviews of ELP and knew I had to hear them. Actually, I've heard them many times before, but I figured it was time to really give them a shot. I got this one coz it's rumored to be one of their best, if not THE best. Plus, I really didn't want the song \\"Lucky Man\\" anywhere in my cd collection. Well, I love the album. The negative press makes the music all the more amusing. Most of the music sounds like it belongs in the movie \\"Tron\\" or something. I will admit the music is kinda \\"cold\\" as many critics say. The album sounds like an instructional cd for music students. Hell, even the name Emerson, Lake and Palmer sounds so technical and classroom-like. Any one of their album titles would have been a cooler name for the actual group. Even with all this slander, I must admit that I love this album, and am very glad I bought it coz it gets alot of play. So, the next time you're at a party with all the usual house music, carefully and discretely throw this on and see what happens.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I am a huge Soundgarden and Chris Cornell fan.  I heard of RATM, and noticed the band was tight and they sounded a lot like Soundgarden but the lead singer's voice was annoying with politics so extreme they were unrealistic.  Both bands broke up, and I heard rumors in the last two years Cornell and RATM were collaborating. I thought this could either be a stunning experience or a something that just doesn't work.  I heard &quot;Cochise&quot; and thought it was okay, sounds of a band trying to get its footing.  I bought the album, and I am absolutely stunned.  This band could do anything, and they have the musical chemistry that Eddie Van Halen and David lee Roth had. This is Wrecking Ball Blues and Earthquakes, and I say album of the year, along with one of the best heard in about 7 years in Rock. Rolling Stone and Billboard should stop promoting the Timberlakes and Spears of the world and get on with the real music, instead of dissing this band.
B000002AVF|5.0|Daydream, for me, is Mariah's best album.  It caters to the R&amp;B fans and those who love Mariah's ballads.  Whereas her first three albums head straight to ballad extreme, and Butterfly and Rainbow head to R&amp;B extreme, both of which I like (to a point), Daydream offers something for everyone. . .something of which I am hoping will happen with her upcoming release Charmbracelet.  Even if you are not a fan who owns every album and single, like me, this album will truly make you appreciate Mariah Carey and how truly talented she is!  Rock on Mariah.
0316666343|1.0|I am sorry, I was bored.  I waited and waited for the climax to hit.. and then all of a sudden the book was over. They never caught her killer?! Are you joking.  BORING! I think I might have to read it again... i think i missed something. I HOPE I did... because there was no point.. no story.
0767821769|5.0|Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon truly give life to this remarkable tale of family, life, love, and loss. Director Chris Columbus (Harry Potter, Mrs. Doubtfire) superbly directs the well-defined script that not once questions its ability to work. Though an intelligent group of screenwriters and a good director are behind the film, it definitely reflects the typical Hollywood-tear jerker, but with quality.<BR>The film focuses on the Harrison family: Luke (Ed Harris), Jackie (Susan Sarandon), and their two children Anna (Jena Malone) and Ben (Liam Aiken). The wealthy New York family has all of the love, but all of the fights, especially those which have come from Luke and Jackie's past divorce. Luke's new love interest, and fianc, is Isabel (Julia Roberts), a stylish, young, New York City photographer. She has absolutely no motherly experience, and is really not ready to be a stepmom, especially since the two children are indisputably close to their very maternal mother Jackie. From this, a slight feud between Jackie and Isabel comes about. Isabel is unhappy of how Jackie sees her as so irresponsible and careless, while Jackie is not ready to be replaced by someone with no parental experience. But after the family learns devastating news concerning Jackie's health, Isabel and Jackie must learn to get along, whether they are going to share motherhood or not.<BR>Though there are some smiles and heart-filled scenes, the emotional and dramatic script offers a typical family drama story, in which a family is sometimes torn apart by the horrible consequences that life brings sometimes, and the difficulty of changes. Fortunately, the story plays out well with great direction, two amazing lead-female stars (also with executive producer spots), and a plot that keeps the audience emotionally attached throughout the film.<BR>Malone and Aiken impress, as the emotionally hurt children that are suffering from their parents past divorce, while they must cope with Isabel, their soonto be stepmom. And despite some mild film-making don'ts, STEPMOM has few flaws, and truly shows us how &quot;family&quot; is more than just a word. The DVD features a &quot;making of featurette,&quot; film trailer, and both Widescreen / Full-Screen versions.
B00006RAKP|5.0|Let's see here, there have been 3 volumes of Greatest Hits released, and various other 'hits' compilations and assorted boxed sets. One would think that everything that could be done to show Sir Elton's career was over and done with. This latest collection doesn't really do anything to outshine all of the other numerous compilations, some of which were a little better(I am of course speaking about the boxed set To Be Continued...., which was released in 1990). However, this set is up to date with Elton's career. It includes his two latest 2001 hits &quot;I Want Love&quot; and &quot;This Train Don't Stop There Anymore&quot;, both off of his stunning album &quot;Songs From The West Coast&quot;. The current single, &quot;Original Sin&quot;, is nowhere to be found. That's the only high selling point for this latest collection. Two newer hits. The rest is filled with songs you would of expected to find. There are also some glaring omissions. You can't have a 'complete' hits collection without actually making it complete. This is a 2 disc collection, if it were really to be complete, then it would of been at least a 4 disc set. There a number of solid hits here that weren't included. You get the great late 80's hit like &quot;Sacrifice&quot;, but the two other hits off of that album(Sleeping With The Past), &quot;Healing Hands&quot; and &quot;Club At The End Of The Street&quot;, aren't here. &quot;Healing&quot; even charted better than &quot;Sacrifice&quot;. One of his great 90's songs, &quot;The Last Song&quot;, isn't here either. How can they leave that one out?. Fans who were hoping to have the Princess Diana version of &quot;Candle In The Wind&quot; will be disappointed too. Not here folks. I know it sounds like I'm bashing it and yet I gave it five stars. I gave it five stars because it is still a great collection. No matter what songs were left out and lesser songs that were put in, it's still a brilliant CD of great songs. It's true that Elton's best work was his 70's compositions, and this set pretty much looks at that era more than any other, but there were still great things in the 80's and 90's that were horribly left out. Where's &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot;. Not here. How about &quot;Kiss The Bride&quot;, or &quot;Blue Eyes&quot;, or the great Lennon tribute &quot;Empty Garden&quot;. Nowhere to be found. This can't ever be looked at as a complete and precise collection. Long time fans will be disappointed for sure, but newbies looking for a toned down overview of his career will be pleased and can't go wrong with it. Elton has been around for 33 years, hopefully there will be someone in the future who wants to release the ultimate collection and will actually get it right. The real king of pop(Sorry Jacko) deserves it. Because, quite frankly, no one will be happy the aboved omitted songs aren't here and his duet with Leann Rimes, &quot;Written In The Stars&quot;, is.
B0000640VO|5.0|Although I didn't really care for the hairdo of the Amelie character or the perky French music, I loved the story.  Speaking from the point of view of a girl, I think girls really do things like this! It's true. There are people [mostly girls but some guys too] who just find pleasure from random and not-so-random acts of kindness and mischief.
B000002UAR|3.0|yes I agree with some people below, the songs are a bit progressiver than the early stuffs.  Taxman, Tomorrow never knows for instance
B0000787FH|5.0|Hailed by Columbia at the time of its release as a masterpiece and trashed by many critics expecting business as ususal from EC & The Attractions, Imperial Bedroom stands as a pivotal album in EC's career. Why? Because he created a diverse musical experience echoing everything from the Tin Pan Alley gaints to his British music idols (most notably The Beatles). It's technicolor production and sweeping lyrical themes make it one of the top 100 albums of all time. Imperial Bedroom along with This Year's Model, Armed Forces, Blood & Chocolate and King of America represent early Costello at his best; intelligent, witty and musical adept at adopting a number of musical styles.<br />This reissue has stunning sound, complete liner notes by EC, complete lyrics as well as a second disc that includes the bonus tracks from the Ryko release. Add to that the alternate takes, demos and you have a reissue worth having. Price as a single disc collection, Imperial Bedroom is well worth purchasing again just to have all the extra
0812580346|5.0|What if everyone in the world was given a 2 minute glimpse into their lives 21 years in the future? How would they deal with that knowledge? And is the future fixed or does mankind have freewill? Mr. Sawyer deals with all of these questions in this fascinating story. And he manages to add in a little murder mystery as well. He also weaves the jargon of physics into the story in a manner that seemed very convincing to me.
B000002L7J|4.0|Merely a response to the supposed insight offered by the above-mentioned persona.  The reality is that the first record released in the U.S. (The Smiths)is not one on/in which J. Marr's guitar was something like &quot;background noise.&quot;  If you ever turned a keen ear to the record, you might find some of the best guitar melodies ever recorded--see &quot;This Charming Man&quot; and &quot;Reel Around the Fountain.&quot;  Clearly, soemone who has had, at least in this case, a true ear infection of the worst kind.  The first LP is indeed, in regards to lyrics and melodies (save Hatful of Hollow)an example of the best of the Smiths--ever.
0920668372|1.0|I found this book to be unbelievably unpleasant. I can't understand why anyone would want to read it to a child, unless you know you are ready to teach your child about death. When I read it to my young child I did not know that's what it was about. The cover makes it look like a cute children's story and it is cute for a little while. Overall I would say that reading this book to a child unprepared was very upsetting.
6305181772|5.0|This was a very good movie.  It was a little gory and bloody but it wasn't too bad.  The plot was sort of confusing but it all made sense in the end.  Tom Cruise does a fantastic job playing Ethan Hunt (a secret agent that was disavowed).  He had to get a disc with a list of the secret agents and deliver it to Max, in order to get... million.  He gets help from another disavowed agent, Luther.  Together with another man named Krieger the they break into CIA headquarters and get the NOC list.  If you want to know what happens in the end you must whatch this awesome movie.  (Rated PG for some intense action violence.)<BR>-John
6305372411|5.0|Seeing the printed word is one thing, but to witness the cutting edge of human evolution driven home through utterly first class acting, special effects, music, and storytelling is entirely another.  Reading of Apollo for so long, I think, certainly sweetened the extravagenza of imagery in From The Earth to the Moon.  It was just so cool to see it *finally* brought to the screen.  I watched all twelve hours in two days--seriously.  <br />Each episode has its own, delightfully creative angle.  In that sense I'm sure it will keep your interest for a long, long while.  And, a la the movie Apollo 13, it also does such an indispensable job of conveying human emotion.  Although robots have explored planets like Jupiter and Saturn, we cannot truly feel like we've been to anywhere but our moon, because mind and soul are always paramount.  And that's why Apollo will always be such a fascinating story.
B000002J09|5.0|This is the best Led Zeppelin Studio Cd ever. Actualy it's probly my favorite cd ever. How can you morons even think about putting a bad review of this cd out? If you did you must have absolutly no taste in music or anything good. Jimmy Page is the Best guitarist ever. Plant has one of my favorite voices. Bonham has the hardest hitting drums ever and John Paul Jones has the tightest bass lines out of any band. I would like to hear the people that say Page sux and this is a crappy cd Play 3 notes form Stairway to Heaven!-Peace
B00006CXXU|5.0|Okay,now I just wanna say don't judge the cd by dirrty because there's a lot more on the cd. She has more Church/inspirational songs,latiny songs, rock songs, and ballads,also there is a song that's a little higher than dirrty called get mine,get yours (lyric: come on and freak my body, we can get nasty naughty,all night a private party, work me like a nine to five...). Christina just made this my favorite,favorite,favorite cd. Just because she has all types of music and just doesn't focus on one type. Here are my ratings 1 out of 10. (i'm skipping the 4 inter ludes)<br />Can't Hold Us Down- great song with Lil' Kim about women inpowerment. 9.8/10<br />Walk Away-slow song but it's just her which is great. 9/10<br />Fighter-one of my favorite songs on the cd. Rockish with Dave Nivaro doing guitar. 10/10<br />Infatuation-another one of my favorite songs with latin flavor. 10/10<br />Loving me 4 Me-good slow jam about her perfect guy. 9/10<br />Impossible- song with Alicia Keys, can't get enuf!! 9.9/10<br />Underappreciated- a different type of sound but so good. 9.8/10<br />Beautiful-new single.great slow song about how we are all beautiful. 10/10<br />Make Over-a really rock,rock song. good song but I can't listen to it more than 3 or 4 times in a row. 9/10<br />Cruz-one of the best on the cd.I just love it!! 20/10<br />Soar-a song with a choir but great no matter what. 9.5/10<br />Get Mine, Get Yours- a song higher than dirrty but I still love it,love it, love it. 11/10<br />Dirrty- Gotta love it. Club song. 10/10<br />The Voice Within-great inspirational song.9.5/10<br />I'm OK- a sad song about her father where she cries but I still love it, it's one of the best. 30/10 (sad song)<br />Keep On Singin' My Song- great song and if you listen afterwards ther is a little outro that's funny. 9.8/10<br />One of mY favorites. please buy it ,then tell your friends to buy it because it's the best cd ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0465011020|5.0|I'm surprised to read some of these critiques and find that individuals feel the need to discount this book for literary shortcomings and typos.  The story itself is a strong one and I was more than willing to forgive this man for misspelling \\"kidnapings\\" in exchange for his horrific tale of the years lost in a North Korean concentration camp.  It amazes me that some disregard these pages as \\"really nothing new\\" -- a very inhumane response to a very vivid and compelling account of abominable human rights injustices.  This isn't fiction here; this REALLY happened and deserves the understanding that this man is sharing HIS story and not trying to write the next \\"War and Peace.\\"<br />Kang Chol-Hwan has shared his amazing journey from one world to another.  In order to share the reality of life under a loathsome, hateful regime that does nothing but systematically starve and kill its people, he risks the well-being of himself and loved ones.  I read his story and was deeply moved.  Being half a world away, it's difficult to fathom that such horrid injustices occur in our modern society.  <br />I am a Korean-American and live a much more sheltered and protected life than many on this earth.  I am deeply appreciative to my parent's for coming to the U.S. in order to give their children a better life.  They were only children during the Korean War and had their fair share of hunger and hardships.  They walked the long, death-ridden highway with the masses towards hopefully a better life in the South.  They were among the fortunate.  Many saw their families torn apart and kidnapped back to the North.<br />Reunification is inevitable.  This seems to be the sentiments of many.  It's only a matter of time before the North just can't hang on any longer without the help of its affluent sister in the south.<br />A great many thank you's to Mr. Kang for sharing his life.
0553208845|4.0|It was the end of this novel that appealed to me. Perhaps in the early parts I was engaged by the newness of the story (which is just what 'novel' means - 'new'). Perhaps in the middle I was envious of Siddhartha who made significant changes in his lifestyle and changed the whole basis of his life - something I have been unable or unwilling to in my life. But in the end I was so attracted to the personal message because it is my philosophy of life. We must make our own decisions, take our own actions - it must always come from within. Following someone else's path (such as the path of Gotama the Buddha which Siddhartha's youthful partner Govinda takes) must always leave an emptiness. A feeling of incompleteness. But as Siddhartha's story tells it, the path of personal enlightenment is such a difficult one. May it always end with the transcendental courage of Vasudeva, the enlightened one who shared with Siddhartha but did not lead, did not evangelise, did not try to convert or convince - just showed the way.<br />The title of my review is a quote from the novel.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I wish I could have taken credit for this masterpiece.  Donnie Darko was the best film I've ever seen in my life. There is so much to this film I cannot even begin to describe . I was floored when I was saw it and I have seen it about 12 times, I still am finding more and more elements to it. My friend told me about it and I took a chance and watched it, I haven't been the same since, I just love talking and analyzing this movie, it never gets old. My suggestion...by the DVD and watch it over and over until you understand and see these things...\\"the God and Jesus\\" corrolation and email me if you too see it. Also I'd like to know what everyone's interpretation of Cherita was in the film.. BUY THIS MOVIE!!
B00006RU5B|5.0|The voice of Soundgarden and the power of Rage Against The Machine combine to assault the masses with a sonic fury unlike anything you've ever seen. Audioslave's debut album is amazing. The last album that I could honestly sit and listen to from start to finish was A Perfect Circle's &quot;Mer De Noms&quot;. Chris' window-shattering vocals send chills down your spine in standout tracks like &quot;Cochise&quot;, &quot;Shadow On The Sun&quot;, and &quot;Show Me How To Live&quot;. &quot;I Am The Highway&quot; and &quot;Getaway Car&quot; are two of the slower, moodier, inward pieces on the album. &quot;Hypnotize&quot; has a UK club-like flavor. &quot;Gasoline&quot; and &quot;Set It Off&quot; are phenomenally powerful. Hell, I could list each song on here and write of their merits and it still could not convey just how damn good this album is. Bubblegum pop, stale rap, and corporate pop-rock need to move over. Audioslave is the future of rock. It is sonic fury. It is total bliss. If you like intelligent songwriting coupled with frenetic power behind it, and are a fan of either of the bands I mentioned above, RUN to pick this album up. This is not SG. This is not RATM. It is Audioslave. And this band and this album redefine rock. Do yourself a favor - pick up AUDIOSLAVE and turn it up to eleven.
0060523794|1.0|After reading Gerstner's self-aggrandizing book, I must agree with the recent Miami Herald review which castigated the man, the book and the company for obstructing the investigation of Edwin Black in his investigative bestseller, IBM and the Holocaust, and for then avoiding all reference to the topic in the Gerstner memoir. The Miami Herald review reminds that it was Gerstner who personally obstructed Black's attempt to access corporate archives, and then oversaw the launch of a disinformation campaign that has been unsuccessful. Gerstner's book should have dealt with this very public issue squarely instead of pretending it did not. I cannot look at the cover of Who Says Elephants Can't Fly and Gerstner's smiling image without thinking of this act of omission and commission.
B00006L83N|1.0|Good morning students.  Today I will demonstrate how best to ruin some of the best guitar music I've ever heard.  [the professor presses play.]  Class, Michael Romeo obviously put a lot of effort into his new album, &quot;Odyssey,&quot; the only problem is that he made the same mistake that he makes every time... he put vocals on these songs.<br />[professor walks around the room]  If you give me harsh, heavy, hard-hitting metal, you better not give it to me with some bellowing megalomaniac doing his best &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; rendition.<br />[professor leans on his/her desk] And you better only have drums, bass, keyboards, and guitars.  Get rid of the strings.  Get rid of the sappy piano.  Then we'll be talking 5-stars.  But, class, right now we're talking 1-star.
0140067477|1.0|When I was at school, we were made to read a book called \\"The Dark is Rising\\". I thought that was the worst book I'd ever read, and it held it's title for a long time (I'm 27 now) - but compared to the Tao of Pooh it shines like a glimmering beacon of success in the puss filled mire of Hoff's seemingly limitless inadequacy as a writer. <br />Unfortunately, Amazon.com won't allow me to put less than one star, but given the choice I'd rate this book in minus figures. <br />What I'm going to suggest though, is that if you are an intelligent person, please do read this book so that you may contribute along with me in diminishing the completely unjustified acclaim it holds. <br />At the end of this book, I understand very little about Taoism, as I would hope that it is vastly more interesting and holds less prejudice and small-mindedness as Hoff suggests. If anything, the book is far more representational of facist and racist views. To suggest that knowledgeable people, or people who strive to gain knowledge are stupid in their quest, is quite frankly ludicrous. <br />The book is basically saying, if you're thick and stupid and have limited room for thought, if you only look for simple things because you're too incompetent to strive to achieve, then you'll be happy. Sorry, not convinced. Are there people who agree with me here, or am I unique, [...] - thanks!
B0000019HU|5.0|This is the first time that I've ever written a review after listening to an album only once.  But this album is special.  \\"Spiderland\\" is amazing.  Dark, emotional vocals.  Well paced songs that rumble then explode.  Great lyrics.  Sheer musical power.  Everything.<br />\\"Good Morning, Captain\\" blew me away.  \\"I'm trying to find my way home.  I'm sorry.  I miss you.\\"  The lyrics may not seem like much written out, but sung they are truly affecting.  Buy this album.  Borrow this album.  Get these songs, one way or another.
B000065U1N|5.0|The first thing that struck me about this movie was how true it was to mark Bowden's book in conveying the sense of chaos and destruction surrounding the disastrous military attack in Somalia's Bakara Market.  The second thing was that while this movie isn't Saving Private Ryan, it is incredibly bloody.  If you're a fan of war movies, like I am, then this is an excellent, powerful film - but be forewarned that the violence is more intense than almost any other movie out there.
B00005YW4H|5.0|she sounds like if BBKing, ELLa and Etta James mixed genes and had a child.  Come Away with me is a great song, and her rendition of Cold,Cold Heart is fantastic.  SHe is someone you wouldn't care how much the ticket price was. She makes you wish you could sing
B00006YXEK|4.0|What a wonderful swansong this album is for George Harrison. Every cut is strong and overall this is one of the best solo efforts by George. I feel that only All Things Must Pass exceeds this. It is a blend of all of George's influences from his past rolled into one very touching album. The Beatle and eastern sounds are here of course and at times it also has a Traveling Wilbury feel to it. This is because of Jeff Lynne's presence. He is prominent throughout with his playing, vocals and partial production work. Sometimes Jeff's production is heavy handed; but here he keeps it a little sparcer and it adds to the album rather than burying it. Harrison's high tenor has never sounded sweeter. The song writing is strong without getting too preachy as Harrison sometimes gets. His guitar playing is nothing short of extraordinary too. The album is a beautiful piece of work. There is also a short DVD included in the limited edition about the making of the album as well as a guitar pick and poster. I was very close to giving this 5 stars but didn't. Perhaps with a few more listens I might.
B00006AG5N|5.0|I know i'm probably a fish out of water here, considering Elvis's main fan base is a few generations before me. However, when I was 16 I thought Mr. Presley's music was just old and something which only my parents listened to. Now i'm 22 and things have changed since then. <br />I perchased this CD and my whole view of Elvis has changed. Tracks 1-8 are by far, the most popular songs i've heard from him. Their simply the best toe-tapping songs I've ever had the pleasure to listen to.<br />For me, i assume it's my age but all of these tracks are extremely *classy*. What I mean by that is, compared to today's music, Elvis's music (especially his earlier work) has an uncluttered and sparse musical sound. Just enough to carry a rockable tune as he belts out the lyrics, especially with such songs like &quot;Jailhouse rock.&quot;<br />Now, this album has a little gem even my up-to-date music tastes can appreciate! The remix of &quot;A Little Less Conversation&quot; is the wildest thing i've ever heard. Consisting of a very funky and danceable sound, for me, the King has never ever sounded so good.<BR>It made me wonder what kind of music he would be doing today if he was still around. It's definately the bright spot on this track that no one should miss. <br />Overall, The sound quality is great and i'm extremely satisfied about this release.
B00006RU5B|4.0|Every one else has ranted and raved for or against this disc... I'm just going to say this. This is the best disc I've heard in a VERY long time... it's simply AMAZING, it's classic. This album has \\"That Feel\\"... it's BOMBASTIC... and BEAUTIFULL. <br />For many rock fans(me included), this album will take it's place(rightfully) alongside Blood-Sugar-Sex-Magic, Ritual De Lo Habitual and Superunknown.  I'm 30 years old... I saw(repeatedly) both Rage and Soundgarden live in the early 90's. I was crushed when Soungarden broke up, and, by the end, I was glad to see Rage break-up(I love music, not politics, and in my opinion, while thier sound was evolving well, it was rapidly taking TOO MUCH of a back-seat to thier politics). Don't get me wrong, I respected their views, it was just that they were way over the top by the end. <br />As a former musician, I can spot when lightning has been captured in a bottle... \\"Audioslave\\" is just that. I don't know how the chemistry developed in the studio between Rage-Cornell-RickRubin, but they captured it in 1's and 0's from the begining of this disc to the end. I am trully impressed!! Peace<BR> all.
B00006F83Y|5.0|This is an amazing alblum.  I bought it and I love it its really amazing just like the band
B000067CPX|5.0|first couple of times i listened to the album, i hated it. hated it. hated. i thought it was crap. maybe not crap, but just so different from what i was used to hearing from the chili peppers. the album started to grow on me the more i forced myself to listen to it. <BR>don't know any of the names of the songs.<BR>#2 reminds of a more beatles-esque style, with fleas high register bass line. #6 is an instant classic. #7 is the funkiest song on the album. #10. can't get over the basslines from the latter part of the song. i love the mellowness of #12. those are the songs that pop into my mind.<BR>as being a religously devote(sp?) follower of the chili peppers, i would definitely recommend this album to any and all who appreciate great music. the sound of the album is so mature. the red hot chili peppers never fail to amaze me with their growth. anthony kiedis, chad smith, john frusciante, and flea make up, at least in my mind, the greatest chemistry amongst band mates that i've ever heard. again, this is coming from a total chilihead
1564029654|5.0|It's hard to say more about this wonderful book -- just wanted to add that my 23-month old has loved it for the past two months and I know this has to do with her presently intensified separation anxiety.  Lovely story, artful evocative illustrations.  One of my favorites to read!
B00005AFMT|3.0|In the 70s, King Crimson was one of those bands labeled \\"progressive\\". If you're a progressive band, your entire reason for existence is to make music as no one else has before.<BR>In the 80's Crimson comes back with \\"Discipline\\"...now is this record \\"Progressive\\", or just a sellout to the (then)-current musical climate, or is it even by the same band?<br />Last question first. This IS the same band, just with different musicians. How can that be?, you say. Well, Robert Fripp is King Crimson - they are synonymous. Any band that Fripp is in will be King Crimson, by definition. Besides, the earlier crimson and this incarnation had the same drummer and played the same encores.<br />Next, this is not \\"just another punk record\\" and it's DEFINETLY not an abandonment of the Prog-rock ideals. Sure this album sounds like Talking Heads or Clash at times, but you could say the same thing about the old Crimson - they sounded like Iron Butterfly or Led Zeppelin at times. OF COURSE they sound like the punks. But they are PROGRESSIVE musicians, and they play the punk music in a completely different way. The sounds on this record are groundbreaking. even from the very start, where comlex polyphony is played on the Chapman Stick, on to the ticky-ticky guitar work, to the mind-bending \\"lyrics\\" on Indiscipline, to the instrumentals at the end - only a Progressive band COULD have done this.<br />Then there are the people who say \\"But it doesn't sound like the old 70s Crimson.\\" PEOPLE, YOU HAVE MISSED THE POINT! If they sounded like they did in the past, they would cease to be a progressive band!! The very nature of progressive music is to sound completely different from anything and everything else. I mean, look at Yes - when they released \\"Keys To Ascension\\" they were doing exactly the same things that they were doing back in 1973 - they are not a progressive band. King Crimson, on the other hand, completely reinvented their sound several times during their career.<br />It might shocksome readers to find out that I only gave this album three stars. That's because I don't really like it very much. But that should not stop you from buying it - this record is essential if you want to understand the nature of Prog. Besides, everyone else on amazon likes it, and I'm sure they know what they're talking about.
0385484518|5.0|This is one of the most moving books I've read in a long time. The book can be read in a few hours. But, give yourself four - you may want to read this again to absorb Albom's moving tribute to his mentor and friend.<br />I was originally drawn to the book out of admiration for Albom's sports writing and his appearances on ESPN, and I'm delighted that I stumbled upon this gem.<br />I won't say much more because I don't want to give away too much about the book - readers should experience its contents on their own. This is a well-written, easy-to-read treasure about what's really important in life, told by a dying man to his prot&eacute;g&eacute;. Morrie's point of view cannot be fully understood by someone not looking death in the eye, but his lessons are thought provoking, memorable and apropos in today's fast-paced, \\"younger is better\\" society.<br />A note about Albom - this is the first book I've read written by him, but it certainly won't be the last. Like any good author - he doesn't tell, he shows. His descriptions of Morrie are vivid - Albom brings him to life. It's not always pleasant, but you feel as if you're in the room with Mitch and Morrie, sharing laughter and tears.<br />I don't hesitate to admit I had plenty of tears at the end of the book, as I'm sure Albom did when he wrote it.<br />...<br />Five stars for Tuesdays with Morrie, and six stars to Albom for sharing.
B00006RU5B|4.0|If you heard the demos and thought they rocked, you will be blown away by the new Audioslave album.  Cornell's vocals are better than they have ever been and I've never heard him rock so hard.  And the guys from Rage are rocking like no other groove-based band before.  Any hard rock fan will appreciate this album, it sounds like no other.  Buy it.  Hard rock has gotten lame and generic lately.  Audioslave begs to differ.
0385508417|5.0|It's a good, lighthearted story. Not your typical Grisham novel but it was a good read.
B00006JDVV|3.0|Christian Bale and a bald, beefed up Matthew McConaughey looking like the guy from Fast and Furious star in a poorly executed film about dragons taking over the planet. Other than the opening scene when the first dragon is discoved underground the story takes place twenty years from now. A combination of fire breathing dragons and the use of nuclear weapons used against the seemingly indestructable dragons leave the cities of the Earth looking like South Bronx. (The film was shot in Ireland and if Ireland looks like that it is time to quit using things that blow up.)The remaining humans - whom the dragons consider food - are living underground and not doing so hot. Matthew shows up with a raggedy army claiming to have killed a dragon and looking for volunteers. Bale is a bit sceptical about his claim to have killed a dragon until one shows up and Matthew dispatches it using a small missle and one of his soldiers as bait - sort of giving you the idea why he needs volunteers. Never-the-less, a dead dragon lying on the ground does wonders for the downtrodden humans.<br />The most interesting scene in the film is a skydiving sequence. Imagine sky diving while a dragon, considering you the main course in a drop-in restaurant, is trying to pick you out of the air for a snack. You have to open your chute a close to the ground as possible but you are in clouds so you can't see the ground. HooHa! Exciting! Very well done.<br />A little conflict between the stars, a little romance between Bale and the female helicopter pilot for interest and they set off to London Town to find the one male dragon. I am not certain how the one male dragon has any time for a skirmish with the humans as there are a lot of females about - sort of like a rooster in a big, big hen house -  but skirmish he does in a big finish. <br />The problem with spending most of the budget on the dragon scenes is that it does not leave much for anything else. There are long drawn out dialog scenes in between the action that seem to go on forever while you are waiting for the dragons to arrive. My kids wandered off after ten minutes of nothing happening. But I think they did an okay job on the film and, as I said, the skydiving sequence is great.
B00006CXXU|5.0|First i thought it's gonna be al some kinda Dirrty-likewise songs. But hey, i was totally shocked when i first heard this cd. It was so amazing good, I must confess at first i just saw christina as a one of million britney rip-of. But she truly has found her way, I'd say: Byebye britney heloo Christina. This cd rocks!! If she keeps on making such cd's...she's gonna be my favorite :-))
0446530573|5.0|This book is great, and not just because it has anything to do with one of the greatest tv shows ever, the Sopranos.  This cookbook has excellent recipies!  If you live in NY/NJ then you will recognize almost all of the dishes as the staples of any neighborhood italian restaurant.  If you don't live here, this is a great way to bring the taste of NY/NJ Italian cooking home to your neck of the woods!  I've already made the Chicken Francais (lemon chicken) and it came out excellent.  My husband is Italian and this is one of his favorite dishes that when I've tried to make it before, it never came out quite right.  This came out perfect and he loved it, as did the rest of my family.  I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone, whether or not you are a Sopranos fan (and who isn't?!).
B000051VWW|5.0|Somehow over the years I was missing out on the great music produced by Sade Adu.  Of course I had heard &quot;Smooth Operator&quot; countless times on the radio.  Now I am catching up.  At first I thought that her debut &quot;Diamond Life&quot; was a standard hard to beat.  I have most of her studio efforts now, but this one is my favorite.  &quot;By Your Side&quot;, &quot;King of Sorrow&quot;, &quot;The Sweetest Gift&quot;, and &quot;Flow&quot; are my favorites on this CD.  Sade proves that in great music, often less is more.  I love the guitar work on this CD also.  I was listening to this CD often in anticipation of the arrival of my sweetheart from another country.  The romantic songs like &quot;Flow&quot; made me pine in anticipation.  Then came the tragic news that she isn't coming.  Now the words to &quot;King of Sorrow&quot; touch my heart.  As so much of the music coming out these days gets on my nerves, this CD is great to just close your eyes and relax to.  The lyrics are superb and of course Sade is hard to beat as a romantic singer with style and heart.
0316666343|5.0|I was hesitant to read this book based on the sad theme it seemed to embrace.  However, the whole idea behind it - a dead girl's journey to the beyond and her ties to the earthly world - really intrigued me.  This book was hard to put down because it is so well written and transcends through space and time beautifully.  There were chapters where I cried at the end, not because of sadness, but because the frail quality of the human spirit is so wonderfully depicted in this book.  Please read it, for it is a book that will stay with you long after the last chapter.
6300273199|4.0|Since I've retired my VCR and turned to the DVD side of The Force, \\"AC/DC:  Let There Be Rock\\" really needs to be on the new format.  This video is a true rock classic and a must-have for any serious AC/DC fan.<br />Filmed in Paris from one of the band's last concerts with legendary screamer Bon Scott, \\"Let There Be Rock\\" shows why AC/DC was recently labeled by Q Magazine as \\"The #1 Band You Must See Before You Die\\".  The sheer energy and ferociousness of Angus Young's performance is truly a wondrous sight to behold.  And the rest of the band keeps chugging along with an intensity that few rock bands have had either before AC/DC's late 1970's/early 1980's heyday or since.<br />The interviews are pointless, but amusing to see Angus & Co. get more and more fluthered as the film goes on.  In particular, Bon Scott displays his legendary charm (and his forgettable stage wardrobe).  Scott's charm might come as a surprise to the casual onlooker, particularly for a man who penned Shakespearean sonnets like \\"Big Balls\\", \\"Beating Around the Bush\\" and \\"Up to My Neck in You\\".  <br />No matter, I once showed this video to my twentysomething neighbor who listened to nothing but 2Pac and the Wu-Tang Clan.  He quickly became an AC/DC convert after laughing hysterically at Angus' on-stage antics and being wowed by his incredible guitar virtuosity.<br />Once again, this video is a must for serious AC/DC fans and the only reason it didn't get five stars was due to its unavailability on DVD.  Come on!  Get with the program!
B000007VRQ|2.0|This was Genesis' first album, recorded when they were teenagers at the Charterhouse School (the British equivalent of a prep school). They were more of a folk ensemble than rock group at that point, hardly able to do more with their guitars than strum. Peter Gabriel, Tony Banks, and Mike Rutherford were already on board, with Anthony Phillips on guitar and John Silver on drums. They sent demo tapes to producer Jonathan King, hoping to parlay a songwriting career, and found that King preferred to have the boys record their own songs. After which he slapped a bunch of orchestration on it, hoping for a success in the style of the Moody Blues' &quot;Days of Future Passed&quot;. Instead, the album only sold 600 copies, though it has been re-released in a hundred different versions over the years and has probably sold in the hundreds of thousands by now. In addition to the original 13 songs, this version includes a couple of early singles with Chris Stewart on drums, and a couple of demos: &quot;Image Blown Out&quot;, which is pretty good, and &quot;She Is Beautiful&quot;, which was revised into &quot;The Serpent&quot;.<br />Several songs are pleasant in a wildly naive way, but other than &quot;In the Wilderness&quot; (with its &quot;Music/All I hear is music/Guaranteed to please&quot; chorus) and &quot;One Day&quot;, nothing here is good enough to deserve frequent listening. The songs are short and poppy, unlike anything else they would do during the Gabriel Era. Much of it is vaguely reminiscent of what the Moodys were doing at the time. The lyrics are like the poetry you wrote when you were 16 and can't stand to look at now. On the single, &quot;Silent Sun&quot;, they purposely tried to sound like the Bee Gees because they knew King liked the Bee Gees. This is a two and a half-star album; I'm rounding down.<br />(1=poor 2=mediocre 3=pretty good 4=very good 5=phenomenal)
B00005T7I1|5.0|I dont like this movie. usally im not interested in Dective movies. If your looking for a cop movie see Who framed roger rabbit, Inspector gadget or kindergarten cop. their preety good.I dont think i would get the vidio game either for my sega genesis.Anyway its unhooked.

I'm surprised they let him make another movie after this one!<BR>It is NOT scarey at all...The dialogue is horrible, the acting is the worst, and the music!!  It reminds me of the music they would play in a comedy/hillbilly type movie...<BR>Where is the house on the DVD cover?  Not to be found...And it happens at night in the dark?  Not really...most of the movie happens in daylight....<BR>I would not take this money if they gave it to me for free...The worst movie of all time!
B0000028VT|5.0|Anyone who has doubts about any of Mariah Carey's vocal skills are seriously proven wrong, when listening to this lp. Whether it may be the eclective street beats of &quot;Dreamlover&quot; or the climactic and heart-quinching &quot;Hero&quot; this album truly sets Mariah apart from any other artist and helped her career very much so. With her mother being an opera singer, Mariah has developed five octave range that is used fluidly, yet flawlessly in the album. This complilation is just another reason she is the BEST SELLING FEMALE ARTIST OF ALL TIME! And is also why this album was on the Billboard for practically forever.
B000002UJQ|5.0|It is a travesty that this album, one of the best albums of the nineties, maybe ever, is down to 4.5 stars.  A work of this much genious and brilliant melody deserves 5 stars and nothing less.  Please, lets help this album get the respect it so much deserves.<BR>Not since the Beatles era of the sixties has a work of this much genious been created.
0553382179|5.0|The writer of this book, Marla Cilley, goes by another name: Flylady. I own this book and have read it.  But there is another way to experience Flylady if you have a computer.  You can receive all the wisdom contained in the book by joining her e-mail coaching list.  I joined her list over a year ago and it has completely changed my life.  Bit by bit, I read and absorbed her wisdom and have been transforming my life and my home.<br />Because the Flylady had made such an impact on my life, I bought her book immediately after it was published.  As I read it, not much was unfamiliar to me because I had been a member of her e-mail group, and yet having it all in one place was very valuable to me.  Despite having received a lot of information contained in the book through the e-mail group, I still wanted to own the book and use it frequently.<br />This book will especially be helpful to people who have a real problem figuring out how to keep and organize their home.  Probably every person will find something to benefit them from the wisdom contained within, however, people who really struggle with issues of getting their act together will be especially helped.<br />I was at my absolute wits end.  I have an extensive collection of self-help books on organization and overcoming clutter. Each and every book has been interesting and hope-inspiring, and has presented helpful techniques and approaches.  Yet to my great despair,I was never able to find a way to make it all work for me.  At one point I decided, maybe I need outside help and hired a very expensive (and famous)organizing professional to help me.  I paid several thousand dollars for an organizing plan, and hired these organizers at $75.00 an hour to try to help me overcome my disorganization problem.  They even selected me to have a makeover in a famous magazine after seeing pictures of my disorganized, cluttered home. (The story was killed by new editors who took over the magazine, much to my dismay).<br />It wasFlylady's way of teaching and coaching that was my salvation.  Her method is so doable.  You start with baby steps, and you never do more than you are ready for.  She starts you off with one task, and one task only.  To shine your kitchen sink.  It is so easy to comply with this first step.  Even if you never do anything else, it is so simple and easy there really isn't a reason to try.<br />When you become really comfortable with shining your sink every day, she has you add another step: developing a simple evening and morning routine.  Lay out your clothes for the next day in the evening, and get dressed to your shoes every morning.  You can practice and stay on these beginning steps for as long as you like, until you feel comfortable to move to the next step.  She likes to say that you are never behind and don't need to get caught up.  She tells you to take everything in baby steps.  You can go as fast or as slow as you like.<br />Later she add her brilliant strategy of decluttering to your steps.  For only 15 minutes a day, you work in various zones in your house decluttering.  It is so simple.  Anyone can work 15 minutes a day.  And, miraculously, you discover the power of what 15 minutes can accomplish.<br />Things seem to get more complicated later on, but you don't even notice, as she leads you through adding simple daily routines, making a weekly plan, putting together a control journal, learning meal planning, holiday organizing.  Because everything is given to you in little pieces, you never realize how much you're doing because you only add each new technique one layer at a time.  You build on what has come before and you never feel like you're doing very much more.<br />A year after I have been putting her methods into practice, I have a completely different mindset regarding keeping my home.  I have experienced a year now of chaos-free, much reduced stress holidays.  I have done many projects that I've always felt bad about never getting around to.  Myfamily and friends all comment on the difference in my home.  My counter (which had been for years a source of despair for me, as it had been covered with piles of junk that I would spend hours cleaning, only to have it reappear a couple of days later) is now always clean and clear.  The problem of my counter which had been impossible for me to solve, has been so easily and elegantly solved by Flylady.  I have learned from her that my counter is a \\"hot spot\\", and that nothing can be on it because \\"clutter begets clutter.  By looking at this \\"hot spot\\" and putting out fires that erupt in it during the day, I have been able to effortlessly keep it clear.<br />I still have a way to go.  I'm still building on my layers of knowledge with Flylady's system.  I have every confidence that her methods will prove to be an answer for me.  If you are in despair and don't know where to turn, please give her a try.
B00005JKDQ|5.0|Monsters Inc is by far Disney and Pixar's best movie to date. What an incredible imagination the creators of this movie have, it just took my breath away. The storyline takes place in Monstropolis a city where monsters live beyond the human world, and in that city there lies the company called Monsters Inc where monsters work and their job is to scare children, and then they collect their screams as a source of energy for the city's electricity. The outrageous part is this, the monsters consider children to be dangerous even deadly and that if a child were to touch them they would be contaminated and the company would be in trouble. Mike Wazowski voiced by Billy Crystal and James P Sullivan voiced by John Goodman are a team at Monsters Inc, Mike assists him and Sully does the scaring, they are the perfect team and Sully who is the top scarer at the company is this close to breaking the all time scare record until something happens. One night when everyone has left work Sully enters in door that has been left and when he goes in to look and then comes back out a little girl follows him and Sully tries to put her back but she keeps following him. Soon everyone in Monstropolis is in fear because of the so called child security breach and the future of Monsters Inc is in jeopardy. The ending is pretty much predictable but the great comedic talents of Billy Crystal and John Goodman more than make up for that. There are other wonderful voice talents in this movie such as the hilarious Steve Buscemi as Sully and Wazowski's nemesis Randall Boggs, the late and wonderful actor James Coburn as the Ceo of Monsters Inc Mr Henry J Waternoose III, the funny Jennifer Tilly as Wazowski's girlfriend and Monsters Inc receptionist Celia Mae, and the hilarious John Ratzenberger as Yeti the abominable snowman. There are also two great shorts on the vhs edition &quot;Mike's New Car&quot; and &quot;For the Birds&quot; All in all Monsters Inc is a movie that is pure magic, anyone can enjoythis movie, there is not one thing I don't like about it. I even found myself in tears at some parts of the movie. Just the relationship that Sully develops with the girl who he names Boo is both endearing and sweet, it really was touching. It is a movie that teaches you about true friendship, being there for your friend no matter what. How wonderful and even intriguing it would be if there really was a world where monsters worked, had families, drove cars just like humans. Pixar really outdid themselves with this movie and the end result can be summed up in one word: amazing!
B00003CXXP|4.0|It's hard to understand A.I. I didn't want to see the film when it first came out, well, because I was maybe bored with Spielberg and his creatures. I dont know, I really couldn't say why I didn't want to see the film I just didn't want to see it. Although I am fascinated with Spielberg.<BR>After seeing A.I, it's safe for me to say I felt depressed and probably would never have wanted to see it again. But I bought it because I got so attached to Monica  and I hated how David lost her and then found her again only to lose her once more. HOW SAD!!!You almost get the feeling that he never truly found his mommy. That she remained lost forever and all that he had was a memory of her. You almost get the feeling that the last words she truly told him was \\"I'm sorry I didn't tell you about the world.\\"<br />How truly sad the world is.
0316666343|5.0|I was given this book as a gift from a friend and had the nerve to scoff at its content as depressing and to scoff at its author (as a Harvard grad I thought: Alice Sebold of Syracuse??).  <br />Oh how wrong I was.  This is one of the finest books I have ever read.  It begins with an act of violence but unfolds gently into an exquisite sketch of love.  I have never experienced such love shining off the pages of a novel. This is an astonishing, lyrical, sometimes brutal, but always moving book.  It is soaked with my tears. It brought me to my knees.<br />Thank you Ms. Sebold for your brilliant interpretation of what it means to be a family and what it means to navigate this life with its ubiquitous violence and its amazing and rare capacity for love and redemption.  You must have been much loved in your life to be capable of writing this novel.
B00005YU1O|5.0|In Steven Soderbergh's bit in this flick he tells of Louis Malle meeting with Billy Wilder and telling Wilder his latest film cost $2.5 million.  Wilder asks what it's about and Malle says \\"A dream within a dream\\" and Wilder replies \\"Well, you've just lost $2.5 million\\".   Richard Linklater knew what he would be up against with this film, and judging by some of the reviews here, he got that kind of response.<br />First, the film looks great!  Using computer animation layed over live action footage, Linlater tells a tale of dreams within dreams, with his hero meandering around encountering this one and that one, and soon realizing that the distinction between his life awake and his life asleep and dreaming has been blurred beyond recognition.  I don't know any other way this dream-like state could have been conveyed WITHOUT the use of animation.  The rocking, floating surrounding motions, and the fluid ever- changing visuals conveys the dream state better than anything we've seen previously.<br />As to the content of the encounters in the various vignettes that make up the film, I was always entertained by the intellectual prattle that ranged from fascinating to facetious, from the ridiculous to the sublime.  I liked the fact that Linklater made a film that allowed people to expound on their obsessions and philosophy, whether crackpot or intuitive.  It certainly was a different day at the cinema.<br />Finally, I congratulate the filmakers for their cleverness and for the sheer originality of the endeavor.  It is very satisfying to see someone marry technology with inspiration and tell a tale, in this case various ideas about the conscious and the subconscious, in a way it never could have been told before, and with a method that perfectly conveys the ideas presented.<br />Certainly not for everyone, but well worthwhile for those seeking something different, done extremely well.

B00005RZV4|5.0|Coming off from the \\"Fragility 2.0\\" U.S.Tour, Trent Reznor decided to make a 16 track live album that would commemorate the memories of \\"The Fragile\\" era. However, what he did was create a complimentary of a \\"best hits\\" album that would satisfy any die hard NIN fan old or new. <BR>This was the CD that started my love for Nine Inch Nails or Industrail as a whole. After hearing \\"Starf*ckers.Inc\\" on MTV, i liked it immediately. So being the stubborn idiot i was when i borrowed this from a friend, i kept \\"Starf*ckers\\" on repeat for 2 days. Then, on the third day i decided to give the other songs a chance, and soon enough, it changed my life.<BR>\\"And All That Could Have Been\\" starts off explosively with the loud thundering beats of \\"Terrible Lie\\", and ends with the quiet emotional whisperings of \\"Hurt\\". Reznor's onstage energy is unmatched elsewhere because it is so raw and pure, the sound itself is original rather than a live version of his studio albums. Theres a wide range of variations in between the 16 songs from the powerful angst of \\"Head Like A Hole\\" to a soft moving ballad like \\"The Great Below\\". This is even excluding the mysterious instrumentals such as \\"The Mark Has Been Made\\" and \\"The Frail\\". Although the sounds of the audience are in the mix, they do not interfere with the recording at all. This is the great feature seperating this CD from the live albums of other bands. Reznor incorporates every detail distinctively including his famous ... replacements in between lyrics. Overall, this is a MUST buy for any old NIN fans, but also an outstanding introduction to new NIN fans like me.
B000002UA7|5.0|Kate Bush's The Whole Story is woefully incomplete when put up against the shear wealth of the 5 full studio albums which preceded its release.  It is only by the virtue of the strength of the recordings which made it on, that the CD finds it's worth.<br />Kate's music is highly driven by rock, theater, and classical music.  Clear influences include Pink Floyd, The Beatles, and Peter Gabriel and his initial band Genesis.  <br />She has been away a great many years since the release of her last record, The Red Shoes.  Here's hoping for her return in 2003.
B00005JL3A|4.0|I wonder that George A Ramero was not  mentioned more in review. This movie seemed to me to be a modern big budget dawn of the dead in space. It DISTURBED me greatly. Pretty horrible so if you like that sort of thing you are likely to like this. I'm not sure if I liked it or  not but it was interesting and compelling.
B000007MVX|5.0|I was fortunate enough to see the 1973 Passion Play concert tour.<BR>It was one of the top 5 performances I've ever seen. The group<BR>played \\"Passion Play\\" to open the show, got a huge ovation at the<BR>conclusion, and then Ian said \\"thank you so much, and now for our<BR>second number......\\" and then they immediately launched into \\"Thick as a Brick\\" and played the entire piece as well. I've<BR>never seen a group play 2 40 minute-plus songs to open a show before or since. The rest of the show consisted of \\"Cross-eyed<BR>Mary\\", \\"Aqualung\\", \\"Locomotive Breath\\" and \\"Wind Up\\" was the encore song. I had great seats on the floor of the L.A. Forum,<BR>about 20 rows back. A rather enjoyable evening for 6.50 a ticket.<BR>Ian Anderson himself considers this Tull's finest album, need I<BR>say more? All Tull fans should own this CD. Buy it and wear it out......
B000065V41|5.0|My 7 year old loves this and we do too!  It is a much more authentic Dickens than any other Christmas Carol that I have seen, yet it's still lots of fun for kids.  And how can you beat having Michael Caine as Scrooge? I'm glad that my child will be learning the story from this version and not from Mr. Magoo like we did!  :)
B000002UAU|5.0|This album is undoubtedly the greatest album ever made!  It shows the world that rock music could be an art. YOu can't go wrong with this album- there is something amazing in every song.  It starts out great with the title song, which has become a classic, and goes straight into \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\"  which is possibly one of the best songs Ringo ever did.  \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\"  is one of John's greatest songs.  No one else could have the imagination to write a song like that except him, and it does NOT have anything to do with LSD the way so many people seem to think it does. The way it was portrayed in \\"Yellow Submarine\\" is unforgettable. \\"Getting Better\\"  is a great song by Paul McCartney, and so is \\"Fixing A Hole\\"  which is nice, soft, and simple, exactly what belonged on this album.  \\"She's Leaving Home\\" is one of the most beatiful songs on the album, and is portrayed so sentimentally by Paul that you feel like it's happening to you.  \\"Mr. Kite\\"  is another example of John's creativity, and is light-hearted, easily a John Lennon classic.  \\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\"  is a classic vaudeville song, and is one of Paul McCartney's most famous songs.  It is light, bouncy, and leaves you in a good mood.  \\"Lovely Rita\\"  is an example of Paul bringing out his not-much-seen nonsensical side, and is a great addition to the album.  \\"Good Morning Good Morning\\" is one of John's strangest, but goes along with the feel of the album, and the animal sounds on the end are a perfect way to start the Sgt. Pepper Reprise, which is somewhat faster than the first one, and ends unpredictably by going slower at the end, right into \\"A Day in the Life\\".  This last song is one of the best songs the Beatles ever did, and is John Lennon's most famous Beatles song.  It is mainly about what he read in the news that day, and in the middle hasd Paul adding a little part of his own into it. Easliy right up there with \\"Strawberry Fields\\" as to how great it is.  This song is the high point of the album, and makes a perfect ending to the best Beatles album ever made.  This is the perfect album, and changed the way people looked at rock music forever.  One of the most important, and undoubtedly the best album ever released by the Beatles, and by anyone else.  However, if you are just starting to listen to the Beatles, don't start with this one, start with something earlier like\\"A Hard Day's Night\\", another great album.
6302641888|5.0|PERSONA may well be Ingmar Bergman's most complex film--yet, like many Bergman films, the story it tells is superficially simple.  Actress Elizabeth Volger has suddenly stopped speaking in what appears to be an effort to cease all communication with the external world.  She is taken to a hospital, where nurse Alma is assigned to care for her.  After some time, Elisabeth's doctor feels the hospital is of little use to her; the doctor accordingly lends her seaside home to Elisabeth, who goes there with Alma in attendance.  Although Elisabeth remains silent, the relationship between the women is a pleasant one--until a rainy day, too much alcohol, and Elisabeth's silence drives Alma into a series of highly charged personal revelations.<br /><br />It is at this point that the film, which has already be super-saturated with complex visual imagery, begins to create an unnerving and deeply existential portrait of how we interpret others, how others interpret us, and the impact that these interpretations have upon both us and them.  What at first seemed fond glances and friendly gestures from the silent Elisabeth are now suddenly open to different interpretations, and Alma--feeling increasingly trapped by the silence--enters into a series of confrontations with her patient... but these confrontations have a dreamlike quality, and it becomes impossible to know if they are real or imagined--and if imagined, in which of the women's minds the fantasy occurs.<br /><br />Ultimately, Bergman seems to be creating a situation in which we are forced to acknowledge that a great deal of what we believe we know about each other rests largely upon what we ourselves project upon them.  Elisabeth's face and its expressions become akin to a blank screen on which we see our own hopes, dreams, torments, and tragedies projected--while the person behind the face constantly eludes our understanding.  In this respect, the theme is remarkably well-suited to its medium: the blankness of the cinema screen with its flickering, endless shifting images that can be interpreted in infinite ways.<br /><br />Bergman is exceptionally fortunate in his actresses here: both Liv Ullman as the silent Elisabeth and Bibi Anderson as the increasingly distraught Alma offer incredible performances that seem to encompass both what we know from the obvious surface and what we can never know that exists behind their individual masks.  Ullman has been justly praised for the power of her silence in this film, and it is difficult to imagine another actress who could carry off a role that must be performed entirely by ambigious implications.  Anderson is likewise remarkable, her increasing levels of emotional distress resounding like the waves upon the rocks at their seaside retreat.  And Bergman and his celebrated cinematographer Sven Nykvist fill the screen with a dreamlike quality that is constantly interrupted by unexpected images ranging from glimpses of silent films to a moment at which the celluloid appears to burn to images that merge Ullman and Anderson's faces into one.<br /><br />As in many of his films, Bergman seems to be stating that we cannot know another person, and that our inability to know is our greatest tragedy.  But however the film is interpreted, it is a stunning and powerful achievement, one that will resonate with the viewer long after the film ends.  On a technical note, I recommend the MGM video release (and am astonished that the film is not available on DVD as yet); although the subtitles have moments of what is clearly poor translation, they are easy to read.  I cannot recommend this film too strongly.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerscreen with its flickering, endless shifting images that can be interpreted in infinite ways.<br /><br />Bergman is exceptionally fortunate in his actresses here: both Liv Ullman as the silent Elisabeth and Bibi Anderson as the increasingly distraught Alma offer incredible performances that seem to encompass both what we know from the obvious surface and what we can never know that exists behind their individual masks.

B00006RAKP|5.0|At the price of a single CD, you get three hours of some of the best music from one of the 20th Century's most popular and talented artists.  Since the release (and subsequesnt re-release) of 1990's terrific box set TO BE CONTINUED, Elton John has hit the U.S. Top 40 twelve more times.  All but four of those are included here, including the No. 1 duet with George Michael on &quot;Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me&quot; (included on the bonus disc), through 1999's duet with LeAnn Rimes on &quot;Written in the Stars&quot; from ELTON JOHN AND TIM RICE'S &quot;AIDA.&quot; The only really glaring omission is his 1997 remake of &quot;Candle in the Wind.&quot;  However, I confess I much prefer the version included here from his 1987 album ELTON JOHN LIVE IN AUSTRALIA.  In addition the 40-page booklet is filled with photos, liner notes by biographer Paul Gambaccini, and a complete pictoral album discography. So if you're looking to update the box set (like me), or simply waiting for a more economic greatest hits package that cherry picks the hits from the past thirty years, this album will not disappoint.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
6305508550|1.0|If you value your time and money, don't waste 10 more seconds thinking about buying this horribly bad movie.  You will want to write to the producers and ask them to give you an hour and a half of your life back.  This movie is a tribute to the eternal question of, &quot;Why do people keep giving Jennifer Aniston movies?&quot;  I'm not saying that this movie is the worst one ever made, but without a doubt it comes in a very close second.
0920668372|1.0|Frankly, I find this book very disturbing.  A mother who drives across town with a ladder tied to her car, climbs into her adult sons bedroom and crawls across the floor to sing him a lullaby is just creepy.  In reality, that behaviour in a mother would cause her to be committed and that behaviour in a boy/girlfriend would result in a restraining order.  No matter how well intended, I'm bothered by teaching a child that obsessiveness is love.
B000003C4M|5.0|The best Punk-metal album ever recorded.O.K. the sound is ugly, the musicians are just awful but it's just what Heavy metal needed at that time...a good kick in the balls!<BR>Each song is a masterpiece rolled in mud and thrown at your face.<BR>WELCOME TO HELL is the first black-trash-metal album released and is a reference to bands which would become bigger than VENOM-slayer, Metallica, etc...<BR>It is the production or the lack of production that makes that album so thick (sick) and powerful.There's also a second degree humour in this one-Schizo, In league with satan, Red light fever and I don't think that Venom was really involved in any satanic crap, they were just using it for the image, to shock your mama  and have some great fun.It surely worked and still does.

B00004RFCM|1.0|Call me cynical, but a show about women especially womens sexuality that is written by men loses all possible credibility.  This show is the poster child for artistic restraint, graphic dialogue doesn't make this compelling.  It is just for shock value, all of it.  Every possible sexual maneuver and quirk is brought up and dissected ad nauseum.  There's a reason this couldn't be on network tv, its garbage.  I mean Will & Grace is much more funny and touching.  It also does more to dispel stereotypes and squash taboos then Sex and the City could ever hope to do, SITC is just put your hand over your mouth television.  \\"I can't believe they are talking about this.\\" is about the best reaction they got out of me.  If thats what they want then fine, but there is better, so much better stuff out there.  By the way, I'm a guy, so I guess I just don't get it.
B00006LLNU|3.0|The reviews already posted describe the musical experience of Sigur-Ros very well. Sigur-Ros produces a kind of music that transcends (or descends?) to a level of undefinability from the opening chords of the untitled first song (they're all untitled). Sigur-Ros deals in calm sound structures that seem to want to challenge the listener to stay awake. This music is excruciatingly slow, even though it's tonal and melodic throughout.<br />I am giving this disk three stars because you are either going to love this music or hate it. I found that emotionally I hate it. I'm a typical get-to-the-point American and I want to boogie now. On the other hand, intellectually I came to appreciate the truly unique vision of this music. It conjures a mental (and certainly aural) mindscape like no one else--and contemporary pop music absolutely NEEDS visionaries right now.<br />Pop music (both national and international) has been a creative vacuum for about three years now, at least since MTV and VH1 began pushing skinhead-grunge-rap and the hedonistic credos to materialism and gold jewelry that regular rap music has become. At least with Sigur-Ros we get a kind of music that is genuinely original, if not a little bit off-putting at times. But the other reviews listed here give a good description of their music and you should be able to make a decision as to whether to invest in this music or not.  At the very least, you'll tap into some of the oddest soundscapes you've ever heard in the music of Sigur-Ros. Whether it's thumbs up or thumbs down, you have to decide.
B0000029AP|5.0|My second Aerosmith favourite album after the eponymous first album.Great rockin' tracks-Toys in the attic, Adam's Apple-Great HEAVY tracks-Round and Round, the classic Sweet Emotion-Great fun tracks-Walk this way, Big ten Inch, No more No more...<BR>On top of that the very-inspired ballad You see me crying which has nothing to envy to their latests soporiphic mtv ballads.<BR>A very good 70's production, a lot of energy, a great deal of guitar solos, a Tyler at his best and most of all a lot of creativity and sincerity.
B000002KDO|5.0|Their debut was based loosely on Cream-inspired jams, and PARANOID their style came together perfectly, but they pushed it a step further with 1971's MASTER OF REALITY. First, Iommi detuned his guitar which gave ther band a darker, more ominious and sludgy sound. Second, the lyrics in a way, have matured, but they more or less mimic those of PARANOID, but they're still excellent. &quot;After Forever&quot; is the first Sabbath song to incorporate keyboards, &quot;Solitude&quot; shows a very soft side of Sabbath without sounding like a cheesy ballad (i.e. &quot;Changes&quot;) but a very sad and somber ballad about a demise of a romance, and there are two Iommmi guitar solo pieces &quot;Orchid&quot; and &quot;Embryo.&quot; <BR><BR>The heavier songs rule and deal with real subject matter. &quot;Sweet Leaf&quot; is an ode to marijuana. &quot;After Forever,&quot; actually condemned for its supposed Christian attacking lyrics by all the right-wingers who hated them, is actually condemning Satanism (citing God as 'the only way to love'). &quot;Children of the Grave&quot; is heavy and sludgy reflecting warfare and social unrest, kind of in the vein of War Pigs, and the other two songs, &quot;Lord of This World&quot; and &quot;Into The Void&quot; are amazing.<BR><BR>Unfortunately, this was their last entriely consistent album, for their next 2 albums (VOL. 4, SABBTH BLOODY SABBATH) had a few mediocre cuts,and then Sabbath became a terrible self-parody, especially after Ozzy Osbourne left. Along with their first 2 records, MASTER OF REALITY is one of the greatest metal albums ever.
1586210912|5.0|I know that many reviews are long and very detailed.  Unfortunately there are too many positive points brought up in this book for me to mention.  Frankly, I have better things to spend my time doing but I wanted to say that I would highly recommend this book.<br />It is a book for beginners.  It is only a starting place, but gives you (if you are open to its ideas) some direction in a very chaotic world of money.<br />Don't take my word for it, try it yourself.  Don't be stuck in the rat race... make money work for you.
B00005BKZJ|5.0|Baghdad Cafe will haunt you.  Will creep into your mind later with no reason than to remind you (with a subtle dry humor) others struggle, like yourself, to fit in, be understood, and accepted.  Holly Cole singing &quot;Calling You&quot; adds to the enchantment and strength behind the characters.  If you want to escape from your own troubles, I recommend that you join this cast of misfits as they find each other and themselves.
B000002JSJ|5.0|Presence is a very cerebral zep's album.Probably the most complex album they've released in terms in rythm and song structure.Achilles last stand is the perfect example, a long complex composition where the guitar and the bass/drums play hide and seek knowing exactly where they're going.Nobody's fault but mine is another one of those beat-broken tracks, but don't get me wrong that's what makes the beauty of this work!<BR>Plant's voice might not be as clear and pure as it was on LZ4 or Houses of the Holy, but he sounds like a person who lived a lot and finally knows why he's screaming and winning for-unfortunately for him thru a great deal of pain.<BR>The massive TEA FOR ONE concludes the album, a heavy-epic blues so full of sorrows and honesty it just makes you wanna hit  the &quot;repeat album&quot; button.LED ZEP's heaviest album, no folk songs on this one, less diversified than most of their work but very mature.
B00003CX9E|5.0|It is OK to think that Citizen Kane is not the greatest ever, even though I do.  However, those who think this movie is terrible or a waste of time just do not truly apprecaiate film as art.  No director ever has or ever will be so far ahead of his time as Orson Wells was.  The same people who hate this move are the same people that hate every movie that doesn't have Adam Sandler, Harry Potter, or $100 million in special effects.  This DVD is fantasic, as well as teh documentry on the second disc.
6304698658|5.0|The film that inspired a whole generation of exterior illuminators! Subsequent to the release of this film, houses soon began Christmas-light makeovers, which I think really adds to the atmosphere of the season! Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo are superb in this John Hughes classic Christmas comedy - as is Randy Quaid. Clark W Griswold Jnr is anxious to have the 'perfect' old fashioned, fun, family Chritmas. But, as usual, nothing goes according to plan: Getting stuck under a truck in the opening minutes... becoming psychotic over the failing of the thousands of lights he's added to the building... ruining the Christmas of Tod and Margo (their yuppie, bourgesois next door neighbours)...Eddie (Quaid) kidnapping Clark's boss because Clark didn't recieve his bonus cheque, needed to pay for a swimming pool...a storm sewer exploding (and the poor cat!)...the tree getting burnt...etc...Leading to the house teetering on 'the threshold of Hell'! There are many great moments in this movie. My personal favourite is when he takes Eddie and the kids sledging: a silicone-based kitchen lubricant Clark's company invented is smeared onto his sledge, propelling him like a rocket! The scenery is so Christmassy here. I have a selection of Christmas movies I stack around the video at this time of year. Christmas Vacation takes prime position. I have seen it *so* many times yet I am still not bored with it. Note: There is mild bad language in the PG version, but for those with younger children, some versions have worse. I really don't know why Hughes had to do this; this film could be accessible to all, as with Miracle On 34th Street (Hughes' remake). As is usual with John Hughes, those typical huge mansions (as with Home Alone, Ferris Bueller and Uncle Buck) feature. The photography is very Christmassy and it just might get you in the mood... The DVD has the trailer (including the other Vacation trailers), different language options, production notes etc... I am glad to have found a site that sells those reindeer egg nog glasses too!
B0000029AL|5.0|It took me awhile to really appreciate this album, I suppose that at first I was more blinded by the production of ROCKS, TOYS-both incredibly good albums-but then I realised maybe thanks to the OVER-PRODUCTION of their 90's releases, that AEROSMITH is a great rocking band featuring amazing song-writters.So back to their roots, I re-discovered their first album:pure, raw garage rock.<BR>The compos on this album are so good that they don't need a big production, listen to MAMA KIN, MAKE IT or the classic DREAM ON and take a dive into the real aerosmith.<BR>Sure those who discovered aerosmith with PUMP or GET A GRIP will be dissapointed unless they can understand you don't need millions of $ to make a great album!<BR>It's all in the soul!
B00006CXXU|5.0|What can I say? This cd is just wonderful! Christina really shows that she can sing sing sing! My most favorite song is The Voice Within, but all of the songs are excellent. <br />If you weren't a fan of Christina's before, this cd will change your mind for sure. I have all three of her cd's not including her Christmas cd which I am going to get this year. <br />I recommend this cd for every one who is a fan or not....to just listen to the music. Almost each song has a great message in it for everyone. <br />I'd give it ten stars if I could.
630018403X|5.0|This is probably the only TRUE movie that deals with the different cliques at a high school.  It has someone who's rich and popular (Molly Ringwald), someone who's jocky and pressured (Emilio Estevez), someone who's geeky and quiet (Anthony Michael Hall), someone who's tough and abused (Judd Nelson) and someone who's weird and lonely (Ally Sheedy).  They spend on Saturday detention with each other and realize that they're not so different from each other.  All going through the same problems like teens.  This movie is one of the best TEEN movies and should get an award for different ways of expressing the truth of high school.  Viva John Hughes!
B00006GA48|5.0|As a fan, you need this CD if only for the bonus tracks alone.
B00006L7XQ|4.0|Being a Cash fan for about 1/4 of my life(I'm 16), I have praised Cash for his great songwriting and musicianship. But also, he has good taste in music; as is resembled on this collection. <br />As the title of this review says, there are some strong songs in this collection: 'The Man Comes Around', 'Hurt'(I'm a Nine Inch Nails Fan), 'Personal Jesus', 'In My Life'. But some songs on this cd are sort of boring; 'I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry', 'Streets of Laredo'; then there are the OK songs; which is every other song. <br />One review I have read that this selection is one of Cash's best; I wouldn't go that far. But if you want something that is better that 95% of what is on the radio and MTV/VH1/CMT/and every other music TV station; pick this one up.
B000002UAF|1.0|This one is recorded in mono only. I guess it was digitally remastered but in fact was not!<BR>PS: only for beatles fans!
B00005JKDR|5.0|DISC ONE: For moviegoers during summer of 2001, the marquee was packed with animated options: Shrek, Atlantis, Final Fantasy and Monsters, Inc. If you disect the movies, the first two end up being dissapointing when viewed in the small screen and Final Fantasy is just made with a different public in mind. Now, Monsters, Inc. achieves in DVD format the same feel you got when you (hopefully) saw it in theaters: the movie IS a great movie for all ages. No bells and whistles: simply brilliant!<br />The script is very funny, clever and innovative (it is worth seeing on the DVD how much it evolved from the original treatment it was going to have...), turning around the ageless childhood fear of monsters into a fear of kids BY monsters, who need kids' screams in order to power their society. Top ranking scarer, big, blue and furry Sulley (voiced by John Goodman) and his one-eyed assitant, Mike Wazowski (brilliantly played by Billy Crystal) see their &quot;monstrous&quot; lives turned around when Sulley accidentally brings a little girl (Boo) by accident into their monster world.<br />Complementing the script and the voices, the animation is incredible. The faces of the characters, the blinking of the eyes (the red in the eyes, when Mike sprays antibacterial stuff on his face, the glassy look in Sulley's eyes toward the end of the movie), the fur of Sulley (every hair moving just as if he were real), the illumination all through the movie. Plus the persecution scene leaves you speechless: there's SO MUCH happening in it, and it's so seamless: one of the great animation accomplishments of the movie without any doubt.<br />DISC TWO: One element that powerfully called my attention is the very human (is that ironic or what?) touch that the second disc has. For example, the Director, the two Co-Directors and the Producer appear in the very beginning, showing you how to find your way around the DVD. It's not that it's a convoluted DVD or anything of that sort: simply the two discs are packed with all sorts of goodies and they are making an effort to have you find it all.<br />One of the best things included in disc 2 is the Oscar-winning animated short film &quot;For The Birds&quot; which we all enjoyed in theaters so much right before Monsters started. Also included are the complete outtakes (call them &quot;bloopers&quot; from the movie, if you may, whose concept alone makes you scratch your head in surprise while you laugh till it hurts). But the fun to disc two doesn't end there: there is a wealth of details for the more technically-inclined or those who simply are curious about the way animation is done, with a whole tour through the process, from story reels, to layout, animation, simulation (a key component in the level of perfection accomplished with Sulley's fur and the way Boo's big shirt works) ahd shading/lighting. Same thing is done with design and music &amp; sound. Wrapping up the goodies is a pretty fun tour of Pixar studios where you can catch a glimpse of why these guys are able to come up with such a funny movie: they're having a blast there! :D<br />Technical comments<br />-If you view the DVD on a computer (as I did), the first time you do it, you will go through the installation of the InterActual player software. Hit &quot;Accept&quot; at every step of the way: whether you like it or not, you won't be able to take advantage of all the elements in the DVDs unless you view it using this software...<br />-Another detail for computer users: the &quot;Peek-A-Boo Door game&quot; was useless on my computer. It's designed to be played when viewing the DVD on a DVD player. In fact, it almost brings my laptop to its knees. So, my recommendation to you DVD-viewers using a computer to go past the intro page with all the games on it and click on to view the movie.<br />-Subtitles included are in English only, so that probably will not make Spanish-only or French-only-speaking viewers too happy, n'est-ce pas? Verdad?<br />In general, though, excellent! Five stars to this incredible production by Disney and to its Two-Disc Collector's Edition. You will enjoy every bit of it and watch it several times over.ugh, excellent! Five stars to this incredible production by Disney and to its Two-Disc Collector's Edition. You will enjoy every bit of it and watch it several times over.
6304708491|2.0|They were musicians not film star! the music is ok but the acting is terrible.
B00001OH7M|5.0|There are truly some outstanding lyrics and songs here.  Allow me to begin with my personal favorites: &quot;Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed,&quot; (hence my review title), &quot;Janine,&quot; &quot;Cygnet Committee,&quot; and &quot;Memories of a Free Cloud Festival.&quot; Yes, we all know the title track (even non-Bowie fans know it well), but I don't think that it's the best track on this album. Perhaps I would think otherwise it I hadn't heard the song, oh, about ten thousand times. Do I exaggerate? Perhaps.  But I do know that my non-Bowie fan friends (and I'm one of those truly obsessive Bowie fans out there, as in &quot;Oh I adore this musician I must absolutely own everything he has ever released and not only listen to all his albums day in and day out-- an offhand allusion there to his album &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot;-- but I must also make everyone in my circle listen to Bowie with the hope that they will, if not at least love his music as I do, then they should certainly appreciate him as a musician!&quot;), recognize &quot;Space Oddity,&quot; and will at least humor me when it is played, by singing along. :)<BR>There is so much more to this album.  It is a breakthrough, yes; somewhere between the adorable likes of his early early stuff (such as &quot;Love You Till Tuesday,&quot; &quot;Little Bombadier,&quot; and his exquisite cover of &quot;Penny Lane&quot;) and, say, &quot;Hunky Dory,&quot; or &quot;Alladin Sane,&quot; etc, etc., but it is a stupendous breakthrough, nevertheless.  Critics may say that he was &quot;finding his voice&quot; with this album, that with this album he was becoming the David Bowie persona that would change and change again for his audience, and I must agree, but I'm not certain that it is necessary to listen to this album while comparing it to the rest of his oeuvre. Genius, yes.  Way before his time, naturally.  His lyrics appeal to my most poetic side while still compelling me to sing (or at least hum) along to his melodies.  And &quot;Space Oddity&quot; does this; the songs grasp you, make you want to sing along, spaced out as you change lanes, but you cannot help but to ponder the metaphorical/metaphysical/ philosophical aspects of his lyrics: &quot;And I want to Believe/ In the madness that calls &quot;Now.&quot;/ That's a light's shining through,/ Somehow. . .  And I Want to Believe. . . I Want to Live. . .&quot;  Even so, there are some lyrics that are maddingly simplistic and unforgettable: &quot;So take your glasses off and don't act so sincere. . .&quot;  The best of all possible worlds, perhaps?  That is to say, the profound and philosophical realm merging with the simplistic and beatific realm of happiness and well-being. . .&quot;It was God's land/ It was ragged and naive/ It was Heaven. . .&quot; It may sound exhaustingly cliched, but this album definitely captures the transition between the peachy blissed-out state of the sixties and the new awareness/consciousness of the seventies. . . I had yet to be born, but, on listening to this album, I get this feeling of transition.  Not only historically, considering the events of that era which would influence my generation, but also in listening to the lyrics which would eventually evolve (?) into those of &quot;The Thin White Duke.&quot;  A peculiar transition, and a welcome one.   This album is a must for any Bowie fan.
B000002UA9|1.0|oh cool! it was the beat music is the 60s, therefore they called them beatles.<BR>they wanted to be Elvis and copied mostly american rock n roll and rhythm and blues. Included The isle Brothers original song Twist and shout!
B00005O5CM|4.0|I reccomend this movie to anyone who needs a quick pick me up. <BR>It's inspirational and optimistic -a real feel good movie.<BR>Reese Witherspoon is great as Elle, a sororety queen preocupied with fashion and manicures.  When she's dumped by her boyfriend for a more &quot;serious girl&quot;, Elle is crushed at first but is then determined to get her man back.<BR>Our heroin applies to Harvand Law School, where her man &quot;goes&quot; in order to prove that she can be that girl.  From the minute Elle leaves LA and arrives in Cambridge the audience is in for a coctail of comedy...as overt and as cliche as it may be Witherspoon manages to deliver it with such energy and believability that any veiwer will live that role with her.<BR>Between the chuckles, the stoy manages to show how determination, faith in oneself and good values can turn every obsticle and challenge into personal development.
B000001EHS|1.0|I really like to try to keep an open mind to exploring different styles of music. However, this greatest hits compilation by Def Leppard shows this band to be mediocre at best and unlistenable at their worst.<br />It starts with their lead vocalist. The man just screetches and scratches his way through nearly every song especially the hard rockers. The man hardly even tries to sing. The sond comming out of his mouth is more like a drunken yell. Now I like my share of hard rock n roll singers. David Lee Roth has personality and style, Paul Rodgers has blues and soul, Ian Gillan brought power and range in his prime. Heck even Vince Neil from Motley Crue added an edgy bluesy style with some colorful vocalizing. This lead singer(Joe Elliot??) brings nothing but an annoying yell and a half baked effort.<br />As for the instrumental support, it is just the same from track to track. Guitar solos devoid of any passion or soul. Both these players just try to solo as fast as possible without adding any color or tone to the notes that they are playing. The drumming is fairly steady but limited in regards to special effects and style. In addition, there seems to be a synthesized effect that is just plain annoying on most of these tracks. By the way where is the bass player in the mix? He is barely heard from in the mix of the annoying crunching guitars and the over used synthesizer. Gosh these guys mine the use of the synthesizer with the exact sound effects through nearly every song.<br />Now the songs do have decent structures. There are verses, a chorus(sort of that is if you count repeating the same words over and over again as a sufficient and memorable chorus), and on some occasions even a bridge. However, the little stylings that exist on great recordings by the Beatles, Stevie Wonder, and The Who and even good recordings by Van Halen and Paul Rodgers era Bad Company are just non-existent on this greatest hits compilation. And the lyrics are just so basic that they do not sound any more mature than a teenage bar band just starting to write their first songs.  That is when you can decipher the words that Old Yeller is screaming!!!!!!<br />Out of fifteen songs on this compilation, only Live Bites and possibly Bringin' On The Heartbreak seem to be even a little memorable. Whereas ballads like Missin' You In A Heartbeat and Two Steps Behind don't offend me, they just don't compare with even similar material written by the reasonably melodic Bon Jovi.<br />Fans of eighties hair metal and synthesizer drivel should probably bypass this review and just buy this compilation or maybe even Hysteria. Maybe I just cannot relate to the mindset of that era. But those who appreciate music with quality songwriting, good singing and instrumental prowess should avoid this compilation and anything by this band like the plague.t sound any more mature than a teenage bar band just starting to write their first songs.

B00007G1ZM|5.0|I've had this on tape for years and can't wait for the DVD. This is probably the ultimate Crawford movie. She even won her only Oscar for it. When we first meet Mildred she's a beleagured houswife saddled with two daughters and an unfaithful husband. She bakes pies and sells them to the neighbors to make ends meet. When she finally throws her husband out, she gets a job as a waitress. But she has a bigger problem: her oldest daughter, Veda, is an ungrateful little wretch who is never satisfied. Mildred can't do anything right to please her. Mildred finally learns the restaurant business thanks to her friend---the matchless Eve Arden---and opens her own place. But Veda still isn't satisfied so Mildred expands her business into a chain of \\"Mildreds'\\". The youngest daughter dies and Mildred is devastated but Veda, bless her, is DELIGHTED. She can now have Mother all to herself and milk her for every cent she has. Veda turns into the daughter-from-hell as Mildred becomes a restaurant tycoon. But darker waters lay ahead for Mildred as she goes bankrupt thanks to the no-good playboy she marries for title to further please that worthless little tramp Veda. He even begins fooling around with Veda until she shoots him and tries to get Mildred to take the blame. Of all the rags-to-riches dames Crawford ever played this is the ultimate. Director Michael Curtiz didn't want Crawford for Mildred and humiliated her publicly but Crawford stuck it out and won him over. James M. Cains' novel had to be toned down for the screen but it still ranks as classic film noir and very sticky soap opera. Ann Blyth is mightily impressive as the evil Veda and matches Crawford scene for scene through all their confrontations. The film is a must see for Crawford, Blyth and the wonderful Eve Arden. Carol Burnett even parodied it in a classic sketch on one of her old TV shows. You know she had to love it as much as we do.
B000001EXB|2.0|This Elton John release just is not up to par by any means.  Yes there are some \\"good\\" songs: Long Way From Happiness, Love Like Horses, Something In The Way You Look Tonight, and The Big Picture.  These songs are indeed well crafted.  However, they fall a bit short of the best of Elton's Classic 70's period as well as from other top releases like The One and Made In England.<br />The remaining tracks aren't terrible per say.  However, they just drag on and on without having anything meaningful to say.  Coupled with the fact that most of them are over five minutes long, its a real chore to listen to this CD in one sitting.<br />Furthermore, the pacing and stylings of the record are limited.  Way too many ballads and mid tempo pieces that lack excitement and verve.  On top of that, the arrangements are so identical.  Must every piece have a synthesizer string arrangement?  Elton's trademark keyboard runs just aren't present enough in the overall mix.  Yes there are some good solos, but once the solo is finished Elton's piano playing more often than not falls into the background behind the strings.  The guitar, bass, and drums don't do anything exciting on any of the tracks.<br />A few good songs here and there, but I would recommend passing on this collection.
B00005LOUP|2.0|I can't put my finger on just what it is about this movie that turns me off.  It can't just be the absence of the magnificent Boris Karloff.  Somehow, this movie feels loveless.  It has a cold, cynical feeling to it to me.  I simply do not get the feeling that this was done out of a love of Christmas or Dr. Suess or anything other than Mammon, the Holy Dollar.  It isn't &quot;nasty&quot; or anything.  IT will certainly entertain small children.  The &quot;backstory&quot; of how the Grinch became &quot;grinchy&quot; feels forced and shallow.  I just think it was ill-advised to stretch this simple, beautiful original story into this long, empty movie.  To me, it's as if I decided to &quot;improve&quot; the Mona Lisa, because, for example, I think I can &quot;show people what she is smiling at.&quot;
B00003CX95|3.0|The thing about Historical movies is that people who watch them sometimes really ARE interested in History. Go figure. And the inattention to History in the name of History seems a good reason to be frustrated with the film.<br />I'm not an expert on the subject, and I think I did learn a few things, and was entertained. The battle scenes are interestingly created even if there are a few romantic inaccuracies like the Irish and Scots not fighting each other. I didn't \\"love the tartans\\" as one reviewer put it, but I'm not sure they were really Tartans. And I did find the scenes of conflict and subjugation by the English soldiers, looking like so many Imperial Roman troops, of the Scots natives looking like any original British (celtic) isle natives, beaten and downtrodden by their masters, very compelling.<br />Patrick MacGoohan is great as the evil king Edward Longshanks. And of course, he's the real reason I got this movie in the first place. (I humbly admit to planning to employ the FF button.) Sophie Marceau, as his daughter-in-law, Princess Isabella, is stunningly beautiful. But if you know anything about her character in History, you know it's not likely she was a lover of Freedom and the masses anymore than her father-in-law was. Does it matter? Well, maybe not to you. And the portrayal of her [homosexual] husband, the future Edward II, is borderline offensive. He's the stereotypically weak and effeminate homosexual, who unlike the butch heterosexual men is actually frightened by the severed head of his relative, and is not good at, uh, fighting. Lets pray Gibson doesn't make a movie about Alexander the Great. The actor playing Robert the Bruce is very good, and there are moments of nice interplay between him and his increasingly scrofulous father who is angling to get his son the throne. But Bruce comes off kind of as a pampered noble in the grip of Machiavellian forces, whereas in actual fact Bruce may have been much rougher. You won't hear the schoolchild story about the Spider Surviving in this film. It's all about Wallace, and Wallace is all about Gibson.<br />There's a documentary about the making of the film on the DVD, which looked like it could have been very interesting--I wanted to hear more about lenses, but after five minutes of Mel is great. Mel is great. Mel is great,\\" and two seconds of \\"You know. William Wallace was a REAL person,\\" I had to stop watching...
B00006M183|5.0|Putting Riot Act in my CD player for the first time the waves of nostalgis rolled over me and i almost crumpled under their weight. Pearl Jam is back. The opening track stamps that thought straight into your brain the minute you hear the first riff. I knew it reminded me of another one of their albums and i couldn't quitre put my finger on it. At first i thought &quot;woa, another Vs.&quot; and was ecstatic, then i thought No Code (Look At Bushleaguer) and was ecstatic. then i thought maybe binaural. but  was wrong: this album is an amalgamation of the last twelve years of their rock history. And i was ecstatic
B00005Y228|4.0|What I love about this cd is that every song is upbeat.  If I feel like dancing this is what I listen to.  My only problem with it is the songs with sexual conotations.  To me, that's [needless].  It makes me think of singers like Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera and I hate them.
B00004U8P3|5.0|When I was a kid, I always had an obsession with dinosaurs, so it was natural that, at the tender age of 9, I embraced Jurassic Park as THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER MADE.  I have since grown considerably since then, and now in my late teens, have come to the conclusion that Jurassic Park is indeed not the greatest movie ever made.  But it's a damn good one, and it's an even match with any of the Indiana Jones films for sheer escapist adventure (thank God Steven Spielberg directed films during my adolescence).  <br />This movie is, of course, hardly plot-driven, but a summary of sorts is in order.  Sam Neill stars as Alan Grant, a paleontologist who doesn't much like high-tech equipment, or kids for that matter.  Laura Dern stars as his girlfriend, Ellie Sattler, apparently a paleobotanist.  Both of them (along with Jeff Goldblum as a chaos theoretician) are invited to an amusement park by a rather kindly, enthusiastic old man named John Hammond (Richard Attenborough).  Well, it turns out the park is full of cloned dinosaurs and they've arrived as experts to deem whether or not the place is safe for tourists.  But a saboteur within the park knocks out the power, leaving the guests stranded somewhere in the island, and the hungry dinosaurs on the loose, searching for food.<br />Premise like that sounds like fun, doesn't it?  And yes, Jurassic Park is very fun.  It's unlikely anyone who's reading this review has never seen the movie, but it's always nice to reiterate to a fan (or detractor) why it is I hold such adoration for this film. Ever since Jurassic Park's initial theatrical release, the movie's always had a lot of unfair criticism thrown at it, a lot of it aimed at how Spielberg should have learned his lesson from Jaws and show restraint toward presenting the dinos, or how the character development was somewhat lacking.  I'm guessing the fact it was directed by Spielberg set it up for far more nitpicky complaints than if it had been helmed by someone else (which makes it all the more amazing how acclaimed Spielberg's movies, especially his most recent ones, are).<br />To both alleged faults, I cannot agree with.  Whether or not anyone actually noticed, Spielberg actually showed restraint by not revealing the T-rex (or dilophosaurus) right off the bat, waiting patiently until the perfect moment, when all hell breaks loose.  As a result, its first appearance is truly terrifying.  Besides, these are dinosaurs, gargantuan sights that are appropriately astounding and awe-inspiring (with these images nicely boosted by John Williams' rousing score), and with such great special effects on hand, holding back the sight of the dinosaurs would be a pretty silly notion.<br />As for the characters, most everyone here made at least a slight impression on me.  Sam Neill is great as always, playing the likeable Grant as a convincing action hero who never resorts to ridiculous stunts.  The friendship he develops with the two kids (Joseph Mazzello, Ariana Richards) is \\"typical\\" Spielberg, but what's typical of his is still far better done than your average, first-rate filmmaker (yeah, I admit it, I'm an exremely ardent Spielberg fan).  The other performances are good; Jeff Goldblum is very funny as the sarcastic chaotician, Laura Dern makes a sexy heroine, and Bob Peck is simply too cool as the park's game hunter.  Loved the man, wish he was in the movie more.  <br />It's interesting to note that the pacing is so good, I never noticed that the film doesn't get into the dino action until almost the halfway mark.  The film was enjoyable before the dinosaur mayhem, and once the dinosaurs start chomping down on puny humans, the movie jumpstarts into a remarkable thrill ride.  There are two action sequences, in particular, that stand out.  The first is the T-rex assault on the motionless cable cars, which nicely builds up suspense, then pays off in spades.  The climactic cat-and-mouse game with the raptors is an even more impressive nail-biter, initially set in a kitchen, then turning into a full-blown chase through the ducts, all the way to a wide-spaced museum.  <br />Opinions for this movie have always been rather mixed, but with the majority aiming toward the positive.  JP's got great action, first-rate special effects, and charismatic leads; what's not to like?  Personally, I enjoyed it a bit more than Jaws, probably because Williams' score never goes inappropriately playful at any point in JP.  By certain definitions, Jurassic Park might not rate as a great movie, but it's great entertainment, and what more could you ask from a film?
B000002HH2|4.0|This is the only Bjork cd I have.  I like most of the cd especially &quot;Army of Me,&quot; &quot;Isobel,&quot; and &quot;Hyper-ballad.&quot;  But I usually don't listen to the songs on the end of the cd.
B00006RU5B|5.0|We've been waiting for this album for a long time.  The union of Chris Cornell and the remaining members of Rage Against the Machine have mixed the right ingredients to cook up a great sounding band.  This album goes some places that you would not expect musically, and makes for a great listening experience.  From heavy or political, to pensive, there is not a track that should be skipped over.  This is exactly how I hoped it would sound when I heard of the band. It will be in my cd player for awhile.
B00003CX9Q|4.0|When I recently viewed this movie for the first time since 1982, I realized that the wonder was lost for me. I think that is because the movie leans so heavily on the culture and technology of the '80s. However, kids will still love it because the story is realistically told from a young boy's point of view and because the theme is one of love and hope. If for no other reason, this DVD is worth having because of the phenomenon that it was when it was first released.
B000002A33|5.0|You know how when a really great song, the best on the album comes along, you just have to turn up the volume?  This whole CD is like that.  Track after track is just a masterful display of songwriting and sonic perfection.  The lyrics are almost totally incomprehensible, but the feeling and mood of each song is marvelously vibrant and eloquent.  The sound is understated all the way through, but always has a perfect PUNCH when needed.  Unbelievable yes, that's why I'm writing this.  These fellows don't have the place in my heart REM does (in fact I discovered them just because Barret Martin played drums for the drummerless Athenians a few years ago) but in terms of pure skill and songwriting, they probably equal (surpass??) anyone I've heard before.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|This is one of the best children's movies ever. I think that the story is exciting enough to keep kids of all ages interested. At the same time, it is not too scary and is ultimately uplifting. The music is captivating. The animation is seamless. Every kid should have this in their collection!
B00005JKWI|3.0|Do you remember the vampire movies pre 1990?  These vampires preferred to go solo.  Usually, someone was foolish enough to open a long-sealed crypt and let loose the undead, usually Bela Lugosi or Christopher Lee.  The released vampire would generally spread havoc until he was staked through the heart.  He did not have to worry about competition from other vampires. Doctor Van Helsing would keep him busy until the climax.  But times have changed and so has Hollywood's vision of the undead. No longer is the vampire the well-dressed stalker who strikes at night.  Now, Hollywood has given the MTV generation a cooler and hipper set of vampires.  Director Guillermo Del Toro in BLADE 2 continues his own tradition as presenting not one but hundreds of vampires dancing in discos and acting like the spike-headed punkheads that Hollywood seems sure represent the bulk of the paying audience.  Wesley Snipes is Blade, a half-human martial-arts vampire who is immune to the sun and to garlic.  In the first BLADE, he rips apart legions of vampires, who promptly dub him Daywalker, since he fears not the sun.  In BLADE 2, Snipes reprises his role that permits him to engage in non-stop action from the opening to the closing credits.  When he reaches a moment that in another film another lead might pause for reflection, Snipes wastes not one moment in idle thought.  He uses his considerable physical presence to dominate each scene with breathtaking special effects that the audience has since come to expect.  And therein lies the problem with this movie and others of its ilk.  Believability and cause and effect were deliberately excluded from the script.  The world of BLADE 2 seems peopled exclusively by vampires of various sorts.  The garden variety vampires look, act, and speak like the middle class wannabe punkheads that they truly are.  If the script did not inform us they were vampires, I might never have guessed.  The only surprising variation was the introduction of a new breed of uber-vampires, who look more like the classical vampires of the past. These uber-vampires feed exclusively on the 'normal' vampires and are immune to the garlic and silver weaponry that used to work in the American International pictures.  These new vampires generally lope after their undead victims as if they were more chimpanzees than vampires.  Snipes battles both types of vampire before he agrees to focus his efforts only on this new breed.  There is absolutely no logic to his actions.  Both breeds of vampires are set up as straw men, only to be knocked down, while all the while the audience is oohing and ahhing over each more spectacular battle.  Kris Kristofferson is wasted as Whistler, Snipes' buddy, as only one of two humans in the movie.  The other human is a sleazy lawyer who allies himself to the undead in a way that critiques the often heartless profession of attorneying.  The plot bounces from one pyrotechnic display of blood and martial arts to the next with nary a thoughtful moment in between.  By the movie's end, I had long since ceased to care which breed of vampire would reign supreme over a world that seemed to lack non-vampire residents. That both Blade movies have proved to be rousing financial successes has filled me with regret that the day of the solo vampire has passed away to be replaced by non-thinking types whom surely Bela Lugosi would not have called kin.
B000023VR6|5.0|Unlike many other artists who have made classic albums and then released numerous half decent albums until they finally made something solid, Dr. Dre did the best thing, he took his time and did things right. This album uses the same formula of great guest appearances and consistent west coast gangsta rap hits that made his solo debut a classic, but Dre gave it an updated style for 2000. The album features several guest appearances from Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Knocturnal, Xzibit, Nate Dogg, MC Ren and many more. A must own for any fan of quality rap music.
B00006AG5N|5.0|This record is brilliant for Elvis fans old and young, for the reason that it reminds us all just why he is called the King, and dispels any lingering rumours about him. For one thing, the great tracks show us that, contrary to the opinions of some, Elvis STOLE music from no-one. He was a pioneer, the creator of rock n roll. Despite the claims that he stole black music, pratically every black artist since has imitated, or been inspired by Elvis in some way (ever see Jacko dance on his toes, back in the days when he still looked human)? And secondly, him not having written all of his songs is irrelevant; he is not a songwriter, but a singer, and one of the best.<BR>This year's remix of 'A Little Less Conversation' by JXL brought Elvis to a whole new generation, and it is known that it wasn't just old fans who bought this collection. As his manager says on the sleeve, some of the songs are so associated with memories of Elvis that their actual quality as songs are forgotten - but a couple of listens to this fixes that; Elvis has never sounded better. <BR>Heartbreak Hotel sounds stirring and moving; Hound Dog and Hard Headed Woman are classic rock n roll; Love Me Tender and Don't show that Elvis didn't always need music to make a song. Other highlights include the beautiful gospel song Crying In the Chapel, the laid-back One Night, the rocking Burning Love, and its reprise Way Down, and the lovely Can't Help Falling In Love. There is also the epitome of 60's comeback Elvis, Suspicious Minds (Gareth Gates, eat your heart out.)<BR>Of course, this was made not just to commemorate the King, but to sell, and the novelty track Wooden Heart is there as proof. But apart from that, these songs really are excellent and put many of today's 'singers' to shame.<BR>And as the cd case itself proclaims, before anyone did anything, Elvis did everything.
0316666343|2.0|I was intrigued by the first half of the book.  The characters were likeable, but then it was like work to get through the rest.  It hit a low plateau and just continued the same.  I was so bored I never finished it.  It lingered too long on unecessary stuff- kind of like the movie \\"In The Bedroom\\" with Sissy Spacek and Marissa Tomei where there were long periods of nothing happening to propel the story forward. I thought it was a big snore after the first 3/4ths.
B00006RU5B|5.0|well, i'm a big RATM and soundgraden fan, so when i heard about this sweet union of the two, i was ecstatic, and lemme tell ya, does this band deliver or what. u've got driving tracks like the siongle &quot;cochise&quot; and others such as &quot;exploder&quot; and &quot;set it off,&quot; to some with a more experimental vibe (&quot;gasoline,&quot; &quot;the last remaining light&quot;), and even some slower, calmer tracks (&quot;i am the highway,&quot; &quot;getaway car&quot;). overall, the work on this album is outstanidng from a technical viewpoint; especially the guitar and vocals, hehe. overall, very strong debut, i ighly recommend this album to anyone with a decent taste in music.
B00005RYL9|5.0|I must say that when I saw this, I had to get it! I mean, it's got videos, at least one featuring Christopher Lambert, and they are really great. Plus you have the truely full length feature as well as all the other goodies. Two discs, but really worth it for any and all Highlander fans. A big pat on the back to all the Crew of Highlander, including Cast :)<br />BB-T
048623231X|5.0|It is incumbent upon the reader of this book to have read Dante's DIVINE COMEDY at least once.  If there is no familiarity with that masterpiece before-hand, little will be gained by browsing thru these wonderful pages.<br />For those who are intimate with Dante, this present book is a can't miss.  As an illustrated guide thru hell, purgatory and heaven, the plates will recall to the mind of the reader the sundry circles, punishments, torments and rewards depicted in the poem.<br />For all who love the COMEDY, this is your chance to allow Dore to help you visualize your journey thru the cosmic afterlife with the likes of our friends, Dante the Pilgrim and Virgil the poet.  As an added bonus, there are tercets depicting the scenes drawn by Dore on every page.<br />After getting this edition, I'm now interested in getting his illustrations of Milton's PARADISE LOST as well.  For those who browse thru these pages, I would HIGHLY recommend listening to Loreena McKennitt's song DANTE's PRAYER while you do so.  It is off of her album THE BOOK OF SECRETS (ASIN: B000002NHN), also available @ Amazon.com.
B00000JCOV|5.0|This, in my opinion, is the greatest album of all time. Every song is absolutely astounding. I have read reviews on ere saying things like: Not as good as other bands which actually work and have talent. How would they know how much the band worked? When recording the album joey played so much and so hard he got over 200 blisters and still continued. Which other band got over 100 stitces and broken ribs in there first tour simply to pease the crowd. Joey is one of, if not THE greatest drummer of all time, his lightning fast drum rolls make you want to bang your head til it explodes, he is also accompanied by chris and shawn on the 'drums' creating a 'power triangle', jim and mick on guitars are absolutely amazing as is pau on bass, sid and craig on decks and samples add an extra electric feel to songs, that really work, and corey on vocals, Absolutely amazing, ive head people say he cant sing, ad has no talent, and the lyrics are good, dont they realise he writes most lyrics, which are amazing, and he can sing (Listen to stone sour) very well, but this is rock for gods sake, and bloody good rock aswell about as heavy as an elephant with a bag of hammers hanging of each tusk. All of this and some perfect timing and u have slipknot. Anyway the songs:<br />742617000027: Great spooky intro of the words \\"The whole thing i think is sick\\" repeated at different pitches.<br />(SIC): The first 'proper' song starts with fast power chords and amazing speed drumming that makes you want to jump out of the window for fun (But remember, turn it up loud enough so u can hear when u hit the floor). One of the best on the album<br />Eyeless: Great mixture of percussion and sampling that lead into this powerful song. One of the best on the album<br />Wait and Bleed: Their first single, great song, great melody in the chorus, keeps up the great speed and power. One of te best songs on the album<br />Surfacing: Great song, great lyrics, excellent dj'ing from sid, great chorus you'll be screaming with your middle fingers in the air after a few listens. One of the best on the album<br />Spit It Out: The fastest song on the album, perfect timing (even live) great rapping/shouting by corey. Slug - slow - medium - fast - super fast - spit it out. One of the best on the album<br />Tattered and torn: People say in reviews 'Too slow, what happened to the speed?' But i think there wrong, is there a rule stating all rock should be fast? This is an excellent break for your neck, while you catch your breath for the next song...One of the best on the album<br />Me Inside: Back to the speed and power, with a bit of spanish in. One of the best on the album<br />Liberate: A fast mesh of speed and power, great chorus and guitar riffs, great lyrics. One of the best on the album<br />Prosthetics: Another slower song, The guitars take a break during the verse, when the guitars smash in, into the chorus, great song, emotional, slow, yet fast... One of the best on the album<br />No Life: Another fast one, with more raping. This song is a mixture between the speed and rapping of spit it out, and the melody and shouting/singing of wait and bleed. Fast, powerful, great. One of the best on the album<br />Diluted: Faster song, great lyrics, great chorus, lots of different points in this song. One of the best on the album<br />Only One: Another fast song, good pace through the whole song, good end bridge. More a Spit it out than a wait and bleed. One of the best on the album<br />Scissors: A great exit to the album. A big mesh of drama and emotion, this fast/slow song, has a powerful sound, and powerful lyrics. A great way to lead to the few minutes of blank space before the hidden track. One of the best on te album<br />Eeyore (Hidden track): The first few minutes of this track is taken from shawns video caera the night they finished recording. They all got some porn videos sent, and one contained one girl having a [bowel movement] in anothers mouth. Its very funny if you listen towhat there saying and picture what there watching, also you can hear chris vomiting. The hidden track is very fast, and was recorded with the whole and just walking into a room, pressing record and doing it, wile ross robinson (The producer) threw plant pots and other dangerous items at them. Great song, fast and heavy. One of the best on the album.<br />Overall this is one amazing album, al the songs are great and it WILL be up there with the other classic metal albums, if the above al the others. Buy it.
6305428050|5.0|It took me all of the opening 2 minutes of this film to remember why I had such an enormous crush on Elisabeth Shue while I was in high school.  Nowadays she is a serious actress with excellent honors and awards to her credit.  Back in her early Thespian days, however, she was just plain adorable.<br />As you might expect, the movie is about a routine babysitting job that goes awry.  Kris (Shue) reluctantly drives from the suburbs to the inner-city of Chicago with 3 kids she's supposed to be watching over.  On her way to pick up a flighty friend who wanted to run away, her mom's station-wagon gets a flat tire.  Let's just say that the rest of the evening is all downhill from there!<br />While the adventures are off-the wall, the plot does maintain a certain cohesion as all of the adventures are linked together nicely.  The film also serves as a funny satire of what happens to naive suburbanites when they end up on the &quot;wrong&quot; side of the inner-city.  Along the way, the kids even pass thru the university of Chicago which is, despite its reputation as an elite academic institution, most ASSUREDLY located on a rough side of Chicago.<br />This film is highly recommended for all persons who enjoy adolescent comedies.  If you look up &quot;fun movie&quot; in the dictionary, you just might find this movie listed as an example.
B00004RJ74|4.0|this movie is worth watching.for the entertainment value at least. i thought it was enjoyable and the special effects were great. if you want a movie that you don't have to think through and want to enjoy then this is one to watch
B0000787FH|5.0|Ah, the CD age...who'd ever thought that when I excitedly picked up this album in the summer of '82, that I would purchase it four, count 'em, four more times!  OK, the second time I puchased it WAS spur of the moment - there I was eating at the Hibachi, a great Japanese restaurant in Kansas City, killing time by treating my taste-buds before seeing Elvis at the Starlight Theater in the summer of '83.  All of the sudden in walks...Elvis Costello with his entourage!  Did I know that Elvis loved good Japanese food?  Well, of course, but who've thought it?  Anyway, after a moment of excited discussion on the strategy of approaching E.C. for his autograph with my then-wife Diane and her brother Jeff, it was decided that Jeff and I would run to the nearest music store to procure a couple of Elvis albums and Diane would keep him at the Hibachi, using any charms necessary.  Jeff bought a copy of his latest, Punch the Clock, while I purchased the Masterpiece?, Imperial Bedroom.  We arrived back the Hibachi, our food getting cold on the table, while E.C. was quickly consuming his.  We ate quickly, while deciding how we were to approach the man.  During this unending dicussion, Elvis and entourage got up to leave...and we paniced, allowing E.C. to walk on by without a word.  However, Bruce Thomas noticed the albums on the table, and stopped Elvis and motioned back to us.  Elvis grudgingly turned around and humored yet another starstruck fan.  We did have a short conversation, he signed the albums, and left.  Yep, still have my autographed Imperial bedroom, never played.    Half a decade later, Columbia issued I.B. on CD, and I, absolutely believing that ANYTHING on CD would sound better than its LP counterpart, purchased it immediately.  Then came the 90s and the \\"remastered reissue\\" madness.  Rykodisc acquired E.C.s Columbia catalog, and reissued this one in 1994.  Did I have to have it?  Absolutely!  AND it did sound considerably better than the Columbia release, AND it hadNINE \\"bonus\\" tracks.  Well, I finally could stop spending money on this album, right?    Wrong.  Barely 7 years pass and Rhino, the King of reissues, gets hold of Elvis' ENTIRE back catalog.  I resist buying E.C.s albums YET AGAIN until this one comes out.  This time there is an entire bonus disc that has 23 bonus tracks!  That's just insane!  So, I shell out to buy this album for the 5th time!    Is it worth it?  Well, the remastering differs only so slightly from the Ryko remaster, just a litte more of that crispness that Bill Inglot is so known for.  The Ryko remaster is a bit subtler, and for this album I think I prefer it.  But I'll state again, the differences are all but un-noticable, so if you're buying this hoping for some remarkable sonic upgrade, you'll be disappointed.    But the bonus stuff is a different story.  If you're an Elvis fan, these tracks are both entertaining and illuminating.  Different lyrics, different arrangements.  Really makes one appreciate the final product all the more.  Ex-Beatles' engineer Geoff Emerick gets it all right, with plenty of Beatle-esque orchestral touches at all the right places.  A masterpiece?    Well, yes.    And this has GOT to be the LAST reissue, right?
B00005RHGK|5.0|This movie was totally enjoyabl. It was funny from the start and that kept up through the film. It did give a few heart starter scares during the film, but there needeed to be a few more. The ending left a bit to be desired though ,but i am looking forward to the sequel.definitly a film worth watching
B00006RU5B|5.0|After many years of Creeds, Nickelbacks, Limp Bizkits and other countless...onthe radio, rock has finaly become good again, and it appears as though it was the vetrans that had to do it. November brought not only the new Audioslave album, but also new Pearl Jam and Nirvana.<BR>While all were great, theres no doubt that Audioslave rocks the hardest. No one in rock is hitting the drums harder than Brad Wilk, and no one is singing with as much aggression as Chris Cornell. While many believe Eddie Vedder has backed off in years with his voice, and though it may be due to his somewhat haitus, Cornell has never sounded stronger. Audioslave is a must have, in my opinion, it is better than Rage, and if not better, than deffintley as good as Soundgarden. In one record these guys are on the map big time, one can only hope they will last longer than their previous efforts.<br />P.S. Buy Pearl Jams Riot Act also.
B0000787FH|5.0|IThe Rhino reissue is wonderful.  First the sound is enlightening, I never heard Bruce Thomas's bended bass notes at the beginning to \\"The Long Honeymoon\\" , and as well in that  song, the mourning french horns sounding so sad and pathetic, while Elvis sings, \\"she never thought her love could be as strong as this\\"  (Her love being a strength and a curse at the same time.  Can you think of another song writer who makes their characters more 3 dimensional than most of what we watch on TV or in movies?). The wonderful arrangement of ..And In Every home bursts out of the speakers.  Excellent sound.  The second bonus disc includes all the tracks added on the Ryko release and a bonanza of great extras.  The original Beyond Belief (retitled the Land of give  and take), a more sensual Kid about it, sung in Elvis's lowest range (this is the one that is almost better than the original cut), a raging rock version of Man about time and a disco, yes disco version of Town Cryer. My favorite extra is the 2 extra versions of You little fool, both with different lyrics that change the dimension of the final song.   <BR>      I give this CD release 5 stars because of the quality of the original album and the great extras.
B000002N2N|5.0|A lot of Ramones fans aren't old enough to remember when punk was the red-headed stepchild of the music industry and the Ramones were pretty widely regarded as a joke -- one that got old about three songs into the second album.<br />But there were some who really heard what the Ramones (and others, let's be fair, though the Ramones' indelible stamp is on punk) were doing -- or trying to do.<br />Younger Ramones fans may not realise just how stultifying all too much of the music of the second half of the Seventies was; there's a reason that Mojo Nixon wrote a song titled \\"Don Henley Must Die\\".  Between prog-art rock and cookie-cutter corporate bands (and the looming horror of mousse metal), most of what you might find at your local record shop was pretty dire. (Notice, i avoided mentioning the ultimate musical horror of the period, D*sc*, so as to not offend those with delicate digestion.)<br />Oh, there was a little bit of fresh air getting in, even then -- \\"Rocky Horror Picture Show\\" was released in 1975, and there was the beginnings of what would eventually become alt.country, with peple like Commander Cody & His Lost Planrt Airmen, but the mainstream was BORING.<br />And then the Ramones came out of nowhere and hit those of us who were listening like a runaway subway train; they brought a refreshing breath of good old stale smog to what had become an all-too-clean music scene.  They reminded us how to SWEAT.<br />And then they went to England and created the Sex Pistols (not exactly that simply, but the influence was huge).  With regard to a similar disproportionately influential musical event,  John Cale said of the Velvet Underground's \\"Banana\\" album -- \\"Only five thousand people bought it, but they all started bands.\\"<br />I don't know how many people who saw the Ramones on that UK tour started bands, but the legacy that they left behind still reverberates to this day.<br />And, in much the same manner that the music of Buddy Holly, Eddie Cochrane and so on had to cross the Atlantic, suffer a sea change, and come back to us in the form of the English Invasion of the Sixties, the punk music of the Ramones was suddenly much more respectable -- or at least marketable -- when vermillion-haired singers with safety pins through their noses were barfing on their audiences than it had been when it was a bunch of long-haired geeks from Queens.<br />And Everything Changed.<br />Except, of course, as we can attest from this end of the telescope, it all pretty much Stayed The Same, and the big labels still dictate what kind of music the majority of people are even going to hear, much less like.  Abhominations like n'Synch and the Spice Girls are periodically visited upon us like scourges, all because not enough of us learnt the Ramones' basic lesson.<br />And that lesson, brilliantly attested to by this album, is that you don't HAVE to have a million dollars' woth of gear and a 64-track studio to produce brilliant rock'n'roll;  you have to WANT to make nusic that's actually worth listening to, and you need a modicum of talent... but most of all you need determination, and you need to not accept what the blanderisors tell you...  You need to be able to stand up and say (as Joey does, on another album) \\"We need change and we need it fast, before rock's just part of the past; 'cos lately it all sounds the same to me...\\"<br />And it helps if at least one of you can count to four REALLY fast.<br />Ironically, this, the album that documents one of the most important steps in the transition of a fringe American musical form to a world-wide phenomenon was, for years, unavailable in the US -- Sire, the Ramones' label, released it only overseas; if you were a USA Ramones fan, you had to shell out the bucks for an import (i did).<br />All i can figure is that they were leery of it because it was a different lineup than the later more (comparatively) successful band who broke through a lot wider in their home country on the basis of the hit single \\"Sheena is a Punk Rocker\\" and their appearance in Roger Corman's \\"Rock'n'Roll High School\\".<br />But, up until the CD era, if you wanted this album, you bought an import.<br />It's good to see it available domestically.gle \\"Sheena is a Punk Rocker\\" and their appearance in Roger Corman's \\"Rock'n'Roll High School\\".<br />But, up until the CD era, if you wanted this album, you bought an import.<br />It's good to see it available domestically.

The Alchemist is a perfect story for a young reader(or anybody)like myself. It will help you to understand the meaning of life and to learn how to follow your dreams.
B000005YZM|3.0|With so many people calling this the most underrated album of the 60s it is actually becoming the most overrated album of the 60s.<br />Worth purchasing?  Maybe. A decent sized collection of 60s album should contain a zombies song or two.<br />A masterpiece?  hardly;   It's mostly lightweight filler. (this will annoy the die-hard fans, but it's the truth, so deal with it.)<br />It does contain some nice tunes: \\"Hung up on a Dream\\", \\"Time of the Season\\" and \\"A Rose for Emily\\", but the rest are quite bad, especially \\"This will be our year\\".  And we don't rate an album on 3 songs out of 12, do we? <br />I find myself skipping _every_ song between tracks 6 (Hung up on a Dream) and 12 (Time of the Season).  Not a good sign :o)
B000002Q88|4.0|Ok while reviewing this CD there are a few points to consider, firstly it was recorded in the 80`s (not a friend for progressive bands) secondly without Kerry and Robby there no way they could produce a recording in the classic Kansas vain. This CD is very good, infact for what it set out to do its perfect. With classics like Rainmaker ,Ghosts, and Bells of saint james , they make the purchase price of this cd worth it alone, then you have great well writen songs like Inside of me (what a rocker) and one man one heart (a beautiful song) The truth is nearly everything on this cd is great and totaly underated by Kansas fans. Steves voice is at its prime (the way he sings ghosts makes me melt) Morse is very tastey on his guitar, phil Eharts drums yet again speak for themselves. Guys just remember its the 80`s we are talking about, comparing it to most of the stuff back then its great.
B00006IM9Q|5.0|If I could have only one cd this would be it. I have the original Best of Blondie cd and before that I had the album on vinyl. My sister gave it to me for Christmas back in 1981.  I actually wore out several copies of the album before it was available on cd.  Anyway, this new cd has much better sound quality than the original Best of Blondie. The opening drumbeat on Dreaming is a prime example.  On the original cd it sounds rather distant and anemic.  On this Greatest Hits cd it sounds like the drums are in the same room with you.  The selection of songs is diverse enough that there's bound to be something on the cd for everybody.  Some of the songs such as The Hardest Part and Rapture sound dated but most of songs would still be hits if they were released today. My favorite song is Heart of Glass.  My least favorite is Island of Lost Souls, it's too similar to The Tide is High.
0448060191|4.0|Little Women was our reading selection for October 2002.  We thought this timeless classic story of four sisters was wholesome and heartwarming.<br />This coming of age story that was inspired by the author's real life family teaches family values and morals.  Each of the girls have their own set of problems but through love and understand they learn the lessons of life.<br />All of us agree that the character were well written and the story is one that will stay in your heart long after you have read the same page.  A few of us have read the many times and we all highly recommend it.
B00005ARS9|5.0|To find a CD with 30 hits of the Beach Boys was very hard, until I  found &quot;The Very Best of The Beach Boys&quot;. The sound is excellent and al the songs that are included here, are excellent too.Starting with &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;, &quot;California girls&quot;, &quot;I get around&quot;, and ending with the great &quot;Kokomo&quot;, each and every one of the songs will move us to another time, in the sixties or even in the seventies.And here is included too one of the finest and more beautiful songs ever wroten... &quot;God only knows&quot;. I only miss two or three songs from the Beach Boys Album &quot;L. A&quot;., that I guess they had to be included here. But, even so, this is collector's CD, and I'm so glad that I have it.
0345404475|4.0|\\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\\" describes a day in the life of Rick Deckard, android bounty hunter. The story takes place on a future Earth. The planet is dying and many people have moved to off-world colonies. Most earth flora and fauna has died and therefore the remaining humans aspire to own as many real animals as possible. In a pinch, even an android animal will do (as long as no one finds out). The law forbids humanoid androids from living on Earth. On this particular day, Deckard is charged with \\"retiring\\" five highly advanced androids.<br />I found this book difficult to nail down. Perhaps it was because I've seen the movie \\"Blade Runner\\" many times and kept making comparisons between the book and movie. The plot, while interesting, really just provides a framework for Dick to explore Deckard's character as Deckard struggles with issues of his own humanity. This is made more obvious at the end of the book when Deckard and another character have strange quasi-mystical experiences. I re-read the last few chapters a couple times to see if I could figure out exactly what Dick was getting at. He lost me.<br />I still enjoyed the book. Deckard is an interesting character living in a compelling post-apocalyptic world.  If you're a big fan of the movie, you'll enjoy reading the story that inspired it.
0571113990|4.0|The book covers basic card control, the glide, the glimpse, the key card, the palm, the backslip, false shuffles and cuts, the double lift, the pass, reverses, the classic force, top and bottom changes and use of arrangements. It also contains 76 tricks, of which about 25% are excellent, 50% are unremarkable, and 25% are weak. You'll get more than enough usable material, including many classics of card magic.<br />This book itself is rightly regarded as a classic of magic. However much of the suggested patter is overly formal, reflecting the style of the late 1940's, when it was written. There are illustrations, but no photographs.<br />The book is aimed at complete beginners, but provides material that would be of use to anyone interested in card magic.
B00006YXEK|5.0|Over the last several years friends and colleagues would ask me about my opinion/taste with regard to the post-Beatle solo albums.  Sure, I like each former member of the Fabs: Ringo's records are at times finger-snapping commercial pop, or excellent country-western songs, or needless filler; Paul's records were consistently good up through the late 90s, with frequent glimpses of the genius composer/musician he is; John's records were either ear-splittingly angry or heartwarmingly beautiful; And George's records are the most consistently polished and tasteful body of work by any artist in rock history -- including the laryngitic vocals on \\"Dark Hoarse\\".<br /><br />True, Harrison's choices of the original Phil Spector and the new Phil Spector -- Jeff Lynne -- have proved mindblowing, but even if this were a collection of acoustic demos the playing, singing and writing would still be there. It's becoming well-known that George retired, over the past decade, to his gardens and ukelele collection and family life.  Buy this CD because it IS a continuation of the craftsmanship of Cloud Nine and the previous albums.<br /><br />\\"Devil & The Deep Blue Sea\\" is the excellent bow that Harrison has taken over many albums to the vast ouvre of pre-Sinatra American ditties, and would've been at least the B-side to a 45 (if we still had 'em).  Biting wit, corny charm, that trademark voice and guitar style...what more can one ask? How about a bonus DVD showing a clip of the abovementioned song, interviews with Beatle George lookalike winner and son Dhani, co-producer and co-Wilbury Jeff Lynne, longtime skin-beater Jim Keltner, and The Reclusive One himself.  This package is a blessing.  If further archive material comes out, IT MUST BE of this production and artistic caliber!
B00000IPAX|4.0|For those of you thinking about buying this album, let me confirm that its trash. Blink can do a lot with their few chords, but the fact remains that they have very few chords. They are undeniably awful lyricists. Its stupid almost from beginning to end. But I dont mean that to be a bad thing.<br />If youre thinking about this CD, I can only assume youve heard Whats My Age Again? and All the Small Things, and maybe Adams Song as well. If you liked these you will enjoy this album. Its 35 minutes of pure fun. Its pop-punk, but the punk element still shines through. Songs about crazy relationships with girls, frat parties... and thats about it. Sometimes its all fun as in the Party Song, sometimes songs like Going Away to College which are a little more serious but not all the way. We get Marks melodic voice and Toms whine. We get lyrics that often dont really fit but actually become even more lovable because of it. Whats not to love? Musically, they can do pretty well with 3 chords, managing to make the songs sound distinctive and fun to listen to. Adams Song gives us something a little different, showing that Blink is capable of being mature if they want to. (I have yet to figure out whether that song is about a fan who commit suicide or their old drummer who commit suicide.) The drummer they have now is the most talented member of the group, but the rest are sort of OK. Even if they cant play their instruments, they can write good songs. As long as you dont try to take this album seriously its very enjoyable.<br />Closing comments:The cover/pics represent Blink perfectly.
B000001EHS|2.0|The idea of a Def Leppard Greatest Hits package sounds like an easy Field Goal, but their attempt sails wide. No Good!<br />It's not in Chronological order, the sequence of going from Pyromania's &quot;Photograph&quot; to Hysteria's &quot;Love Bites&quot; is downright illogical. Whose idea was the song order? It fails to show the Leps change in musical style. Worst of all, it fails to properly represent their first 2 albums. Where, oh where is &quot;Let it go&quot;?  <BR>A good song included from High N' Dry &quot;Bringin on the heartbreak&quot; was severely butchered.<br />Def Leppard made three classic albums in a row, High n' Dry, Pyromania, and Hysteria that are essential and well worth the investment. Pick those up instead, I'd avoid this compilation, it's not a thorough overview.
B00004WG2X|3.0|I completely agree with the reviewer who stated that the reviews for this film were misleading.  The razor-sharp Austen wit was almost entirely absent in this version while I laughed the whole film through during the A&amp;E version.  There was no dramatic build up which you would think would make the ending less disappointing, but sadly it does not.  The last scene ends and you are left saying to yourself, &quot;That can't be it!&quot;  Immediately after the movie ended, I felt the incredible urge to put in my A&amp;E DVD and make all right with the world again.  So much for reviews, but I do hope someone pays some attention to this one.
B00000JG4N|5.0|This is Motley Crue's best and most focused album, with Shout and the '94 Corabi album coming in tied for second. After years of shoddy, drug-influenced work with Tom Werman, The boys hooked up with future Metallica producer Bob Rock. They're commitment to sobriety was a long time coming, and with Bob Timmons help, they finally built up the courage to live clean and say nope to dope. This album was recorded around the same time Aerosmith was working on their classic \\"Pump\\". In fact both bands studios were right next to each other! On Dr. Feelgood, the production is crisp and clear. The days of partying with chicks and kegs of booze in the studio were over, no more of Nikki being too strung out to play, the Crue finally gave it 110% effort the whole way through the recording process and it paid off. Big time. Their first (and only) album to top the charts. Every song but 1 released as a single. 6 Hit videos on MTV. A Sold-Out world tour played to all corners of the earth. The Metal Edge readers choice award for 1990. An American Music award for favorite Hard Rock album. I could go on & on.<br />I'll review this song by song (my ratings are in parenthesis)<br />1.T.nT \\"Terror 'n Tinseltown)-Nice intro, sets the tone. (5/5)<br />2.Dr. Feelgood-The infamous title track, features an excellent Tommy Lee back beat, clever lyrics. I Like Mick Mars demonic voice at the end. (5/5)<br />3.Slice of your Pie-Has a great blues influence, Steven Tyler co-arranged it. (4/5)<br />4.Rattlesnake shake-Rollicking mainframe, with a full horn and piano section. Vince Neil is in fine form vocally. (5/5)<br />5.Kickstart my heart-A top ten hit, Heavy riff, excellent slowed down bridge, and a kick-ass Tommy Lee drum solo to finish it off. The video was a blistering, in-your-face performance. (5/5)<br />6.Without You-Motley's second best ballad besides \\"Home sweet home\\". It's very deep and sentimental, heart-felt. (5/5)<br />7.Same ol' Situation-Nikki Sixx plays a nice bass line, tells an interesting story. I loved the video back in the day, Motley were at the top of the mountain, music-wise and commercially.<br />This song, along with Dr. Dre's \\"Next episode\\" played in my head while in line for my last paycheck of Summer 2000. (5/5)<br />8.Sticky Sweet-Top notch musicianship. Takes me back to September 1990 when I got my new bike. (5/5)<br />9.She Goes Down-Packed with sass, raunch and a chugging backbeat towards the end. (5/5)<br />10.Don't go away mad (Just go away)-Yet another megahit, it's a power rocker, with a catchy chorus. The coda is terrific. the video sort of foretells the internal conflict and tensions that arose in early 1992. (5/5)<br />11.Time for a change-A perfect closer. It's socially aware with relevant lyrics. And the chorus sounds like a choir singing. The only downside I can think of is in the title, The band is talking about change. Unfortunately the wrong kind happened, 2 years later in the Fall of '91. Music changed big time. Grunge exploded out of nowhere and bands like the Crue fell out of favor. It was the end of an era. The reign of the Hair Bands ended overnight. That said this track is still a 5/5.<br />If you don't own this album yet you're in luck. In 1999 the band acquired their back catalog and Master tapes from Elektra and started their own label called Motley records/Beyond. Their previous albums were re-issued under the Crucial Crue series, it's fitting that this was their best album, because it's also the best of the re-releases.<br />There's new liner notes pertaining to info on selected songs, and Demo versions of songs as well as unreleased tracks.  The title cut has different words and it's an interesting listen. You can hear what's missing and in turn corrected on the final songs.<br />The demos for \\"Without You\\" and \\"Kickstart my heart\\" don't pack quite the punch of their album counterparts, all things considered, they're still pretty decent as is.<br />The unreleased track \\"Get it for free\\" Is good, but itseems more fit for the Girls, Girls, Girls album. It would have seemed out of place on Feelgood. It makes sense to me why it was left off.<br />My review is a bit lengthy, but by now you get the point. Don't miss out on this Rock-N-Roll classic. As I said before, It's Motley Crue at their creative and commercial pinnacle.eems more fit for the Girls, Girls, Girls album. It would have seemed out of place on Feelgood.

B00006F7S4|5.0|First of all, I must warn you that I'm fairly biased concerning Beck. Excluding his indie releases, I just love the guy. Keeping that in mind, here's my opinion of &quot;Sea Change&quot;-it's nothing short of brilliant. While I also think his other major releases fall into that category, the difference with &quot;Sea Change&quot; is that we finally get to know how Mr. Hansen FEELS.<br />One of the stand-out tracks on this album-length ode to feeling low is &quot;Round The Bend&quot; in which I swear he sounds like he's channeling the late,great and under-appreciated Nick Drake, complete with shivery strings straight out of Drake's &quot;River Man&quot;. &quot;Lonesome Tears&quot; begins softly like the other tracks but towards the end builds into an incredible sonic orgasm reminiscent of the Beatles' &quot;A Day I The Life&quot;, with the string section getting progressively higher and higher until the whole thing explodes. I've always admired Beck as a lyricist- alternately dry, funny, punny- always amusing. Here he will break your heart with incredibly honest and sad couplets. The chorus to &quot;Guess I'm Doin' Fine&quot; is particularly fine to my ears.<br />As you've probably already gathered in reading previous reviews of this CD, it's a TOTALLY different animal than any of his earlier efforts, including &quot;Mutations&quot;, which it's been compared to by a lot of folks. But if you're in the mood for some beautifully crafted songs with wonderfully inventive string arrangements, this CD makes for essential listening.
B00006V9A0|5.0|There are perhaps a couple of songs that could've been put into this compilation, like Sappy and Aneurysm. The album, nevertheless is kickass. And I scorn all u people who think 'You Know You're Right' is not a good song. It's awesome...and the maj0rity of the true Nirvana fans would agree with me. Vindicated by its top notch performance on the Billboard Rock chart. An excellent album that is a must have for those with taste of quality Rock.

It's incredible the way Pearl Jam change the face of rock music with every new album. I think Binaural was very good...this latest offering is even better. Ok, it's no Ten but the songs on this piece like Save You, I Am Mine and Love Boat Captain still talk wonders about the talent of this band.

B00006CXXU|5.0|Whatever expectation I had of Stripped, the album continues to surprise me. This album indicates that Christina is willing to break new grounds, such as co-writing the songs, co-producing the album, and collaborating with experienced musicians. I have enjoyed all the tracks and continue to enjoy them even at work. Fighter, Get Mine Get Yours and Underappreciated are particularly good for dancing, especially those high impact aerobic-type moves. Beautiful, and the last 3 tracks make good companion for solitary, thoughtful moments. I am particularly taken by Soar, and have been listening to it whenever I felt that everything has gone wrong for the day. I hope that Christina will continue to excel and create soaring music in the future... As said in japanese: ganbattene!
B000002KB8|5.0|This album is a must have for every Black Sabbath/ozzy fan.<BR>Personally I only love listening to Sabbath with Ozzy,don't<BR>get me wrong Ronnie James dio is an awesome singer but I perfer<BR>Black Sabbath with Ozzy.Alot of classic songs on this one such<BR>as Black Sabbath,The wizard,N.I.B.,Behind the wall of sleep,Wicked world,Sleeping village,warning.This album is when<BR>in my opinion heavy metal really started.There were other rock<BR>n roll bands that had a heavy sound like,Led Zepplin,The who,<br />Rush,AC/DC,Jimi Hendrix and a few others back then.But the true<BR>nature of metal began with Black Sabbath because back then there<BR>was no such thing as heavy metal.If you love the blues and rock n roll you will love this one.Don't forget Black Sabbath was a <BR>blues/rock n roll cover band at first called Earth and then became Black Sabbath.That's why I love this album an awesome<BR>mix of the blues and rock n roll,buy it today!!
B00006M183|5.0|Of the major Seattle bands that agitated the charts a decade ago, the only one still alive is Pearl Jam. The quintet's seventh studio album, Riot Act, is a defiant answer to world events over the past couple years and to a stagnant music scene. Lead singer Eddie Vedder still writes the bulk of the lyrics - and the presidency of Bush II, Sept. 11 and its aftermath, and corporate malfeasance have provided plenty of fuel for his fires - but what's surprising here is the amount of input from drummer Matt Cameron and the lack of material from founding member and primary rhythm guitarist Stone Gossard.<br />Cameron, who joined Pearl Jam in 1998 after his own band, Seattle sound architects Soundgarden, ultimately crumbled, contributes music and lyrics, and even some chunky rhythm guitar of his own on \\"You Are\\" - a rare PJ love song. Gossard, the primary songwriter on the band's first few albums, contributes only one tune here, though it's a beauty - haunting album-closer \\"All Or None,\\" a desperate examination of personal sabotage.<br />The best songs, as usual, are Vedder tunes - melancholy acoustic \\"Thumbing My Way,\\" catchy but vitriolic diatribe against corporate greed \\"Green Disease,\\" and first single, \\"I Am Mine,\\" written last fall in the smoldering ruins of Sept. 11. Exploring themes of independence, grief and loss, Vedder has never expressed himself as eloquently as he does on Riot Act. His recent divorce clearly haunts him - he'd been married since 1995, but had been with the woman years before the head-spinning success of 1991's Ten - and his frustration with political events in the United States over the past year is also evident.<br />Though Vedder's heavy-handed pretentiousness hasn't entirely gone away - see spoken-word misfire \\"Bushleaguer\\" - Riot Act is still PJ's best album since 1994's Vitalogy. Lead guitarist Mike McCready, largely absent from the past few albums, is all over this one like an animal unleashed, especially on the searing anti-drug missive \\"Save You.\\"<br />Nirvana may be making a ghost appearance on the charts, and Chris Cornell is back on the scene, but Pearl Jam is the real Seattle deal - as vital as they were in 1992, and more urgent than ever.
B000000H6D|5.0|Type O Negative are one of the most sensual and dark bands to be found, and quite possibly my favorite. While I like October Rust the most among their brilliant albums, Bloody Kisses is essential as well, and a worthy start to your own personal Type O library. Pete's deep, erotic voice; Josh's eerie keyboards; Kenny's searing guitar; and Sal's thrashing drums are an intoxicating combination.  You need to experience this album.
0316666343|5.0|WOW! That was incredible! I am a 12 year old middle schooler and after I read this book I managed to get my friends to read it. They don't read anything... (to busy doing stuff with guys I suppose but of course who isn't?) Anyhow I just wanted to say that this book was very touching, and well written regardless of what those idiot adults have to say, and yes it was definately dirty at points (mainly the end... very cute having sex in her friends body hehe) but I plan on buying it for my mom for Christmas so it wasn't that bad not anything I hadn't heard before at least!
6301763041|1.0|Quite honestly, I would have rather watched my grass grow. It would have more entertaining. Though it would probably be a good cure for insomnia.
B000002UAR|3.0|I Really Like The Beatles and Revolver is an allright album but it is indeed not the masterpiece everybody is talking about. I Have surely listened to better albums. The good songs on this album are Taxman, Im Only Sleeping, Love You To, Yellow Submarine, She Said, She Said, And Your Bird Can Sing and Tomorrow Never Knows. the other songs are either okay, bad or boring. this LP does not work as a whole and containes filler. I Do however recomend this to everybody who are starting to become a beatle fan. Beatle Fans allready have this and for those who are looking for something with the Beatles for fun. check other titles not this one.
B00006L7XQ|4.0|I did not truly discover Johnny Cash until I picked up a copy of 'Unchained' at a used CD store.  Having enjoyed country music from the 70's and 80's, I was becoming somewhat dismayed at country's apparent disappearance and transformation into vapid pop songs.  After listening to Unchained and immediately running out to buy American Recordings, I was instilled with a belief that this is what country music should be today.  This album is another worthy entry to Cash's excellent American series. <br />American IV is simaler in composition to it's immediate predecessor, American III, but is somewhat darker overall.  Made up of mostly an eclectic selection of covers, Cash is more successful at some than others, but he seems to always bring something new to the material.  A version of NIN's &quot;Hurt&quot; is startling, with Cash's ragged voice infusing the song with an authority that wasn't in the original.  Also standing out is a haunting &quot;Danny Boy&quot; and a wonderful &quot;Streets of Laredo.&quot;  His renditions of &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; and &quot;Desperado&quot; are perhaps a little too straightforward, but are by no means failures.  Part of the fun of a Johnny Cash album is marveling at the range of material he tackles, and this one is no different.  From Sting to the Beatles to Simon and Garfunkel, Cash takes each song and makes it his own.<br />The Cash-penned title track is also excellent. An interpretation of the book of Revalations, it's a hard-edged delivery of poetic material, something I think only Cash could pull off.  Like, Cash's other Rick Rubin produced albums, you will discover something new in each repeat listen.
B000002U9E|5.0|Hounds Of Love definately is one of the most daring and ambitios albums to come out in the mid 80s. The music which is brilliant is one of the key elements to its sucess and it has recieved great reviews all over the world. Kates voice and lyrics just make it better and gives another spark in the gem. This LP contains 12 flawless tunes. She mixes electronic beats well with pianos. also she uses different instruments and vocal ranging on every song. this album is beautiful and i recomend every music fan out there to get a copy of it as soon as possible. This is definately one of the best female albums of all time and not just that but best albums in general of all time. buy it now. You wont be disapointed.
B00006EXDM|3.0|Disc 2 is everything I could hope for, Jumpin' Jack Flash and Honky Tonk Women have never sounded better to these ears.  But what happened to the earlier songs?  Satisfaction has all of this extra echo that didn't exist before.  Listen to the beginning of 19th Nervous Breakdown - the guitar that wangs in at 3 seconds is all but obliterated.  That's not remastering - that's fraud!   Ruby Tuesday sounds like the volume turned down everytime the chorus comes around.   Buy this set for Disc 2 and don't throw out your old vinyl or CD's.
B000068IEU|1.0|Regardless of the time it was made, I'm shocked Wes Craven made this film, and even more shocked he was allowed(by any company) to get a chance to make another filmangain. One positive thing that has nothing to do with the film is he (Wes Craven) did make more films and most of them were fantastic. The worst thing was the fact that there wasn't any plot, the music was a mix between country, wacky hillbilly moonshine banjo music, and blugrass. Scariest movie of all time? I think not. No matter what the retrospect was at this time or what was considered &quot;scary&quot; this does not fall under that category by any means what so ever. I wouldn't even watch this movie if i were paid to again (as i could barely stand to watch it to the end). I'll be suprised if i get more than 50 cents from anyone for it off of ebay unless they are like me and unsuspecting, just assuming because most people say it was so great and wes craven made it just decide to buy it. It also drags on for the first 20 minutes with nothing happening at all, REALLY making you think something good just HAS to happen,Which never does. PLEASE stay away from this film if you don't want your portrayal of Wes Craven or horror movies of the early 70's in general to be greatly diminished.
B0000787FH|4.0|For everyone who thinks his work with Bachrach, Sofie Von Otter, or The Brodsky Quartet (among others) is just bored experimentation, this album suggests otherwise.  10 years before The Juliet Letters and his score for the BBC series GBH, EC recorded this homage of sorts to mid-20th century pop lyrics and late 60's Beatles orchestrations.  For the most part this pays off, especially in the first half, as inspired playing by the Attractions combines with smart arrangements to place EC in a then-new and quite interesting context.  Some of his best mid-period songs come from this section:  &quot;Beyond Belief&quot;, &quot;Shabby Doll&quot;, &quot;Long Honeymoon&quot;, &quot;Man Out of Time&quot;, and &quot;Almost Blue&quot;.  &quot;...And In Every Home&quot; is a delightful musical tribute to George Martin.  The second half of the main album doesn't hold up quite as well and is perhaps a song or two too long.<br />Like the other discs in Rhino's EC re-release series, the emphasis on the bonus disc is on the early versions of the songs on the album.  Here nearly 2/3 of the album is represented in this form.  Where some of the other releases sound a little too Beatles Anthology-ish (i.e. not different enough to really matter) here we get an idea of what this album might have sounded like had it been made as a &quot;normal&quot; EC album.  Not essential, just for fans.  If you already have the Rykodisc re-release of some 7 years ago, the extra tracks here add nothing really revelatory.  <br />The rest of disc 2 is made up of a few other demos that didn't make the album cut, as well as some other songs cut around the same time for various purposes.  The best of these are the covers of 60's pop songs (tracks 13-16), especially &quot;From Head To Toe&quot;.
1573225517|5.0|Hornby has emerged as probably the most talented of the group of young 20-30 something British novelists. <br />Writing about universal truths mean universal humor. Hornby's ability to find the humor in all of our human frailties and the common struggles we all go through make the story of Rob's failing music store and love life a universal reflection of our own lives.
B00006BXI0|5.0|This CD is, as another reviewer wrote, an &quot;absolute shred fest.&quot;  Fantastic musicianship combined with excellent songwriting makes for a real headbanger with a distinctly gothic feel.  The song &quot;Pharaoh&quot; is worth the price of the CD alone.  If you like metal music in any way, shape, or form, especially progressive stuff, this is THE CD to have.
B00006LSM3|5.0|I consider this album the second best album of George Harrison's career!  That's how much I like this album!  Some of you may be thinking that I only gave it a 5 Star Highest rating because George Harrison died but even if Harrison hadn't died, this album would still have been worth the 15 year wait between studio albums!  There are no clunker tracks here!  Harrison's guitar work is superb, his lyrics focused and thought provoking and he is in good voice!  He knew what he wanted to say and says it well!  The string section of \\"Rising Sun\\" which Harrison actually sang onto the tape with instructions to his Son Dhani Harrison and friend Jeff Lynne to put a couple of strings here, reminds me of the strings on \\"I Am The Walrus\\"!  \\"Marwa Blues\\" is an instrumental that is some of Harrison's best guitar work!  I've always liked the 1974 instrumental \\"Hari's On Tour (Express)\\" and \\"Marwa Blues makes the perfect bookend to it!  Incidentally, George Harrison never stopped recording in his studio in that 15 year gap between studio albums, he just didn't release anything because he didn't want to!  Three or 4 years ago he asked Jeff Lynne to complete these songs with him, so they would have been completed even if he had lived!  As a result, this is not a sad album, but an uplifting one!  In my opinion \\"All Things Must Pass\\" will always be his best because he had such a vast amount of songs at the time and recorded them all for \\"All Things Must Pass\\" but \\"Brainwashed\\" is a very close second. Dhani Harrison has done his Father's music proud, and Jeff Lynne has also done his friend's music proud !
B00006YXEK|5.0|Recived this record yesterday and I love it, one of George best albums and of the solo Beatles. Im a Beatles fan from Sweden and Im looking forward to some more music from George, Jeff and Dhani has made a great job. Buy it, regards Kenth.
0131103628|5.0|This review is simply an addition to 162 other reviews that give this book cumulative five starts.  There is a reason for such a great rating!    In less than 300 (actual overview of C is less than 200) pages these authors packed a wealth of information.  Their writing style is fabulous, crisp and clear.  All of you computer authors who bombard us with 500-1000 page books ought to learn a lesson -sit down and think... think... think... and then produce a book that is full of useful information rather than watered down stuff so that you can charge more money for it.    Elegance of thought combined with examples that transition swiftly from easy to difficult makes it an invaluable classic, a must addition to your tech library, and a blueprint for communicating technical information in a written fashion.      Big thanks to the authors for job well done! :)    Dmitriy    P.S.  Also I would suggest to buy an answer book that complements this text.
B00004XONN|5.0|When I first bought this album I listened to it once and then filed it away for a couple months without listening to it again. One night for the heck of it I put it on with earphones while I was doing dishes or something and really got lost in the first song and then the next and so on... This is a FANTASTIC CD. It has so many layers which meld together perfectly. To be honest the only song I DON'T like is 'Optimistic'. Granted, I miss the sound Radiohead captured on their album \\"The Bends\\" and I DO hope that they release another album like that one soon but that does NOT mean that there is anything wrong with \\"Kid A\\". I mean come on, if all you heard from a band was the same thing every album, with absolutly no experimentation wouldn't they get a little old? Did all of the Beatles albums have that safe guitar sound or did they experiment and try new things?
0312954468|5.0|I discovered Wilbur Smith by accident and I'm glad I did.  His books are totally engrossing.  This book is the 1st in a series that will keep you reading long after you should have turned the lights out and gone to bed.  His character development is among the best I have read and his descriptions of events and places are vivid.  You'd think he was an eyewitness to the events as they unfolded instead of the creator and author.  This is probably one of the best books I have read in a long while.  When you finsih this, read Warlock.
0060934913|5.0|A tacky, sordid, behind-the-scenes look at the world of haute cuisine.  I loved it; couldn't put it down! Bourdain is an excellent writer in addition to his culinary talents, which makes this such and enjoyable read.  Anyone outside the restaurant business who thinks they have a hard job ought to read this book. Also, it's hard to complain about how [costly] restaurant meals are after discovering what a difficult and cutthroat business it is. Bourdain is refreshingly opinionated (vegetarians beware!) A caveat: anyone who's new in recovery from drug or alcohol abuse would be best advised to pass this one by; the detailed descriptions of both are pretty intense.
B000006NPY|5.0|If you're not already a Smashing Pumpkins fan, \\"Adore\\" may not be the best introduction to the band. Corgan's voice is not easily accessible, and if you're used to listening to feed from the radio, you probably won't appreciate this music to the level at which it needs to be appreciated. \\"Adore\\" is, simply, a beautiful album. It is not \\"Siamese Dream\\" and it is not \\"MCIS.\\" Most songs were never heard in the mainstream, and if one reviewer here mentioned that they needed to listen to the album five times before beginning to understand it, there's a reason for the limited popularity. The Smashing Pumpkins are not easy. They make true music. If you want an introduction to them, buy \\"Siamese Dream,\\" love it, and then learn to love the directions that the band took from there. Buy this album. You won't regret it.
B00006J3WH|5.0|Now that I have picked this up I have three different versions of &quot;Once More, with Feeling&quot; the &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; musical.  Each has its own virtues and one of the main pluses for this collection is that Joss Whedon actually makes some money off of it (another plus is the &quot;Hush&quot; suite music).  For years we heard about Joss working on a &quot;Buffy&quot; musical and when the time came he more than delivered.  My only complaint is that we do not hear the crickets chirpping when Anya suggests it might be bunnies (but that is on the other two versions, so it is no big deal).  Thanks for including the lyrics.  I had them 99% of the way down but Willow's &quot;I guess this line is mostly filler&quot; had me completely thrown.  I see the script is out for &quot;Once More, with Feeling,&quot; so where is the video tape, Joss?
B00005U8EM|5.0|One of my most watched and favourite comedies.  I was interested to see some of the other reviews here that compare it to a Karmic journey - that opened my eyes a little.<br />I must confess the fascination for me lies in wondering exactly how long it took him to learn everything he does in the course of that movie.  How many times would *you* have to repeat the same day to turn it into the best possible day?  How many lives would you try to save, how many people would you try to make happy?  How many piano lessons would you take?  Would it be an option in the &quot;real&quot; world or would you just go mad from boredom instead?<br />Oh I also like to watch it because it is very funny!
B00005QZWI|5.0|Once a composer of little note, Howard Shore has earned a comfortable place in my pantheon of favorite composers with this score. From the brassy, heroic &quot;Fellowship Theme&quot; that is present in many of the tracks to the pounding, rhythmic theme of Isengard, Shore's work simply shines. Enya's contributions are of note as well; the beautiful 'Anion' sends shivers up my spine even after many listenings, though I do prefer Fran Walsh's &quot;There and Back Again&quot; at the end of &quot;The Breaking of the Fellowship&quot; to Enya's &quot;May it Be&quot;. This album grows even stronger in my eyes when compared with the awful score of its 1978 predecessor. The bottom line: A wonderful score that every soundtrack-lover should own., and an Oscar well-deserved.
B00005NB8J|1.0|The low rating I am giving this disc does not reflect my opinion of the film, but rather my opinion of the discs poor quality.  The below average image quality is surprising, considering the fact that this is already the second DVD release of this movie.  Not only is the overall image quality not as good as it should be, but to top it off the entire film features a video burn on the right hand side of the picture.  Lower end monitors may cut this area off and therefore hide it, but a good screen will feature this irritating flaw.  One can only hope that a Superbit or Criterion version of this film will be released one day.  The disc presently available is certainly a disapointment.
6304907648|5.0|When I saw the movie Copycat, the guy Peter Foloy was the kind of guy you would trust. His truth was completely hidden by the way he acted. He seemed nice and then he killed people. William McNamara did a great acting job!
6304457383|5.0|I don't care for gory films or just plain teen-horror.  This film had me literally almost peeing on myself.  Especially the last fifteen minutes.  It was nail biting.  Audrey Hepurn was excellent as the woman who was not going to be a victim.  Her resolve to fight back and not let the bad guys kill her was just the best ending in cinematic history in the thriller/suspence genre.  \\"Wait Unitl Dark\\", is right up there  with \\"The Changeling\\", \\"The Exorcist\\", \\"The Shinging\\", and all the Hitchock films when it comes to be frighting.  I screamed at the ending and if you seen this film and know what I'm talking about then you know that part was scary.  My hands even got sweaty.  Even my friends jumped and said it was scary.  Being of the generation that grew up on teen-horror and gory style killing, we take for granted the old style of horror that truly is scary.  Films like, \\"Sorry, Wrong Number\\" with Barbra Stanwick are scary and absolutely suspenceful. The films ending was scary too and right up there with this film.  Watch this and you will not soon forget it.
6304907648|5.0|Can you imagine being one of the best of the best, then suffering a trauma so severe that it leaves you an Agoraphobic? Our hero has been there, she is terrified of her hallway, when once she strode them with purpose and conviction in her on-going fight for justice. Years later, younger people, fresh, innocent in many ways of the difference between law and justice, force her to face her fears, which are far from groundless! The situation builds as we find The Bad Guy is still out there, and still wants to take her down; to replay the scenario that left her terrified of the world. A horror, but a second chance ... does the strength of fear and memory over come the life-long commitment to justice? How would you replay the scenes in your life that altered you? Great movie, with a thought-provoking ending, one to share with other people who enjoy exercising their minds, stetching possibilites, and makes for a great evening. Excellent, whether you are a fan or not, it is the character you follow, not the actress ... which is a sure sign of an excellent actress!
B00006LLNU|5.0|Once you get past the gimmickry of its packaging, this latest outing by Sigur Ros is a gorgeous exponent of the kind of rock made famous by the Moody Blues and Pink Floyd.  The incredible thing is that, without even being intelligible lyrically, it manages to make the experience an intellectual one.  It's as if Edvard Munch's screaming man on the bridge found himself surrounded by ice floes and singing in Neil Young's tortured voice.  The music shimmers and twists, building in majesty until its grand finale in track 8.  The journey is its own reward.  My favorite Sigur Ros cut will always be &quot;vel til loftarasa&quot; from Agaetis Bryjun, especially when played over the evocative video (viewable on their web site), but there are plenty such moments, my favorites being tracks 1 and 6, on the new album as well.  If this is your first trip to the mysterious country of Sigur Ros, their latest CD, whatever it may be called, is a good place to start.
6304907648|5.0|Amidst all the suspense, shocks, and chills of this superbly made thriller stands the awesome performances of Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter. Ever since she pioneered the \\"female butticker\\" in the Alien movies, Sigourney has stretched her range to show the immense amount of talent she possesses. Her role as agoraphobic Helen Hudson is one of her finest; she lets us feel every nuance of her frustration, her terror, her anger, her intense ability to be strong even when she admits she's weak. Matching her performance is the understated portrayal of cop M.J. Monahan by Oscar-winner Holly Hunter. Hunter's bravura etching of this likeable cop is extremely effective in counterbalancing the tormented Weaver. Altough the fate of Dermot Mulroney as Monahan's partner is questionably appropriate, it does serve as a motivating factor in Hunter's pursuit of the serial killer. William McNamara's performance as Peter Foley may seem underplayed, but it serves to hightem the normal-ness of this obviously demented young man. Like life, the good guys don't always come out unscathed. The film is dark, brooding and its ending is chilling in that Harry Connick Jr. imprisoned psycho is obviously going to continue his quest for revenge on Weaver. A sequel would have been nice; I would have also liked to have had at least one scene with Weaver and Hunter after theexplosive ending. But, as far as thrillers go, this is a great addition to a small set of classics.
038533348X|5.0|Cat's Cradle is a wonderful little novel. The narrative is quick-paced, never stopping to allow you to catch your breath from alternately laughing and crying at the folly of humanity. <br />Of course, it's as all of the reviewer's here note; the novel is short, though takes a wide scope. It contemplates such difficult subjects as the nature of science and science's refusal to consider religion or the moral implications of its work. The novel is also extremely interesting for its commentary on religion, particularly considering that Vonnegut was an atheist. Each minute chapter is thought-provoking in its way, and underneath its primary themes, there is an exorbitant range of objects to satirize. And yes, the much of the stupidity is captured in the pages of this little read.<br />Cat's Cradle is one of the greatest novels of this century. Everything which Vonnegut comments on is just too much to go into here; this review would end up being longer than Cat's Cradle itself. It certainly makes a great read, and the things Vonnegut writes will keep you thinking whether you agree with him or not (I particularly recommend this for college science majors).
6304907648|5.0|Copycat is a great movie. A suspensful plot with many twists and a great cast. Sigourney Weaver is fantasic and Holly Hunter is amazing, too. The ending kept me on the edge of my seat. This movie is not as good as The Silence Of The Lambs, Red Dragon or Se7en, but is is very close.
B000063V8T|4.0|As I review this season I have watched Seasons 1-5 (but not 6 or 7).  In my subjective opinionl this one ranks second, surpassed only by Season 3.<br />Having said that, this season contains the single best Star Trek episode I've ever seen: The Inner Light, which won television's Peabody Award.  And rightly so--even the most hard-boiled viewer will find this episode to be moving and unforgettable.  I cannot imagine anyone failing to appreciate the impact of this superb episode.<br />This collection has lots of other strong episodes as well.  This is the season that introduces the lovely &quot;Ro Laren&quot; character.  She's hot, and a definite plus.<br />A great season for a great series.  The DVD is very nicely done, very high quality audio and video.
6304907648|5.0|Anyone interest in psychology or criminal profiling will definitely enjoy this movie.
6300216209|3.0|I was greeted with surprise by a friend when I recently said that I'd never even heard of Love Story, so she insisted I had to see it.  For likewise uninitiated it concerns a couple who meet at Harvard from different ends of the social spectrum - she's poor, he's rich - and forge a relationship against all odds.  When the girl contracts cancer though they find their love put to the ultimate test.<br />If the synopsis I gave above sounds clichéd that's probably because the story is clichéd, although that doesn't mean to say that the movie is.  In fact, against all odds it actually presents a very moving relationship that will, if nothing else, draw you in.  The acting by the two leads is very good indeed, especially for the genre because they make an often-trodden story seem realistic.  More than anything else it's the presentation of the relationship that makes this a romantic tragedy that's a cut above the rest.  This isn't presented in hyperbole but as something real.  They argue, they tease and they have fun like any other couple.  This is important because it's one of those rare occassions where the 'love to end all loves' is actually presented realistically.  Neither of the leads are stunningly good-looking, and they argue about issues that you imagine yourself arguing about.  More importantly, the moral issue of whether the husband should tell his wife that she has cancer (in a particularly interesting social note today - the husband was told first) is presented very well indeed.  This serves to make the ending quite moving and if the famous line 'Being in love means never having to say you're sorry' (which I hadn't ever attributed to Love Story before watching it) sounds cheesy then for the most part the movie isn't.  In many ways it reminded me of the Marisa Tomei/Christian Slater vehicle Wild At Heart, which should be sought out by anyone who enjoyed this.
6304907648|5.0|Definitely a movie to see! A blend of police drama and suspense that truly works well in this feature. In it's favour it's fast paced and is never boring. It allows the storyline to move at just the right speed, that it keeps the viewer's attention from start to finish. It will keep you on the edge of your seat as to what is going to happen next. A clever paranoid thriller. The story is captivating and intersting. If you've never seen the film(and your old enough to watch it of course)then I would recommend that you get it right now and experience one of the best thrillers that the 90's had to offer.

B00005OAIE|4.0|I am listening to the cd as I write this. I am on the 9th Song. So far, I enjoy it. It has this feel good feeling to it. The lite music w/ the nice smooth guitar playing is refreshing. Yeah, LOL, he does sound similiar to Dave Matthews, but their is a distinct difference in the voices. And I happen to like DMB also! But, 1st he must get props for writing the songs, singing well, and really playing the guitar. He has creativity ~ you will never hear anyone say the things he has said on this cd. It is very original...he's like a poet. And I enjoy his soft smooth voice, it's one of those voice that make u feel good or puts you to sleep (in a good clam way!)... a voice of solace. So the editorial above really does no justice. The writer of it needs to pop the cd back into the player and listen to it again instead of bashing Mayer. I think he will make it in the music business! Believe me, buy the cd! You'll enjoy it!
6304907648|5.0|This is more like Manhubter/Red Dragon, but no way is a rip off. The creepy killer in the beginning, Daryl Lee Cullum is based off a serial killer named John Paul Knowles, who used the name Daryl sometimes. A lot of this is based off real serial killers. It is an excellent film, Sigourney Weaver beats Edward Norton(RD) and Jodie Foster (SOTL) in every way.
B00006CXXU|5.0|All I have to say is...Don't sleep on this chick. She is totally underrated and her record label does not promote her properly. She should not even be compared to Britney Spears...it's an insult. She has a style all her own and I wish she recieved the credit she is overdue for.
6304907648|5.0|As is offen the case, the director's scene by scene commentary that comes with the DVD is almost as good as this exciting film itself. Sigourney Weaver is a great actress and had to go through a lot to make some of the scenes, the bathroom sequence for example.<br />As far as serial killer film go, I am still must impressed by Kalifornia as a film, and the strange 8mm. Personally, I think this genre is overworked.
0321146530|4.0|On multiple projects I've spent a lot of time encouraging, cajoling and sometimes forcing developers on the team to write unit tests for their code. Test Driven Development is an important skill that a lot of developers need to master. It is great to see a book devoted to the topic that provides some good examples on how to do it. In addition to the examples, the test patterns are also very useful. Most of the examples in the book use Java, with the rest in Python. Personally, I would have preferred that the book used Java exclusively. This is a minor complaint however. Overall this is a good book.
6304907648|5.0|A great thriller about a killer who tries to outperform famous serial killers.
0754053385|5.0|It is almost 200 years since \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" was first published. It ought to be the equivalent in literature of those faded, dried flowers that used to be found pressed between the pages of the old family bible. Instead it is redolent of freshly cut flowers still carrying a sprinkling of morning dew.<br />The freshness and the perfection of form are certainly astonishing. Jane Austin is as good as story teller as ever picked up a pen, knowing exactly how to construct plots, and what incidents and dialogues to detail in full and what to briefly summarize. Her \\"world\\" is small but intricately constructed. Every characteristic, quality and idea has a precise and fixed value, all being ranked strictly and sternly according to decorum, logic and morality.<br />Despite its architectural perfection, however, a recent re-reading reveals one or two construction features that are questionable. How could it be, for example that Fitzwilliam Darcy could have such a dragon for an aunt? I also wonder about the friendship between Darcy and Bingley. How did it begin? It is obviously important to each, but we are given nothing of its history.<br />Jane Austen lived long enough to see this book published and enjoyed amongst her own family and a small readership. Her mother entertained family members with it, reading it, in Jane Austen's estimation, a little too quickly. Distinguished British actress Lindsay Duncan reads it with perfect timing and inflexion in this highly recommended audio tape format, which presents the novel in an unabridged version of just over twelve hours.
6304907648|5.0|Can you imagine being one of the best of the best, then suffering a trauma so severe that it leaves you an Agoraphobic? Our hero has been there, she is terrified of her hallway, when once she strode them with purpose and conviction in her on-going fight for justice. Years later, younger people, fresh, innocent in many ways of the difference between law and justice, force her to face her fears, which are far from groundless! The situation builds as we find The Bad Guy is still out there, and still wants to take her down; to replay the scenario that left her terrified of the world. A horror, but a second chance ... does the strength of fear and memory over come the life-long commitment to justice? How would you replay the scenes in your life that altered you? Great movie, with a thought-provoking ending, one to share with other people who enjoy exercising their minds, stetching possibilites, and makes for a great evening. Excellent, whether you are a fan or not, it is the character you follow, not the actress ... which is a sure sign of an excellent actress!
B0000640VO|5.0|Of all of the movies i've seen, this would have to be the the best one ever. I love this movie; the actors are wonderful, it is beautifully directed, and the story is outstanding. If i could only own one movie, this one would be it.
6304907648|5.0|I've debated over writing a review of this movie simply because words cannot express how fascinating and brilliant it is. The plot is seemingly simple: Sigourney Weaver portrays Dr. Helen Hudson, a retired but brilliant criminal pschiatrist, who is a step ahead of the police in solving a recent rash of murders by a serial killer. Two detectives, played by Dermont Mulroney and the deceptively simple Holly Hunter, lure Hudson back into the fold to aid the police in stopping this killer. If only it was that simple. That it's not is what makes this movie great. Hudson's brilliance is eclipsed by her pill-popping nature and her alcoholism. She's also agoraphobic, in that she hasn't left her house in 13 months, when she was attacked by the last serial killer she was responsible for incarcerating. Now aided by Hudson, the cops search for a killer who is copycatting murders made famous decades earlier by Son of Sam, the Hillside Stranglers, and the Boston Strangler. William McNamara is chilling as the psychopath in that he embodies the basic profile of all serial killers. He's young, handsome, charming, affable and evil to the core. Just when you think it's all resolved, the final scene is the most shocking of all.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This CD was brought home by my wife; At the time I was listening to Diana Krall's &quot;Love Scenes&quot; which is an excellent album. Yet as soon as I put NJ's CD on, I felt that she was on a league of her own. Diana Krall, although beatiful sounds dull compared to Norah Jones... not that I will stop listening to Diana Krall, I think she is great; it is rather that I am happy to have discovered such a fantastic and talentful performer as Norah. I am eager to see what comes next!!
6304907648|5.0|This movie is wonderful! This movie has great acting, great mystery, and above all, a great plot! The idea of a serial killer whose pattern is not his own, but that of a mix of several different serial killers is just such a mind-thriller for the viewers. I believe the way he incoporated Helen's lecture into his killings and included her in his plan was really awesome! Up until the time he hunts her down, he followed the pattern of others. Since Helen didn't die in her attack by Darell Lee, it was then the point in which Peter had to create his own method for killing her rather then that of another serial killer, an amazing aspect into his madness, IF he would have succeeded. This movie is one that will make your heart leap into your throat! A must see for any thrill-seeker!
B00005JKZ3|5.0|Reading a few negative reviews prompted me to counter with this positive review.  I honestly thought the movie was great!  Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are an unlikely duo to place side by side each other in a blockbuster movie, but together they bring out the best traits of one another.  Tommy Lee Jones is histerical as &quot;K&quot; who has no memory of being in this Men in Black organization and Will Smith has the job of trying to convince K that he was, who thinks he was a mailman most his working life!  I really thought the jokes were funnier this time around and I'm defintely putting this on my wish list.
6304907648|5.0|This was one of the scariest movies I have ever seen. Sigourney Weaver was amazing as the \\"drug addicted\\" psychologist, and the chemistry between the two detectives was very entertaining. The movie stealers, however, were the two serial killers--particularly Connick. This movie makes you realize how important it is always to be cautious with people you don't know and not to trust people alone at night, even if they do seem like \\"the nice guy next door\\"<br />I would like to see a sequel to this movie with Holly Hunter & Sigourney Weaver and another interesting Serial Killer.
B00006DEFA|5.0|Certainly a fantasia on the life of one of the world's greatest composers, &quot;Amadeus&quot; is more much more than merely dreamed biography. It soars above the retelling of a wonderous life, presenting to us a mosiac of deep meaning, wonderful performances, sensational music, and one of the best movies ever made.<br />Tom Hulce and F. Murray Abrams take control of this movie the first time they appear in it, and refuse to let it go. Whereas the power in their lives rests in the monarchy, they are the true power of this film as they dance and weave around each other. Salieri, a now forgotten composer, apparently once revered in his time, secretly adores and publicly abhors Mozart, gifted prodigy.  By giving us some creative if not accurate context for Mozart's music, we see the true brilliance of his greatness, by comparing and listening to his music through Salieri's simple ears.  The finest moment of the film perhaps comes at the ending, with Salieri, an old and feeble man, realizing that his life has added up to nothing but mediocrity and meagerness. As he's wheeled through the halls of the sanitorium, he blesses the crazy and insane, reveling in the pain of the irony his life has become. Incredible.<br />As mentioned, Hulce and Abrams both soar in their roles; each embody the true spirits of their characters, there is not a moment's doubt or hesitation in their performances.  Their acting is so perfect, so refined, it is not acting, it is being. On the screen, the real Salieri and Mozart are before you. No finer gift can an actor give to his craft.<br />And no finer film can a group of professionals give the world. Amadeus is all about brilliance at the same time being all about mediocrity. This duality drives the tension and the drama, making the film so wonderfully complex and deep. I never tire of watching this, each time finding a new glimmer previously not realized.<br />It is well worth your time, if you have not yet done it, to settle down and allow &quot;Amadeus&quot; to soak over you, and prepare to marvel.uot;Amadeus&quot; to soak over you, and prepare to marvel.
6304907648|5.0|This is a great movie. It is accurate in the details of some of the most famous serial killer in history. Harry Connick Jr. portrays the \\"scariest\\" person I have ever seen. I am a self proclaimed horror movie addict, and this one, by far, with the exception of Brian DePalmas Dressed To Kill, is one of the best. One recommendation, don't watch it alone!!
0140042520|4.0|I had been told for months on end by a Lit professor that I should pick up \\"On the Road\\". From what I had heard, however, it was not something that I needed to tackle without having first read something else (and less dense) by Kerouac. So, on a whim, I bought \\"The Dharma Bums\\" at a local bookstore just before I went home for one weekend. <BR>  As luck would have it, my car broke down at an out-of-the-way gas station, so I had some time to kill while I was waiting on a ride. I began to read...and read...and read. What I found was pure Beat genius, a zest for life, and an inward desire in myself to say \\"Screw it,\\" and hike the Smokies. Kerouac, with his brilliantly crafted observations, dialogue, and imagery, brings us into a universe of windy freedom and presents the world as an answer to the problems that it itself causes.<BR>  If there are any problems with this novel, I'm certain that some people will get bored with some of the beautifully written, yet tedious, description and imagery. In spite of that, I recommend this book to anyone who needs a break from there mundane nine-to-fives. Read it.<BR>  Maybe I'll get on with \\"On the Road,\\" now.
0345409671|2.0|I am an extreme Anne Rice fan, But this book has to be the worst in the Vampire Chronicles. I found it very hard to read but forced myself to finish it after an attempt to skip the ending made it difficult to follow the later books in the series. I felt that it was extremely long winded and the point was often lost.Before this book the thought of over describing a situation had never crossed my mind, Rice definately managed to do so. Had it not been a necessary step in the evolution of the chronicles I would have never gotten past the first chapter.
B00003CX5P|5.0|This movie is exciting.  I watch it usually with my young son and its about every little boy dream; a young boy hero, flying, racing, and saving the universe.  I think that Darth Maul is very scary in spite of my son's reassurance but we both agree O b One is great. I cant wait to see Attack of the Clones.
B00003CXFV|5.0|Erin Brockovich (R)- You can ask anyone around me and they will tell you that I am not a Julia Roberts fan.  I don't vehemently hate her but she has to work hard for me to enjoy her.  Well in this movie she works hard and pulls out the best performance of her career.  This film is a milestone for many reasons.  Hiring Indy favourite Stephen Soderburgh to film what easily could have been a Lifetime (television for woman) weepie gave this script the spark it needed to make a huge and likable hit.  The look is independent, the script is Hollywood and the result is a feminist fairy tale that flies high enough to lift the spirits and low enough for guys to laugh too.  Hiring the perennially British Albert Finney as a down home American Lawyer seemed like disaster but ended up as perfection.  When people say they don't make movies like they used to, they probably haven't seen this one.
0671027344|5.0|read it and you will understand why to live life. Do as charlies does, read what charlie reads and listen to what he listens.  This is one of most magnificent pieces of art I have ever viewed.  The innocence and adulthood behaviors mix to form this genius idiotic character and it makes it a beautiful mess.
B00003CXE7|2.0|*Gladiator (R)- Ridley Scott is a favourite director of mine and I waited anxiously for this.  While I was never bored during the films lengthy running time (even when so much of the time is spent fawning over unimpressive CGI shots of the Coliseum), I was absolutely enraged that the film is basically a remake of The Fall of the Roman Empire and the screenwriter's of that far superior film are not even acknowledged.  If you want a roman epic, rent Ben Hur, Spartacus, The Robe, Fall of the... or countless others. Joaquin Phoenix was brilliant.
B00006RU5B|5.0|As a 40 hour a week Target electronics employee, I hear nearly every \\"modern\\" rock band song out, by those famous or not courtesy of the good old \\"Target Video Network\\".  Lately, I have been noticing a disturbing trend.  The more rock catches on, the more \\"modern\\" rock bands we see appear who sound exactly the same as other bands that already are popular.  This will not last, soon people will get tired of the modern rock scene and the videos will go back to rap again.  <br />The point of that was that in this era of bland, generic sounding rock, it is great to see a band, born straight out of the grunge era that writes unique songs, with good lyrics, unique guitar riffs, and crazy ...solos.  Anyone who knows anything about Tom Morrello knows how friggin weird his guitar solos are - this album is no exception, he rips out a bunch of weird wah - whammy freaky stuff solos.<br />Now being a huge soundgarden fan, I have to say that Cornell hasn't sounded this good in a long time.  He is an amazing song writer who is gifted with one of the must amazing voices of our time.  The first half of this album is reminiscent of his work on Badmotorfinger, while the second half leans more towards superunknown.  His song writing is just awesome, it ranges from contemplative, \\"If your're free, you'll never see the walls.  Ifyour head is clear, you'll never free fall.  If you're right, you'l never fear the wrong.  If you're head is high, you'll never fear at all.\\" (exploder) to explosive, \\"Going into shock, the last thing he said was, 'Set this f***er off!'\\"  <br />I won't go into detail on the songs on this record, because EVERY ONE is amazing and unique.  None of them sound the same and they are all great.  \\"Set it Off\\" and \\"Shadow on the Sun\\" are my two personal favorites.  I don't really know why because when I listen to the cd, there is no songs I skip, I listen to it all the way through and love it all.  I just think that the choruses to these two songs are really exceptionallygreat.  \\"Set it Off\\" is going to be like there huge mosh-pit arena song that gets everyone going, listen to it and you'll know what I mean.<br />Perhaps what we need to refresh our rock music scene right now is voices from the past.  With this release, the Nirvana release, the Pearl Jam release, Jerry Cantrell's excellent solo albums released in the past couple of years, and the god of everything metal, Metallica's upcoming release the rock scene looks better and better.  <br />Buy this album, every song is good, the riffs are funky, unique grooves, the solos are weird as hell, and Cornell sings like the truly amazing performer that he is
B00003CX9W|5.0|*Fantasia (G)- Fantasia is quite simply one of the greatest films ever made.  In fact, it is a milestone in Art and Pop culture.  I believe it stands just as high as Citizen Kane in important American films.  How a US film, albeit a \\"cartoon\\", was able to get away with nudity and cultist revelry at the height of Hays' Code hysteria stands as an achievement that few even comprehend.  Few people love all 2 hours of Fantasia, but there are also few who don't like a single piece.  And that is a testament to art in and of itself.  Fantasia is a walk through an art gallery and a symphony hall.  Some of it may draw you to tears, some of it may baffle you and some may enrage you but at least it made you feel and think something.

B00006J3WH|5.0|Everyone knows that this is a must have for all fans. It is an amazing cd with the original cast recordings feat. all the songs from the musical episode &quot;Once More With Feeling&quot;. The cast aren't the BEST singers, but that's what makes it more real. However, their voices DO grow on you. Amber Benson, Anthony Stewart Head, and James Marsters do have amazing voice however, and their songs soar above most of the others. They are classics. I also love Sarah Michelle Gellar's singing, it really grew on me, her voice is very unique, and it's fun to listen to her. The whole cast did an outstanding job, and you have to give props to Joss Whedon, he created something that is a classic, and it will live on as a great musical. I highly reccomend this CD to ALL Buffy fans, even if you haven't seen the episode.
B00004RJ74|5.0|After the superb masterpiece Pulp Fiction came From Dusk Till Dawn which continued his consistently origanal flair for diversity. This wild, action-thriller sees two brothers going on a desperate crime spree. Quentin Tarantino puts in an effective performance as a completley deranged convict who aloingside the dynamic on-screen presence of George Clooney, kidnaps a preacher (played convincingly by Harvey Kietel) and his two children (which includes Juliette Lewis of Natural Born Killers). They flee for safety to a remote and eerie looking nightclub in Mexico. Whilst the film seems to be settling down as a compelling hostage drama it rapidly steers direction and is thrown into a darkly humorous horror movie as the nightclub is crawling with blood-thirsty vampires. The outrageous plot twists makes it all the more compelling and riveting and the scripts roll along like a rollercoaster. The special effects are vastly impressive and the energetic film making and engaging performances makes this truly another masterpiece to Tarantinos credit. Directed by Robert Rodriguez, his in-your-face shocker is an absolute must see. From Dusk Till Dawn makes a comfortable transistion to DVD and there are some extra features to be found beyond the movie making this collectors edition essential.
0800177177|3.0|The title of this story is most misleading.  Except for the names of the characters, nothing is the same as Bram Stoker's novel.  Lucy is not a slut, and Mina and Dracula are anything but star-crossed lovers.  While Stoker did base Dracula on an actual historical figure, Drakula, no connection is drawn in the novel; he and Mina never knew each other, and there was no reincarnation in the story.  There was also no reason given for him becoming a vampire, and he wasn't so much present in the story; he remained hidden from his pursuers.  The Dracula of the novel was incapable of love, and only felt the need to survive by taking victims and drinking blood.  The movie plot is perfectly fine, but the name of Bram Stoker should not have been added to the movie title.  The direction is okay, though overly-dramatic.  The sets are fine, and the acting is good, but again the characters are nothing like those of the original story.  Dracula was not suave and sexy, but he also was not a disgusting old man who could reach across continents and oceans to control the will and actions of others.  Van Helsing also was not an outrageous laugher, nor was Renfield so over-the-top; in the story, both men behaved as educated gentlemen, except on a couple of occassions.  The script, direction, and acting were overall good; but when a movie is finally made that stays true to Bram Stoker's novel, it will surpass every Dracula movie ever made, if only because Bram Stoker created the perfect horror story that continues to frighten people throughout the generations since its publishing.
0783225792|5.0|A compelling tale of power, money and depravity sets the tone for this riveting crime drama. Casino has always been compared to Goodfellas and indeed one of the few variations is that this film is set in the heart of Las Vegas but the film holds enough merits to make it distinctley unique within itself and deserves to be judged on such. Robert De Niro heads the excellent cast, playing Sam \\"Ace\\" Rothstein, a master bookie turned big-shot casino manager who's astute head for business quickly deserts him when he marries ex-hooker Ginger McKenna (played convincingly by Sharon Stone). Sams boyhood acquaintance, Nicky Santoro (a superb turn from Joe Pesci) turns up with an ambitious agenda of his own thing that takes things on a further downward spiral. <BR>Casino was written by Nicholas Pileggi (who received an oscar nomination for Goodfellas) who goes for absorbing realism, expertly drawn characters that are played with raw, instinctive conviction and a host of intriguing subplots. There are plenty of stomach-churning scenes of violence with such graphic images of a victims head being squeezed in a vice being one of the most brutal acts displayed in the film. The films well-thought out structure is accompanied by an enthralling and sizzling soundtrack. A genuine masterpiece!
B00006LSM3|5.0|What is striking on hearing this album for the first time is just how fresh and strong Harrison's unique voice is despite his battle with cancer.  My personal favorites: \\"Rising Sun\\" , \\"Looking for My Life\\" and the title track.  As I write this I can't but feel once again a great disappointment that there could not have been a reunion tour with the three former Beatles (and Jeff Lynne).  Lynne's presence on this album is in a word, wonderful.  I am sure others are aware of this but isn't interesting that Harrison's major albums-ALL Things Must Pass, Cloud Nine, the current one, etc., have all been released in November-one of the bleakest months of the year.  For me this occasional burst of wonderful music in the depths of the fall from the former Beatle and friends always brings imaginary sunshine, the promise of spring, renual and the sense of better times to come.  Thanks George!  Like millions of boomers I feel like I personally knew you and will miss you greatly.   <BR>     If you are a Beatles fan buy this CD/album. You won't be disappointed no matter what the \\"nitpicking\\" pseudo critics may say above or elsewhere.   The lyrics and music are timeless.  Thank you Amazon for this forum.   RB/Maine.
B000000H5J|5.0|This album is amazing.  Period.  Fear Factory deliver a vicious metal assault sure to please even the most discriminating of headbangers.  Their futuristic thrash sound was led by Burton C. Bell's fearsome growl, Dino Cazares's interesting and spine-crushing riffs, and the thumping rhythms of bassist Christian Olde Wolbers and Drummer Raymond Herrera.  Perhaps better than any other album, \\"Demanufacture\\" combines the accessibility of thrash with the all-out heaviness of death metal.<br />But there's more.  A lot more.  Burton could sing, and he did so quite often here.  He had a very cool, haunting singing voice that provided a nice contrast with the aggression that characterizes much of the album.  On the title track, he sings the first few lines, making it that much more effective when he turns on the growl.  \\"Dog Day Sunrise,\\" a cover of a song by a band called Head of David, features entirely clean vocals, and it's downright mesmerizing.  What's more, the band also added an industrial element that helped to differentiate them from other metal bands, especially at the time.  Although the industrial samples are used conservatively, they add an extra dimension to the already heavy songs.<br />If one song here deserves special mention, it's the closer \\"A Therapy for Pain.\\"  It's a slow, melodic, nine-plus-minute epic with an indescribably eerie sound.  Burton's foreboding, almost angelic vocals combine with heavy doses of industrial samples to make a song that's truly chilling.  For some reason, it strongly reminds of the Lone Biker of the Apocalypse's theme music from the movie \\"Raising Arizona.\\"  But anyway, it's a great song, and a brilliant way to end an album.  In conclusion: this album is a masterpiece.  If you don't have it, you should.  End of story.
B00006JIAF|5.0|I can honestly say the best album in a long time.  Amazing vocals by Julian Casablancas, same with guitar by Albert Hammond Jr. and Nick Valensi, the bassist Nickolai Fraiture actually has a keep role in the band's music and drummer Fab Moretti sounds like a drum machine.  Buy it, its worth it.
B000021YQV|2.0|Gave this CD a whirl after hearing so many people rave about it and I still can't find why it's a good CD at all.  I'll give credit to the song &quot;Aerials&quot; because it's just awesome and different; however, the rest of the CD didn't ever seem to lyrically grab me and I got tired of the leader singer's same vocal pattern on every single song.  I thought this CD would yield yet another rock band for me to like but unfortunately it seems too monotonous in structure and almost disjointed at points.  I hope this band does some more fine tuning and gives more variety in singing style but also in the way they produce songs that can at least be deciphered somewhat on the first listen, not unintelligible until the fifth or sixth listen.
B00005N91B|4.0|In 1992, director Paul Verhoeven (Robocop, Starship Troopers)would be at the helm of this psychological erotic thriller which took on-screen sex to higher heights and made Sharon Stone a star.  Michael Douglas stars as a burnt out, disgraced San Francisco cop who is on the case of a murdered rocker with Stone as the prime suspect.  Soon some ridiculous revelations are abound, but thanks to Verhoeven's excellent directing and screen writer Joe Eszterhas' suspenseful and erotic script, we believe all of it and are enthralled at the results.  Basic Instinct is without a doubt a guilty pleasure with notable comparisons to late night pay channel soft core porn, but Douglas and Stone's on screen chemistry makes it all somewhat believable.  It's just too bad that Verhoeven and Eszterhas' next film, 1995's Showgirls, missed any aimable mark whatsoever.  The DVD case design is rather clumsy, but you've got to love the ice pick pen.
B00005OAIE|5.0|It's not often that someone of exceptional talent gets accepted on mainstream radio. John Mayer is one of the tastiest guitarists I have heard in a long well. He isn't showy, but he  knows what to play. Songs like My Stupid Mouth and Why Georgia highlight this. But if there is one defining thing about John Mayer it is that he GROOVES. Just have a listen to Neon to find that out. Some might say he sounds a little like Dave Mathhews, but I say, so what? If you don't like that then don't listen, I personally think he has much more to offer than that. Room for Squares is one of the best albums to come out this year,and John Mayer is a very endearing and talented songwriter.
B00001U0E1|4.0|i rented \\"shakespeare in love\\" because i heard it was a good film, and because it won best picture.  yes, \\"saving private ryan\\" is better, but you really can't compare the two movies on the same level.  \\"ryan\\" is about companionship and the brutality of war, while \\"shakespeare\\" is about... well, shakespeare.  with that said, onto the review:<br />okay, it was promoted as a romantic comedy, but the comedy elements aren't all there.  true, there are some good one-liners (ben affleck's \\"woman\\" line kills me.  i won't say anymore for those of you who have not seen it.), but some of the lines seem a little forced to the point of hokiness (i.e. \\"the show must...\\" / \\"go on!\\").  however, it is a romantic comedy, not a comedy, so the romance must come first.  after all, wouldn't pretty much every comedy be considered a romantic comedy, as everything has the underlying theme of love, yet the comedy takes precedence?  well, anyway there are funny parts.<br />yes, it is a romantic film.  for those who have said that the relationship is merely lust, they probably need to watch the movie again.  true, there is a lot of sex in the movie, but there are definitely great romantic themes in it.  i remember being able to relate to the characters in their desire to see and be with each other, and any movie that can strike a chord like that is at least half-way decent.  i watched the movie twice (i believe, it's been awhile.), and i would like to watch it again to make sure the relationship is not just dominated by lust.  by the way, romance aside, miss paltrow has a fabulous body, so if you want to see her naked, there's the bait.<br />lastly, for all you cynics that have pointed out the film's chronological errors, do you forget that in fact, william shakespeare may not have written all the plays with he is credited?  there is speculation that sir francis bacon may have penned some of his works, and others argue that one man could not have known so many things about so many different places, as represented in shakespeare's work.  pointing out small errors made by screenwriters seems to be a favorite pastime among persons with small genitalia, so forget them and think about what i just said about mr. shakespeare.  chronological errors, indeed.<br />i'm not a fan of shakespeare, but i'm a fan of this movie.  it is worth a try if you like romance, theatre, or naked gwyneth paltrow... so i guess it's fun for the whole family.  enjoy.
0140120416|5.0|I think that this book, when accompanied by talking and consulting prople who speak Russian, can really get a serious student to speak and understand the language.<br />True, some of the words and grammer are in old fashioned Russian, but other than that -it is very easy to learn from, very deductive and well organized.
B00006LWSF|1.0|whenever a Music Artist makes a film&has a Soundtrack naturally the Soundtrack will out last the film right? wrong.the film is getting alot more attention&after hearing this Album I can see why.Eminem is a Ok Artist who is catchy,Cleaver&has a certain charm with certain songs but this CD doesn't have Him all the way through.if the Record Company had have been Smarter they would have Milked Eminem's Version of \\"Purple Rain\\" With Him doing the whole Soundtrack.at this stage of the Game Eminem doesn't need any outside guests.this disc beyond the so-so lead single is weak.
B000001FHV|5.0|\\"too high to die\\" is one of the best albums i have EVER listened to. the first meat puppets album i bought was MPII and i liked it, but this is what i was looking for. great guitars, lyrics that make you think, this is something anyone should love. So, put down that backstreet boys and creed junk, and crank this up!!! j mascis rules too
B00006M183|1.0|Pearl Jam just keeps falling&falling with each release it seems.this Album lacks a real knockout track&the Playing seems like going in routine.the only thing that has changed with Pearl Jam is there Hairstyles.Pearl Jam is mainly a Band that had a few moments&a bunch of clone acts like Stone temple Pilot,Creed,KnickleBack,etc... keeping there sound&Vocal stylings around.but all I hear here is another Band doing a formula round.
B000000OSE|3.0|Following the success of Appetite and Lies, the boys decided to wack on any and every song (except surprisingly the b-side 'shadow of your love' that they had ever written and anthologise it onto this 2 CD monster.<BR>The result is an uneven ride through very average and dull songs interspersed by several masterpieces.<br />Basically, the first side of this album (ie songs 1-9) should have been scrapped (but for 'Bad Obsession' and 'Don't Cry')and filled in with the best of CD 2, to make a kicker of an album.<br />Instead we have the mish-mash that this is. Still, the standout tracks are Bad Obsession, Don't Cry, November Rain (written originally for the Appetite album believe it or not) and Coma.<BR>The rest of the left over songs would have made great b-sides instead, because that is what they are.
B000002HEP|5.0|Excellent album by one of the best bands from the '90's you probably never heard of.  Great concept for an album, 12 songs or something on 3 tracks with a bonus track. Heavy and beautiful
B000002BSV|2.0|in some ways a return to form after a rather depressing second album, this one is a little too light and bubble-gummy, largely saved by the most quintessential suede song ever written \\"picnic by the motorway\\". Too many songs are throwaways and begs the question why the single \\"Trash\\"'s b-side \\"Every Monday Morning Comes\\" wasn't included on the album.<BR>There is little direction shown by the band which seems to be now treading water.
B00003CXI1|1.0|Can It get any worse?Harry Potter is as convincing as the tooth fare, the story is awfully tiring, the only good part is the quadraball one.This has NO magic other that earning BIG bucks, of course I am almost alone here, maybe due to the fact that many of today's children didn't grow up watching wonders such as : Snowhite and the Seven dworfs, Pinochio, The beauty and the beast, etc...Maybe the Harry Potter producers should have sticked to the cartoon-like movie instead of casting such a horrible set of actors.Oh my God, I hope It stops or improves soon, after all, how much more torture somebody has to endure having to take kids to see such an awful piece, over and over again?
B000000OSG|3.0|Like I said in my earlier review, this 2 CD monster is a mish-mash of ... and masterpiece and should have been carefully cropped and made into a single brilliant album. Shame.<br />The first three songs on this album should have opened CD1 as they are extremely good (Civil War lyrics are a bit immature). The alternate version of Don't Cry should have been made a b-side for the curious collector, as with the appalling and by-the-numbers songs like shotgun blues, get in the ring (cringe) and my world. 'So fine'is ...., while the Dylan classic should never have been released as a single for such a huge band. Oh well.<br />Standouts: civil war, 14 years, yesterdays, breakdown, pretty tied up, and (from Appetite left overs) you could be mine.
6300215512|5.0|I find every day that I, an eighteen-year old movie buff, am starting to get into the classics a lot. This one is no exception. Eerie and funny, anybody who likes &quot;serious&quot; films will enjoy this one. Grade: A+
B000002LR3|5.0|Primal Scream will never be remebered as a great band but this album WILL be remembered. Every song on here is immaculately crafted and is catchy, sweeping and original. Nothing quite like it. If there is any criticism, it would be that song no.1 doesn't fit  stylistically on the album and would have made a great closing number instead. But that's just knitpicking.<br />Buy this album, the play it over and over, occasionally interspersed with the Beatles' Revolver and the Stone Roses first album.<br />A must for any serious collection.
B00005JKLY|5.0|This movie rocks! A great piece of entertainment! Well worth the time (No pun intended)! Grade: A+
0684803356|3.0|This is the second Hemingway book I've read, the first being Farewell to Arms. This book is about 200 pages too long. There are some wonderful bits washed out by blinding repetitiveness. Over and over again Robert Jordan talks in circles around his head, Pilar nags and curses, Maria and Robert compete to see who can proclaim their love the best. Say it right once, clear, simple and powerful. Do not say it a thousand times so your words are an echo of an echo of an echo.
B00003CXTG|1.0|The attack on Pearl Harber obviously didn't look anything even close to what this film shows it to be. If you want to make a claim that this is a &quot;historical&quot; film, show me that the historical facts are respected(it's really not even worth asking if they are or not). <br />If you want a love story, there are thousands of other movies that are better than this. And if you want a war movie, there are yet another thousands that do better than this one. If you want special effects, ok, maybe there aren't thousands then. But special effects don't make movies by themselves. <br />In my opinion, this movie is an insult to those who died in Pearl Harbor. Too bad special effects sell these movies like they are the only things in the world to see.
0060523794|5.0|Having lived through this time within IBM, it was very instructive to read about the thoughts and reasons behind the actions that occured behind the scenes. Within IBM as a worker bee we didn't realize much of what Lou describes here. We saw the company sink, and the only pre-Lou idea offered to 'fix' things was to fragment the company(and thereby destroy it). Gerstner came in, developed plans to save the company intact, and got them done. The public surely couldn't see it. So it is enlightening for all.<br />Yes, there was a great deal of pain in this, especiially for the downsized ex-employees, which he doesn't cover to any extent (perhaps he can't). But this wasn't his purpose. <br />He describes the rebirth well. And it's now a better company, with better products. And that's largely due to Lou.<br />And it's a better place to work.
B00006RU5B|1.0|This is the WORST album I have heard in my ENTIRE Life!!
B00000420F|4.0|The &quot;24 Arias&quot; are known by every singer as the beginner songs, and the fact is that many students butcher the songs because they find them very boring to sing. Therefore this is a recording for any beginner.  Cecilia's coloring, vocal line, diction and basic interpretation are what an aspiring singer should aim for.  Even the &quot;boring&quot; songs are brought to life by this versitile singer.  How many times has one heard &quot;Se tu m'ami&quot; and just thought, &quot;Not again.&quot;  Well Cecilia brings new life to timeless songs and hopefully she will inspire younger singers to find the beauty in these songs.  For the non-singers, what more could you want to hear but a beautiful singer singing beautiful songs?
B00006LLNU|5.0|In my opinion ( ) is a vast improvement over the overproduced Agaetis Bryrun. Whereas Agaetis Bryrun (with the exception of 'Svefn-G-Englar') was filled with overwrought silly clichéd art-pop hooks, suffocating under lengthy bland orchestration, the new album ( ) is spare, engaging and original. Although lyrically and conceptually many tracks sound like variations of the same song - they are intriguing and moving variations. Standouts for me include tracks 4, the track closest to a song also from Vanilla Sky, and track 5, on which the asexual vocals soar into a space similar to the gothic (literally) medieval stylizing of Lisa Gerard of Dead Can Dance. Track three is an almost new agey rendition of a simple, but beautiful piano melody. <br />The reference by the Amazon reviewer to Low, a (less cheesy) U2, Radiohead and My Bloody Valentine is spot on. Other comparisons might include the long climatic works by the experimental live Ummagumma era Pink Floyd, and the brilliant vocals of the Cocteau Twins. <br />One of the best albums of the year.
B000066NW0|3.0|Today we have Michelle Branch, Vannessa Carlton, Norah Jones, Avril Lavigne, Pink, Britney, Christina, Mumba, Ashanti, Dynamite, etc.  In my opinion only 3 of the names mentioned above have a respectable career set out for them in the future, and Lavigne is one of them.<br />Accepting that Norah Jones actually has a style that is truly her own and Ms Dynamite actually has more than 4 good songs on her new album (unlike Ashanti) Avril Lavigne at the moment has just started.<br />Listening to the album, what she lacks in style (for example, one song could be a dido tune and another could be Alanis Morrissette) she makes up for in variety.  She is not perfect yet by a long way, but in songs like \\"I'm With You\\", \\"Tomorrow\\" and \\"Unwanted\\" her voice reaches peak in the album, these songs are ones she'll sing till she's retired.<br />one reviewer said all her music sounds the same, which is quite possibly the biggest wrong thing anyone could have said, I'm assuming that guy/girl only listened to the not so great singles complicated and skater boy.  Every song is different and there are times when Lavigne shows real maturity in melody and rhythm and songwriting.  The lyrics are unfortunately \\"Accessible\\" in other words lovey dovey and you broke my heart you bad man type lyrics, but there are some self reflecting lyrics showing that maybe she just writes what is in her heart.<br />Lavigne is probably going to end up as the most popular out of the names I mentioned in the first paragraph, simply because the stuff she writes about is easy to grasp and understand as well as sounding good.  Is it pop? yes.  Is it good pop?  Hell yes.  Will it get better?  She is only 17...........<br />Unfortunately there are only a few songs that sound like \\"Lavigne\\" songs which is why I give this album 3 out of 5, but I look forward to the next album where I'm sure she will develop her sound and sogwriting, This is not bad music, and she is not a poser, she is young and full of energy with plenty more to offer.
020530902X|5.0|\\"New Edition\\". Now includes a Glossary in the back pages with at least sixty words and phrases such as; \\"adjectival modifier\\" and \\"modal auxiliaries\\" clearly explained. As with the 1979 Third Edition, my recommendation is to begin this book on page 66 and read the twenty-one reminders that follow, then read the book front to back.
0553381709|4.0|I liked the first two a lot, and was sceptical that this one would be as good, I was suprised, it is a very good book. I read a few of the other reviews and don't really understand why people don't like this. I do like the overall style of chapters focused on each character and it got me to where I would want to look forward to see what happened to each character at the end of each Chapter, luckily I resited. Its a fast paced book, even though it very long, which is good.
0316666343|4.0|The Lovely Bones was a book that pulled me in almost immediately.  The way the author shapes some of the characters, especially Susie's parents, left me wanting more and more.  The part with Holiday and Susie meeting up after so long left me in so many tears that I had to put the book down for a few minutes and just cry.  The author takes the book in a wonderful direction but abruptly makes a complete turn and ruins everything the book had going for it.  <br />I went in expecting something completely different than what I received.  This can be interpreted as both a good and bad thing.
6305428220|1.0|This movie is a sad joke.  The boom microphone droops into the view of the camera constantly.  What weak wimp did they have holding it up there?  At least trying to spot this constant error gives you something to watch for.  The story certainly does NOT.
B000069CWE|2.0|to all linkin park fans - You'll probably buy this even when I tell you that this CD [is weak], but it does.  I really liked \\"Hybrid Theory\\" and some additional songs I've heard by Linkin Park, but this album is really bad.  I'd give it 1 star, but the songs are, after all, just re-mixes of \\"Hybrid Theory\\" which I really liked.<br />to all those interested in linkin park - Do NOT let this album be your introduction to Linkin Park.  They have so much more to offer!  Buy Hybrid Theory, and even if you like that, I wouldn't reccommend this CD.<br />to anyone else - If you don't like Linkin Park, and aren't interested in hearing any of their stuff, then why are you reading this in the first place?
B00006RU5B|5.0|This album is one of the best albums I have heard in a LONG time. There isn't one song that won't have your foot tapping right along, and it's hard not (to attempt) to wail along with Cornell. &quot;Shadow on the Sun&quot; and &quot;I am the Highway&quot; are both unbelievably beautiful &quot;ballads&quot; that still feature an awesome rythym section. The vocal harmonies on &quot;Hypnotize&quot; give me goosebumps. This is a great album to sit down and listen to all the way through; no skip-over tracks on this album. After a thorough listening-to, you will be moved.
B00005JKZ3|1.0|The Extras on this DVD make it worth a look, but honestly you could skip the movie and get more enjoyment out of the disc.  I Can not believe this movie got released as is.  The story IS remenicent of the first MIB but I don't fault that; I mean how many sequels have there been that simply rehash original material.  The big problem I had with this film was that it only gives a cursory glimps of the plot line, the movie feels so rushed I thought I was being brushed off by someone who had something better to do.  If the film had been given the time to develop all its ellements I think there would have been a good movie in it, but as it is the runing time is just around 1hr 20min and in the day and age of 3hr versions of LOTR and 2hr 45min of Harry Potter I think a great injustice was done to this production by not fleshing it out fully.  There were some good points in the performances... but without the time to really develope the characters even these great actors have a tendency to appear wooden and in some cases bored.  The aliens were of course a high point but without a good story to present them it seemed more like a pagent for animatronics and CGI; &quot;here is alien pupet #1&quot;  &quot;here is alien computer grafic #5&quot; &quot;aren't they beautiful&quot; this gets tedious after a while no matter how beautiful Rick Bakers work is.<BR>The Extras have some real pluses though, and I found them all very worth while, the Blooper real is side spliting.  The Special efects docu shorts aren't as good as the ones included on the Episode I disc but are still very interesting.  And far and above everything else is the animated short film called &quot;Attack of the Chub Chubs&quot; this is totally hilarious, one of the best short subjects you will ever see... I rank it right up there with &quot;For the Birds&quot; which is included on the Monsters Inc DVD.<BR>BOTTOM LINE: If you don't expect much from this DVD you will be satisfied by it, but if you expect the magicof MIB I you will probably be angery and sad.
B00005JKJA|4.0|This is really just a quick technical note, obviously the movie is great or I wouldn't have purchased it, but the DVD is the bare minimum of expectation - it does have the film on it, and a slide-show style cast and crew section - but most horrifically there is no chapter selection! For a 147 minute movie not to have chapter selection or even index points that you can skip to is really very shabby. The zone 4 version has chapter selection, Canne Festival press conferences and a David Lynch interview.
0060930187|4.0|What else can possibly be said about this book that hasn't already been said since it was published in '63?  It's fiercely personal, it's scary as hell, it's laugh-out-loud hilarious.  Plath has the ironic first person voice of Esther Greenwood down cold, and her dark sense of humor is what makes this book so much more harrowing.  What amazes me most about reading the Bell Jar now in 2002 is how modern it seems.  Plath was way, way ahead of her time.
B00006J9OT|5.0|Not that I did not enjoy 'The Look of Love', but this album is why we love you.  Thank you for this one Diana.
B00006F2TV|2.0|How is a grownup to respond to silliness of sci-fi these days? Tune out of this review if there is nothing that can stop you from suspending your disbelief in today's computer generated action. Isn't this new technology supposed to make action sequences better? I LOVE great action. I WANT them to utilize the technology in a fun and exiting way. But if you have half a brain, then the childish, insulting special effects of this and many other recent movies has to depress you-it has to leave you wondering if you're just too old to enjoy this genre any more. ROT!! I'm not too old, this movie is bad. Granted, directors are up against the studios demands that every new blockbuster be more radical than the last, more DARING, more -- well, you know what I mean. What is the result of this philosophy? Obviously, it's a law of diminishing returns, in which we get increasingly more dynamic use of CG technology, and less and less useful substance, less and less responsibility for showing us something that we can sink our teeth into. Once the director establishes his lack of respect for the audience, he can proceed with the story with this caveat: any action sequence is valid. If we know they distort reality in the silly action sequences, we also now know that the story, characters, theme, plot, are all suspect. MAKE ME BELIEVE! That's the director's job. Spiderman is a major disappointement. If you are over 16 years of age....
B000002BFZ|3.0|As the same with vitology, I bought this album as open minded as possible, and willing to except anything this album had to offer. And upon basing it on mixed opioins. But once again that did not really happen. But there are a few more redeamable qualitys to no code that lacked on vitology. For one no code did not lack so much focus that vitology lacked. No code for the sound quality of it really sound like pearl jam took there time and organaized there prioritys. But with it's share of duds(in my opioin) that no code has, it more than makes up for it with songs that are some of pearl jams most flamboyant songs, or from a avid fan such as myself's point of view. Songs like \\"hail,hail\\" with it's angry punk vibe, in my tree, smile, and one of my favorites off he goes, habit, red mosquito, and present tense are prime example of this. The only problem with \\"present tense\\", it that it could of had a more powerfull climax to it. Once again, if you were to be new to pearl jam I would ease into this one. But then again, I do listen to no code regularly as I do with the rest of the pearl jam catalouge, so I still listen to it by the off chance something will catch my ear that has not before.
0393317552|1.0|Diamond's book is an example of what is now known as \\"reverse racism.\\"  Arguing the New Guineans have a greater intellectual capacitity than Europeans in particular is just too much to swallow. I agree that race plays no part in the rise of cultures, but I also contend that culture plays a part in the rise of races.<br />Imagine if Diamond had lived in the realm of the founders of Western culture-- the ancient Greeks and Romans.  He would have praised the pale, yet primitive Europeans to the north as somehow superior than his own swarthy people of the Mediterranean.  Truly a racist ahead of his time!<br />Yet the whiter people of northern Europe would eventually come to exert more influence on the rest of the world than the Greeks or Romans ever did, apparently losing the mantle of unbridled intellectual capacity.<br />Apparently, Diamond hates the West.  He resents its success at the expense of indigenous people throughout the world.  But remember, Gauls, Iberians, and Germans were once indigenous people too.  And don't think for a moment that New Guinea natives would never have hesitated to oppress white people if given the means.<br />If Europeans developed guns, better methods of treating disease, and steel, it's because of a history of the Western notions of rational inquiry and the dissemination of knowledge.  <br />Determinists might love his book because it makes an easy argument supported by conventional wisdom.  I am no determinist, nor is Diamond an historian.
B00005JKDR|5.0|If you look at my other Amazon[.com] reviews, you will notice that I don't review movies and truth by told, I watch very few movies.  Perhaps 2-4 per year, including both in the theater and at home on video or DVD.  I'm just not a movie fan.<br />But tonight, we rented the Monsters Inc DVD and I absolutely loved it!  Clever, hilarious, touching, innovative, unique, imaginative - those words don't begin to tell about this movie!  You just have to see it.<br />It's such a pleasure to see a G-rated movie doing so well, both at the box office and also sales of the products for home viewing.  This movie is totally free of sex, profanity, and substance abuse.  Some of the action could be called violence, but not in the sense we usually define violence in movies!  This movie might scare a 4-year-old, however.  You need to know your own child to know if he's ready for this action-packed, laugh-a-minute masterpiece!<br />I watched this with my husband and two of our older kids (ages 19 and 21).  We all enjoyed this movie immensely and can't wait to watch the extras on the other DVD.  I can actually see watching this movie again, as the humor flies fast and furious and I know I missed a some good lines!  <br />You will be touched by the relationship between Sully (the big blue monster) and the little girl he affectionately names Boo.  He puts her safety above his job and above the good of the company.  This little girl they created is nothing short of charming and endearing.  You will instantly love her and cheer Sully on as he does everything he can to protect her.<br />The premise of the movie - that the Monsters collect screams of children which in turn power the city that the Monsters live in, is nothing short of genius.  This DVD would be a great gift for many people on your Christmas List - regardless of their age!
0060536977|4.0|Mr. Crichton has developed a habit of taking current technologic challenges and submitting them to flights of fancy. Such is the case with his latest novel. Here is the thesis: increasingly complex systems become increasingly uncontrolable, and at some point may develop behaviors beyond those intended or anticipated by the designers. In a sense these behaviors may mimic evolution, at some point the creatures imitating if not in fact becoming sentient creatures. Of course these creatures would not be worth a novel if they didn't do Really Bad Things, and couldn't be contained or controlled in a conventional way. The creatures in this case are microscopic machines manufactured (bred?) to act as collectively as a camera, that take on the characterists  of a predatory algorithm conveniently built into its programming by its designers. They attack things, multiply, threaten to take over the earth; well, you get the idea. The subplot concerns the marital relationship between an unemployed programmer who just happened to design the algorithm, and his wife, who just happens to be an executive in the company who inadvisedly included his algorithm into the microbots. Did she cheat on him or not? Does the world end? What unswered questions will we have at the last page? Sticky sweet melodrama to be sure, but worth an afternoon to read. <br />The thought came to me as I read another of Mr. Crichton's books (Airframe) that he had written it with the movie rights in mind. No deep character development, thank you, and evenly paced, if not contrived, action. The same happened as I read this book. Now that is not necessarily a bad thing. If you want a little more meat with your starch, maybe try Stephen King. A lot more energy could have been given to what the principals felt and though along the whole way. Narrated by a man who on the one hand is troubled by his wife's (possibly unfaithful) behavior, and on the other by the technology he spawned that threatens mankind, I would haveliked a better image of what made him tick, and a little less stereotype. Being part geek by nature I didn't mind all the techno stuff, but it may be off-putting to some. These reservations aside, Prey is worth the time to read it, or as in this case, to hear while on the way to work. Keep your literary expecations in check, though, and try not to lose any sleep over the thought that there may be nanobots in your soup.

B00006M183|4.0|I rank this album up there with Vitalogy and Yield, PJs best. I've been a fan from the beginning and find that Vs. and Ten, which are great alubms for their time, sound too much like a product of a young band, which in fact they were at the time (I only mention this because so many reviewers have a tough time facing that those albums are not the bands top work. Face it, kids - life does go on). <BR>Upon 1st listen, I was about half way through Riot Act when I thought that I was yet to hear a unintersting song (not the case on their last album - Binaural). This is a complete album. I do not find myself skipping past any songs. Nice progression boys. I'm looking forward to the next one.

B000002UJQ|5.0|This is perhaps the ultimate late-90's rock CD. Every song has a thick layer of sound on it that keeps revealing new surprises even on the hundreth listen. Each instrument (including vocals) is played as well as it should, without emphasis on \\"showing off technique,\\" in perfect synchronization  with all the other instruments. This is about as good as it gets in the genre of rock. Anyone who likes music will enjoy this CD and find something that they like here. I am living proof of this statement; OK Computer alone delivered me from my obsession with nu-metal bands such as Korn and Orgy two years ago when I bought it as a birthday present for my mom and loved it too much to actually give to her. This is not some overhyped CD full of recycled 70's music that really isn't as good as everyone says it is. If you want to hear something like that, get Is This It by The Strokes. This is music played at the highest level by very competant musicians that mean business; something that has been very hard to find lately. If you don't believe me, download a few songs; they're all excellent. My personal favorites are \\"Paranoid Android,\\" \\"Let Down,\\" \\"Electioneering,\\" and \\"Climbing up the Walls.\\"

B00005R2M3|4.0|never having heard anything of shakira in my life, after seeing the weird video for whenever wherever, i bought the album, just to give it a go..looking at the gorgeous blonde one on the front i assumed it would be your average blondes attempt at recording an album, but after listening just the once, i changed my mind.The album is impressive, shakira having an emotionally moving and amazingly strong voice, she cant fail..all the tracks, a marvellous blend of music, the colombian, latin american music she grew up on, various other influences, and of course the westernised sound we like, she has produced this eclectic mix, with something for all tastes..the guitary sounds of \\"fool\\", the slow sensual sounds of \\"underneath your clothes\\", the beautiful spanish songs,\\"que me quedes tu\\", and \\"te dejo madrid\\". i believe this album will impress, a good strong voice, a nice mix, and the sexiest videos to match..a classy effort, her experience definately shines.and her first english speaking album too..the girls done good!

0440237688|4.0|The Giver is a thought provoking book.  The community is controlled by a group of elders who believe they are protecting the people of their community.  The people in the community experience a life without pain and little emotion and no memories of the past.  This is seemingly a wonderful life except it is a life controlled by a committee.   <br />There is however, one individual the Giver, who carries the burden of all memory, emotions and suffering for the community.  He is like Jesus who died on the cross and took all of our sins with Him except the Giver is not perfect. Therefore, every number of years a new child is picked by the committee to be the receiver of all the pain, memories and emotion.  The current giver passes this on to the new giver and so the community continues until one receiver no longer plays by the rules of the community.  <br />The burden of being the reciever is great and they bare much pain during this time.  I like how Jonas became the receiver and took up all the memories and realized all that is wrong about the community.  I dislike that there is no lovingness between the members of the community.  They have no pain but the also lack any real passion or love.  It made me appreciate that although life can be difficult (there is real good and real bad), these two conflicting emotions are what bring vitality to life.
B000069HP6|4.0|I got the DVD a few days ago and watched it once and then a couple days later half way through again from middle to end. I like the whole concept of the movie quite a bit. The story has some good twists and turns which keeps it interesting.<br />I found the visuals quite good and the sinister and distant mood quite appropriate. The Cygnus is a wonderfully detailed ship and shows nicely in many scenes before and after starting to enter the black hole. The black hole and the space visuals are generally nicely done too. Since I saw this as a kid, the robots Maximillian and V.I.N.cent (and B.O.B as an interesting contrast and variation) really stuck in my mind as very unique in the sci-fi area. Some people apparently complain that they are take-offs of Star Wars robots but that comparison eludes me. <br />I thought the acting of Max Schell was quite good and the accent was a great characteristic for that role.<br />The whole section where Dr. Hans Reinhart and Maximillian meet up and apparently merge into one human/robot entity was a favorite section of the movie (although just a bit funny when the human eyes appear moving about in Max's head). The hell-like landscape with Maximillian standing on the mountain with flames rising around him was a wonderful bizarre dreamscape. <br />I did think some of the music during laser fight scenes was a bit odd. I would have preferred different music in those places. The music in other times (including during the Maximillian/hell scene was good though.<br />I wasn't as fond of the ending after the hell/maximllian scene when it just seemed to end on a happy &quot;we made it through&quot; note with the probe ship heading away. I think I would have preferred them entering a totally bizarre universe which was visually unlike ours. That would have ending on a less sure and more interesting note (IMHO).<br />Anyway, it's a classic I'll watch again for sure.

0517221160|2.0|Very boring. I had to read it for something I did at school. The beggining is OK but after awile it gets really boring. For example they propose he gets turned down ect. I didn't really get<br />the feel for this book. I had heard it was supposed to be good. But I heard it from one of my substitutes she said it was really good but I don't really like romance, stress, and poverty in stories but if you like that you can try this book. I DO NOT. YES I DO NOT RECCOMEND THIS BOOK!!!

B00005U8EM|4.0|Bill Murray plays self-centered and sarcastic TV weatherman Phil Connors in &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;. Giving everyone contemptuous and snide remarks, it's no wonder that both his TV producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) and cameraman Larry (Chris Elliot) find him completely dislikable. On an assignment, Phil along with his crew is sent to the small town of Punxsutawney, PA to report on the annual celebration of Groundhog Day. Phil of course can't wait to get out of the town but 'disaster' strikes when a blizzard comes in fast and hard, making it impossible for Phil to leave the town of Punxsutawney. Strangely enough, Phil wakes up the next morning, finding out it 'isn't' the next morning, he has again woken up on February 2nd, 1992! Day after day, he must live through the same Groundhog Day! Will he ever be able to break out of the time loop or is he destined to live the same day over and over? Phil desperately wants to go back to his normal life. And more than anything, he wants to be the kind of man Rita would fall in love with, just as he becomes to fall in love with her....<br />By reading the summary on &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;, those who have never watched this movie are probably thinking 'what a strange movie this sounds like.' But I assure you, I myself was very surprised how good the plot was and how every actor and actress was perfect in their parts.<br />The most notable acting done in the movie was by Bill Murray. I have always liked Bill Murray, he has a sense of timing, giving off jokes at the perfect moment. He is just sooo funny! And he is not only a great comedian, he also gets to show off some of his serious and romantic side in &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;. As he continued to live the same day again and again, you can't help but get attached to his character and even begin to like him, especially as he begins to change. The supporting actors Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliot do a good job in their roles, too, but Bill Murray certainly steals the whole movie.<br />I must also acknowledge the superb screenwriting job done by Danny Rubin and Harold Ramis (Ramis is also the Director and Producer of &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;). The plot is actually very 'smart', creating a very interesting perspective. The movie is a bit repetitive at times (of course it is, that's the whole point!) and feels a bit bogged down, but the story always picks up. The ending was so nice I couldn't help but want to jump up and down and shout hurray! A truly triumphant ending! <br />I highly recommend this movie for those who like incredible acting with plenty of drama, humor, and romance in the plot. The movie is rated PG because of some innuendo, crude humor, and adult themes. Not for younger kids to watch since they might find the story a bit hard to follow and a bit dull. Great for teens and adults. Another movie I highly recommend is &quot;The Truman Show&quot; starring Jim Carrey. An incredible movie, the PG-rated film is similar to &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; in that the movie centers on the life of Carrey's character whose life is stuck an interesting perspective.<br />Some bits of interesting trivia on &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;:<BR>*Murray was bitten by the groundhog twice during the filming of this movie.*<BR>*Murray and Ramis have both been Honorary Grand Marshals for the Groundhog Day celebrations in Punxsatawney, PA.*<BR>*The movie was not filmed in Punxsutawney, but actually in Woodstock, Illinois. There is a small plaque that reads &quot;Bill Murray stepped here&quot; on the curb where Murray continually steps into a puddle.*<BR>*In one of the early scenes of Phil at the piano teacher's house, when he is fumblingly playing Rachmaninoff's &quot;Rhapsody on a Theme by Paginini&quot;, is actually Bill Murray playing. He does not read music, but he learned that much of the song by ear.*
B00006X06U|5.0|This collection of orchestral arrangements of some of Joni's classics demonstrates the scope of her talent.  By giving these compositions new, lush, orchestral arrangements, she has given these songs new meaning, new life and a majestical feeling and sound.

0316666343|3.0|After reading the first few chapters I started thinking...'I have to let my mom read this book'.  But then the story dragged, and I began to skip a page until I was scanning chapters searching for anything new happening to the characters.  This author took a unique approach about death but she couldn't keep my interest.  My recommendation is to not bother reading this book.
1577311760|5.0|After I had purchased the audio cassette of &quot;The Power of Now&quot;, I made a commitment to listen to it at least twice a week, usually while I'm performing some mundane tasks such as exercising or doing housework. For someone who is in search for more meaning in life, I find its question and answer format very suitable for me. I praise Eckhart Tolle's skill in getting his message across without sounding arrogant. <BR>The impact which &quot;The Power of Now&quot; had on my &quot;being&quot; is so positive that I believe I have a better understanding of my own existence.
B00006G8LB|3.0|Our entire family enjoyed this movie. However, the love scene is a bit dry, and the relationships between all the characters are simply a bit sad in many cases. Some of the characters, especially Spider Man's love interest and best friend, are a bit shallow - and some of the scenes seem to attempt to prove otherwise, when the characters actions speak much louder.<br />On a more positive note, I felt the reason for the characters transformation into Spiderman were quite interesting, the main character was enjoyable to watch as he grew with his new responsibilities.  The special effects were very good, not working so hard on realistic, but instead gave the old comic book feel.<br />Though I did enjoy the movie, I felt there was simply too much left unexplored. I believe it could have been so much better, but not bad for a one time viewing. I would recommend renting it, not purchasing it.
B00006AG5N|5.0|Elvis is truly the most distinctive singer I've ever heard; you can always tell when he's on the radio.

B000066C6F|1.0|Now that John Travolta is back on Hollywood's A-list (unless \\"Battlefield Earth\\" sunk his career again), it is worth remembering why he was considered such a has-been during the 80's and early 90's.<br />This movie is just plain BAAAAAAAAAAAD.  I mean, it's not even amusing bad (like \\"A Night at the Roxbury\\", for example)--it's boring bad.  <br />Travolta plays a journalist for \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine who joins a health spa to determine whether or not these establishments are \\"the singles bars of the 80's\\".  Are you hooked yet?!     .............  Didn't think so.  <br />Jamie Lee Curtis plays the obligatory love interest--a sexy, dedicated aerobics intructor and unfortunately there's little-to-no screen chemistry between her and Travolta.  It probably looked good on paper at the time, but given the weak script and putrid direction, it didn't pan out.  Personally, I thought Ah-NULD made a more believable on-screen lover with Ms. Curtis in \\"True Lies\\".  <br />If all this isn't bad enough, there's a completely pointless unrelated subplot on ethics in journalism and how Travolta's character becomes a champion for the First Amendment.  On the edge of your seat, right?!  .......................  Didn't think so.<br />The only thing worth noting is an appearance by Laraine Newman (portraying an insecure fitness geek) to see what she did with her life after leaving \\"Saturday Night Live's\\" Not Ready for Prime-Time Players.  I guess she was behind on her mortgage payments when they were casting this movie.<br />My advice?  Buy \\"Perfect\\" if the sleeping pills you're taking or the NyQuil you're gargling still won't cure your insomnia.  Otherwise, fuggedaboutit.

B000006PYU|5.0|Like a little Blues in your life? Well, You can't beat this. <br />Did you ever buy a record that only had one good song on it? (Manfred Mann's &quot;Quinn The Esquimo&quot; comes to mind.) Well, There's 16 songs on this album - and 14 of them will knock your socks off! <br />I got this CD in the mail about three days ago. I've listened to it about a hundred times. This is one of the best.
B000002KYR|5.0|I own this in LP.  But I had heard on the radio before buying it, this was their first hard rock recording.  And between the radio and MTV, I had heard enough of the songs from this album.  I admit.  I was impressed by how they did this.  It separates the professionals from the amateurs.  I will cover why.<br />  One thing I like about this recording is, it was so little of a transition hardly anyone who had not heard this was a hard rock recording would not know it.  They made little change in their style of music in this recording.  But it was enough to classify as hard rock.  I had heard earlier recordings of theirs.  One is Tres Hombres.  It was to be one of their last regular rock recordings for a while.<br />  The guitars were a little deeper and heavier.  They slowed down the tempo just enough.  The drums had a harder beat.  It was in all their songs in this recording.<br />  I noticed why they only made a gradual transition.  One was to keep their regular rock fans.  The other was to pick up new hard rock fans.  And they did succeed in both areas.<br />  Of course, I noticed their next hard rock recording that came out in 1985, Afterburner, got a little harder yet.  I liked their gradual approach.  There is a reason.<br />  There have been other regular rock groups who changed too rapidly into either hard or metal rock.  They did not last.<br />  Others chose not to change.  And they faded as well.  One is Pat Benatar.  It was at an era when regular rock was fading.  And hard and metal rock were on the rise.  ZZ Top knew they had to change or fade out.  And they knew to change gradually.  Or they would risk losing their then current fans.  And they would not be able to pick up hard rock fans.  This is what separates the professionals from the amateurs.<br />  All I can say is to buy this CD from this site.  Listen closely to their style.  You will see as I have why they survived while others died.  And they are still going strong.  It is a momento in the 1980's history of rock 'n roll.  It is well worth the investment.
B000002A46|5.0|Okay, we'll all seen the news about Mariah in the last year or so---the melt down, the movie flops, etc.  But if you go back a few years and listen to some of her earlier stuff, you'll see why she became one of the biggest selling female solo artists of all time.  This collection of Chrismtas songs is no exception.  Released at the height of her popularity, it is full of great renditions of classics and some new material.  I dare you not to enjoy her dancey version of \\"Joy to the World\\" or the get up shout \\"Jesus Oh What a Wonderful child\\". This is my favorite Christmas collection of all time.  I play it every year and have yet to hear one that is much better (Vanessa Williams also released a nice collection a couple of years back).  A great addition to your Christmas collection.
B00005A1PR|5.0|Worth the price of the CD all on their own are her numbers \\"Always in My Head\\" and \\"I See God in You\\".  I am not someone who likes spiritual music either so the fact that the God one ranks so high with me is testimony to her talent.  Of all the tunes here, it was the one I was prepared to dislike.  That is the only one of its kind on this album so this is NOT a Christian rock or a gospel album.  It is pure soul and Arie is the best practitioner of that genre to come along in a very long while.  She also composes all of her own work and plays several of the instruments so is truly a triple threat talent.  I discovered her on a Spike Lee film soundtrack and am so glad I did.  She possesses a voice that soars, that only gets better on repeat listening.  Go for it.
B00006RU5B|5.0|One of the greatest albums I've heard in a very long time.  Rage's incredible grooves combined with the greatest rock and roll singer of all time makes for one hell of a band.

B00006YXEK|5.0|If you're a George Harrison or Travelling Wilbury's Fan, this is a must have.  I'd rate All Things Must Pass as George's best album, but this comes right behind it.  The songs melodies and lyrics will haunt you.  Make sure you get the special edition enhanced version.  The DVD of George's last interview are touching although the DVD is short, it shows what a truely great and honest person George was.  What a shame this is the last we'll ever have.  A true loss.
B000069CWE|4.0|My knowledge of the music world is lacking compared to the average music listener.  This is my first attempt at reviewing a music CD, so keep these facts in mind.<br />Normally I like remixes but hate enhanced CDs.  Their video segments are a pain to watch on some computers due to a lack of compatibility with some system setups.  But there's one heck of a music video included on this CD, making it worth trying to view.  It's the best music video I've ever seen BY FAR.<br />The actual music isn't too bad, either.  A large portion of the songs have a hip hop-sounding rhythm to them.  I don't care for hip hop or rap at all but fans of such music will dig it.  What I liked was three particular tracks: 02-PTS.OF.ATHRTY, 19-1STP KLOSR, and 20-KRWLNG.  These first two have a great techno-industrial beat that had me enthralled.  The last one is a tune I have trouble describing.  It soothes and rocks at the same time and the vocals are great.  Those three tracks make the CD worth buying.<br />This is barely worth mentioning, but the titles of the tracks irritate me a little.  You'll notice the words are severely shortened to strange initials which, to anyone not familiar with Linkin Park's original album, will come off as nonsense.  Couldn't they have named them something more descriptive?  For example, we could call PTS.OF.ATHRTY: Points of Authority - Cyborg Remix.<br />One last note, the cover features a cool anime robot patented after Linkin Park's mascot guy.  Without that cover I might've never noticed the CD in the store.  You can't go wrong with anime robots.<br />I think this is a great CD for urban or techno fans.
B000002N2P|5.0|Of course 'Dookie' will go down as the definitive Green Day album, but this album's way more abrasive than 'Dookie.' This was a response to all of the fans that said that they were punk sellouts and that Billie Joe was having sleeping problems (hence the title). Sure there might be traces of the 'pop' punk riffs on Dookie, but Billie Joe's vocals are more aggressive, as well as Tre's drumming, Mike's bass playing and Billie Joe's distinctive guitar tones. <BR><BR>It's short, it's fast, it's heavy, it's abrasive, and I'm certainly glad that it is not a carbon copy of Dookie. It's definitely one of their best albums, for me it's second to NIMROD.

1587990717|5.0|Chance, luck, randomness, and probability are all topics which incite debate among everyone, from the scientist to the philosopher, from the economist to the market trader, from the erudite intellectual to the ordinary thinking person. And Nassim Nicholas Taleb's new book &quot;Fooled by Randomness&quot; deals extensively with those topics for this is a book about how, in both business and in life in general, we perceive and deal with luck or, as the author says, it is a book &quot;about luck disguised and perceived as non-luck...and, more generally, randomness disguised and perceived as non-randomness.&quot; Moreover, &quot;It manifests itself in the shape of the lucky fool, defined as a person who benefited from a disproportionate share of luck but attributes his success to some other, generally very precise, reason.&quot;<br />Taleb, a professional trader and mathematics professor with an M.B.A. from the Wharton School and a Ph.D. from the University of Paris, extensively examines what randomness means in business and in life and why human beings are so prone to mistake dumb luck for consummate skill. His book is an unconventional and highly personal exploration of the nature of randomness that wanders from the court of Croesus and a visit from Solon, said to be the wisest man in the ancient world, to trading rooms in New York and London, to discussions of Russian roulette, Monte Carlo math, the survivorship bias, Darwin's theory of evolution, the problem of induction, baseball great Yogi Berra, the philosophy of Karl Popper, and a whole lot more. The range of information and knowledge displayed by the author is impressive.<br />The obvious background against which the book is set is the world of trading, but the real background is the whole mosaic of our common life. One reason the book is fascinating is Taleb's ability to make seemingly esoteric mathematical ideas entirely relevant in evaluating and understanding everything from the stock market to the successes of ordinary people, and &quot;the lucky fool in the right place at the right time.&quot; In an uncertain world where much depends on chance events, success is not always explained by the concept of &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; but, rather, by the concept of &quot;survival of the luckiest.&quot; How do chance, luck, randomness, and probability impact our lives? Taleb has some ideas about the answers to that question.<br />Don't be fooled by the brevity of this book, a mere 196 pages of textual content. Within its pages is much to ponder and I suggest reading this book once very rapidly to view the broad canvas upon which the author paints his concepts and examples, then go back and read it slowly to grasp its major ideas and important details, and then spend some time merely thinking about the conclusions, consequences, and ramifications of the notions put forth by the author. &quot;Fooled by Randomness&quot; is a fascinating read and, unusual in a book about such complex topics, an entertaining read as well.
0375703764|4.0|It's true that all the many layers of stuff going on this book are sometimes distracting and that those distractions sometimes take away from the suspense/horror of the story. On the other hand, I have to admire Danielewski for attempting so much with his first novel and, while it may not all work out as well as he'd hoped, it's still a pretty darn impressive book. Very original, very clever.
0060934913|5.0|Anthony Bourdain shows his talent as a writer by showing you his talent as a cook.  In Kitchen Confidential, Tony will take you from his first experiences with cooking all the way to his experiences at the Culinary Institute of America (CIA) and on to his professional career.  Packed with many disturbing anecdotes, this memoir will show how &quot;odd&quot; the people who work in food service really are.  He also explains several secrets for getting the best food at a restaurant and what pitfalls to avoid to prevent you from getting the absolutely worst food (don't buy the fish on Monday, don't order your steak well-done, etc.).  If you have any interest in getting into the food service industry, you simply MUST read this first, in order to get an idea of what you are really getting into.  As Tony explains, the real world of cooking is absolutely nothing like what you see on T.V. with all those celebrity chef shows.  The real world kitchen is much tougher and grittier, and certainly isn't for just anyone.
6305069611|4.0|This is one of the most beautifully photographed movies ever.  It has a moody, atmospheric quality that is hard to describe; almost dreamlike in places. The storyline is fairly straightforward at first, but then becomes convoluted as the movie increasingly digresses into tangential areas including a fair amount of Weird Alien Sex. The weakest aspect of the movie, IMHO, is the acting. Bowie's performance is pretty flat, while Rip Torn and Candy Clark are \\"over the top\\" a lot of the time.  But if you can get past that, this movie is well worth watching, at least once, and perhaps repeatedly.
B00006RU5B|5.0|So much has been said and anticipated about this album that it could easily be considered a dissapointment if it was nothing short of classic. And in my opinion, it is exactly that. From start to finish it is engaging, inventive, and exactly what people have imagined combining the stellar rythym section of Rage Against The Machine with the amazing vocal abilities of Chris Cornell. And in fact, it is even more than I expected. It seems that this union has brought out the best in both parties.<br />Many, including myself, were disappointed at Cornell's solo work and found it difficult to get into the style of RATM. And from the soft approach Cornell has pursued in his solo career, some had even began to wonder if he had lost his vocal range and power. Fortunately for all, this record is proof that his voice is just as strong and vibrant as ever. Much of his singing on Audioslave are the bluesy screams we all loved in Soundgarden- and it sounds as magnificent as ever. The songs that make up this album lean more toward Soundgarden, in fact, but throughout this album you can easily identify the RATM sound as well. Some tracks, such as &quot;I Am The Highway&quot; for example, sound nothing like RATM ever even attempted before, and there are several moments like this where you just would never expect the music to be coming out of those guys. And much praise should go to mixer Rich Costey- this is an amazing sounding record. Turn it up and it has a great full sound as if you were there in the studio while they were recording. Overall, brilliant and everything you would have hoped for!
B00005JKCH|5.0|Without a doubt one of the best comic book movies ever! Tobey Maguire did a fine job as Peter Parker and Kirsten Dunst's performance was excellent. I cant wait for the next ones to come out.
6305603847|5.0|This is still one of the best DVD transfers out there.  I've had this movie on VHS for a number of years and I'm glad to get a letterboxed version of it.  The scene where Bob Geldof is pounding at the wall is worth the price of the DVD.  The feeling of isolation is so evident on the widescreen as he almost appears insignificant next to the wall.  <BR>The songs sound so much better in surround sound, especially the part where the stuka is dive bombing Roger Water's father.  <BR>The menus and all the extras are also really well done.  It shows that the band oversaw the making of this DVD.
B00006FXB6|5.0|With the rock these days being so predictable, it's nice to hear a band who is willing to be as adventurous as QOTSA. They first caught my attention with &quot;Lost Art of Keeping A Secret&quot; from the last album, which to this day, I am interested in getting. This album I heard on a rock station once and never got enough of it afterward. The first three songs are the classics, though. Even my mom likes those. Also, screaming has never been very infectious on my ears, but that mold has been broken with &quot;Six Shooter&quot;, an awesome, chaotic track which you must listen to when you're angry.<br />Also, &quot;God Is In the Radio&quot; has awesome guitar lines, as well as the interesting &quot;The Sky Is Fallin'&quot;, and ESPECIALLY the weirdest of all, &quot;Mosquito Song&quot;.<br />Because of these things, I'd say it's this year's best album, with the only possible exception being that Wilco album. To me, they tie and are great for different reasons. If you want to have fun listening to an album, buy Songs for the Deaf.
B00006CXXU|5.0|dirrty gives the wrong impression to people aobut what the cd is like.  don't get me wrong, i love the cd and i love dirrty.  buy it, you won't be disappointed.
B00000099Y|5.0|I've had this CD for about 3 years now, and still nothing else can even compare to Aenima. It didn't leave my CD player for atleast 3 months, and it helped me realize just how great of a band Tool is. This CD is just something else. It has a dark, mysterious feeling to it that I have yet hear from any other CD. After experiencing this CD, I got into Tool so much that I couldn't really listen to any other band, since Tool seemed much superior. If you don't have Aenima, get it now. It may just change your perspective on music forever, just like it has done for me.
B00003CX5P|3.0|I enjoy the Star Wars triology and I grew up with the Star Wars figures, played the role playing game and couldn't wait until the new Star Wars movie came out.  I'll admit, I was disappointed by the movie mainly because of the cutesie things that were put in.  However, the lightsaber battle at the end of the movie more than made up for Jar Jar Binks.  It was cool to see actual Jedis practice their craft.  It was also cool to see the little boy that would eventually become Vader.<br />The DVD itself and the extras are pretty well done as well.  I never noticed before that they use different scenes each time you put the movie in.
0316666343|3.0|This book was lovely and haunting. It details a child's journey from life to afterlife while she watches the effects of her murder on the people that she loves. It gives people a new way of thinking about letting go of those that we have lost.<br />I give this one 3 stars because of the ending. After reading some of the horrors of the book I was disappointed by the ending (I don't want to give too many away here). Worth a read.
0312265859|5.0|As a long time Janet Evanovich/Stephanie Plum avid fan/reader I was eagerly awaiting this eighth book in the series. I literally started reading and didn't stop until I was finished with the whole book. What I find enthralling about J. Evanovich's writing is that after 8 books I still want more and found this particular book to be even more entertaining than the last few in the series (and the last few books were GOOD!) All our favorite characters are here from Lula, Ranger, Morelli and Bob the dog to Grandma Mazur. There's further development in this book that enhanced several of the characters (remember, I never spoil a plot) along with a few new colorful characters in Ms. Evanovich's creative literary style.
0385335482|5.0|It's rare that I'll laugh out loud while reading on public transportation, but Sophie Kinsella's Becky Bloomwood is so darn funny, I just couldn't control myself. Her attitudes about shopping are so easy to identify with -- especially if you're an urban career girl! I immediately bought Shopoholic Takes Manhattan, the second book, and managed to borrow a galley of the upcoming Shopoholic Ties The Knot from a fellow editor. I hope Kinsella writes many more Becky Bloomwood tales, because I'll be the first in line to buy them!
B00006JDVV|2.0|Almost every sci-fi thriller asks us to suspend disbelief. It does so because we usually have no true frame of reference in reality. For example, we can choose to believe that mankind will travel to distant galaxies in the future; however, the how, why and when of this possibility is mere speculation. In the best of sci-fi, the story takes precedent over our questions about how the events could really happen. We gloss over the technical improbabilities because they are inconsequential to a tale well told. In a bad sci-fi thriller like \\"Reign of Fire\\", a weak story causes us to take note of how ludicrous and impossible the whole movie is. Case in point: There is a scene in this movie where a band of people, who have somehow survived civilization's annihilation by a plague of fire-breathing, flying dragons, celebrate the killing of one of the creatures. Suddenly, giant spotlights come on atop the forlorn castle they live in. How can this be possible when presumably all the power companies have been destroyed? And where on earth do they get the fuel to power their tanks, helicopters and other vehicles? No attempts to explain these or any other questions are made. We are simply expected to believe. Problem is, we don't. <br />All of the nonsense takes place in the not-so-distant future. A crew excavating for a new subway line in London digs into a buried lair of dragons. The things escape and begin to multiply and to destroy everything in sight. In just a few years, they've burned up almost everything and everyone. As you might expect, it's finally up to a small group of survivors to save the world. <br />The dragons are skillfully rendered and rather impressive. By the time we get to their nest in the ruins of London, though, we don't much care. <br />\\"Reign of Fire\\" stars Matthew McConaughey and Christian Bale, two fine actors who must have taken their roles for the paychecks.
B00006RU5B|4.0|When I first heard that Chriss Cornell and the band from Rage Against the Machine were combing forces to create a new band, I was extremely excited. I'm a big fan of both soundagrden and rage against the machine so it seemed that the combination would just as good if not better. Finally, after a long wait, audioslave comes out with their debut CD. The album is definetely strong with songs like cochise, show me how to live, and bring em back alive. You do hear that rage against the machine heard rock sound mixed in with chris cornell's screaming vocals. However the combination is not as good as one would expect. From Rage's sound, it seems as though you would hear a political diatribe which you don't and from Cornell's screaming, you expect to hear soundgarden which you don't. In a way you do expect more from the band. Overall, this would be a great album if you didn't know who the members were. However, since the marketing people went crazy telling you the members were and people had certain expectations, the album just doesn't sound as good as it should.
0802130208|5.0|I am so depressed now, after reading Confederacy of Dunces, I wish there were ten more novels telling about the life and adventures of Ignatius. Absolutely one of the best stories I have read in a while, I only hope the hollywood interpretaion does it justice.... in the world-view of Ignatius.
B00005JKDR|5.0|In Toy Story, we had toys coming to life, now we learn that there really are monsters lurking in kids' closets. Every aspect of this production, from the story, the animation, the effects, the voice actors, the music and sound design, is well executed and it all fits together wonderfully. The final breathtaking and hilarious set piece in the door vault must be seen to be believed. My favorite bit of casting is Steve Buscemi as the lizard-like Randall, and using a real child to portray &quot;Boo&quot;, which lends more credibility to her character.<br />Disc 2 is a feast for those who love behind the scenes features. Pixar's funky offices, their pet monkey, and the executives riding around the halls on scooters make it look like a fun place to work.  Unlike many DVD extras, you get a genuinely informative crash course in how these films are made, as well as fun frivolity to explore, the most obscure being a playbill for Mike's company play and an orientation to Monsters, Inc for new employees.
B00005JKL8|1.0|Saw it in the theatre... Well. The kindest thing I can say about it, is that I saw it with someone who speaks a couple foreign languages. He said the translations were really well done.<br />Other than that, it strains credability to the breaking point and then goes charging enthusiasticaly over the edge. But maybe I wasn't in the mood for it.<br />It's supposed to be based on a true story. Sort of. Loosely. There was one scene... the most greusome scene in the movie, I won't say what because it's self evident... It was the only thing about the movie I believed and the only portion I liked.<br />The hero is a blonde, stong-jawed mid-western American; he recklessly gets himself into trouble and is eventually saved by his hard-charging tough superior officer. The foreigners are suspicious, or helpless. It's very simplistic. But if you're looking for a patriotic film, this is it.
B00005OAA6|5.0|After reading all the great reviews (and some down right rotten!), I decided to purchase the album! And I have to say - It Is A Great Album!<br />The album is a perfect blend of R&B and pop and is so underrated! Some of the tracks on this CD, J.Lo would love to get her hands on!<br />The album starts out on a low point - NOT SUCH AN INNOCENT GIRL - is a tired `been done before' pop song, the lyrics are witty and her vocals are really good, especially the high notes, plus she does all the backing vocals on this single. But the production is a bit messy. (6 / 10)<br />A MIND OF ITS OWN - this is a bit better, a track which is quite original, with its talked parts and harmonies. This shouldn't have been a single, but its quite good anyway. (7 / 10)<br />THAT KIND OF GIRL - Getting better! This track is very chilled out, and her vocals really shine on this song. Very R&B and could have been a single. (9 / 10)<br />LIKE THAT - This song is massive! It's starts out as a Sisqo-type song with an orchestra, and then a shuffling urban beat kicks in. Vic's vocals are relaxed in the verses and the bridge is catchy then she bursts out in an attitude packed chorus! This could have been a huge worldwide hit! (9.5 / 10) <br />GIRLFRIEND - Another wicked R&B song, similar to an old Pink song with its opera feel and hard beats, the song goes into garage towards the end, pure class! (10 / 10)<br />MIDNIGHT FANTASY - An OK song, a bit tacky, a bit too poppy, but a nice garage feel and very seductive vocals, this could be a Kylie Minogue song, but Victoria does it better. Not a fave. (7 / 10)<br />I.O.U - A nice balled, with an R&B beat. Nice vocals and very heartfelt, could have been a single. (8 / 10)<br />NO TRIX, NO GAMES - Produced by Christina Aguilera's producers, very cool track and trancy-like vocals from Vic, could be a single. Good pop & R&B song.<BR>(8 / 10)<br />I WISH - THE BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM! Very R&B with hard beats, the most hardest, edgiest song by any Spice Girl.Produced by Soulshock & Karlin (Whitney, Toni, Destiny's Child, Usher), this song was made for Victoria to sing. This was supposed to be the 3rd single off the album, WHAT A BIG MISTAKE VIRGIN MADE! This would have blown J.Lo outta the water! (10 / 10)<br />WATCHA TALKIN' `BOUT? - Another Soulshock & Karlin song, all about Geri Halliwell. Very relaxed R&B number with very soulful vocals (she shines the most on this song) and it has the best intro ever! (9.5 / 10)<br />UNCONDITIONAL LOVE - Produced by Rhett Lawrence (Mel C's never be the same again), a wonderful tear-jerking song, very dramatic and sweet! (8 / 10)<br />EVERY PART OF ME - Very sweet, nice melody, with Dr Dre style hard beats! Victoria is the best singer outta the Spice Girls at this point! Her singing is simply FANTASTIC! (8.5 / 10)<br />Overall a very, very entertaining album. Victoria has a very rich voice, better than Kylie's (what's so good about her anyway??) If Vic has all the right breaks she will be a huge solo star!!! <br />Great news! Victoria has signed a new record deal with Telstar Records, home of Craig David, Mis-Teeq & BB Mak! Hopefully she will have huge success! All the best Vic, u deserve it!
B00005ASHM|5.0|When I first became interested in The Beach Boys I knew I had to make Pet Sounds the first CD of theirs I bought after all the hype. I knew Wouldn't It Be Nice and God Only Knows were great but I wasn't sure what to expect from the rest. What I discovered was an album of songs that express honest feelings of love , angst , and youthful introspection. In my opinion this work as a whole beats anything by The Beatles , The Stones , Dylan , The Who , Spector , Motown , etc. it is a true masterpiece. Brian put his heart on the line with Pet Sounds , and the love really comes through from the CD player to the listener. A lot of people love this album but dislike other Beach Boys works , I admit some of there stuff is hard to digest for someone who's not a big fan, but there are several other things they put out worth giving a try. I recommend anyone who has a remote interest try out the two-albums-on-one-disc packages of Sunflower/Surf's Up and Today / Summer Days {and Summer Nights}, you won't be dissapointed.
0553573403|5.0|It's a good book! Make no mistake: It's long. Mr. Martin is telling truly EPIC fantasy here. It has a large cast of characters, a far-ranging domain, an extensive backstory, and lots of politics. Martin's rotating point of view works well, particularly when you see several sides of the same events. Some of the stories of charactres are mainly to illuminate other characters. Ned's daughter Sansa is one for sure. Other characters stories are rivetting, compelling, and moving. The story of Jon Snow. The story of Tyrion Lannister. The story of Eddard Stark.
B00005OM4N|5.0|This cd was great. It has lots of songs to listen to and great to dance to. Some were slow and some were fast. In this cd Britney doesn't sing through her nose anymore, which is a good thing. There is one bad thing though. The cover doesn't look that great, but it still has great music. I loved it. Britney even wrote some of the songs. Justin Timberlake sang the last song with Britney, \\"What it's like to be me.\\" The first song \\"I'm a slave 4 u\\" is great. It has a great beat to dance to and Britney is saying that she wants to do her own thing. The second song, \\"Overprotected\\" is saying also that she isn't a little girl anymore and she doesn't want to be overprotected. Also that song has a great beat to dance to. The fourth song \\"I'm not a girl, not yet a woman\\" is a slow song and is great to sing along with. It is saying exactlly what the title is called, she is not a girl, but also not a woman yet. The fifth song is called \\"boys.\\" That has a great beat and is fun to dance to also. Most of the songs are great to dance to and the whole cd is just great and cool. Once again i'll have to say that it is a great cd and the songs are great to listen to.
6304493681|5.0|This and Princess Mononoke are by far my favorite Anime movies.  The first time I watched this I didn't really understand it.  The point of the movie didn't come to me until a few sessions later and now I love it.  The question of being, of the soul, leaves me dumb every time I watch it.  Anyhow, the movie is brilliant.  The DVD isn't half bad, either.  The English 5.1 is very good.  This movie was made for an English release also, so I don't mind watching it in English as the English voice overs are very good.  Japanese 5.1 would be nice, but I have always liked the English version so I guess that can slide.  What is deffinitely nice is the true aspect ratio of 1.85:1 that it is presented in.  Gotta see what they wanted you to see.  Now please, for everyone in the world who is naive, 1.85:1 is NOT animorphic widescreen, it's just plain widescreen.  Movies that are 2.35:1 are animorphic.  This has to do with the lense used in a movie theater with film.  Anyhow, I know this because I projected.  So you at Widescreen Review, please get it right.  1.85:1 is Flat, 2.35:1 or even 2.40:1 is Scope.  Back to the point, this DVD is worth every penny.
0060977493|3.0|As Arundhati Roy has stated in an interview, after being asked about how her work compares to Salman Rushdies, there is no monolithic India.  There are many languages and cultures, not to mention a billion people and all their stories making up modern India.  In The God of Small Things Roy, trained as an architect, invents her own language, carves out her own interpretation, her own story which, through an almost miraculous fillip of ambition, a paradox, becomes \\"the\\" story.  Using made-up words like \\"Lay Ter,\\" poetry, childlike logic, throwing in details such as \\"fresh cow dung with small flowers,\\"  behaviors such as twin Rahels wonderfully exploratory and confused but unladylike breast-banging into senior girls,  and erotically precocious or (from an adult point of view) anachronistic encounters such as what the \\"the Orangedrink Lemondrink Man did to Estha in Abhilash Talkies...And these are only the small things,\\" Roy inventively plays like a charmed, verbally gifted child, detailing the story of two twinsa random story which her authorial gifts turn into our story.  Medical science now tells us that most people have an intrauterine twin which dies prior to birth, being reabsorbed into the womb; linguists and \\"parapsychologists\\" tell us about the special language and mental affinities of twins.  It is as if in The God of Small Things Roy features the details from which reality is made, details beyond language or details which are usually swamped by language, in creating her own twin languageone which it is her special grace to share with us.
6305014140|4.0|Ninja Scroll is great, no doubt about it.  I would love to give this DVD 5 stars, but they screwed up.  The 1:33 to 1 ratio murders this DVD as I buy DVD primarily for a movie's true aspect ratio.  I want the full picture.  Also, the English 5.1 soundtrack is very nice, where's the Japanese 5.1?  I prefer watching Japanese movies in Japanese, I don't mind subtitles at all but I really enjoy 5.1 (I didn't spend all that money on a nice system for nothing.)  Anyhow, other than the better picture quality and the English 5.1, there's not too much difference between the DVD version and the VHS version.  The movie itself gets 5 stars, the DVD gets 3, we'll average it to 4 stars.  My 2 cents.
B00000I8NC|2.0|maybe i'm cynical, but this disk tries a little too hard to be gut wrenchingly powerful. it starts off nice enough.. some violins and other strings slowly generating a medative tension. then it builds and builds... 10 minutes later.. still building.. wow, this is really powerful (yawn). for godspeed, build-up is their claim to fame, but they don't really do it that well. it feels cheap and forced.. a sloppy drummer who breaks into annoying marching snare drum-rolls at random adds to the cheapness. if people want to hear really well executed build-ups they would do well to check out glen branca, or swans' last studio album. <br />the 2 stars given here are for the sampled voice that graces the middle of the album.. this is masterful. the build-up finally ends, and the strings play around generating a nice ambient backdrop while a \\"field interview\\" of some weirdo discussing his views on the present state of the american government plays in the back/foreground. how well you can hear what is being said depends on what the violins are doing. <br />then all of a sudden it kicks back in to that 'bring you to your knees coz this is so unspeakably beautiful and powerful' thing, and again, it's done with minimal skill. the strings are really well played, but they way it's orchestrated is terribly half-assed. really just thrown together. what makes it particularily irritating is they operate under the pretense of being really emotionally moving, and they're really just very overlydramatic. maybe they should hire glen branca to orchestrate their future works.. or even my 7th grade band teacher for christ's sake.
B000063V8T|5.0|Best one so far, I'm getting them all. Can't wait for more.
0385312083|3.0|Although Slaughterhouse-Five was somewhat graphic, it was well written.  Throughout the story, three different time periods were going on all at one time, but the story still flowed well.  You were able to get inside the mind of the author, which was not a place I would like to be very long.  The book was different than any I've ever read, but we all need variety on our bookshelves, don't we?
B00003CX5P|4.0|i admit that the way Lucas did the Star Wars thing was kinda goofy...i mean whole episode 4-6 first and 1-3 last.....but everyones whining about it soooooo much, its not that big of a deal...and no it does not make the movies predictable...it just sorta makes sure you wont get confused....anyways about Episode 1...i thought the plot didnt go right...plot went to fast during the whole thing....but i did LOVE the saber duel between Maul and the 2 jedi...best saber fight scene ever!!...only reason i give it 4/5 stars
B000056VIY|5.0|I think that the J-Lo cd is a must have for any person who is into R &amp; B music, latin, or pop. It combines all 3 and makes the album really hot. Some of the songs like &quot;My love don't cost a thing&quot; and &quot;Play&quot;, and  are good but since you hear them on the radio all the time they get boring and arent the real reason you should buy the CD. The real reasons you should buy the CD are the songs that are toward the end of the Cd like &quot;That's not me&quot;, &quot;Dance with me&quot;, &quot;I'm gonna be alright&quot;, and &quot;That's the way&quot;. They have good catchy lyrics with a R&amp;B flair with some hip hop mixed into it that makes it sound really good. The choruses on the song are the best part, they sound really good with the beats and the music and her singing makes it all tie in. There are parts on the songs that are sorta like a chorus but they arent that sound really good and it makes you just want to keep rewinding the part and listen to it again and again. The other parts of the CD that are cool are the latin songs like &quot;Carino&quot;, &quot;Dame&quot;, and &quot;Si Ya Se Acabo&quot;. They sound really good with the latin instruments and music playing and even if you can't speak spanish they still sound good. Honestly they sound better if you can't speak spanish. Well anyways I just want to summarize this up by saying.......BUY IT!!

B000063DHK|1.0|I was a BIG Maiden's fan until I heard that album!<BR>I first got it on double LP when it first came out and believe me I was expecting this album to be the new MADE IN JAPAN or UNLEASHED IN THE EAST...A great LIVE album recorded by one of the greatest bands.<BR>What a mess!There's not a single song on this album that sounds even sightly as good as the studio version.The sound is way to clear and crisp...it sounds DEAD and clinical.<BR>Bruce Dickinson might be a wonderful showman, but he sure is a bad singer on stage, he's so monotone,it's sounds like he's singing on one note, one  looooooooooooonng note through the entire album.It is even worse when he takes over the old tracks-wrathchild, running free,phantom of the opera.<BR>It really took awhile to like Maiden again after this one.<BR>I prefer to forget that album and concentrate on their studio recordings.<BR>MAIDEN is a great band in the studio and when you assist at one of their shows but their live performances don't fit the Lp or Cd format.
B00003CXCW|5.0|At last this is on DVD. And it was worth the wait. Billy Wilders' legendary classic looks great and the extras are plentiful and entertaining. The story of Norma Desmond is not exactly satire and not black comedy as some whimsically rave. &quot;Sunset Blvd.&quot; is a tragic and macabre Hollywood horror story that as filmed holds the viewer in a creepy kind of thrall from the famous opening to the bizarre finale. Gloria Swanson is awesome as Norma, the one-time star now reduced to a forgotten shadow by the industry that made her...eternally waiting for her big return to the screen. As Joe Gillis, the down-on-his-luck writer seeking refuge from the repo men, William Holden is perfect as both the living Joe and the corpse/narrator. Joe enters Normas' sad and delusional world with a marked cynicism for her past glory but soon comes to realize how deeply disturbed and tormented she really is. Erich von Stroheim as Max the butler/chauffer/enabler reveals the truth to Joe who now realizes he's in over his head. He has become her kept lover and another enabler for her demented fantasies. When he finally decides to break free and return to his hometown sadder but infinitely wiser, he becomes a Hollywood legend of another kind---a corpse floating face down in a has-been movie stars' swimming pool. There has never been a movie quite like &quot;Sunset Blvd.&quot;.  The actors match the trenchant script line for line with every nuance and detail beautifully captured in gloomy b&amp;w. Normas' crumbling mansion is her own Egyptian tomb encasing her for eternity---suitable for a once powerful queen. And as Gillis' voice ironically points out, Norma does return to the cameras. But as a tragic curio for a sensation hungry public. This is Hollywood filmmaking at its' finest, as if the money men chose to leave it alone without interference so that the ultimate punch retains its' potentcy: the great Norma Desmond was waiting for her &quot;return&quot; to the cameras and poor Joe Gillis always wanted a swimming pool. That's Hollywood.

6304913176|5.0|\\"Starship Troopers,\\" directed by Paul Verhoeven, is based on the novel of the same title by Robert Heinlein. While the film differs to a significant degree from the book, I find Verhoeven's version to be a thoroughly exciting and enjoyable piece of science fiction adventure.<br />\\"Troopers\\" takes place in a future in which humanity is waging an interplanetary war against an extraterrestrial collective of insectoid creatures. The film focuses on the personal journey of Johnny Rico (played by Casper Van Dien). We follow him from high school graduation to enlistment in the space infantry to combat against Earth's alien enemies. So \\"Troopers\\" is as much coming-of-age film as sci-fi adventure.<br />\\"Troopers\\" works well as a straightforward sci-fi adventure, but the filmmakers have also woven a lot of satirical material into the film. The result is a film with an odd vibe: should we be more fearful of the \\"bug\\" aliens or of Earth's own government? Incorporated into the story are bits of futuristic newscasts and propaganda.<br />Van Dien and the superb supporting cast play their roles with sincerity and enthusiasm, so regardless of the film's satiric thrust, the viewers wind up with heroes whom we can really cheer for. There is a great chemistry among the youthful ensemble of troopers, and tough guy Michael Ironside has a fine role as an older mentor figure.<br />The special effects and action sequences are top notch; the filmmakers have shown an amazing attention to detail in realizing this future world. The insectoid aliens, who come in a variety of forms, are very impressive. The whole thing is presented with great visual flair, and is superbly complemented by Basil Poledouris' thrillingly bombastic musical score. And while the outrageous gore and violence of some sequences may be too much for some viewers, I found this material to be well integrated into the overall cinematic vision. \\"Starship Troopers\\" is a sci-fi epic that definitely packs a punch.
0140186409|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this classic.  This book was a brilliant analysis of social society and it really makes me feel sorry for the immigrants. I especially liked how Steinbeck made the novel as gloomy as possible to prove his point. The vivid images of this great book showed a farming family forced to move out for a better chance at life, and then fail at the end.  It makes you feel as if you are really there. The Great Depression was a cruel, foolish discriminating event on the innocent Americans. It was also very difficult to see proud Americans being significantly reduced to nothing at all. It leaves you hanging, lets you decide what will happen. It is really a wonderful book.
0451457994|4.0|2001: A Space Odyssey is the quintessential science fiction book, filled with both inspired visions of the future and startling philosophical questions about humanity's place in the cosmos.  <br />At the core of the novel is humanity's connection with an alien intelligence.  The novel begins with primordial man encountering an alien intelligence--an encounter that would forever change human history.  Several thousand years later, evidence of this alien intelligence (a black monolith) is discovered on the moon.  The monolith, and its mysterious radio signal directed towards Saturn, compels mankind to initiate an interplanetary journey to the distant planet to uncover the monolith's origins and meanings.  Unbeknownst to the human crew, only the ship's onboard computer (the HAL 9000) has full knowledge of the journey's actual mission.  The final parts of the novel pit the human crew against the &quot;self-aware&quot; HAL 9000 computer.  In a stunning conclusion, the true meaning of the monolith and man's connection to it are both exposed.<br />This is a fascinating book that reads surprisingly quickly.  Clarke is masterful in his details and paints vivid pictures for the reader throughout the novel.  Beyond the interesting and provocative story-line, 2001 constantly asks the reader to think deeply and philosophically about humanity's place in the universe.  Clarke beautifully captures the scientific and intellectual spirit that has driven humanity throughout the ages (from primordial man to intergalactic man).  <br />Most people are more familiar with the Stanley Kubrick movie &quot;2001&quot; than with this novel (the novel and screenplay were written at the same time).  A careful reading of this book (preferably before seeing the movie) provides invaluable insight into what many perceive as a perplexing and convoluted movie.  The novel more clearly explains and connects the plotlines and allows you to more fully appreciate the cinematic masterpiece that 2001 is.<br />This is a great book for anyone interested in science, science fiction, futurism or related subjects.  I do believe that the book does hold valuable meaning for general readers as well because of its philosophical roots and because of its place in the annals of science fiction greatness.  And for all those people who are confused by the movie, pick this up and read it--it will be sure to shed some light on the subject.
B00006RU5B|5.0|In the day where Justin Timberlake dominates the charts, we need a good ROCK band.  Thats where these guys come in.  RATM was awesome but were only part rock.  Soundgarden was sweet but they have broken up.  Putting this together gives you 14 tracks that make up an ALBUM.  thats right, not CD, album.  Lets look at which rock bands are dominate on MTV...Nickelback...The Calling...Sum 41....these are hardly rock.  AudioSlave is rock.  Good riffs, good vocals, awesome rhythm section and plenty of crunch.  I downloaded like 3 of the songs and decided to go out and buy the cd.  Wise investment.  These guys have potential to be the next big ROCK band.  Let's see how the next 2 or 3 albums do...ROCK ON!
B00003CXA2|5.0|forrest gump is a triumph of the human spirit. it shows you that even if you are different, you can still lead an eventful, courageous, and happy life.  it is not an over rated movie in the slightest! tom hanks does an almost flawless job playing forrest, a mentally retarded man who is trying to lead a normal life.  robin wright penn is magnificent as jenny, forrest's child hood friend turned hippie.  a wonderfu movie overall-i highly recomend it.

0440237688|4.0|The Giver is a thought provoking book.  The community is controlled by a group of elders who believe they are protecting the people of their community.  The people in the community experience a life without pain and little emotion and no memories of the past.  This is seemingly a wonderful life except it is a life controlled by a committee.   <br />There is however, one individual the Giver, who carries the burden of all memory, emotions and suffering for the community.  He is like Jesus who died on the cross and took all of our sins with Him except the Giver is not perfect. Therefore, every number of years a new child is picked by the committee to be the receiver of all the pain, memories and emotion.  The current giver passes this on to the new giver and so the community continues until one receiver no longer plays by the rules of the community.  <br />The burden of being the reciever is great and they bare much pain during this time.  I like how Jonas became the receiver and took up all the memories and realized all that is wrong about the community.  I dislike that there is no lovingness between the members of the community.  They have no pain but the also lack any real passion or love.  It made me appreciate that although life can be difficult (there is real good and real bad), these two conflicting emotions are what bring vitality to life.

B000002BFZ|5.0|I don't know why this record did not do as well as its predecessors.  It is a great piece of rock music.  Maybe it wasn't marketed as well or something?  There is easily some of Pearl Jam's best work on this record.  And, of course, there is some strange stuff.  But hey, it wouldn't really be Pearl Jam without some mild craziness, now would it?<br />This album is a major step in the evolution of Pearl Jam.   There is a feel to this record that was not in the previous works by Eddie Vedder and the boys.  There is a calmness.  Not to say that there it contains no rock, but not plagued with era-related, stereotypical rock anthems.  There is a feel of classic rock and maybe even some blues.  <br />The first single \\"Who You Are\\" is very cool.  It has this rolling drum beat and an almost Arabic sounding guitar (Eddie denies completely that the song was influenced by the time he spent with, now sadly deceased, Pakistani singer Nusrat Fatah Ali Khan, while working on the soundtrack of \\"Dead Man  Walking.\\" Eddie says that the song was, in fact, built around an old Jack Irons drum beat)<br />There are no real radio gems on this record.  \\"Who You Are\\" was on the radio for a little while. \\"Hail, Hail\\" also spent some time traveling the radio waves.  I was rather surprised that \\"Off He Goes\\" did not find its way onto the radio some how.   It was an absolutely beautiful song and probably in my top 5 of all Pearl Jam.  I really like \\"Present Tense.\\"  The words are nothing but captivating.  The song \\"I'm Open\\" is a little bit of beat poetry.  It is rather good.  Without naming everything on the record, I think it is all very well done.  <br />This record gets better and better with age, as I have had it for just over 6 years.  The album art is great, the CD comes with \\"Polaroids\\" with the lyrics on the back.  The vinyl comes with the same \\"Polaroids\\" but they are the size of an album.  The vinyls pictures are much easier to make out and the sound is superior.  Though it is a greatCD, if you have the chance, find the vinyl, it is well worth the premium.  There is a lot to the record and it is a great addition to any rock CD collection.<br />epc
6305546797|5.0|Doesn't matter wich version you buy, it still scares the .... out of you! This is not the scariest movie ever made, but it is one of the scariest movies ever made. Scarier than Psycho, but not scarier than The Shining or The Exorcist. The Exorcist is based on a true story, The Shining could happen (especially if you're an achoholic) and Halloween is  scary because it is so real. This is one that every horror fan should own. Contrary to popular belief, Friday the 13th didn't rip this off. The first 3 didn't, but the rest did. While Michael Myers pales in comparison with Jason Voorhees, he is a heck of a lot scarier, and has a much scarier movie. Jason is probably the most notorious serial killer of all, Leatherface (Scariest Slasher Villian) is the sickest, Freddy is definately the smartest, but Michael is the most unpredictable of all of them. You don't know if he's gonna kill you or not. This is definately one of the scariest movies ever made, and I would recommed this to everybody. Watch it alone in the dark!!!
0792101448|5.0|This is probably my favorite western, and I think it ranks with the greatest westerns of all time.<br />I heard the sequel, \\"Once Upon a Time in the East,\\" about a lost samurai warrior trying to find his home clan, didn't do nearly as well, despite the narration by James Clavell.
B000002G7E|5.0|This is the first Velvet Underground album I have ever heard.  I got into the VU through the Royal Tenenbaums soundtrack (Stephanie Says) and from there I downloaded Heroin and loved it, so I figured I'd give this a try.  Man did I get a surprise!  This was NOTHING like the Underground that I had heard!  This is true in your face music.  <br />White Light, the opener, starts out immediately upon pressing play.  I had the volume up high and it actually made me jump!  It reminds me a bit of classic 50's rock 'n roll with the backup singers and everything, but it is definitely a good song.  Next up is Gift, which is Lou reciting some long story over the music, and for a newcomer to VU such as myself, I don't like it at all and I confess I skip it every time.  Lady Godiva is ok, but nothing special.  The last three songs (Here She Comes, I Heard Her Call My Name, and Sister Ray) are what makes the album worth the purchasing price.  They are like one long song almost, since they all run together so well.  The best of the best in my opinion is Sister Ray.  Sister Ray can best be described as a 17 minute distortion/feedback frenzy!  Behind and in between the feedback is a driving beat though, and some amusing lyrics from Lou Reed which you will find yourself singing along to in all the wrong places.  <br />This is not the album to get if you are new to VU.  It is nothing like their well-known songs and will most likely do more harm than good if you buy it first.  I seem to be the exception to that rule, but to be safe I'd recommend the debut album Velvet Underground and Nico.  This is an album you should come to only after having safely got a foot into the Underground and are looking to jump in all the way.  And if you aren't new to them, what are you waiting for?  You call yourself a fan?  Buy this now, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.

B00006RU5B|5.0|BEING A BIG SOUNDGARDEN FAN, AND AN EVEN BIGGER RAGE FAN, I HAD HUGE EXPECTATIONS FOR THIS ALBUM. I WAS NOT READY FOR WHAT WOULD BE ONE OF THE GREATEST ALBUMS I HAVE EVER HEARD. <br />COCHISE(4/5)- the perfect opener and first single. classic riff from morello, one of the hardest songs on the album<BR>SHOW ME HOW TO LIVE(4.5/5) - opening to this song sounds a lot like soundgarden, but then converts into full out rage with amazing chorus and the perfect cornell touch, he's an amazing vocalist<br />GASOLINE(4/5) - another rockin song with awesome guitar effects during verse and so so chorus<BR>WHAT YOU ARE(5/5) - the first to a string of classic songs. this one left me speechless. a soft, cornell-dominated verse leads into a kick  chorus with another great guitar riff, almost soundgarden-like.<BR>LIKE A STONE(5/5) - not for hardrockers, this is a soft one, almost a love song. cornell shines on this one, along with rolling bass line that gave me chills<BR>SET IT OFF(waymorethanfreakin'5/5) - the best hard song on the album. great guitar effects intro leads one of the best riffs i have EVER freakin heard, morello's a genius. turn this one way up, smash something and then jump on it, that's what this one will do to you<BR>SHADOW OF THE SUN(4.5/5) - a dark song that rocks when it wants to. being a drummer, i loved the drums on this one. one drawback is it drags on a little too long.<BR>I AM THE HIGHWAY(5/5) - another soft one, chorus gets stuck in your head, a groovin' tune.<br />EXPLODER(morethan5/5) - comes close to set it off but not quite. great vocals from cornell, and even better guitar and bass from the boys. warning: will get stuck in your head (dah-um dah-dah-dah dah-um dah-dah-dah)<BR>HYPNOTIZE(3.9/5) - weak point on the album, almost reminds me of techno, but thankfully not quite. it does get quite addictive, though, and has cool solo. still good enough to listen through. <BR>BRING EM BACK ALIVE(4/5) - this one just plain out rocks, some kind of vocal effects for cornell that give nice touch during verse, chorus pretty much filled with screams.<BR>LIGHT MY WAY(4/5) - a great song that rocks despite awkward vocals from cornell during hard parts, guitar and bass dominates this song<BR>GETAWAY CAR(waywaymorethanfreakin'5/5) - the best song on the album and clearly the best soft song on the album. first off, this is the BEST CHORUS EVER. cornell brings his best vocals and lyrics to this one. subtle guitar parts give perfect compliments to cornell. morello's solo reminds of frusciante from the chili peppers, which is awesome. <BR>THE LAST REMAINING LIGHT(5/5) - great closer to the album. haunting vocals and guitar at beginning slowly build up to amazing semi-hardrocking chorus that leaves lasting effect of cornell's voice in your head along with morello's out of this world guitar playing<br />OVERALL, THIS IS ONE OF THOSE FEW ALBUMS THAT YOU CAN LISTEN THROUGH WITHOUT SKIPPING OVER ONE SONG, WITH SOME BEING TOO GOOD TO EVEN RATE. CHRIS CORNELL IS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE BEST VOCALIST OUT THERE TODAY. TOM MORELLO IS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE BEST GUITARIST OF THIS GENERATION. THIS ALBUM MAKES YOU FORGET ABOUT WHAT'S HIS NAME FROM RAGE AND THOSE OTHER GUYS FROM SOUNDGARDEN.
B000000Y87|5.0|These recordings from the June 25, 1961, sets at the Village Vanguard have become legendary both because they solidified Bill Evans' stature as a paramount improvisor in jazz and because Scott LaFaro's bass playing moved the instrument up a quantum level. LaFaro entered the company of Jimmy Blanton and Charles Mingus with these recordings. Evans and LaFaro complement one another the way that Ellington and Blanton fed each other years earlier. The solo in take 3 of LaFaro's composition \\"Gloria's Step\\" the second track on this disc expands the boundaries of bass playing. In Gershwin's \\"My Man's Gone Now\\" Evans explores at great length all the minor and modal possibilities of the melody leading to another extravagant LaFaro solo. Evans continues excursions in modal improvisation in Miles Davis' \\"Solar\\" with LaFaro and Paul Motian supporting. Spurred by Motian's brushwork, LaFaro's extended solo proceeds at breakneck speed. Evans' \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is nothing like the cartoon theme--he swings the simple melody, converting it into an improvisational wonderland of his own--a gently lyrical and liquid expose of the song's possibilities--with rich interplay among the trio members. Evans launches Cole Porter's \\"All of You\\" to an etherial sphere with delicate introductory phrases and then turns the song inside out. Led by Evans' robust exposition, the trio swings this ballad with strong solos (listen to LaFaro underpinned by Motian again on these tracks) and ensemble work. Motian's solo is particularly effective, a nice blend of explosion and subtlety. The disc concludes with two versions of LaFaro's \\"Jade Visions,\\" a further virtuoso display of bass technique and improvisation.
1577311523|5.0|The Power of Now is an impressively written very inpiring book.  It resonated so clearly with me that I felt shaken after having read through it.  The new doors that were opened in my awareness, didn't all open to places that felt good or that were comforatable.  Sometimes it was frightning, and sometimes it was painful.  But, the experience, in the end, was cathartic and deeply beneficial.<br />I've been a practicing therapist for many years, and have begun to use Tolles ideas in my practice - with great success.  Although, many that don't have the prior experience with eastern wisdom, or psychological concepts, have a hard time making the leap from theory to practice with The Power of Now alone.  I recommend for all to first read Present Moment Awareness (author: Shannon Duncan), which gives very practical and useable ideas and assignments for the reader to do, that truly set up the appropriete frame of mind to get the most out of what Eckhart is teaching.

B00006LSM3|4.0|This is a lovely album from start to finish. Brainwashed contains all of the sides of George we've come to know and love. Most of the reviews that compare this to a cross between  All Things Must Pass and his Wilburys/Cloud Nine era stuff are on the mark. I haven't seen anyone mention this yet, though...Upon multiple listenings, I have picked up little melody lines here and there throughout a number of the tunes that invoke Beatles tunes. I thought I was \\"hearing things\\" but I went back and heard the melody to For You Blue in one of the tracks, a moment from Within You, Without You in another. I'm not going to name them, but you'll hear what I mean.
B00006IR5S|5.0|John Williams did it again, an excellent score with notable new themes like Fawkes the Phoenix. <BR>Last year with the release of &quot;The Philospher's Stone&quot; we were so lucky to get a CD-rom with trailers, screensavers and stuff, and this year Warner Music did the same for us. But I don't read anything about bonusmaterial on this site. Does Warner USA skip the American listeners again...??
B00005JKDR|5.0|What can I say? This movie is fantastic. <br />Although probably not appropriate for the youngest of viewers, those over age 8 or so will get a kick out of Pixar's newest twist: those monsters in your closet are actually scared of kids!! This movie follows two of the monster world's &quot;Top Scarers&quot; as they try to find a child who has escaped into their world -- without anyone else finding out about it.<br />Billy Crystal and John Goodman are both excellent as Mike and Sully, the main characters. Also, the voice actress for Boo, the little girl, is spectacular. This is the first movie that I have ever seen to use &quot;baby talk&quot; realistically, and also with humor. This movie will give both adults and children something to laugh about.<br />As for features, there are some good featurettes included that explore &quot;The Making Of...&quot;, plus an added scene or two. I wasn't that impressed by the &quot;extras&quot; but the movie itself is DEFINITELY worth it!!
B00006YXEK|5.0|George Harrison, He did it again!  Brainwash is a great, fun CD  to listen too, along with the 7min. Dvd.  My Dad who is 69 even likes it. Since he to is a ukuele and guitar player. Funny he did not like the Beatles at all.     George left us with a Gem, Not a lump of Coal (Brainwash). AS with all Beatles and their solo work album's you can't go wrong by buying it.  Have your kids listen to it so they can know great songwriting and  Artist's. George and The Beatles, were Fab!
B00003CX8Y|5.0|This movie is a must-have for any Disney fan. Origianlly released in the early 1990's, this was one of the first movies to actually use computer generated environments, although all the characters were still hand drawn. The movie captures the classic fairy tale, where the Beast must make someone fall in love with him despite his appearance.<br />Overall, the movie is spectacular. There are 3 different versions included in this set: the Original Theatrical Release, Special Edition, and Commentary. The Special Edition version includes a couple of scenes that were originally cut from the Theatrical Release, and have since been remastered.<br />My only complaint: I'm not sure why each version was included as a whole, instead of having the &quot;Special Edition&quot; version play the original release plus a couple of extra scenes. Same with the commentary: they could have just included the commentary as a separate audio track instead of re-recording the whole movie over again. I get the feeling that Disney included each as a separate &quot;recording&quot; (as you can see by watching the track numbers on your DVD player as you play each version) to fill up a whole disk with this somewhat short movie, and to justify having a second disk for other &quot;extras&quot;. Overall, though, the movie is worth it.
6305531374|4.0|Although part 6 (1996), which got 3 stars deserved 3 and a half, part 7 (H20) is the ultimate. It brings Curtis back to reprise her role. Although part 6 was almost better in a &quot;scary&quot; sense, it had 2 undoubtful flaws. It was too gory and people were killed off too quick. Plus, Michael wasn't as &quot;fun&quot; as he was in the previouse films. The good things that part 6 owns that 7 doesn't is great, long suspense before the big chasing. I think when Kara's son walked into the Myers House and she ran across to the house to save him, that was so scary, and upstairs you can see Michael, stabbing Beth...But H20 has it's betters, like such great acting, including Curtis and Josh Harnett. The gore and bodycount was toned down from part 6's 15 deaths to H2O'S 6 deaths (2 off screen, so 4). H2o definately has a better ending then the previous, it is, however, too short (86 min.) but it was pretty well crammed for it's run time. This is definately a powerful sequel and fans should diss 3, 4, 5 and 6...and just keep 1, 2, H2O and Ressurection in their collection, it will make more sense, seeing that part 7 (h20) and 8 ignore parts 3-6 as if they never were released. Definately a must see on the special edition DVD, H2O is a good sequel and the bonus material and 2.35:1 widescreen transfer is great. See it!
B00006LLNU|5.0|Following their mind-blowing worldwide juggernaut of a record in Agaetis Byrjun, Iceland's Sigur Ros had really no place to go but down. Their second album gained them worldwide acclaim and this record justly was one of the most anticipated of the whole year. '( ),' their major label debut, against all odds, has possibly matched the brilliance of it's predecessor and has expanded the sound of the band into new, even more interesting territories.<br />'Agaetis Byrjun' was filled with bombastic string arrangements that soared and gave the songs real huge dimensions. This record is amazingly different, in a kind of way I personally thought Sigur Ros wouldn't venture. They've stripped down their sound, but at the same time drawn it into a tight  sound that seems just as natural as their previous airy soundscapes. The new compactness relies on the intense percussion of their drummer and then the songs are built off that extremely strong foundation. All the familiar elements of the band are here, but used in new ways. Jonsi's otherworldly androgynous vocals return as does his \\"hopelandish\\" (his own self created language) lyrics, that aren't meant to have any literal meaning, but act as another instrument in the sound. When couple with his guitar playing with a bow, it can't be beat.<br />The record comes with no real title, just usually referred to by the apostrophe shaped cut outs on the albums slip cover. The songs, averaging about 9 minutes, are also untitled. Critics will like to rag on these as pretensions, but it couldn't be more untrue. Sigur Ros like to create, as they themselves call it, a fully interactive music. The listener is able to free their  mind of any kind of pre-conceived concept and create their own meanings and lyrics. In fact, the album booklet consists only of blank pages, meant to be used by the individual to write in their own lyrical, or even visual, interpretations.<br />A one word title if any would have been most appropriate because the tracks flow so well into each other it's not worth even trying to find where one ends and another begins. The album's contraction is one of the best parts as first half is much warmer and much of it is piano based (tracks 1 &3) and tender feeling (track 4) ; after a short silence separating the halves, the second proves to be  menacing with aggressive drum beats (track 6)and even some straightforward guitar work that all climax at the end (track 8). The album at it's most brilliant (tracks 1,4, 6, & 8) is nearly unmatched today and at it's worst (track 5) it's inspirational.cks flow so well into each other it's not worth even trying to find where one ends and another begins.

B00006LSM3|5.0|A very sharp. clean, professional sounding album. George's voice is surprisingly strong on most songs and his slide guitar just prime, reminiscent of late Beatles, early 70s period. The instrumental slide Marwa Blues is nothing short of a miracle. Most songs are simple blues structure of the Traveling Wilbury's or Let it Be vein - in fact, P2 Vatican Blues would have been one of the best recordings on LIB. Sure there's a taste of ELO, but Lynne keeps it subdued when compared to Cloud 9. Lynne's been given a hard time in the past when he's heavy handed on the production, but once upon a time, ELO made a very good album or two like Eldorado. The key this time is clarity.<br />It's certainly more of an album about living and reflection than dying. Rising Sun, Never Get Over You, and Brainwashed best reflect those unusual, twisting, interesting melodies and harmonies that characterized George in the past (self-titled 1979 album is full of them - when are they going to re-master the whole catalog??). Any Road, P2 Vatican Blues, Pisces Fish are a conspicuous start. Looking for my Life could be a single and sounds like something off All Things Must Pass. All in all, an extremely consistent recording with high sound quality, which is something that was not ideal on most of Harrison's solo efforts. In a better world, George Martin would have produced those 70s Harrison recordings. After a few listens, Rising Sun may be as good as What is Life or When We Were Fab, and unlike the other albums, a No Dud Zone...probably ranks up with the best of any of the Post-Beatles albums (for whatever that's worth)...certainly far better than Double Fantasy which garnered a lot of sympathy Grammys - this one probably deserves at least a nomination, if not a gold-plated RCA Victor on a block...
0790742780|5.0|This story about a man's life spiraling out of control has inspired a lot of superficial reactions.  But there's a much deeper subtext.  Michael Douglas's D-FENS and Robert Duvall's Prendergast are sympathetic characters at the outset.  Both are \\"victims\\" of very typical, and serious, personal problems in the US - being made useless at work, losing a child, and a general loss of joy and hope.  The two characters are extreme contrasts of each other: D-FENS angrily reacts to his frustrations, while Prendergast sadly resigns himself to his own.<br />By the end, both D-FENS and Prendergast see the fallacy in the way they have lived their lives.  Sadly, for D-FENS, it is too late.  Prendergast takes the opportunity to move in a new direction.<br />D-FENS and Prendergast may as well be two halves of the same personality.  They represent a struggle within all of us when we're faced with serious, and sometimes unsolvable, problems and terrible occurrences in life.  Do we angrily lash out?  Do we sadly accept?  Or is it possible to move on and rebuild our lives?  The movie is groundbreaking in the way it presents these concerns.<br />\\"Falling Down\\" is controversial because D-FENS is a very sympathetic figure who reacts in a violent and somewhat racist way to the frustrations around him.  Some feel that the movie tries to justify D-FENS's behavior - I think they couldn't be any more wrong or superficial.  The film makes it obvious that Douglas's character, through his over-the-top anger, becomes somewhat like the extremist he despises, the owner of the Army-Navy store, and sadly turns himself into the true \\"bad guy\\".
B000002AT6|2.0|Well, for starters it annonyes me a lot that almost every critic here give the product always five stars. I'm not about to preach for that subject, don't be afraid...<br />As a classic music enthuasist and anyother good music lover, I think this soundtrack definetly doesn't deserve five stars. I must say that I haven't watched the movie, but this is a quite a boring and poor music. It's very classic movie soundtrack with almost played only by violins.<br />The composer of this soundtrack didn't got the courage to try and make something special and unique, and the result is in my opinion a very flat, easygoing and poor classical violin music, with not a single characteristics in it.<br />It's not all so bad as might get the expression from this, but it's a very mediorce. And there are much better soundtracks available to buy, like &quot;Braveheart&quot; and it's sequel &quot;More music from Braveheart&quot;.
B0000640VO|1.0|There's something about european films which make me feel more kindly torwards Adam Sandler.. maybe I go from insane hatred for him to just bitter contempt. At least Adam Sandler WANTS to entertain you though. It's not just two hours of artsy, self indulgent fluff. But about Amelie..<br />  It wasn't completly awful. There are a few laughs, but they take to long setting them up and they are too far between for such a long movie. The actress is a sort of pretty, female version of Rowan Atkinson. I think if the movie had concentrated just on her and her life and been much shorter, then I might have enjoyed it. Unfortunatly, the main character is left very lightly developed and most of the other characters are almost less than stereotypes. The director only gives Amelie maybe three expressions and shoves down our throats how waifish and charming she is and how sympathetic and sorry we should feel for her. Halfway through the movie I felt myself wanting an insulin injection. The movie mostly spends time dispensing threadbare lessons about LIFE!, LOVE! and ART! (there were moments in the movie were I could imagine the art house crowd nodding their heads and saying 'so true, so true'). I guess it was more important than developing actual characters. I felt the atmosphere of French kitsch (I guess that's what it was) a little suffocating. I think the American equivalent would be like being stuck in a big parking lot filled with hot pink and aqua blue 57 chevys, each one containing an Elvis and Marily Monroe look alike.<br />  You'd think you could count on a European movie to have a clever or ambivalent or at least deppressing ending, but Amelie can't even do that. The writer can't even think of anything for the two lead characters to say once they do get together- they just skip straight to the sex. And this is supposed to be a romantic movie! How is this man any different than the facelss man Amelie is shown [fornicating with]of the movie?<br />1.49 stars
B00006LSM3|5.0|This is George Harrison's at his best.  Assisted by his son, Dhani, and Jeff Lynne, George Harrison has put together an album of well crafted songs.  The music is beautiful and the lyrics heartfelt.  LOOKING FOR MY LIFE is my favorite but there are many strong tracks on the album.  ANY ROAD and PISCES FISH are two others that are excellent.  STUCK INSIDE A CLOUD is the first single from the album.  George's guitar playing is strong and there are plenty of guitars on the album.  Dhani Harrison and Jeff Lynne provide guitars and vocals. Jim Keltner plays drums on the album. ....  I have heard this album many times and love it more with each listen.

B00005QZWI|5.0|This is one of the best movie soundtracks I have ever listened to.  So many that come out today seem like they just pick songs from whatever bands are popular at the moment.  This soundtrack is one of those rare gems that not only enhances the movie, but stands very well on its own.  You can feel the emotional highs and lows throughout.  The soundtrack is mostly orchestral with some choral elements scattered throughout.  Its varied pace and emotional content (fast, slow, happy, sad, spooky, etc.) keep it interesting.  My one and only complaint is about track 13, &quot;The Bridge of Khazad Dum.&quot;  It is too short!  Or rather they cut it off too soon.  To me it is one of the most emotional parts of the soundtrack/movie, but if you compare it with the movie, they left off a good 30 seconds at the end of that track.  What a shame to lose such a beautiful part.

B00005B58Y|5.0|\\"Milestones\\" is the second album Miles Davis released for Columbia records.  Although it followed the landmark \\"Round About Midnight\\" and came before the classic \\"Kind of Blue,\\" this CD doesn't quite get the recognition it deserves.  But while it remains somewhat overlooked, \\"Milestones\\" is still very much a masterpiece, featuring the incomparable Miles Davis Sextet churning out moments of brilliance on track after track.  The album gets off to a promising start with the fast and furious \\"Dr. Jackie,\\" an upbeat number that moves along quite briskly.  John Coltrane almost steals the show with his impressive sax on \\"Sid's Ahead,\\" and Philly Joe Jones gives some nice drumming on \\"Two Bass Hit,\\" which, again, features Coltrane in fine form.  But they and the other members can't top Miles, who assumes a commanding presence on each track with his trumpet, as shown on the title track, \\"Dr. Jackie\\" and on the disc's closer \\"Straight, No Chaser.\\"  On this, the remastered version, we also have alternative takes of 3 album cuts which are just as good as the versions that made the original LP.  \\"Milestones\\" is a classy record that would help shape Miles' future as one of music's most vital figures.  It's just as important as \\"Kind of Blue,\\" and shouldn't be missed.

0920668372|5.0|This book is one of the top ten children's books of all time.  I give this as a baby shower gift to everyone I know.  I cry myself everytime I read it, and I'm not even a mom yet!  Trust me, this will be mom's favorite, even if it's a little boring for kids who would rather read some of Robert Munsch's more fun fare.  This pictures are good though, and the story has a sort of repetitive chorus, so younger kids may still enjoy it.  A great bedtime story.
B000003S0I|5.0|1973's _Larks' Tongues In Aspic_ is arguably King Crimson's most experimental and \\"progressive\\" out of their classic '73-'74 period. This is also the album where Crimson attempted their first stab at metal. While King Crimson lost enough musicians in their long career to fill up a school classroom, the lineup of Robert Fripp, John Wetton and Bill Bruford seemed to be the finest to many. Robert Fripp (guitar/mellotron), John Wetton (vocals/bass), Bill Bruford (drums), David Cross (violin) and Jamie Muir (percussion) showcase their masterful musicianship here. They gel perfectly together to give us an amalgamation of metal blended with classical, jazz, funk and tribal rhythms to create soundscapes that are fiery, ominous, mysterious, transcendent and spellbinding. Jamie Muir (percussionist for this album only) had the creativity of a madman here, as he used plastic bottles, plates, bowls, chains and all-sorts to create otherworldly percussive acrobatics. Now, onto the tracks:<br /><br />\\"Larks' Tongues In Aspic (Part One)\\"--This is the first of three instrumentals on the disc. This 13 1/2 minute piece features percussive ambience, fiery drumming, slithering violins and explosive proto-industrial metal. Some of the lurking and foreboding violin textures found here possibly foreshadowed what was to be heard on \\"Providence\\" (from _Red_, on which David Cross makes an appearance). John Wetton even misses a (bass) note on here, which not only proves that instrumental wizards are human, but mistakes can make perfect art. It also gives this track a live, natural and improvisational feel.<br /><br />\\"Book Of Saturday\\"--A beautiful ballad. The arrangement is unconventional for a typical ballad, but still melodic and moving. John Wetton's moving vocals combined with Robert Fripp's tasteful noodling and David Cross' soothing violin playing is truly beautiful. I believe there are no drums on this track.<br /><br />\\"Exiles\\"--This track brings reminiscence to \\"Epitath\\" (from _In The Court Of The Crimson King_). Robert Fripp manages to slip a guitar line from the aforementioned track on here as well (the G-F#-G-F#-A melody). A mellow, ethereal and mellotron-laden r&b/symphonic rock track.<br /><br />\\"Easy Money\\"--While featuring menacing lyrics, is mostly an instrumental showcase. Jamie Muir chain-slaps his multitude of percussive instruments with menace, while Robert Fripp noodles away with snaky, scaly and improvisation-like soloing. I call this a strange mix of classic r&b-infused hard rock, with John Wetton's vocals adding slight blues atmospheres.<br /><br />\\"The Talking Drum\\"--An instrumental featuring tribal rhythms galore. This is probably the most straightforward on here in terms of rhythm.<br /><br />\\"Larks' Tongues In Aspic (Part Two)\\"--An arrhythmical funky hard rock instrumental. All the musicians shine here collectively. Complex motifs are layered atop one another, which can challenge even the most cerebrally-inclined (Bill Bruford sounds like he's playing a different track altogether). Near the end, you hear abrasive percussion-bashing from Jamie Muir, which may sound like pure noise to many, but still manages to sound fresh and exciting.<br /><br />It's pretty futile to pick favorites out of King Crimson's catalog, but _Larks' Tongues In Aspic_ (to me) is one of their strongest efforts. If hard rock combined with funk, elements of modern classical and jazz floats your boat, pick this album up.King_).

B00006RU5B|5.0|Audioslave mixes Rage Against the Machine and Chris Cornell from Soundgarden into one of the most powerful groups this decade.  From the opening of Cochise the listener is rewarded with guitar shredding chords coupled with the power howling from Cornell.  This band is the future of rock and roll.  You know when you see songs like exploder and gasoline that the album is going to kick ... and this one does just that.  Fans of both bands need to buy this album.  Rage has finally found a singer and they have learned to play to Cornells voice making this band the best thing since sliced bread.  Morellos guitar solos sprinkled throughout the album keep the ride going, with power bass lines to back him up.  My favorite songs are Gasoline, Set it off, Like a stone, and Bring em back alive.  Buy this album today and get ready for the ride of a lifetime.
0385486804|5.0|Let me just start this off by saying that I am absolutely terrified of the wilderness and this really isn't the sort of thing that I would usually be into. But Krakauer's writing has an odd effect on me... even though I may not be the most outdoorsy type [aside from my backcountry skiing] I am still drawn into reading his books. My point? Anybody can read this... but at times it can almost be a little tearful.<br />The book is about Christopher McCandless, a college graduate from a well off family who decided to give it all up to venture across the country. And he really did give it all up... his family, his beloved car, and his entire savings.<br />Still, Chris finds happiness in his travels... ranging from the heat of Baja California... to farming plains in South Dakota... ultimately to Alaska.<br />This is a wonderful book, it really changed my outlook on some things. I think that Chris was a little weird... a little too idealistic. He was too cocky and made a few mistakes, mistakes which cost him his life. Many call him crazy, but I admire him because his story interests me a lot more than some guy driving a mini van to work at his office job from 9 - 5.<br />I also love Krakauer's style of writing, he provides a great narrative to Chris's story. Sometimes he gets off topic... but I think that gives his book a kind of campfire story effect that I really like.<br />Overall, it is an excellent book, I highly recommend it.

1558908420|4.0|Since the mid-80s almost all movies have depended on various special effects (car crashes, shootouts) and heaping helpings of violence while scripts are geared towards someone with teenage comprehension. Not so here, Cop Land is a drama with the emphasis on personal interaction. This film also suffered from the fact that Stallone has had no career success playing anything other than an action hero. Stallone's character is carefully crafted, he is the nice guy who played by the rules and suffered because of it, with little career success and reduced to longing for an old flame saddled with a dysfuntional husband and a kid. This film makes one think, something very few major films take the risk of doing. Though Stallone gained some weight for his role, he is not fat and, along with the rest of the cast, does a fine job here. Michael Rapaport currently plays a somewhat goofy teacher on TV's &quot;Boston Public.&quot; This is a film the cast members can be proud of in the future, highly recommended.
6305165912|4.0|The Big Lebowski provides further proof (as if it was needed) that the Cohen's are masters of film design and execution. Case in point: the script. At one point, The Dude, completely smashed, comments that \\"Mr. Treehorn treats objects like women\\"-a line that can use multiple going-overs. Other scenes feature a marmot in a bathtub, cameras used in the wholes of a bowling ball, a malfunctioning submachine gun, and no end of vehicular damage.<br />The camera work is equally impressive. From the \\"Gutter Balls\\" dream sequence to the introduction of Jesus, the sex offender, a wistful, surreal quality permeates the film-especially when combined with the music. The gothic chanting and the Latin dance tune both fit their respective scene perfectly.<br />The plot is simple, revolving around The Dude, a bowler whose current major problem is that the rug that tied the room together has been despoiled, and he wants to get it replaced. It's simplicity is effective; it works well. <br />However, it does have one fault. The end of the film sort of leaves many plot threads lying there. The entire film was filled with people asking what had happened to the money, and yet the end of the film makes us wonder the same thing-it's never really established. <br />But that's the only problem. Bottom line: If you're looking for something serious, in Fargo's vein, this isn't quite what you need. On the other hand, if you like a film with crazy camera angles, suitable music, and Saddam Husein passing out bowling shoes, then enjoy.
B00004XQ83|5.0|O' Brother Where Art Thou, introduced me to some great acts in the business.  Tnanks!
B00006SFBD|5.0|Views on this album seem to be somewhat mixed. Lots seem to think this is a step down after Blackwater Park, some that this is a return to form after a relatively weak album. This is only my 2nd Opeth album, with the other being Blackwater Park, and while I feel that this is the better of the 2, both are excellent, and stand well on their own merits.<br />Many reviewers have claimed that this album is less musically complex than Blackwater Park. I don't think I agree with them.  Blackwater Park was probably the denser, more layered album, but Deliverance has greater variety and is more innovative.  BWP didn't really have a terribly great variety within the styles that Opeth utilizes: The Death Metal parts were all fairly similar to all the other Death Metal parts, as were the acoustic folk parts.  And, despite what others will have you believe, the layered, dual guitar parts of BWP are still found on this album, they're just tempered with some heavier, straight power-chord rhythm work, and some choppy, highly rhythmic, nearly percussive sounding guitars similar to those used by Fear Factory. Thus, Deliverance is a heavier album, which I like, though BWP is certainly far from light and poppy. Akerfeldt vocal work has improved, though it was very good before. His death growl have got more range than it had before, as do his clean vocals. The softer parts are also more varied, frequently with a more jazz like flow to some of them, and more varied tempos in general. This results in songs like the title track and The Pain I See In Others, both of which are far more ambitious than anything on BWP. So, in short, Deliverance has got more variety, variety is good.<br />Perhaps the single greatest most noticeable difference is the improved drumming. On BWP, the drumming was pushed way down in the mix, and frequently muffled sounding, along with just being merely adequate, run-of-the-mill drumwork. The drums on this album are much louder and clearer, with the technique being much improved as well, with more complex patterns and very good use of the kick drums. This results in much of Deliverance being much more rhythmic than BWP was, which I feel to be a good thing.<br />This album has 5 full songs on it, all of them between 10-14 minutes long. They are all excellent. The opener is Wreath. It starts out the heaviest of all of the tracks, with the pounding drums and blunter, more aggressive guitar work eventually giving way to smoother, though still heavy guitars. The lyrics, which are routinely excellent on all the Opeth I've heard, are especially notable on this track. They are the typical, fragmented, near stream of conciousness flow of image and emotion that Opeth is known for, but they are simply particularly vivid and disturbing here. Everyone who listens to Opeth needs to take the time to read the lyrics sheet, since the vocals are very, very hard to decipher w/o them, and those who don't learn them are really missing out. The title track follows, and is probably my second favorite full song on the cd. It's switches from the gentle to brutal with remarkable ease, and contains some of the more abrasive, pseudo-percussive guitar work on the album, particularly at the beginning and end. A Fair Judgement is a particularly interesting track, as it is the only one with no death vox in it, and is easily the lightest full track. It's got some very cool, melodic guitar solos and an extremely moody and evocative piano introduction. For Absent Friends is the brief, instrumental piece, that, as most say, isn't bad, but isn't terribly memorable either.  Master's Apprentices is another traditional Opeth track, with a devastating death riff at the beginning, and particularly harsh growling followed by the mellow middle then returning to the harsher styling. It's perhaps the weakest full song, but it is still very good. By The Pain I See In Other, is probably my favorite track. It's the most innovative and distinctive song on either Opeth albums Iown.  It's highly unusual, with some crazy, evil carnival music in the middle and an unexpected pairing of a warlby sounding growl over some tense, up-beat acoustic guitars. All in all, it's very cool.<br />So, Opeth is good. Go buy Opeth.own.

Baduizm becomes one of my personal favourites of the 1990s. Just an album that everyone should have and suits for everyone. Badu vocal ranges and creativity and her style is represented here in her beautiful and powerful debut album. the music just puts smile of people. Every fan of music should own this album. It is brilliantly made and made to peace and smooth our soul. great work.
B00006G8G4|5.0|First of all, this isn't a review of the Spider-Man movie or dvd. It's a review of the box set: Spider-Man Limited Eidtion DVD Collector's Gift Set. (I'll do a review of the Spider-Man dvd at a later time) It contains two dvds: 1) the Spider-Man widescreen special edition, and while I'm not going to go into it in this review, it is a great movie and a great dvd; and 2) Stan Lee's Mutants, Monsters & Marvels, which I've reviewed under the dvd, so I won't go much into this dvd here. But it is a very informative interview. These two dvds pretty much make the gift set worth the price. It also comes with a few 'collector's items' which I leave to you to decide if they make it worth picking up the gift set or just buying the dvds. There's a reproduction of the Amazing Fantasy comic that first introduced Spider-Man. It's monetary value is null, since it is a reproduction, but it is nice to get a copy of our favorite web-slinger's first appearance. A bit juvenile, but valueable for the Spidey-fan. There's a piece of artwork by John Romita Sr, nice but doesn't add much to the set. And finally there is a film cell from the movie (when Spider-Man is dodging Goblin's bats in the burning building). Also nice to have, but I found these collector's items don't add much to the enjoyment of the dvds. I'd say the gift set is only valuable to the hard core fan. Otherwise, just pick up the dvds.
B000002NJS|3.0|When it comes to reviewing Madonnas Ray Of Light it is hard to describe it. What Madonna wanted to do is reinvent herself and make different kind of music. She said she was a big techno fan but said also that many people didnt like techno becomes it wasnt really emoitional and she said she wanted to make it emoitional. It is nothing wrong with that but it fails to deliver the true emoitional part. William Orbit is a great producer. He remixed Justify My Love which could be found on her single. (She never mention it when they asked her why hireing William Orbit). Now this album contains many Madonnas hits and truly has some great tracks in between. However some songs on Ray Of Light are fillers and others not so perfect. The music often distracs Madonnas voice and sometimes the opposite and when Madonna tries to be emoitional she ruins her songs with not so perfect lyrics ( she has written better lyrics before). Her voice also does not seem to balance on the album and often the song that starts out really well becomes a big whole mess. Though this album has some great kick ass tunes it has also some bad ones and not so good ones. I Have to say that Ray Of Light by Madonna is probably her most overrated and overhyped work to date. I Have listened to better albums but many Madonnas fan seem to praise it. Try Like A Prayer or Erotica instead.

Boy was I blown away when I played this cd when I got home. It will stand out in my collection of cd's for many years to come. <BR>     One thing that I would like to point out is that the drumming on this album is incredible. The speed, technique, and sound is outstanding. The guitars also stand out in there own way as they do in every Blind Guardian album, and of course the unforgetable voice of Hansi! The melodic yet very hard-corish voice, the most unforgetable voice that I have ever heard aside from Kai Hansen from Gamma Ray, Rob Halford from Judas Priest(Ex-Judas Priest :( ) and Dave Mustain from Megadeth. <BR>     The songs on this album just blew me away one by one. &quot;Battlefield,&quot; I would have to say is my favorite. &quot;And then there was silence&quot; pretty much speaks for it's self when you hear it as well as all the other songs do. <BR>     All in all there are no songs on this cd that I would fast foward through. It has great sound, great musicians, great production, and great songs...what more could any metalhead ask for? Stop wasting your time and go buy this cd. <br />          5/5 stars ~JpPainkiller~
6305784078|1.0|This is one of Disney's worst, almost as bad and annoying as Peter Pan.  Don't get me wrong - I love Disney.  But this is just awful.  Slow storytelling, extraneous and unimportant scenes that add nothing...<br />The main characters aren't bad, but many of them are just excuses to add a few more excruciatingly painful minutes onto the film.  Whoever approved the release of this film in 1970 was obviously still suffering the effects of a rotten acid trip.  Now I know why everyone warned me not to waste my money buying this one!  Guess my faith in Disney's usual excellence and quality was ill-founded in this case.  Wait for it on TV, but don't go and buy it unless you really like it.  Otherwise, stick with Bambi or The Lion King if you want a great Disney critter movie.
B00000JHAU|5.0|This album is so good, and so brilliant I think I could go on for three pages about how good this album is. People that have written reviews that express very strong feelings and lot's of excitement let me assure you their intent is very sincere because this album is that good. This is a very poppy album, with some raw emotion that comes through in some very infectious melodies. The verses and choruses are so catchy and brilliant that it won't take you long to figure out why this album is so great. There isn't a song on this album that I don't like, but here are the ones I think of the most: 'Stars of Track and Field' is an amazing opener, 'If your feeling sinister' simply beautiful, 'Seeing Other People' catchy as hell, 'Judy and the Dream of Horses' makes me wheep it's so perfect, and 'Fox in the snow' has the same effect on me as 'Blue Velvet' has on Frank in Lynch's Blue Velvet. To sum this all up, this album ranks up there with a great Velvet Underground album, or a classic Dylan record. This album is a perfect achievement.
B000002UAC|4.0|The Beatles' 2nd LP, \\"With the Beatles,\\" builds upon their growing popularity.  Only eight months after the release of \\"Please Please Me\\" the Beatles came out with another album with both original material and covers.  The album features only one timeless classic, \\"All My Loving,\\" but contains a number of strong originals, including \\"It Won't Be Long,\\" and George Harrison's \\"Don't Bother Me.\\"  Only 1963, and already Harrison was getting fed up with Beatlemania.  All the touring and promo activity probably didn't give a lot of time for songwriting, but the covers are also strong.<br />John Lennon's performance on \\"Money (That's One I Want)\\" is nearly as definitive as \\"Twist and Shout\\" with some great raw vocals and screams.  He also does a nice role reversal on \\"Please Mister Postman\\" showing that the Beatles were not afraid to tackle songs previously recorded by female vocalists.  \\"You Really Got A Hold on Me\\" is also a standout, with fine harmonies by John and Paul.

0380789035|1.0|It's hard to believe this book could win any award.  I found the characters mostly wooden and not believable.  The plotting mediocre and nothing intellectually very interesting either.
B00000JRTX|3.0|I don't understand why this movie got so much hype.  While I love to watch Andy McDowell and Hugh Grant, one viewing of this movie was plenty enough for me.
080018789X|1.0|I hate to put this movie down since it's by Cameron Crowe and I love his work, but this movie was just plain bad.  It was nothing but hype.  Tom Cruise's character was shallow, and Renee Zellweger, who's such a good actress, was an annoying whiner.  Ditto for her brat kid.  The only redeeming virtue came in Cuba Gooding's &quot;show me the money&quot; line.  To save my life, I'd pick him as the only thing good about this horrible movie.  In fact, it was so bad that I couldn't struggle through the end of it -- I merely ejected it from the VCR and promptly returned it to the store I rented it from.
B00005JKDR|4.0|This is such a great movie for kids and adults, alike.  Kids enjoy the wild colors and action, and adults get the jokes that go over the kids' heads!  Everyone should see this!
6300214184|4.0|I was 15 when this movie came out, and it was the catalyst for a cultural revolution.  It completely changed the music and fashions of the times and truly defined the 80's.  During the summer it was released (summer of '83), you couldn't listen to the radio for more than an hour without hearing \\"Maniac\\" or the Flashdance theme song at least four times.  All the girls, myself included, emulated Jennifer Beals's style of dress in the movie: cut-up sweatshirt, tight mini skirts, high stiletto heels.  This movie cause an absolute furor!<br />You cannot watch this movie and not want to dance!  I should also mention that it caused a huge fitness craze, with leg-warmer-clad women flocking to the gyms and the aerobics studios in droves.  I suspect it's what encouraged Jane Fonda to churn out all those aerobics videos in the 80's.<br />As much as I adore this movie, it bothers me in the fact that it holds an ambivalent attitude toward women.  On one hand, it empowers women, as evidenced by Alex Owens's (Jennifer Beals) ambition, drive, and independence.  But on the other, it exploits them: Many of the men view women as nothing more than sex objects.  The saddest part comes when Alex's ice-skater friend Jeannie loses all faith in herself after falling during a crucial competition and resorts to working at the local strip club.<br />Its treatment of men is none too just, either.  It sends out the message that wimpy but good-hearted men like Richie Blazik, the cook-cum-stand-up comedian, will always come in last, and sleazeballs like strip-club proprietor Johnny C. always succeed in their evil ways without retribution. To wit: his goon busted Richie in the nose, and it was he, Johnny C., who wheedled Jeannie into stripping at the club.  He even ends up as her man! Go figure! (What decent man allows his girlfriend to work as a stripper?).  I think the scales were trying to be balanced by the addition of Nick Hurley, the guy who hailed from the rough streets of Pittsburgh to makegood.  He was truly a knight in shining armor, but he is ineffectual at best.<br />For anyone who wants to take a trip back to the 80's, this is THE movie for you!
052594527X|4.0|Go back to a time when the classic painters were honing their talents, and you find yourself immersed in this beautiful novel that is a sort-of biography of Vermeer.  After reading this book, I felt I knew all his secrets for producing his beautiful paintings filled with light.  The story is seen in the eyes of a young servant girl who later becomes the subject of the title painting.  Her feelings as a girl maturing into a young woman are heart wrenching.  Well worth reading!
0321127420|5.0|This book sets forth essentially everything I've learned over the past twelve years or so about how to write enterprise applications (and many things I hadn't learned -- and now won't have to learn the hard way) in clear and easy-to-understand language.<br />All of Mr. Fowler's books are worth reading.

0679720200|3.0|The book begins with the death and funeral of Monsieur Mersault's mother.  The man is not really affected by the death and goes on living life as he did while she was still living. The weekend after the funeral Mersault ran into a lady who used to work at his office and they went swimming together.  Mersault and Marie ended up going to a movie and spending a lot of time together.  Raymond invited Mersault up to his room to talk and have dinner.  That night, M. Mersault ended up writing a letter to Raymond's old girlfriend who had cheated on him. Her brother, an Arab, had been following Raymond and watching everything he did.  One day, Raymond, Mersault and Marie went to one of Raymond's friends' bungalow on the beach.  The Arab and two of his friends followed them there.  The three men went for a walk and ran into the Arabs.  They had a fight and Raymond left with a cut lip and arm.  Later on that same day, Mersault decided to go out for another walk.  He ran into the Arab man once more.  This time, however, Mersault used the revolver that Raymond had given him for the earlier fight and shot the man five times.  He was arrested and taken to jail. M. Mersault told his lawyer that he would not lie to the court and he never showed remorse for what he had done. Eleven months later, the judge sentenced him to death.  The chaplain tried to talk him about God, but the man decided that there was no point to life and he didn't believe in God anyways.  He knew that he lived his life for his afterlife and waited for the day of his execution to come.  <BR>I thought this book was good.  It would not have been my first choice to read, but it came out alright in the end.
B000003S0Z|5.0|The masterpiece of Eno's &quot;rock&quot; period, &quot;Before and After Science&quot; brings all the elements of earlier albums together: quirky, catchy rock tunes, picturesque lyrics, ambient atmospherics, unique arrangements and timbres.  Eno had mastered it all by this stage and having achieved it, left the genre of rock albums for immersion in ambient territory and production work for others.<br />But like all great music, &quot;Before and After Science&quot; is somehow more than sum of its parts: an aura of melancholy and longing pervades the album (especially what was side 2 of the LP, tracks 6-10 on the CD), transcending the clever production to create a work of lasting beauty and emotional connection.<br />Beyond essential.

She steps through to find an apartment that is exactly like hers, complete with her \\"Other Mother,\\" and her \\"Other Father.\\"  They seem nice and all, but she still goes home to her own parents.  Except her own parents don't seem to be around anymore - they certainly don't come home for a couple of days.  What is Coraline going to do?<br />I would say that this is a darker _Alice in Wonderland_, except Alice was pretty dark too. Coraline, however, is both a great book and a great character.

B00006F7S4|5.0|Beck started out making music as a folk subversive. Both incorporating folk traditions while at the same time adding a pop temperment. He took this aesthetic as far as it could go with Midnite Vultures, an album that had relenquished almost all of his folk roots for a satirical disco kingdom. Now with Sea Change he has brought back Hank Williams and the blues for album of heart break and despair. He accomplshes this while still down playing the the digital soundscape backing a lot of the songs. In the end it is a beautifull conceived piece of work worth your time and your money.

B00004WKII|5.0|Wow!  Jimi Hendrix made three albums, one a double record, has a four disc box set, plus such albums as South Saturn Delta, First New Rays Of The Rising Sun (...or whatever its called), The BBC Sessions, Live At Woodstock, plus countless bootlegs, all made in just five years of recording activity.  On to the box set.  When I got this, I had already had Are You Experienced? and Axis: Bold As Love, but not Electric Ladyland (now I have it).  But I have to say that all you need is those three albums and this set and you can &quot;Experience Hendrix&quot;.  There are a lot of great live and unreleased recordings on here.  The key live ones are &quot;Killing Floor&quot; and &quot;Hey Joe&quot; in France when he was first starting out, &quot;Like A Rolling Stone&quot; from the Monterrey Pop Festival, &quot;The Burning Of The Midnight Lamp&quot; live in Sweden, an explosive performance of &quot;Fire&quot;, &quot;I Don't Live Today&quot;, &quot;Purple Haze&quot;, &quot;Voodoo Child (Slight Return)&quot;, and &quot;All Along The Watchtower&quot; from the legendary Isle of Wight Festival.  But, lets not forget the other unreleased studio recordings.  &quot;Title #3&quot; is a great display of Jimi's guitar work, &quot;If 6 Was 9&quot;, &quot;(Have You Ever Been To) Electric Ladyland&quot;, &quot;Gypsy Eyes&quot;, a powerful rendition of Van Morrison's &quot;Gloria&quot;, &quot;Star Spangled Banner&quot;, &quot;Spanish Castle Magic&quot;, &quot;Lover Man&quot;, &quot;Ezy Ryder&quot;, and &quot;Night Bird Flying&quot;.  So there it is...enjoy.  Jimi lives on.
B000002LK1|5.0|This album is my second favorite of all time (second only to Mike Oldfield's Hergest Ridge). The song Blue Dress is one of the most sensual songs written and performed.

B00006LSM3|2.0|George Harrison absolutely LOVED ukulele/Hawaiian music in the last years of his life. It is a shame that he didn't do an entire album of covers as he has the exuberant, buoyant spirit of that genre down perfectly in his cover here of \\"Devil and the deep blue sea\\". It is the one irresistably charming element in an otherwise hum-drum set. Most of this album is uninspired and lacks melodic hooks to draw you in. Songs begin, progress, and then end with hardly anything musically noteworthy occurring. Some seem as if they were slapped together quickly and beg for reworking. Yes, I know that George was very ill when he made this. An album should not be given high ratings merely because it is a memento of a dying legend, though.

B00006L7XQ|5.0|American IV is a very solid album; I'm not disappointed in the least.  If you can find the LP version, there are two extra songs not on the CD: Marty Robbin's &quot;Big Iron&quot;, and Jimmy Webb's &quot;Witchita Lineman&quot;.  Glen Campbell does a guitar solo on the song he made famous.  Both songs are very good, like all the others on the album.
B00006RU5B|5.0|For those of you Soundgarden fans aching over the loss of the greatest alt-rock band, your dreams have come true.  This album is reticent of old Soundgarden (anything pre-Superunknown)and is hard as hell (with two bearable ballads on it). It proves that Cornell was always the driving force behind Soundgarden. Cornell went back to his early rock roots on this and is obviously the main influence on all the songs (seeing as he wrote all the lyrics, too).  The old RATM guys are a palatable back-up group for him, as the Soundgarden guys were.  If you're a real fan of Soundgarden, buy this album now and put it in your Ultramega OK jewel box (you will never notice the difference).
B000002UAX|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said?  The greatest band in history releasing one of their best albums of all-time...simply fantastic!  After toning down their 'experimental' stage a bit, and not all that long after 'Revolver', who many consider their greatest album, 'The White Album', which surprised many by being a double album came at a time when the very fabric of The Beatles was quickly coming apart at the seams...and yet you can't tell by listening to their music.  If these guys despised each other you just simply cannot tell.  From the almost overly optimistic 'Ob La Di Ob La Da' to enjoying George coming into his own with 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps', and widely considered one of the first heavy metal songs, 'Helter Skelter' and 'Back In The U.S.S.R.' this truly is an audio masterpiece.  Some songs are easy to pass by, but not a one is poorly done.  No 'The White Album' shows the musical genius that was the Lennon/McCartney writing duo, plus some flashes of brilliance thrown in by Harrison -- and then there's always Ringo...No matter HOW you view The Beatles, from the opening days of the British Invasion to their experimental meditation days with the Mahesh Yogi in India to their abrasive time just before the break-up (begun with Paul, but precipitated by a LOT of things least of which was Yoko -- though she DID contribute to some degree) these young boys simply had something which is in short supply these days:  RAW TALENT.  Even while not trying too hard, they still produced amazing music that has stood the test of time (all while showing no signs of slowing down)...something that hasn't been seen in the music scene since the latter 60's...a true test to how good they are, Paul has been rated the most successful composer of ALL-TIME by Guiness not long ago, a crown he definitely deserved and earned over many years of hard work.  'The White Album' as maligned as it has been over the years still sells well, which is tribute enough to the staying power of the greatest rock &amp; roll band of all time.wer of the greatest rock &amp; roll band of all time.
B00006X06U|5.0|They are not what you think . They are not what they look like. They do not sound familiar.  This is not a collection of re-sung song but a breathtaking new album featuring old  Joni's moving lirics. The orchestra has deconstructed and reconstructed back again into a different form the \\"old\\" songs. Nothing you will expect will happen. A full male choir moves storming through the Sire Of Sorrow, Sex kills is aggressive and  biting with full orchestra and drumming, Cherokee Luise is as sad as it could possibly be, Borderline is gentle and moving and fluid.

No.<BR>The family dynamics illustrated after their daughters death felt like a strained attempt to create characters out of the famous stages of dealing with grief (denial, anger, depression...). <BR>The heaven Sebold describes is incredibly superficial (every wish is granted), unimaginative, and sentimental. <BR>Sebold tries to tackle far too much--too many characters and their emotional states, and she obviously adores nearly all of them, considering by the end, everyone's lives have become disgustingly and predictably ideal.<BR>The book does not come to any resolution, fruition, or conclusion, nor does it have any underlying message that I could glean from its pages.
B000060P79|5.0|Wow i really underestamed them untill i really heard sum of there songs. To tell you the truth when there first song \\"I'm just a kid\\" came out i really didnt like it and i thought that Simple Plan was just sum dumb pop-punk band, a few weeks later when the Atticus (my favorite brand)cd came out i saw that they where on it and that mark hoppus (from blink 182 wich is one of my favorte bands)had a part in there song \\"i'd do anything\\" and i said \\"what the heck is a band like simple plan doing on this cd and why did mark hoppus make a song with them?\\" So then a little later i started downloading some of the songs on the atticus cd because the cd wasnt out yet, then eventually i decided to download \\"i'd do anything\\" and i just thought it was going to be a dumb song but when i heard i was like wow these guys are awesome!rite after i heard that song simple plan imediatly became one of my favortie bands. so then as i kept listning to taht song i eventually decided to download some of there other stuff and i figured out that pretty much every song from them was also really catchy and great, and before i knew it i liked \\"i'm just a kid\\" also. If you like pop-punk like new found glory i can promise that you will love this cd. every song on this cd is very well written and very catchy and every song i fell i can relate to.

B00006LSM3|4.0|Damn I wish Jeff Lynne would have laid off of the Wilbury like drums and pathetic background vocals! He nearly ruins some of these great songs. I know George thought highly of his mate, but frankly, these songs would have been even better with a guy like Rick Rubin producing. <br />And what's with the Wilbury drum sound? I can't stand that loose snare drum, and Keltner's not the problem. It's how the drums were recorded, and that loose sound is a Lynne trademark.<br />Oh well. George's guitar playing is his best since All Things Must Pass, and that's remarkable when you consider the discomfort he must have been feeling throughout these sessions. \\"Stuck Inside a Cloud, and \\"Marwah Blues\\" are my favorites, and the CD keeps growing on me.<br />The world misses you George.<br />By the way, I've read reviews that have said this recording is better than McCartney's \\"Driving Rain.\\" In my opinion, good though it is, it's not better.

B00006CXXU|5.0|Five stars for this great artist, who have demostrated to the world that she's more than a pop singer. With this album she created a masterpice of modern music. Great colaborations with another great musicians like Linda Perry, Glen Ballard and Alicia Keys, among others. Christina deserves the major credit for the production of all this new music. I think all in this CD is perfect, it gaves us a tour of sounds all perfectly melted, surprisingly descovering a new good writer in Christina and the most important thing is that is somekind of a realization for her, in an artistic way, and when you hear this album, you can clear noticed that. Congratulations Christina and this a living proof that the contemporary music have an artist with so much to give now, and in the future.
B00005NKW3|5.0|Since &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; begins with the Macy's parade on Thanksgiving Day, it is the obvious movie to watch on Turkey Day to begin the Christmas season (when you watch &quot;White Christmas,&quot; &quot;A Christmas Carol,&quot; and &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; is up to you). I know am not alone in my belief that Edmund Gwenn IS Kris Kringle, which means he IS Santa Claus. Of course they gave Gwenn the Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role in 1948, but the film also won Oscars for Best Writing, Original Story (Valentine Davies) and Best Writing, Screenplay (George Seaton). Maureen O'Hara plays Doris Walker, a single mom who insists on bringing her daughter Susan, played by adorable Natalie Wood in one of the great childhood performances of all time, in a no-nonsense manner, which means no fantasy, no fairy tales and certainly no Santa Claus. Boy, is she ever wrong.<br />This version of this classic holiday film offers up the long trailer in which the publicity department tries to figure out how to market the film to the masses.  A nice added bonus.  However, the point of owning \\"Miracle on 34th Street\\" is to be able to watch it when it fits our holiday schedule and cry over our favorites scenes.  The best times to cry during this movie are as follows: (1) When Susan overhears Kris talking Dutch to the little refugee girl; (2) When Mr. Macy admits under oath on the witness stand that he believes Kris to be Santa Claus; (3) When Susan writes &quot;I believe in you too&quot; on Susan's letter to Kris; (4) When Susan yells, &quot;Stop, Uncle Fred! Stop!&quot; and (5) when Fred sees the cane in the corner. Please feel free to add others to this list as you see fit. Now, excuse me, as I have to go dry my eyes and remember that some films have become holiday classics for good reasons and that remaking something in color does not mean just because it is new it is improved. Happy Turkey Day, everyone!

B000006IUQ|4.0|David Mamet and Lee Tamahori have delivered one of the great films in recent memory. Released in 1997 by Twentieth Century Fox, The Edge provides enjoyment at every level. Tamahori's rich, visceral directing drives a genuinely suspenseful story, and Mamet's screenplay is simply brilliant. Far from just another wilderness film, writer and director form a true collaboration that depicts a smart, sophisticated look into the reasoning mind and the nature of man's faculty for survival. <br />Equally impressive to the writing and directing is the casting in this film. Anthony Hopkins plays billionaire Charles Morse, who has embarked on a retreat to the Alaskan wilderness with a small entourage. The entourage consists of Morse's wife, a fashion model, and her photo-shoot team, including photographer Robert Green (played by Alex Baldwin). True to form, Hopkins captures the cerebral, mildly paranoid Morse perfectly, and Baldwin (perhaps typecast) shines as a myopic, range-of-the-moment thinker with clear envy of Morse and obvious designs on Morse's wife. <br />There is some mild character development as the entourage settles into the lodge at which they are staying, but these scenes serve mostly as a backdrop for the important scenes and themes that follow. Of particular note in the early scenes, however, is a brief exchange between Morse and John Styles, the lodge owner played by L.Q. Jones. The exchange involves a test of Morse's prodigious \\"book\\" knowledge, wherein Morse wins a bet put to him by telling Styles what image is depicted on the flip side of a Cree Indian canoe paddle. On the side shown to Morse is a panther, and Morse calmly recites that the rabbit smoking a pipe on the alternate side is a metaphor. When pressed for details, Morse states that the rabbit is smoking a pipe because he is unafraid: \\"The rabbit is unafraid because he is smarter than the panther.\\" This brief exchange serves as wonderful foreshadowing for the events ahead. <br />The plot really getsunderway when Green learns that a second model will not join the entourage. To salvage the photo-shoot, Green wants to include a native who he believes will give him a \\"truly non self-conscious photograph.\\" Green convinces Morse to accompany him, and a small group sets out on a plane ride in search for this native. What follows is one of the great examples in film of man as a rational survivor. <br />Without giving too much away, circumstances force Morse to apply his theoretical knowledge and employ his rational faculties or face non-existence. He does this despite numerous setbacks and circumstances that might drive lesser men to despair. Morse is at once cool and collected and at the same time clearly struggling to remain so. In short, he is an incredibly believable hero. Couple this with an intentional absence of wooden speeches and grandiloquent stances, and the viewer can truly appreciate that the script has been deliberately stripped of all but the essentials needed to drive both plot and moral. <br />This is a milestone in Mamet's career, and it is a far cry from much of his earlier work. Unlike some of his prior works that involve characters of ill-repute and low moral character, here we see the essential nature of man the hero and his true faculty for survival. What is skillfully wrought in this film is a simple, memorable tale of how reason triumphs over animal cunning, brute force, and duplicity. Despite some unimportant flaws in Morse's character[1], the viewer is left with is a genuine sense-of-life reaction to Morse as a bona fide hero. The introspective viewer is left with is a genuine appreciation for the deeper moral of this story: Man's survival does not merely involve his rational faculty, it hinges on it...man's mind is his edge on reality. <br />[1] For instance, Morse is depicted as almost ashamed of his great wealth, and he seems occasionally like an apologist for those with less drive or ambition than he himself exhibits.
0671027344|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chboskey has become one of my favorite books yet. As you read the book, you will find that the protagonist, Charlie, a shy and lonely 15 year-old boy, is very likeable and easy to relate to. His stories of a year in the life of a high school reject really come to life as you start to read the letters he begins to write to an unknown person when he is scared of starting his freshman year. During the story, you the reader take on the role of the person Charlie is writing letters to. It feels as though Charlie is telling you all of his problems. This book relates completely to the real world that the average teenager goes through, and it makes you feel as though someone is going through all the same dating issues, or school issues, or drug issues as you are. <BR> I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and would recommend everyone to read it. It will really change the way you perceive things and how you see the people around you. In the book Charlie seems to view the world from a neutral point of view. He observes everyone around him and is always putting everyone else's problems before his. \\"I walk around the school hallways and look at the people. I look at the teachers and wonder why they're here...\\"page 68.What I really got out of The Perks of Being a Wallflower is that sometimes in life you have to stop watching and analyzing everything around you and just let yourself be a part of it. I encourage you to read along to Charlie's adventures as he learns this and other lessons, and finds out how hard being a teenager really is.
B000002UJQ|5.0|It would be easy to sit here and blow RH like countless others before me, but the truth is is I dismissed RH for YEARS as childish, self-pitying 'college rock' (in part because of an ex-girlfriend who loved pablo honey). <br />Well, I was wrong. On a second listening to kid a i finally got it. Then came amnesiac (kid a II), and then o.k. computer. o.k. is not a flawless album (see fitter happier) but damn near close. what is amazing is the  unabashed emotion that comes through RH wihtout ever sounding overly sentimental, and at times the sophisticated harmonics are nothing short of breathtaking.  <BR> <BR>bring on the bends...
B000068CNX|5.0|The biggest bonus of this set, not to mention that it's an entire season of our favorite show, is that the ability of the DVD set to deliver more goodies than on video makes it a good deal better.  The inclusion of a trivia game, which for some reason I won against my wife's knowledge of the shows, is illustrated by going back to clips from the shows in question.  It also has the Smelly Cat video, which originally was partially used in the episode where Phoebe is signed to a record deal, but is not so great.  The episodes, however, are.  This collection of one of the early years of Friends is completely enjoyable,a nd compares well to the top-rated shows that have come in the last two years.  All in all, we really enjoyed sitting down to watch these shows, even if it was the umpteenth time- and you know what I mean when I say it doesn't matter how many times you have seen some of these- they will ALWAYS make you laugh.
B00005Y7AW|5.0|This album is a real triumph for Rufus. It's a little more cohesive than the debut album, and the songs are superb throughout. I love Rufus's smart, offbeat lyrics and the music is layered and melodic. It's a shame that the seemingly radio friendly &quot;California&quot; never found its way to the airwaves. My personal favorite track from &quot;Poses&quot; is the unforgettable &quot;Grey Gardens.&quot; I really treasure this CD and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys smart, well-crafted pop.
0316666343|5.0|I read this book in less than a day. It is a quick read, but at the same time not a word is wasted. High marks for Alice Sebold in her first novel. The story moves along at a quick pace, and the subject matter is treated with less darkness as one would expect.<BR>At times you may not realize how cleverly Sebold has enabled her narrator, Susie Salmon, to slip from first person to third person omniscient. This is truly a talented writer and I look forward to her next work. <BR>Some readers may be put off by the ending which seems to be missing the great sense of finality and vengence we all seek, but it is more realistic than you realize. The characters are true to life and very solid. You will recognize yourself, you parents, your friends and your loved ones in one or more of the individuals in this tale. Pick it up today, read it, and pass it on tomorrow.
B00006AG5N|5.0|First of all, let me explain that I am 27, and have long been aware of Elvis' contribution to modern music.  Aware is the key word, but I never really gave him a good serious listen.  Having seen photogaphs of him in his outrageous 70's Vegas performance outfits never really struck a cord in me to make me want to tune in.  Well guess what?  Right now I am tired of most musical trends and have been litening to older stuff like Sinatra, the Stones, Ella Fitzgerald, Stan Getz, with a sprinkling of the newer Jesus and Mary Chain, and New Order, just to bring me back to my own youth and not my (grand) parents'.  The point here is that my tastes are eclectic.  I saw this disc and I thought I give the ole king a try.  I love it.  I didn't think I would hate it, but I definitely didn't expect to like it this much either.  I had it on in the background, and found myself dancing a few minutes later before I even know what happened.  The music is cheerful, upbeat and innocent.  It also honestly can put a smile on my face.  Though I am partial to the earlier recordings, rather than the Vegas years, they really are all excellent selections.  It is a great intro for those wishing to explore.  I can honestly say that my Elvis collection is only just beginning... now where do I go next?<br />- A new fan
B00006LSM3|4.0|How can it be that this gentle soul is gone? When \\"Any Road\\" kicks in with all its Traveling Wilburyesque charm and life-in-the-rearview-mirror lyrical whimsy, it just seems an impossibility. With \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" cheerfulness and that vintage slide guitar, this album comes on like a familiar, comfy sweater on a crisp autumn day. There's so much optimism and insight, and, well, LIFE, on this record that the mind can't square the fact that this marks the end, and there won't be anymore.<br />The \\"Cloud 9\\" comparisons are largely accurate. In fact, the two seem somehow bound together - they are nice companions for each other. Some of that is Jeff Lynne, but it it's also an attitude. Man at peace, doing it for the fun of it, I think.<br />There's some really nice stuff here: \\"Any Road\\", the dreaming \\"Stuck Inside a Cloud\\", the fun \\"Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea\\", the deep \\"Looking for my Life\\" are highlights. \\"Stuck Inside a Cloud\\" has the single best lyric on the album, when George sings \\"Knowing as you leave me, I also lose my heart\\" - the only time he really reflects directly on the end of life. Just read that line - it's not he that's leaving, it's the ones staying behind that are, a wonderful thought-provoking twist. And in the only nod to the material world in any song, he laments losing his heart. A sole regret of what's being left behind for a man otherwise prepared for the next dimension - the tangible, physical love of those close and dear. \\"Talking to myself, crying....Only I can hear me, I'm stuck inside this cloud\\". So sweet and tragic, and so uniquely George Harrison.<br />And, yeah, there's a couple of just-average songs here, like \\"P2 Vatican Blues\\" and the faux blue yodel of \\"Rocking Chair in Hawaii\\", but that's quibbling. Overall, it's a wonderful record, one of the best George ever made, and an effective tonic for those sad thoughts of his early departure.
6302862949|1.0|Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha!!! The only legitimate intellectual response to this ludicrous film is laughter. Throwing up, unfortunately, is not an intellectual response. It is sooooooh of its time, a time apparently of pure cheese. Baryshnikov tries to smouler but just scowls and Gregory Hines looks half asleep as usual. Dancing will free the World -- erm, actually NO. Communism just fell down by itself like a ballet dancer with bad balance or a turkey that tried to dance.

B000065AQU|5.0|Great CD!  This is the best one yet for System of a Down.  The next CD is comming out soon!  I can't wait for it!  But, don't get me wrong this is a great CD for anyone who lets alternative, industrial-metal, and rock because its all in one sorta.  Buy this CD if you don't have it!  The best songs in my opinion is Chop Suey and Toxicity, but there are other very goods ones on the CD.
B00006X06U|4.0|Joni's influence on the spate of wannabe's who've surfaced over the past two decades is indelible... If you're looking for Kathleen Battle's honeyed tones do not enter the landscape of \\"Travelogue\\"... if you want a mostly fascinating, and likely last, album from a great lyricist, buy this.  On the best songs you sense the wisdom and weariness that inspired her writing when she was young, presaging the performances that are now fleshed out by the experience of a worldly, older woman.  A must have item.
B00006G8LB|2.0|Clark runs to the rescue and opens his shirt to show his \\"S\\" uniform. Superman introduces himself to the public by doing several super hero activities. Lois Lane falls form a building and is saved by Superman. Perry White berrates Clark Kent and the staff. Luthor and the super-villains from Krypton - General Zod, Urza, et.al attack the Daily Planet offices. People gather infront of City Hall  before the Jokers attacks. Lots of big ballon- figures fly in the air and thereafter the Joker attacks. The Joker laughs horrifically and has a split personality. Yep the same scenes are present in Sam Raimi's film, except that the character is Spider-man. Is it any wonder that I feel like I've seen this film before. Hey Stan (Lee), this is definitely a brand echh movie. It seems like Irv Forbush directed this one. I hope the sequel is all Marvel.
B00006LLNV|5.0|In what appears to be a collection of original and traditionally-inspired music, Goldenthal is able to evoke the amazingly deep colors and textures of the movie. He is also successful in capturing the heat and light of Mexican culture. It is likely to win awards.
B000000ORX|5.0|Here JM displays a new-found sense of balance and harmony in her life and music. Night Ride Home proves that the creative embers were glowing brightly again. Her languid voice is accorded poetic justice by the sparse backing on themes eternal. Religious symbolism surfaces on Passion Play and Slouching Towards Bethlehem - the latter an adaptation of a Yeats poem. The topic of growing old, gracefully treated in Nothing Can Be Done and Come In From The Cold, is brilliantly balanced by the teenage romance of Ray's Dad's Cadillac, in which Joni puts one over Rickie Lee Jones, one of her followers. Savour these lines: &quot;Ray's dad teaches maths/I'm a dunce, a decimal in his class/when it comes to mathematics/I get static in the attic.&quot; Well this is music - not maths - and Joni gets five out of five for composition and performance.
B00001QEE9|5.0|Of course, it's got a nice theme to it.  Kids love the typical Disney songs.  Pinnochio, Geppetto, Jiminy Cricket, Good Fairy and others.  Even the villains are funny.  My three year old and five year old both like it and adults enjoy it too.  There are some dark scenes here with drinking and smoking done by some bad influences on Pinnochio.  I guess that stuff flew by in 1940 when it was made.

B00007BHOE|5.0|This DVD is the most amazing thing ever. Suncoast in the mall sold me a copy on Saturday and I've watched the thing non stop. This mosnter is one of the most advanced and well done DVD's I've ever seen. They use over 30 cameras and have some great footage of every member of the band. The songs are of course amazing. They play fan favorites like Spit It Out, and then they play some of their less mainstream songs like Gently. The pyro is amazing and the crowd is friggin nuts. The whole show is a hundred minutes long when you include the clips of the band setting up. The second disc has tons of extras. It has the performances of The Heretic Anthem and People=S**t with a camera angle for every member of the band. Some of it is in first person view and some of it is normal shots. It's also got another multiple angle song, every music video (Spit It Out, Wait and Bleed, Wait and Bleed Animated, Left Behind Directors cut, and My Plauge Edited version). If you're a maggot or even just a metal fan, you have to get this DVD. You'll love it.
B00005OAIE|4.0|I purchased this album on the strengths of a televised John Mayer concert.  From a guitar playing standpoint, the guy is fairly wicked, with a style reminiscent of Stevie Ray Vaughn.<br />I have to admit, I was quite disappointed with the album at first listen.  There was no obvious sign of the guy's guitar talent (no extended solos, etc. - Probably wanted to focus on the songs and keep the CD radio friendly) other than the use of chords not usually found in the top 40.  I think those chords are the reason that everyone thinks JM's music sounds so similar to DMB.<br />The more I listened to it though, the more I started to realize that the guy is a really clever songwriter.  His songs center mainly around relationships, which is nothing new, but the way he structures the musical makeup of the songs around the lyrics is something not usually done in the pop arena.  <br />Check out 'My Stupid Mouth' where John sings about never being able to keep his mouth shut and getting himself into trouble as a result.  He states &quot;...I'm never speaking up again, starting now...&quot; after describing a date where he messed things up because he said too much in an effort to be liked by the girl.<br />The song is silent for four beats and then suddenly starts up again with &quot;One more thing...&quot;, as if to show us that he truly can't keep his mouth shut, no matter how resolute his will.  <br />Absolutely a perfect match of subject matter, lyrics, and song structure.<br />Another favorite - a verse from 'City Love':<br />&quot;Friday night, and we've been drinking,<BR>2AM, I swear I might propose.<br />We pay our tab, split a cab,<BR>Call each other up when we get home.<br />Falling asleep to the sound...<BR>of sirens.&quot;<br />Who hasn't had a perfect night like that in the first stages of a relationship?  JM really does a great job at conveying the bliss of meeting someone new, and the joy, hopes, fears, and regrets inherent in love with each of his songs.  That last line is a direct homage to Simon and Garfunkel, and is done exactly as in the &quot;Sounds of Silence&quot;.<br />Couple the clever, fresh songwriting with those witty homages and the perfect distillation of what every single twenty something male wants or misses in a relationship, and the album is truly worth a listen.  <br />Granted, not every song will grab you by the collar, but chances are you'll find something in the words, tunes, or otherwise that'll make you glad you bought it.  JM's sound and style is fresh and totally different from the rest of the angst-driven rock, hip hop, or bubblegum fluff on the radio today.<br />As for the Dave Matthews comparisons, I don't really feel there's a basis for them.  If you want DMB, buy DMB albums.  John Mayer isn't trying to be Dave Matthews and deserves to stand on his own merits as a songwriter, performer, and musician.<br />And for those guys who are too manly to listen to &quot;relationship&quot; songs - the women really seem to dig John M.  Play this one in your car and they'll think you're the sweetest person around.  And you'll get to listen to some great songs as a bonus.
0316666343|2.0|The heaven portrayed in this novel is not the heaven that I grew up learning about or the one that is so popularly portrayed in the Bible, it is instead more of a slumber party fascination with the tastes of Ouiji boards and campfire ghost stories.  I can suspend my disbelief enough to read the novel, but I don't actually believe it.  This isn't one of those books that you can fall into and forget that you are actually reading.  I also kept waiting for something to happen, down on the earth that the protagonist was watching, but it didn't.  I appreciate that this is likely how things really happen on earth, but it makes for a boring novel.  At one point, the spirit thing gets out of hand when Suzie, the main character murdered at the beginning of the novel, returns to earth.  During this part of the story I actually put the book down not believing that the author actually though I, the reader, would go along with it.  I was expecting a `Touched by an Angle' sweetly tragic sort of Christian representation of the afterlife, but instead it was more of a teenage horror story.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I always thought the musicians from RATM were good, but their annoying rap singer always got on my nerves. Now that they started a new band with a different singer it's much easier to listen to. With Chris Cornell on vocals, to me a lot of this cd doesn't sound too different from Soundgarden. Of course the last time I listened to Soundgarden is when Louder Than Hell first came out. I think the music is above average for this style of alternative or grunge or whatever it's called these days. I hear some Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath influences here. I've never been a big fan of today's rock and metal so I guess I can say that this may very well be the best mainstream hard rock cd to be released in at least 20 years. Maybe the best since Led Zeppelin 4. Well, maybe not THAT good, but better than anything I've heard from Metallica, or any [weak] rap-metal band that seems to be so popular these days.
B00000K31Q|5.0|i really liked this movie i thought it was funny, enjoyable and romantic. The feelings of the characters change alot and they have different lives at the end. There was not a moment where this movie was boring, it was all entertaining! I would recommend this to anyone with a sence of humor, sum1 who is intersted in romance or just wants entertainment.
B00006CXXU|4.0|ok i liked it alot better than i thought i would heres my run down on the the songs! i dont really like her much as a person but her music is awesome and i love her voice (i think she should have a lil more class than what she does) unless she likes being called a sleeze<BR> 1)stripped Pt. 1 ~ its an intro basically from what i got out of it, she was explaining how this is really her (guess she's been fake up until now......?)(2)**s<BR> 2)cant hold us down ~ umm i like this song ONLY b/c of its hidden meaning to eminem but lil kims part is just repeating what x-ina has already covered earlier in the song.<BR> 3)walk away ~ i loved this song personally (maybe b/c i can relate) and its so well written and song(5 stars)<BR> 4)fighter ~ hmmmm have i heard this song before?? how many songs are artists gonna make about girl power (blah blah) but it does have a good tempo and beat!

0783229526|5.0|I didn't think it possible but Terry Gilliam has brought &quot;Fear and Loathing&quot; to the screen.  I had enjoyed the wise-cracking Bill Murray in &quot;Where the Buffalo Roam&quot; but that film stretched far and wide and went no where.  Here, Gilliam is in complete control, which is no small fete given the character of the subject.  Johnny Depp makes a good effort but Benicio Del Toro steals the show.  He captures the crazy Samoan in all his kinetic glory.  The scenes build as effortly on each other as they do in the book.  Gilliam sticks very closely to the text, and Thompson seems to have given the film his seal of approval in the pivotal flashback scene.  The swirling carpet patterns and other metamorphoses are fantastic, and show that Gilliam is the master of bringing psychedelic visions to the big screen. This is one you have to see over and over again.
0380778556|5.0|I thought that the book Rebecca was an excellent book. Not only did it have suspense but many unexpected turns. The book kept you so involved and I never wanted to put it down. Rebecca was written very nicely although it had some pages that weren't necessary.
0316776963|5.0|Don't read this book in public or people will think you're crazy. I laughed so hard when I read &quot;Jesus Shaves&quot; (the story of Easter told by beginning French students) that I almost went into spasms. The entire book is ragingly funny, but the best parts are about how to get along in France when you don't speak French. Read Naked first, then this book.
B00006G8HX|4.0|A good DVD, but lacks the extras that made the Star Trek I and Star Trek II DVDs so awesome.  No new scenes, no new effects, it looks like a basic transfer of the theatrical print.  Quality is pretty good.  Regardless, still a needed item for the endearing trekkie.
0316666343|5.0|Alice Sebold has a gift with language.  Her writing is fluid and enchanting.  This is no ordinary prosaic story, and as such should be read with a little suspension of disbelief.  Once you have fully entered the story, you will not want it to end.  Besides, it offers those of us who have lost someone a new perspective on grief--the grief that those who die feel at not having been able to live they life that they had dreamed of.  I have recommended this book to several picky readers and have not heard a complaint yet.
B00006M183|3.0|Here's the guts of it.  PJ was made great in the beginning by 3 big things.  1) Strong songwriting.  2) Powerful vocals.  3)  Great guitarwork.<br />The first album \\"Ten\\"  had ALL of these on EVERY track!  \\"Vs.\\" follows close behind, keeping with that kinda stuff, but a little rawer.  The band still had 1 and 2 on \\"Vitalogy\\", even if the guitarwork lacked the depth of the previous 2 efforts.  On \\"No Code\\", (the band's worst album to date)  only a few songs held strong and the rest felt flat and unfinished, and Eddie Vedder sounded like he just woke up.  \\"Yield\\" was a bit of a suprise because it was an improvement over its immediate predecessor.  Strong drums and rhythms kept the album alive and 1 great guitar solo on All Those Yesterdays helped.  The singing and songwriting were getting better too, though still not up to par with \\"Ten.\\"  \\"Binaural\\" was also a suprise.  It seems to be universally hated, but the songwriting is strong and the return of political themes is quite relevent.  It had no guitar solos per se but the leads weren't all that bad, and Vedder sounded like he at least had a shower and a glass of OJ before singing.<br />Remember those great guitar solos on songs like \\"Alive\\" and \\"Daughter\\"?  On \\"Riot Act\\", they are BACK!  Mike McCready has been awfully shy of his gift lately, but here he overcomes it.  He hasn't sounded so alive since \\"Alive\\".  The songwriting feels fairly complete, though hardly perfect.  The vocals range from good (You Are) to bad (Thumbing My Way), and sometimes both (Love Boat Captain).<br />Well, this album's not strong enough for a full-throttle comeback, even if \\"I Am Mine\\" is making its way as a hit.  What the album does prove is that PJ has the capacity to make it back, in spite of all the nu metal trash that's out there.  PJ may or may not come out with the next \\"Ten\\", but given the performance here, they've certainly got the fire for it.
B00006AW2J|5.0|Many argue that \\"Beggars Banquet\\" is the best album the Rolling Stones ever recorded.  It certainly marks the emergence of the mature sound of the band and the beginning of a five-year roll of brilliance!<br />While The Beatles' \\"White Album,\\" also released in 1968, shows a band in disarray without focus; \\"Beggars Banquet\\" shows a band unified and focused, getting back to their roots after a detour in psychedelia.  The Stones, with the assistance of Jimmy Miller, could no longer be called Beatles imitators.  When the Beatles began disintegrating, the Stones finally hit their stride.<br />Every album after \\"Beggars Banquet,\\" up to and including \\"Exile on Main Street,\\" features the Stones at the top of their game.  \\"Goats Head Soup\\" marks the beginning of the band's slide- due in large part to Keith's loss of focus due to drug abuse.  The band wasn't firing on all cylanders after \\"Exile.\\"<br />This remastered version really brings out the great sound of five musicians doing what they do better than anyone else in the world!
B000002IFP|5.0|Just can't get enough of Simply Red!<BR>Good dancing music.  The good old dancing music that you can dance to, not one of those static house music.
B0000027RL|5.0|This is probably the best album EVER made by ANYONE.  Well that's just my opinion.  It was released in 1991 and has many great songs on it including: Once, Even Flow, Alive(my favorite), Why Go, Black, Jeremy, Oceans, and Release. That's 8 out of 11 songs on the album.  If you are a Pearl Jam fan and don't own this CD, than I strongly suggest you get it; also if you like early nineties rock, than get it!
B00006LIRI|4.0|This compilation does a good job of summing up the history of u2 in the last decade.  I think it was an incredible decade for the group, maybe with more pitfalls but there were also more risks.  They experimented and changed their style with virtually every album just to satisfy their musical appetite, even after the success of the &quot;Joshua Tree,&quot; which sold over 10 million copies. Critics like to say the 90s weren't as good to u2 as the 80s, but in a recent poll in Rolling Stone Magazine of the Top 100 albums of all time, Achtung Baby #9, Zooropa #70, and All That You Can't Leave Behind #15.  How bad could it have been? This CD is a great recap, and I would recommend it to any fan, whether you are a serious u2 fan (as i am) or just liked a few of their hits.  However, there are a few things I would have done differently.<BR>  <BR>1)CUT AND PASTE - I would have liked the CD to be 18 tracks (16).  I would have cut out &quot;The First Time&quot; which is a beautiful song but was not a single.  I would also cut out &quot;Hands that Built America.&quot;  I say this because it was not a new song made just to promote the compilation like &quot;Electrical Storm.&quot;  It will show up in a couple months on the &quot;Gangs of N.Y.&quot; soundtrack, plus it hasn't really grown on me.  To replace these two tracks, I would definetly add in &quot;Walk On,&quot; an incredible track which should have been included not only because it won the Grammy for Record of the Year, but also because it took even bigger meaning after 9/11.  I also would have added &quot;Lemon,&quot; a great single and hit off the Zooropa album which I feel captures the direction u2 were looking into with that album.  Then for the two extra tracks, I would have added &quot;Elevation&quot; off the latest album, it was a big hit and a great, flat out rock song to keep up the pace of the greatest hits album.  Finally, it would have been cool to add on &quot;The Fly&quot; as a bonus track (kind of like &quot;October&quot; on the 80s Best Of).  I feel this is a must, as people forget it was the first single of Achtung Baby, and the first sign of what fans should expect from the u2 in the next decade.<br />2)ELECTRICAL STORM - I fell in love with this song completely even though I had a few minor issues with it. Although received greatly, I wished it was a bigger hit.  My problem is that I wish the original version (which you can find on the B-Sides) was included and not the William Orbit Mix.  The original just gives the song more power, and this more upbeat version brought on by Edge's electric guitar seems to go better with Bono's soaring, soulful lyric.  I enjoy the Orbit mix, I think it is PERFECT for the video, its very classy.  But when listening to it on a CD, at home or in my car, I prefer the original a lot more.  It makes E.S. an incredible rock song.<br />3) REMIXES - Although I enjoy some of the new mixes and a few have grown on me, I would have prefer the orginals to be on the CD.  I figure people are buying this greatest hits compilation beacause they loved the hits over this time period, why change them?<br />I gave this 4 stars because of a few minor problems I had with the compilation, but in the end I enjoy EVERY track and I feel every one has stood the test of time.  It would just be boring to write &quot;hey, great cd, go pick it up.&quot; I feel you can't compare the two different decades and say which one was better, each had a different flavor, goal, and meaning. And for fans who think they'll be a Best of 2000-2010, I gaurantee it.  I think their next album might be one of their best yet.
B00006V9A0|3.0|alright, first off, im a kid. so i wasnt old enough to enjoy Nirvana while they were intact, but when i heard of a new album, i was expecting a rarities album with great unreleased songs like bambi slaughter, pencapchew, in his hands, talk to me, and of course all of the screw-up tracks of kurt in his room and all of that. but NOOO that money-obsessed courtney love stuck us with ONE new unreleased song, that isnt good anyway, and songs we allready own. sorry new fans, go buy Bleach or Incesticide if you want nirvana's best.
B0000683DH|5.0|With the possible exception of First Contact this is easilly the best Star Trek film in my opinion. The extras here are interesting but the films the thing!
B000068TSI|5.0|I've never been a soldier or visited Vietnam, but I had the feeling when I watched this movie that this is probably what it was like for our soldiers.    The film begins in 1965 when Lt. Colonel Hal Moore, of the U. S. Air Calvary is sent to Vietnam with his 400 newly trained soldiers.  They're landed by helicopters right in the middle of a firefight and the men jump out of the helicopters immediately having to defend their lives. Their opponents are 2000 experienced North Vietnamese troops.  This story was very painful to watch.  The Americans were virtually surrounded and facing enemy soldiers who were seasoned and knew the terrain. There's realism about this film that makes the viewer see the true brutality of the battlefield.     Mel Gibson in the role of Moore did an excellent job of portraying a man who cared about his soldiers and wasn't too mucho to let them know.  Greg Kinnear in the part of a helicopter pilot and Sam Elliot as a tough career sergeant major were both terrific in their roles. The wives and children who were waiting back home where also shown which was a touching way to point out the humanity and real lives of the soldiers.     This is the most compelling and realistic war story that I've ever seen.
0312305060|5.0|I had some trepidation about reading this novel.  First, it was a Pulitzer Prize winner.  And while that is supposed to be a badge of honor, often it only seems to work against a novel by setting up overly high expectations.  Second, knowing &quot;The Hours&quot; was a homage to Virginia Woolf's &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; I read that classic work beforehand but found it nearly unbearable. Despite having these two early strikes, Michael Cunningham's novel hits one out of the proverbial literary ballpark.   It flawlessly weaves three narratives - Clarissa Vaughn (nicknamed Mrs. Dalloway), a 50-something editor living in present day New York City - Laura Brown, a troubled housewife reading &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; in 1950s Los Angeles - and a fictionalized account of Virgina Woolf herself as she prepares to write &quot;Mrs. Dalloway.&quot;<br />One review blurb on the book's cover says this is a &quot;tour de force&quot; and it is certainly a fitting description.  The allusions between the fictional character of Mrs. Dalloway and the three women (as well as amongst the three themselves) are truly wonderful.  Perhaps, the only complaint is that the book is TOO well-crafted or gimmicky.  <br />Despite not very much liking it, I must reluctantly recommend that one reads (or attempts to read!) &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; before reading this novel as it will make for a much complete and rich reading experience.  I can not imagine I would have &quot;got&quot; this novel having not worked my way through Woolf's work (which, by the way, is relatively short).  On the heels of this book's transition to the silver screen, there is no better time to read &quot;The Hours.&quot; It is certainly a daunting task as much of the book explores the fragile (and often unspoken) emotional state of the three women.  But in the hands of its stellar cast (including Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman, and Julianne Moore) at least the chances of success appear to be good.  By far this was one of my bestreads of the year.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|What can I say that others have not?  After it was nominated, Michael Medvid and others thought that it should have won for BEST PICTURE at the Academy Awards.  Instead the Academy gave the honor to SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  Never were there two films as diametrically opposed.  BEAUTY AND THE BEAST was family fare with charming music, skillful animation, and a happy ending.  Hannibal the Cannibal, on the other hand, gave us a lurid R-rated tale with gross violence, nudity, and the partial triumph of evil.  The word leaked out that while the Disney production was the better film, the Academy felt compelled to give the award to a film with live-action human actors.  <br />Disney was unprepared for the subsequent backlash against their film from celebrities in the acting field.  Not mentioned on the DVD was the fact that the subsequent Broadway production was, in large part, an attempt at appeasement to the acting community that publicly lamented the use of cartoons over live actors in the musical.  <br />We all know the story.  An inhospitable young man is punished by an enchantress by being transformed into a hairy monster.  His servants are changed into various household items.  They are reduced from persons into things or objects-- always the price of inhospitality.  The Beast has until his 21st birthday to find someone to love who will love him in return.  If he does not, the last petal on a mystical rose will fall and he will remain a monster forever.  When all seems lost, a beautiful girl comes into his life who softens his heart of stone.  A rival suitor will try to kill him, but her love for him will win the day.<br />The story has always been a wonderful metaphor, a parable so to speak.  Without love, we are all monsters.  With love, life is given its meaning and we are changed.<br />>No nudity. <BR>>No vulgar language or blasphemy.<BR>>Plot violence.<BR>>Some female characters are top heavy and revealing.<BR>>A few characters are obvious womanizers and flirtatious.

0061040967|5.0|The end of the Discworld is near, as the geriatric Silver Horde, lead by Cohen the Barbarian, are on their way to Dunmanifestin with the firm intention of blowing up the Gods. They've even kidnapped a minstrel to write the story of their heroic lives. Someone has to stop them, and quickly!<br />So to save the world from total destruction, the Wizards of Unseen University and the Patrician of Ankh-Morpork, Lord Vetinari, have no choice but to call Leonard da Quirm to the rescue. Soon the inventor, along with the very literal Captain Carrot of the City Watch and Rincewind the chicken-hearted WiZZard, embark on a perilous journey aboard the Kite, a bird-shaped flying device powered by Swamp Dragons. According to his calculations, if the Kite goes over the rim at great speed, it'll come back around and rocket right towards the hub, where lies Dunmanifestin, just in time to stop Cohen and his gang.<br />Even though The Last Hero might seems a little bit short, comparatively, of course it has the genuine, punful, Pratchett style that we've all come to love so much. The good side of it is that it's read in no time, eh! And Paul Kidby's lavish illustrations are just astounding. Would do a wonderful gift idea, wouldn't it?
0812550706|4.0|What's this? Nancy's reading a Sci fi book? Yes, Strangely enough it's true. Sci fi has never been my favorite type of book but I actually really enjoyed this one. It tells the story of Andrew &quot;Ender&quot; Wiggum. Ender lives in a futuristic world where humanity has already been ravaged twice by an alien race called the Buggers. To prepare for the next attack they start training commanders from a very early age. So when Ender reaches the age that most of us were still eating paste and finger-painting, he's sent away to Battle School. Ender hates Battle school. Because of his superior intellect he is forced to be separated from all of the other students. He is teased and made fun of. But once he gets used to the school he finds out that he not only enjoys the battle games that the students are forced to play, he's talented. So talented that he surpasses all of his peers easily. But once he gets comfortable everything is taken away from him. Suddenly things are not so fun anymore. And Ender discovers that his destiny is much more complicated than he thinks.<br />People have been recommending this book to me ever since started getting into fantasy but I've always been iffy about it considering I'm not into Sci fi at all. But when about the 6th person recommended it to me, I knew I had to read it. I'm glad I did. Ender's story, although rarely realistic, is absolutely fascinating. The characters are complex and interesting. My personal favorite character is Ender's sister Valentine. I am very interested in reading more about Ender, Peter, Valentine, and the other characters from this book. I'll probably read the rest of the series. Maybe someone could give one to me for Christmas (hint hint). I recommend this book to pretty much everyone into fantasy or sci-fi.
B00006M183|5.0|...It just may be. A truely stunning album, and easily their best since VS., if not Pearl Jam's best ever. Anyone who doesn't enjoy this truely flawless offering is not listening with an open mind and is simply hoping to hear &quot;Even Flow&quot; part 2. <br />Riot Act truely encompasses all the great aspects of Pearl Jam. We get straight out rockers like &quot;Save You&quot;, &quot;Cropduster&quot; Green Disease&quot; and &quot;1/2 Full&quot;. Also present is the experimental, yet brilliant &quot;You Are&quot;. And the soulful, somber tunes are represented with &quot;All or None&quot; and &quot;Thumbing my Way&quot;. <br />This record is really exceptional, and I honestly recommend it to anyone willinging to accept that Pearl Jam are not going to write another song like &quot;Jeremy&quot;, and that they are better off because of that.
B00006RU5B|4.0|Wow...i'm not a good review writer, but reading through the reviews, i didn't see one mention of the 5th track &quot;Like a Stone&quot;...it was this track that made me buy the album..I had to chime in on that...i thought this track had great melody, great energy, and the best solo on the album especially cuz it totally clicked w/the rest of the song..buy this album and listen to that track..the rest of the songs are worth listening to as well...a good collaboration between Cornell and the 3 RATM members that satisfies fans of Soundgarden and RATM.
0375703861|5.0|Hard to understand how some of the reviewers think this book is pointless. If one does not agree with the authors observations and hypotheses that is one thing. But, Zadie makes so many points throughout the novel that a careful reading is mandatory.<BR>I found it extremely insightful at many levels. It is a satire, <BR>( in the &quot;Catch 22 &quot; style ), with continuing references to the core problems that we all face in today's complex society.<br />Hurrah for Zadie.
0385484518|3.0|Right off the bat I thought to myself \\"boring\\", but it wasnt that bad.  I had a particularly hard time with it because my grandmother just died and I, too, am suffering from a fatal disease and dont particularly wan't to talk about dying. However, had I not been so mentally block from the subject matter,perhaps I would haave found it much more entertaining.
0375823352|2.0|<warning: contains spoilers><br />I disagree with a couple of reviewers who felt that Pullman is deliberately attacking our world's Christian God. <br />Rather, he sets the series' church in a different world from ours so that he can show what it could be like if any religious body had become all-powerful, dominating all spheres of life i.e. he posits what our world might've turned out if the Holy Roman Empire after Charlemagne had retained its power (all those inquisitions etc).<br />His point with the trilogy is that extreme religious dogma is bad. The extremist Spanish priest isn't necessarily a bad person, he is a product of his education and belief in the Authority and the specific extreme ideologies of his church. <br />We even find out later that the Authority is actually an angel, the first being of consciousness. Pullman leaves the question of whether there is a true Maker (God) uncertain and unnecessary. His attack is on beings/people who assume leadership and enforce their own ideologies on others, leading them to harm fellow beings. Thus, I don't view it as an attack on God.<br />However, this 3rd installment is pretty weak plot-wise and characterisation-wise. Some of my gripes are about...<br />* Why did he have Balthamos kill off Father Gomez in that violent, almost psycho-detached manner? <br />* In book 2, we expected Serafina Pekkala's role to be larger but she didn't appear in the final battle at all! And how did she enter the mulefas' world?<br />* Mary Malone's sojourn into the land of mulefas was distracting and slowed the pace of the book. Plus the amber spyglass turns out to be pretty unexciting really. Apart from one discovery made from it, it doesn't seem to help the plot along much after that.<br />* Who were the men chasing after Will? This was never followed up. <br />* And what was the deal with the Himalayan people? Are they under the jurisdiction of the church too? How come they're not?<BR>All left unexplained.<br />Perhaps Pullman hadbitten off more than he could chew with his themes and the numerous characters he's introduced over the 3 books. Books 2 and 3 lack the charm and cleverness of the first one. They've turned unwieldy and his sermonising could've been subtler.<br />I would recommend book 1 only.
B00006ZSAD|4.0|Having released what I consider to be some of the most important music of the 90's, Portishead paved the road of trip hop's gloomy, yet beautiful soundscapes. With Portishead on \\"official hiatus\\", Beth has left what they do to in the closet, opting for a heavier mood through pure singing and less sampling. Coupled with the bassist from Talk Talk, (Rustin Man) they have achieved something in the same ballpark as Portishead, yet light years away at the same time. Beth's voice shines brighter on any Portishead record, her lack of the trip hop over-tones helps this along. So think of this as less of a Portishead record and more of a Beth Gibbon's record and you will be pleasantly won over.
0553274503|5.0|This is a very moving novel, but I found it rather unfair.  People often ask why God lets bad things happen to good people.  I wonder why novelists do the same thing.  After one gut-wrenching scene after another (Charlie visits his father, then his mother, Charlie re-lives many painful experiences from his past, et al), I thought that he had earned a happy ending.  Unfortunately, instead of anything positive, the author gives us the bleakest conclusion imagineable.  I mean, I felt for Charlie so much, it killed me to read that ending. Still, it's a great piece of writing, and totally recommended.
B000002UJQ|3.0|Ok,sure Radiohead are a good band with good ideas,but does that really mean they're the second coming? I don't think so.Pink Floyd they are not,and Thom York's vocals seem to be in a high-pitched mono-tone all the way through the album,which gets a little tedious.I don't know,theres just something about them that iritates me,I can't put my finger on it. &quot;So don't listen to it then if you don't like it&quot; i hear you cry.I've played this cd about 8 or 9 times from start to finish and it still hasn't made a difference.I'm sure theres alot of you that say you like Radiohead just because you think you have to.Bloody media.All in all,nothing really special or stand-out-ish about this album or band and a tad overated.And no,I don't listen to Limp Bizkit and co. Thought i'd clarify that before you all get on your high horses.<BR>Bands i do recommend highly : <BR>TOOL... I can't praise this band enough,almost perfect music.And don't you even dare compare York to Maynard James Keenan...easily the best vocalist for the past 15 years<BR>OPETH... Another band that astounds me.Along with Tool,probably the most talented and original bands to grace this otherwise poor music scene.Mikael Ackerfeldt has got an amazing voice,beautiful and soft one minute,the next ,hes tearing his throat open with seemingly minimal effort..the best growl ever..period.<br />DREAM THEATER .....Technicaly amazing,have the best drummer in the world along with Tool's Danny Carey,in Mike Portnoy.Some of the best progressive rock/metal this side of Yes and Rush.
0553260111|5.0|The Bourne Identity<BR>In the opening paragraphs of The Bourne Identity a bullet ridden body is found floating in the Mediterranean Sea by fishermen.  The half dead man is hauled onto a fishing boat and examined by a drunken doctor.  The doctor discovers an I.D. number etched in this man's back. The man with the bullet wounds survives but suffers amnesia. His only clue to his identity is the I.D. numbers the doctor found on him. Later, in a Zurich bank the I.D. number matches a bank account and storage box in which he finds money, weapons and passports with the name Jason Bourne. Then he discovers that he is supposed to be dead. Confused, he holds hostage a woman, named Marie, and together they set out to find out who the man Jason Bourne was.<BR>The author of this book Robert Ludlum, is amazing. One of his strengths is an ability to give an incredible portrait of the main character's thought process along with descriptive details. For example, in one passage he writes,<br />     \\"A crack. Outside the room.  Snaplike, echoing off into a sharp coda, the sound       penetrating, diminishing in the distance. Bourne opened his eyes.<BR>       The staircase. The staircase in the filthy hallway outside his room. Someone had been walking up the steps and had stopped, aware of the noise his weight had caused on the warped, cracked wood. A normal boarder at the Steppdeckstrasse rooming house would have no concerns.<BR>        Silence.<BR>       Crack.  Now closer.  A risk was taken, timing paramount, speed the cover. Jason spun off the bed, grabbing the gun that was by his head, and lunged to the wall by the door. He crouched, hearing footsteps -one man- the runner, no longer concerned with the sound, only with reaching his destination. Bourne had no doubt what it was; he was right.<BR>        The door crashed open: he smashed it back, then threw his full weight into the wood, pinning the intruder against the doorframe...\\"<br />Another strength of Robert Ludlum is his ability to create a believable plot; though the stories are outrageous, he can still make the reader believe them. In one chapter of the book while going through files Jason Bourne finds a story containing a theory of JFK's assassination and in my mind it is still a possibility.<BR>Although he has many strengths, in this novel there was one weakness. In a few passages the place and setting was not explained. It was as if he left it to the reader's imagination to picture the setting. This seems to be his only flaw and it is pretty minor.<BR>In conclusion, I thought this book was extremely intriguing and it was very hard to put down. This was because every chapter there was more information about Jason Bourne and I wanted to find out more. It was a novel filled with cruel villains and wise officials who either helped or impeded Jason's findings. So if you are drawn to action and suspense thrillers, read The Bourne Identity by Robert Ludlum.

0385121679|4.0|i had not seen the movie before reading this book so i was not sure what to expect exactly. i was in for a pleasant surprise! the book is basically about a writer of whom cannot controll his anger or his drinking, and both seem to continue to have him shut doors upon himself! the drinking he gets in check, as for the attitude, he tries but not before it gets the better of him and he looses his job as a debate teacher for an incident he has with a student! hence we have the overlook hotel. with what seems to be a his last chance, he is offered a job as the caretaker at a huge, and very old hotel in maine that shuts down in the winters becouse of the snow storms. unfortionaly for jack and his family this is no normal hotel, and with danny (jacks boy) being able to &quot;shine&quot; it makes for some very interesting problems. fore come to find out the overlook has some very, very interesting and colorful backgrounds!! shinning is basicly described as being with a sixth sense or hearing and seeing things that normal people cannot! in the end basicaly this hotel is living and likes the terrance family ecspealiy danny, and doesnt want the to leave...ever! being snowed end with no phone just doesnt seem to help matters!! a definite personal fav. and would recamend to anyone!

0761536434|5.0|Steve Kent has done a fine job of amassing countless interviews, facts, and anecdotes to provide a very entertaining and insightful look at the history of video games. I especially enjoyed reading about the early years up to the crash and subsequent decline of the arcade industry through the 80's. Don't just take Steve's word for it though, the book is filled with direct quotes from practically every major player in the video game industry. From Nintendo to Sega, from Atari to Midway, frome Intellivision to Colecovision, from Commodore to 3DO, it's all in here. I really can't think of one aspect of the video game industry that was left out. Very impressive job.
B00004XPQ2|5.0|In my list of the top ten movies of all time there is a place for  &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;.  This movie has just about everything; great acting, great directing, great music, great cinematography, a great, multi-layered story line, and a message for all humanity.  The great acting includes William Holden who brings his usual swagger to his character.  However, the audience finds themselves focussed on the acting of Alec Guinness and Sessue Hayakawa and their mental chess game of a struggle for power.  This aspect of the movie would qualify for greatness by itself.  The cinematography is outstanding and underscores much of what the director tries to bring out.  This is one of those movies worth seeing on the big screen if you can find a theatre that shows old(er) movies.<br />The story essentially involves British POW's having to build a bridge deep in the jungle of Burma.  The Japanese prison commander is insistant that officers work along side their men.  The British commander refuses to alow this to happen.  This is the chess game between Guinness and Hayakawa.  An American POW (Holden) escapes towards the beginning of the movie and is drafted to return to the POW camp in a guerilla action to destroy the bridge.  During this 160 minute film, there is ample action, plenty of sub-plots and a lot of brilliant symbolism.  My favorite is a gun battle between the guerillas and a Japanese patrol deep in the jungle.  We have an early glimpse of a number of sleeping bats as the scene develops.  When the action starts, the gunfire disturbs the bats who blacken the sky as they come to life.  This imagery of turning peace into chaos is itself symbolic of the ultimate anti-war message of the movie.  The idea of the British soldiers building, with misguided pride, a bridge in the jungle only to have it destroyed upon completion is a message about the pointlessness of war.  The brilliance of this movie is that it can be enjoyed equally by WWII buffs and anti-warprotestors.  Each time you watch it you pick out a little bit more than you saw before.  If you haven't seen this movie, you've been cheating yourself.
B00006V9A0|5.0|A must for all you Nirvana fans out there, it really has some of their best stuff on it, including my favorite, Pennyroyal Tea, and the unrealeased You Know you're right. It really showcases what Kurt, Dave and Krist did best: make music.
B00006L9ZT|2.0|I'm afraid this production doesn't making very enjoyable viewing/listening as the performances get gradually worse as the cycle progresses.<br />Rheingold proves to be a promising start, but the tension begins to sag a bit in Walkure. A big decline in performance standards greets the viewer/listener in Siegfried whereas Gotterdammerung provides an anti-climatic end through some lifeless tempos and inadequate singing.<br />I'm OK with the staging but it isn't much help to the performance as a whole. I've no regret buying the set, but I'm indeed quite disappointed by the performances.
0380002930|5.0|After reading Watership Down, I can truly say that it was one of the best books that I have ever read.  Reading this book was an incredible experience-going on adventures with Hazel and his friends, listening to the stories of El-ahrairah, and learning from them, was a time that I will never forget.<BR> One of the most enjoyable aspects of the novel were the characters.  Richard Adams brilliantly describes them in rich detail so you feel like you have known them all of your life.  They are in such detail that they are like people, with feelings, hopes and ambitions.  After finishing the novel, I felt like calling up Hazel on the phone to see how the warren was, or maybe call up Dandelion for a story about El- ahrairah and his many adventures.  After reading the novel, I have such vivid pictures of these characters in my mind.  Although I loved all the characters in the novel, there was one who really stood out in my mind.  That character was Hazel, the leader of the rabbits in the story.  Hazel led the group of then hlessil (wandering rabbits) through the wilderness, and got them a home.  Then after finding a home Hazel defended and preserved it.  Without Hazel, these rabbits would probably have died.  I admire Hazel because of his great qualities: kindness, leadership, and forgivingness, for when he let Strawberry come along with them after leaving Cowslip's warren.  To me, Hazel is now like an old friend who will be imprinted in my mind forever.  Richard Adams does an outstanding job of creating characters.  Watership Down is a long book-over 400 pages, so an important step in writing the book would be how to keep the reader interested.<BR> I admit, when I went to the library to get Watership Down, after it was recommended to me, I was intimidated by its size.  I've read long books before, but this one was one of the longest.  While reading the book, I was very surprised at how fast it went.  With its wonderful characters, meaningful events, and a whole culture ofthe rabbit way of life the pages seem to turn themselves.  When reading the book, Adams makes it so that you want to know what happens next.  There are some scenes where someone is close to death and you feel compelled to read very quickly in search of what will happen to that person.  There were more than a few close calls in Watership Down.  Richard Adams has a remarkable gift for writing an exciting and interesting novel.<BR> Above all, reading Watership Down was a learning experience.  I learned that with perseverance and determination you can achieve anything.  Hazel and his friends left their warren with nothing, and they went on to succeed at anything that came in their way.  Also, on the smaller scale, I leaned that just because a book is over 400 pages doesn't mean that it is unreadable.  Watership Down is now one of my most favorite books.  In terms of recommending it, I would recommend it to everyone above ages 8 or 9 because it is a very complex story that you have to focus all your attention on.  Watership Down is an extraordinary novel about friendship, determination, and adventure that everyone should experience.

B00006JSS8|2.0|If you are rather poor and can only afford one CD of Stevie Wonder, then I still don't suggest purchasing this one.  Better to get any record from &quot;For Once In My Life&quot; to &quot;Hotter than July&quot; except perhaps &quot;Journey through the Secret Life of Plants&quot;.  I personally recomend the often overlooked &quot;Music of My Mind&quot;, the deservedly heralded &quot;Innervisions&quot;, or the underrated &quot;Fulfillingness' First Finale&quot;.  (I would also recommend &quot;Songs In the Key of Life) but that's two CD's and anyone rich enough to make such a splurge is advised to just get all the albums, preferably on vynil so that you hear what Stevie wanted you to hear and not what some two bit studio engineer ratcheted off after he was done playing with it.
0064471837|5.0|This has to be one of the best fantasy stories ever written. Garth Nix weaves a world that is unique and believable (unlike 90%+ of other \\"fantasy\\" literature)that entraps the reader and makes you fall in love with the characters. The story moves a little slow to begin with, but soon picks up the pace and has you asking for more. With an ending that is both bitter and sweet, it will keep you turning till the last.<br />I myself, am a bit of an purist and a snob when it comes to the genre of fantasy, and tend not to read any unless it us up to par with the classics. Sabriel definately falls under that umbrella and it will continue to be so.<br />Sabriel is listed as a \\"Young Adult/Intermediate Reader\\" title in most, if not all stores, but it is an all ages book. I highly, higly reccomend this for fans of \\"fantasy\\" of all ages. Also read \\"Lirael\\" the sequel to Sabriel, as well as \\"Abhorsen\\" (when it is released in January). Lets give Garth Nix the recognition he deserves!
B000068PQ0|5.0|This is just a great, quirky, fun record -- the songwriting is good, the performances are good, the choice of instrumentation is really great -- this is what rock should be.  If you can conceive of the melodic abilities of Pavement combined with the quirky songwriting of Guided by Voices, and throw in a little Ween and Wilco, you have a bit of an idea of what you'll get here.  But Flaming Lips may be the best of the bunch.  Oh, below, someone rated it poorly and said it sounds like Neil Young in his Trans phase?  Well, there are some to whom that couldn't be higher praise.  I agree, and that's why I love the record (and if they want to go on reminding people of Neil Young, who could argue with that?).  Really, the only things that link this music to Neil is the strong songwriting, freedom from formula, lively intelligence and strong melodic sense.  And that ain't bad at all.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Awesome soundtrack, fights, storyline. What more can I say ?
B00000JLWW|2.0|Why this movie was such a blockbuster I have no idea.  The script is tepid, the direction is OK at best and the performances merely adequate.<br />But hey!  It's got that neato ship that strikes an iceberg and sinks!  I'm telling you, the last hour of the film makes up for the two hours of preceding boredom.  If you hate all the characters in &quot;Titanic&quot; remember that almost everyone dies in the end--and you'll feel better.
0792151712|5.0|Not a lot of  movies appeal to me. However, this one makes the cut. It is excellent, a masterpiece. There's action, tons of drama, love, and historical details overflowing this movie making it so wonderful. I would deffinetly recommend it to anyone.
B00003CX95|5.0|Mel Gibson delivers a stellar performance, aided by James Horner's soundtrack. Spectacular battle scenes, a semi-fictional romantic twist. Who knew history could be so interesting...
B00006CXSS|5.0|I didn't see anyone mention this so I thought I would. The image is so crisp during the interviews especially, that you'd swear you could reach out and touch the vets.<br />Also the sound is extremely well done in DTS. bullets wizzing past your left speaker will woosh on past your rear left. You can hear following solders running behind the camera when it's following a solder up front. I was quite impressed.<br />Everything else reviewers have mentioned here is true as well, so I won't rehash.
0316666343|1.0|I had read all the glowing reviews of this book in newspapers and magazines, saw the author interviewed on the today's show, read the mostly 5-star reviews other people gave the book on this website, and heard a friend of mine simply rave about it--so I bought it and could not even force myself to finish it.  The premise was so creative and it could have been a great story. Yet, the writing was so basic and not flowing.  It was painful.  I knew as soon as I read the first silly description of Heaven, including a Heaven in-take counselor, that reading this book was a mistake.  Why do people like this book??
0312305060|5.0|\\"The Hours\\" is aptly named, as one would expect from a Pulitzer Prize winning author.  Like an hour, it can be singularly beautiful, a momentary flash and very long indeed.  Like the hours of our lives, it can feel fragmented, full, and intact--in increments or all at once.<br /><br /> Michael Cunningham has written a literary novel firmly revisiting the 1920s, Virginia Woolf and her novel, \\"Mrs. Dalloway.\\" I thought I would remember enough about Woolf's work to do justice to \\"The Hours.\\"  I was wrong. You, too, may want to reread the book to which \\"The Hours\\" pays tribute, if you are determined to get the most from it, hear the lingering whispers, find the subtle innuendoes, recognize the implications.<br /><br /> The story is told primarily from the viewpoint of three women whose lives we find are inexplicably intertwined.  A reader must be prepared that Cunningham-who has paid his dues-randomly breaks the rules that we, as new millennium readers, have come to expect. Most of us are not accustomed to a story told in first person, present tense. Many of us have not read a work that uses stream of consciousness since we read Faulkner in college. Cunningham jumps-effectively but unfamiliarly-from point of view to point of view.<br /><br /> Perhaps it is time that those of us who have gotten rusty extend ourselves a bit, both to improve our skills and our understanding.  This is a story about death and resurrection.  It seems an affirmation of lives that we may find trifling, insignificant.  Somehow, gently-very gently-Cunningham makes us see that existence is, after all, promising.  Even if you plan to wait for the movie, you may wish you had \\"read the book first\\" and \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" before that.<br />Carolyn Howard-Johnson, author of \\"This is the Place\\"
B00003CX5P|4.0|Lets start by saying that this movie will not live up to the hype that fans of the original trilogy have set. THE PHANTOM MENACE is an introduction movie, nothing more, so don't expect a really spectacular film. This is the first of the series, just like A NEW HOPE was the first of the original series, and A NEW HOPE wasn't that good either. In this first installment, we are introduced to the galaxy before it collapsed. The beautifully designed planet Coruscant is the home of the Republic and the home base of the Jedi Knights. Another planet, Naboo, the home of Queen Amidala and the gungans, is nicely designed to resemble a palace. And Tatooine, is a planet that resembles a home for the poor, also home of Anakin Skywalker. THE PHANTOM MENACE starts off in space where Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Won Kenobi are forced to settle a trade dispute, which happens to go bad. Then realize the Trade Federation is planning an attack on Naboo. Both head to Naboo to warn Queen Amidala of the attack. Then decide to leave to Coruscant where the Queen will be safe. But instead are forced to land on Tatooine where they meet Anakin Skywalker. The special effects are amazing. The pod race is absolutely great. The light saber fights are spectacular, and the war scene in space is really good. But the story is just a little confusing. Why does the Trade Federation want to start a war with Naboo ? I just don't understand. But THE PHANTOM MENACE delivers exactly what I had in mind, a decent first movie, which A NEW HOPE was as well. Let me say this, THE PHANTOM MENACE is just a setup. Thats it. A setup to what will be a great film. Just like A NEW HOPE was a setup to the spectacular THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. So just accept THE PHANTOM MENACE for that... Also a great DVD for the additional behind-the-scenes footage.
0312305060|3.0|An impressive exercise, but an exercise nonetheless, this short novel never quite manages to stake its own artistic territory.  Cunningham has beautifully pared his prose, but the effect remains one of effort rather than inspiration.  Stylistically, it's intense but rather sterile, and the characters' alienation, without compelling narrative as its backdrop, lacks larger resonance--the story which Cunningham does supply, of lost love and longing, is anodyne in the extreme, and ultimately unnecessary.
0393314804|5.0|Trainspotting is a truly honest look at modern life from the perspective of a group of young people in Scotland. It's written in Scottish dialect, which is frustrating at first but ultimately adds to the overall appeal of the novel and really draws the reader into the lives of the characters, and although there are several characters, the story is not difficult to follow.  The range of characters show life from all perspectives, and not just life in Scotland.  The character's frustrations, motivations, and observations can really be applied to any culture.  <BR> This book is one of my favorite books of all time.  There are some amazing passages that comment on the absurdity of modern life in an honest and humorous way.  The \\"choose life\\" speech is so popular because  it speaks to this generation in it's disregard for socially constructed ideals.  People reading this book will question what it is that makes society really care about people using drugs:  why is it our problem?  Is it simply because their giving up on life reflect the futility of our lives?  Are we simply trying to make them play our game and \\"choose life\\" along with everyone else?  It's really a wonderful book for anyone who wants to examine the motives behind societal constructions.  <BR> It's surprising how funny this book can be, considering some of the truly grotesque or disturbing moments that make up much of the story.  Welsh writes clearly and brilliantly, and I laughed out loud at several passages in the book.  There are other parts that are truly disturbing and thought-provoking, like the descent of a once clean Tommy into drug addiction and ultimate death.<BR> I would recommend seeing the movie as well.  The film makers did a decent job of maintaining the essence of the novel and not altering (most of) it for audience-approval, although a lot of the book is missing from the movie due to time constraints.  Also, there are some scenes that are just better portrayed on screen, like the infamoustoilet scene.  Ideally, I'd watch the movie, read the book, then watch the movie again if there were time, just to be able to really note the differences in the two. If you've seen the movie already and haven't read the book, read it.  You know books are always better than movies, and while the film is a good adaptation it leaves a lot out.  <BR> I'd highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in getting a picture of a different face of society.  Like I said, it's amazingly well-written, humorous, disturbing, and profound.  If you are even remotely interested, I would definitely pick it up.
B0000541AM|5.0|This movie has got it all. It was made in 1979 so you know it has all the ingredients. From the first scene of the train coming up the Brooklyn subway to the final scene of the survivors strutting down the Coney Island beach to the tune \\"Survival in the City\\", it's a great ride. The different gangs are great, too. The Lizzies, the Baseball Furies, the Orphans...Each have their own distinct stlye that you can really get a feel for. And the running, everywhere. Subways, streets, through the parks, running for their lives! The music is great and crisp on the DVD and the picture quality awesome seeing how  it was mostly shot at night. The fight scenes were done right like they should be in a movie that kicks as much tush as this one. I only wished they included the daytime scene, wish I really thought they'd put on the DVD. Oh well. Rock on, Warriors.

0679720200|2.0|The stranger is about a man who has no emotion and is indifferent to the world. In the beginning, the man's mother dies, and he doesn't show any feelings. Next, he meets a girl but won't tell her that he loves her. Later, the man kills an Arab on a beach and is put in prison. While in his trial the man is bored and is eventually sentenced to have his head cut off. While waiting for his execution, he tells the chaplain that he doesn't believe in God and never will. The book ends with him in prison, waiting hopelessly for his execution.<BR>I did not particularly like this book. It is boring to read a book when the character has no emotion. I also thought that there wasn't enough action and that the ending was pointless.
0767849493|4.0|Prepare to be annoyed, amused and alarmed when you watch this satirical saga of an ordinary Catholic woman who gets drafted to stop two wayward angels from taking advantage of a loophole in church doctrine and messing up Life As We Know It. If you can get past the overabundant use of 4-letter words, it is a marvelous jab at those of us who like our religion sanitized. The prophets WERE annoying, the Old Testament WAS violent, and the Whole Point of faith is not the details of dogma but the faith itself. Add to this some refreshing takes on who was who in the Bible, and it's thought-provoking and funny at the same time. Lest you think that the movie was made by someone who hated the church, read the opening words and the credits carefully: they tell of someone who has really wrestled with his faith and emerged with a sense of humor and a lot of questions.
B00006RU5B|5.0|With all the dull, feel sorry for me bands like Staind, the tiresome pop-rock blandness of Creed, all the Kinks rip off bands and all the Nirvana-Alice In Chains sound alikes invading the airwaves, the long awaited teaming of Rage Against The Machine members and Sound Garden front man Chris Cornell is here to save rock from itself! What an amazing marriage! Audioslave's debut album is an awesome collection of explosive guitars (led by the innovative and vastly under rated guitar virtuoso Tom Morello), passionate vocals and in your face rock & roll. <br />Every track on this album excells in its own way. Cornell's voice still sounds as potent as ever and his lyrics have never shined as brightly (his lyrics make a bit more sense now that Cornell is older and wiser). Rage has left their political agendas behind (save for the fight-the-power web address found in the liner notes) and arrive to show us what underappreciated musicians they truly are -- Rage's message and rap/rock sound, although outstanding in its own way, sometimes cloaked the musical talents of this band but, with Audioslave, they come at you full throddle. It's a musical merging of epic perportions and Audioslave is the best rock album to come out in a long, long time.
B00006CXXU|4.0|After listening to this CD, I began to really admire Christina - for her guts, her depth, and her talent.  <br />Her guts:  I think Christina knows very well that not everyone will like her new style of music - I, for instance, prefer her songs on the 1st album.  However, instead of always doing things to please others, and doing brain-less, heart-less, soul-less songs like some of her peers just because those songs sell, Christina chooses to be her own self and takes the risks.  It should be evident by now that \\"Stripped\\" will not come anywhere close to the commercial success of the 1st album - and yet, \\"Stripped\\" is a much better piece of work artistically (because it's so different from what's out there right now and it's so heartfelt), and something that Christina should be more proud of.<br />Her talent:  Christina has the voice of an angel, AND she writes the songs herself too.  Need I say more?  <br />Her depth: Christina is not a teenage poptart anymore (despite her image in \\"Dirrty\\", which is unfortunate) - she's outgrown every single one of her peers, and she IS a woman now, putting her heart and soul into her songs.  You can feel the emotional intensity and the hard work that went behind this album.  <br />Don't be fooled - \\"Stripped\\" isn't doing great in the charts for someone with Christina's talent and stardom, but it is a first-rate album from a true artist who's not afraid to show the world who she is, and who is breaking new grounds and creating a new, different sound.
B00006J3WH|5.0|When I first started watching the show I knew that it was something really special. I thought the writers can't possibly make the show even greated than it already is. Then came along the musical episode. You have to see it to know how wonderful it really is. My favourite song is &quot;Under Your Spell&quot;. Amber Benson can really sing. Anthony Stewart Head has a wonderful voice as does James Marsters. Sarah Michelle Gellar has a pretty voice. Emma Caufield is a nice singer. Hinton Battle is brilliant. Nicholas Brendon is an ok singer. Some people thought he wasn't good but I liked his voice. Alyson Hannigan barely had any singing parts but I believe she told Joss Whedon that she couldn't really sing. Great episode and soundtrack. Plus the bonus material is awesome.:)<BR>Buy it!
B000002B30|5.0|This is a great collection of Springsteen career but it could have been so much more probably better served by a two disc set. There should have been more tracks from his career from the 1970s and 1980s before his huge success in 1984 with born in the u.s.a. such as jhonny 99 from the nebraska album. There are also tracks that should have been added after born in the u.s.a such as from albums such as tunnel of love and ghost of tom joad. Some live tracks would have also been good.
0066214122|5.0|Just as \\"Jurassic Park\\" was a cautionary tale for the dangers of tampering with the genetic code, so to is \\"Prey\\" a warning.  This time, Michael Crichton has chosen to explore the potential and hazards of nanotechnology; the fashioning of robots at the molecular level.  The power of these machines is that they are small enough to go anywhere, and their capabilities are limited only by human creativity.  However, since they are so small, they need to be able to apply adaptive learning in order to accomplish their assigned tasks, and that's where the trouble starts.<br />The novel begins with Jack Forman, stay at home dad, and long time, but currently unemployed software engineer, shopping for placemats.  This touch of normalcy sets up an environment where Crichton can rapidly ratchet up the tension, as an all-American home life turns distinctly scary.  Moreover, Crichton has written the book in the first person, so the reader really has the opportunity to roam around Jack's head.  As a result, Jack may be the best character Crichton has written to date.  His emotions leap off the page, and his thought processes allow Crichton to seamlessly integrate necessary expository elements into the flow of the novel.<br />Of course, Jack doesn't remain the house-husband for long.  It turns out that there are problems at Xymos Corporation, where his wife is a vice-president.  It seems that they've lost control of some of the nano-particle swarms that they were working on, and they need Jack to help bring them back into the fold.  As it turns out, Jack wrote an early version of the software (which is based upon predator-prey relationships) that is being used as the brains behind the swarm.  As an added level of intrigue, Jack suspects that his wife is having an affair with one of the people at Xymos' fabrication plant.<br />I don't want to say much more for fear of ruining the plot, but as one would expect, the situation quickly spirals out of control in typical Crichton-esque fashion.  Specifically, I think I can say without giving anything away, that he does a superb job of imbuing what are essential machines with an incredible sense of malice.  Anyone who thinks that tiny machines acting in groups aren't scary will quickly have their minds changed by this novel.<br />As with all of Crichton's best work \\"Prey\\" leaves you not only entertained, but feeling like you learned something as well.  At the same time, unlike \\"Jurassic Park\\" and \\"Timeline\\" which employed technically possible, but functionally questionable technology, nanotechnology is on its way, and is already here to a degree.  Already there are microchip sized laboratories that can perform dozens of experiments on a single drop of blood, and there are exotic materials custom built for specific functions from the molecular level.  It is entirely likely, even probable, that within ten or twenty years, we will see some crude version of the technology that plays the central role in the novel.  As a result, Crichton writes with a sense of urgency that makes this a thriller you don't want to put down.  This is definitely one of his best novels to date: an incredibly exciting story filled with cutting edge, but easily understood, technology.  A must read!<br />Enjoy!
B00003CX8Y|5.0|The best love story that was ever told is not Titanic.  For the greatest love story that was ever told is nothing but Beauty and the Beast.  The story of Beauty and the Beast has been told from generation to generations, it is indeed true that it is a tale as old as time.  Love does not found on appearance, but love is found within, that is what Beauty and the Beast all about.    It comes with 2 discs.  Disc one (main disc).  Disc two (Supplemental Features)    When Disc 1 is inserted, it automatically plays the sneek peeks:  - Jungle Book 2  - The Lion King (Imax version)  - Beauty and the Beast (Enchanted Christmas Special Edition)  - Lilo & Stich (Beauty and the Beast) &  - Sleeping Beauty (Special Edition)    After that, an eye popping and jaw dropping of 3D rendered intro bringing you to the interactive DVD menu:    The film features 3 version:    Special Edition  Original Theatrical Edition  Work-In-Progress Edition    Special Edition: Figuring a never-seen-before musical footage known as \\"Human Again\\".  This song was taken out from normal edition because it causes timing error that sadly the song as to take out.  At January 1st 2002,  This special edition was shown on Imax Theatre as well as other giant screen theatres.  It was shown in Singapore Science Center from January 2002 to June 2002 as well.  Since there are no giant screen theatre in Malaysia, My girlfriend and I went to Singapore, purposely to catch this wonderful show.  It comes with 3 audio channel:  - English  - French &  - Audio Commentary    Since the story is on France background, French is definately can not be excluded.  Audio Commentary is another interesting audio, the director commented every moments in the film with interesting stories happened during production.    It also comes with 2 subtitles:  -  Sing-along track  -  English    The Sing-along track is sub-title only on musical sequences.    Work-In-Progress Edition:  It is shown in 1991 New York Film Festival.  You can see many ofthe sketches, pencil drawing, concept arts are playing on this version.    Disc 1 also features a small interactive game called \\"Break The Spell\\".  A kiddie game, nothing much worth to mention here.    Disc 2 features a lot of information and fun staffs.  I can't list them one by one, it is just too many of it.  However, I would like to highlight the main interesting ones on Disc 2.  -  The Making of Beauty and the Beast  -  The Story Behind The Story (hosted by Celine Dion)  -  MTV of Beauty and the Beast      o Sung by Celine Dion & Peabo Bryson      o Pop version, sung by Jump 5 (not too bad actually)    It comes with a nice full coloured booklet covering:  -  Introduction by the Producer Don Hahn  -  Sitemaps of Disc 1 and Disc 2.  Typically sitemaps of Disc 2, due to the huge contents, the middle page is folded in.  When you flip open the middle page, it reviews a panoramic containing the full sitemap of the Disc 2.  -  Features of the DVDs    A must-have for a DVD collectors especially you are a Disney animation fans and Beauty and the Beast fans.
0060523794|1.0|I feel the high rating of this book is because most (in the know) who have had their fill of Gerstner could not justify buying it. Only an egotist would dare to look back at what occurred during that 10 year period, and try to paint them self as a genius. <br />Gerstner failed to take credit for decimating the birthplace of IBM, Endicott NY, which already had an economy that was in decline. In the process of doing this, he dumps money that could have help revive Endicott, into Albany NY. I guess when the tax incentives run out it is time to move on, and as long as the technology stayed in NY, politicians who benefited from the Albany buildup could not get too upset (Yes George, I mean you).<br />&quot;The dotcoms are dottoast&quot;, a quote from king louie V. This is after the tech bubble burst. Lost in the shuffle is the fact that months before the bubble burst millions were spent positioning the behemoth to be a dotcom generator using packaged hardware and software. If lou was so gifted, why did he wait until the end of the tech expansion to decide that becoming a dotcom generator was a good idea?<br />How about inflated stock buybacks. Is that the stuff geniuses are made of, or can anyone do it?<br />How about the body count (i.e. layoffs). Is that the stuff geniuses are made of, or can anyone do it?<br />&quot;In the end, when Lou bids farewell to the new IBM, he admits that his heart has become a &quot;true Blue&quot;.&quot; A quote from a previous post. However, this does not explain why sir lou dumped his stock upon leaving IBM. Is that something that someone who is considered &quot;true&quot; to a company would do? I am sure there are many out there, but the only company head I know who is true to their company is Bill Gates, who for the most part only sells stock so he can donate money to charitable organizations. Old lou is true blue because the compensation package he received ensures he never has to spend a cent off his own money. <br />In summary, the book is nothing but an egotist's attempt to paint a rosy picture for those who are unaware of the destruction he caused. In the end, in spite of the actions of sir lou, the recovery in the economy saved IBM.
B00006LSM3|5.0|This is the last great gift from an extraordinary man. Thankyou, George, for bringing tears to my eyes, because I know you're still around and making beautiful music. <br />This album is wonderful and absolutely stunning; please buy it, because it is just great to listen to. I've listened to it ten times already and all I can say is &quot;wow!&quot; It's wonderful for Beatles fans, George fans, Wilbury fans, or simply people who want to appreciate wonderful moving music.
0060512806|3.0|An excellent story, very well written, but with way too many asides, and lengthy ones at that.  Out of the 900+ pages, I think I only read about 600 - skipped all the pages where he shows his extensive knowledge of acrane information that had little to do with the story.  If the editor had chopped out all of that stuff it would be a 5 star read.
B00003CXPJ|4.0|It's not plot heavy or brainy, just a cute comedy that makes you suspect Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson have read too many Cosmo and Vanity Fair interviews of female Super Models assuming that and explaining why they're so great, and not  just because &quot;they're incredibly good-looking.&quot;  Watching these guys imitate the mannerisms and trite speech of these most, uh, vacuous of celebrities is hilarious.  Look for Wilson as supermodel Hansel dressed as an angel at the VH1 awards trying to emote his awareness and spirituality and don't forget to note the incredible differences between Zoolander's copyrighted &quot;looks&quot; like &quot;Blue Steel&quot; and the much awaited &quot;Magnum.&quot;
B00006RU5B|5.0|In the days where bands like Nickelback, Puddle of Mudd, Saliva, Linkin Park, Default, Creed, etc, are the norm and topping the charts, good rock music is hard to come by.  Enter Audioslave.<br />Featuring members of 2 of the greatest and most influential rock bands of the 1990s, Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine, including one of the greatest guitar players ever, Tom Morello, Audioslave gives us the best album of the year easily, and possibly the best album period since Tool's Lateralus of 2001.<br />This self-titled debut features 14 amazing tracks such as the well-known, energetic single Cochise, to the ballad I am the Highway, and everything in between.  Not one track on this album disappoints.<br />In short, if you are a fan of real rock music and are sick of most of what today has to offer, pick this up today.
B00005Y7LD|5.0|This is a very cool cd. The front of the cd case booklet looks like a boy I know named Blake. I love the songs on there. if you dont have this cd, buy it.
B000001Y2U|5.0|Buy this album and everything that this man has done, he really needs to be listened to. OK so this isn't exactly a review of this particular album but the other reviews are all fine. It's more to do with the vital importance that this man and his genre of music represent. His overboard shock tactics are simply to kick you into listening. Sure record company's are scared of difficult artists like Manson and would prefer the baby bands that fill the charts.<br />However, he has some interesting things to say. In the \\"bowling for Columbine film\\" he describes how he pretty much got the blame for the shootings because the two boys listened to one of his albums. Yes he looks scary and the music is dark and industrial BUT you know what you're getting and what he's really doing is empathising and reflecting disaffection because he experienced it. His album gives modern theatrics to Book of Revelation's rise of the Antichrist to world domination without anyone copping on, wonder who/what he means here? A goofy smile in a suit? Manson uses music and lyrical imagery to empathise with deep trauma but this has nothing to do with it's cause. Peel back the layers of the fear based consumer society that we have to live in and it's not a world away from a Manson soundtrack. This extremely talented and erudite musician needs to be listened to and not marginalised. His shock tactics are required to challenge the pure evil of our excuse for a society. When Michael Moore asks Manson what he would say to the kids at Columbine, he said nothing, he'd just listen, because nobody else did, well let's listen to him.

B00000JMOF|5.0|Although I have seen better prints of the film, this DVD issue of Universal Studio's famous FRANKENSTEIN is a magnificient  package that is sure to delight any fan of classic horror.  The film itself has been restored for content, and the Skal-hosted documentary--which traces the story from Mary Shelly's famous novel through its numerous film incarnations--is a delight, including numerous interviews with various historians, critics, and Karloff's daughter.  The bonus audio track by Rudy Behlmer is also quite interesting, as are the various biographies and notes, and although the short film BOO is a spurious mix of footage from NOSFERATU, DRACULA, THE CAT AND THE CANARY, and FRANKENSTEIN, it is an enjoyable little throw-away.  All in all, it doesn't get much better than this.<br />As for the film itself, the production of FRANKENSTEIN was prompted by the incredible success of the earlier DRACULA--but where DRACULA is a rather problematic and significantly dated film, FRANKENSTEIN was and remains one of the most original horror films to ever emerge from Hollywood.  Much of the credit for this goes to director James Whale, who by all accounts was deeply influenced by silent German film and his own traumatic experiences during World War I--and who mixed those elements with occasional flourishes of macabre humor to create a remarkably consistent vision of Mary Shelly's original novel.<br />Whale was extremely, extremely fortunate in his cast.  Colin Clive was a difficult actor, but Whale not only managed to get him through the film but to draw from him his finest screen performance; Mae Clarke is a memorable Elizabeth; and Dwight Frye, so memorable in DRACULA, tops himself as Fritz.  But all eyes here are on Boris Karloff as the monster.  Karloff had been kicking around Hollywood for a decade, and although he appeared in quite a few films before FRANKENSTEIN he never really registered with the public.  But in this role, acting under heavy make-up, weighed down by lead weights in his shoes and struts around his legs, and without a line of intelligible dialogue he offered a performance that transcended the word &quot;monster.&quot;  This is a suffering being, dangerous mainly through innocence of his own power and the way of the world, goaded from disaster to disaster to disaster.  Even some seventy-plus years later, it is difficult to imagine any other actor in the part.<br />Karloff would play the monster again in two later films, one of them directed by Whale, but although THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN is a remarkable film in its own right, this is the original combination of talents and the original vision.  Truly a national treasure, to be enjoyed over and over again.  Strongly recommended.ights in his shoes and struts around his legs, and without a line of intelligible dialogue he offered a performance that transcended the word &quot;monster.&quot;  This is a suffering being, dangerous mainly through innocence of his own power and the way of the world, goaded from disaster to disaster to disaster.

B00006YXEK|4.0|The album is overall quite a pleasant surprise. Nice songs, well done, many quite moving. I think the Hawaiin blues song is me fave. Of course, I don't like Jeff Lynne's production, but I try not to let that ruin the experience of such good songs.<BR>As far as the Bonus DVD goes, it's kinduva gyp. Just a short infomercial, though the interview with George is nice. I say just get the regular Cd, and wait for a record that offers a DVD worthy of the extra cash. Tom Petty's The Last DJ, for example, has a much more satisfying Bonus DVD on its Special Edition.

B00005JKMQ|4.0|Some  films are made great by their by action, others by being a great story, others by the soundtrack or special effects.  This movie like a few others was made by one characterization.  Will Smith IS Muhammad Ali, primarily because he has worked to make Ali's voice and inflections his own.  It is an incredibly convincing performance, and to the reviewer who said that Smith could not capture Ali, I ask whom he would suggest instead?  It is hard for me to disagree more with another Amazon[.com] colleague, and I would instead concur with another reviewer who noted this film shows the ability to have a single Oscar-caliber performance in a film which even the biggest fans acknowledge is not likely to be the best film of the year.  <br />I guess the real challenge accepted and dealt with admirably by Director Michael Mann comes with making a film about not just someone we all know, but THE most recognized person in the world..  How can this story be told in just two hours?  As some of the detractors have made clear, this is a tough task.  But Mann did a great job, in my opinion. <BR> <BR>Where to start this story; and where to end it?  No mention of the young boy's going to learn to box after some neighborhood kids humiliate him by stealing his bicycle.  No mention (rather surprisingly) of his Olympic gold medal and the even more significant return to the States where he threw his medal into a river in protest of racial mistreatment.   And even once we get that issue resolved, where to end this saga?  How about Summer, 1996 in Atlanta, with the Champ holding the Olympic torch (or even better, at a preliminary boxing match in those same Olympics when an incredibly bitter Joe Frazier was, when introduced, met by cheers of \\"Ali, Ali!\\").  This is by no means a criticism, because this one incredible life is far too large to capture in one movie.<br />Those who lament the lack of great boxing misunderstand what the film and Ali were all about.  He transcended his sport in amanner that no athlete has in the past fifty years (and perhaps ever).  America in the 1960's, racism, and the draft were far larger issues and more formidable competitors for him than Liston, Frazier, Foreman could have been if he had to fight all three one after the other!  If all he had done was fight and defeat them, he would have been just one more name in the record books.  This leads to my only real substantive lament:  While the \\"Rumble in the Jungle\\" was a singular and a true epic event, I think the three Frazier bouts were the greatest one-on-one competitions in the history of sport, and were among the defining moments of their respective careers.  For this reason, I would have like to have seen more time devoted to that relationship.<br />Great supporting actors.  Before seeing this, I could not imagine Jon Voight as Howard Cosell (just like Will Smith, Voight also made this role his own merely with the use of tonal inflection).  Ditto the efforts of Jamie Foxx as Drew Bundini Brown.  Mario Van Peebles would have been memorable as Malcolm X, but for the fact that we ALL know that he could never again be portrayed after the efforts of Denzel Washington.<br />Just like the Man himself, some people liked him, and some people hated him.  Not surprisingly, the reviews turned our correspondingly.  It is, as noted a better than respectful telling of the life of a great figure in the history of America.  For my money it was worthwhile, and I enjoyed it more the second and third time.

B00005JK8K|2.0|This movie kind of stinks.  Nicolas Cage's character is a marine corp sergent who is in charge of making sure that his Nevajo Indian companion who acts as a code talker doesn't fall into the Japanese hands. This movie supposedly took place during the invasion of Saipan during WWII.  The enemies, which are the Japanese Imperial Army soldiers, were basically nameless and faceless.  The only purpose they serve was to be shot, just like the Indians in your old typical western movies.  The movie doesn't give you the perspective of what the whole war was about.  Also, it was a little unrealistic that at the end when the marines were sent to scout a hill that was supposedly heavily bombarded by the American battleships, and yet, you don't see a single shell hole anywhere.  It could have been made better.
0151008116|5.0|It took me three weeks to finally find this book.  It flew off the shelves like hot cakes once it won the Man Booker Prize in England.  However, once I got my hands on a copy, I read it from cover to cover.  From the very beginning, Martel is able to enticingly  draw the reader into a world that most of us in the western world have never seen before.  His travels in India are apparent in the detail he uses when describing Pi's hometown of Pondicherry, and his talent for developing the main characters is done very well in my opinion, delivering enough detail to make it extremely authentic, but not overpowering the reader at the same time.  Martel's style is simultaneously powerful, confident, and unassuming.  <br />The \\"meaty\\" part of the book is used to describe Pi's incredible (and harrowing) journey across the Pacific Ocean in a lifeboat with a tiger. Don't let the description fool you.  This book isn't sweet and cuddly; as is apparent by Martel's description of Richard Parker and his various companions on the lifeboat. This journey is one of life and death.     <br />I've never read anything quite like \\"Life of Pi\\", apart from Kipling.  This is on the same level in it's fableistic qualities.  Instantly a classic in my opinion, it won't ever be outdated.  This is the type of book that could be read a hundred years from now and still be great. 5 STARS!!!
B00006690G|4.0|To be honest, before this album I had liked some of Eminem's songs but I never thought of him as an amazing artist. He was and still is an mult-talented rapper,  and he had witty lyrics but his albums were made up of the songs sounded the same and not many stood out due to a lack of stand-out beats and lyrics that were conceptually repetitve. However on this album has gotten much more personal, switched up the format and type or rapping on each song, created great hooks and finally beats that are just as predominant as him. So heres the breakdown of ths songs, skipping the skits:<br />White America: the pounding beats and Eminem's agressive tone match each other perfectly in this song with self-confessing lyrics about Eminem's rise that are not only shocking in what they say but because that Eminem is willing to admit them. From this song you know Eminem is much more focused on his rise to fame and the media's potray of him rather then jabs at his targeets.  8.5/10<br />Business-a good bouncy track with a great beat with eminem talking bout the rap game. 8.5/10<br />Cleaning out my Closet- one of the most personal tracks on the album about eminem's darkest issues, but mainly his mother. Rather than make jokes about her, the track is of grim seriousness and emotion. 8.5/10<br />Square Dance- this is a good song even though its got a strange chrous. A pretty good beat and some political raps. 8/10<br />Say Goodbye to Hollywood: another track with personal lyrics mixed with an desperationa and vunerability in eminem's voice. A good beat too. 8.5/10<br />Drips: this one of the lesser tracks on the album. Not really worthy of mention. An ok beat, but predicatable unorignal lyrics bout STDs and sex. 7/10<br />Without Me:the first single. Although its uncannily similar to his earlier first singles of the other albums. This is the albums most club-friendly song and has jumpy beat which suits eminem's upbeat raps. A good hook too. 8/10<br />Sing for the moment: An amazing song with lyrics about emimen's music, how music people affects people and plain thought-provoking. Grim music matches eminem's voice that is full of determination, emotion and edge. 9/10<br />Superman: although the lyrics are somewhat unoringal in comparison to the other one on the album. Eminem's flow on the song is a hook all itself and the chorous is great too. 8.5/10<br />Soldier: although Eminem's lyrics about how tough he is are much less inovative, the beat and Eminem's flow is full of raw energy, enough to overshadow the lyrics. 8.5/10<br />Halie's Song: the is the best song on the album. Eminem's voice is compact with emotion, love and anger at the same time. The lyrics reveal the vunerability of eminem and how deep he can be. The hook is powerful and grasping. 9.5/10<br />When the Music Stops: this song may be overlooked as a typical D12 song, its not. Although their are some of their typical lyrics, their are many insightful ones too about music and themselves. But the track has a dark creeping beats that coats the grimmness of the rappers. 8.5/10<br />Say What You Say: This is Dre's magic. The beat is slamming and head-bobbing that its impossible not to be drawn it. Emine's & Dre's flows and chorous are full of rawness and edge. A great slamming track full of energy. 9.5/10<br />Till I Collapse: eminem's flow that speaks like a giant, empowering lyrics, a militant beat thats rocks, and Nate Dawg's hook = 9.5/10<br />My Dad's Gone Crazy: Eminem is at his wittiest and funniest here with a great hook and beat. 8.5/10<br />this is eminem's best work capturing his anger, frustration, emotion, pain, love and skills all in one. Combine this with amazing, pumped up beats and you've got an amazing album.<br />overal 9/10
B00006CXSS|5.0|This was the best war movie my whole family has ever seen.  We were glued to the TV every night....Couldn't wait to see the next one.  Would recomend to any one even the slightest interested in this War.
B00006X06U|5.0|I've read a few not-too-positive reviews by paid critics. One even called it bombastic but I don't trust opinions of the like, nor the kids at Rolling Stone. What Joni has done is taken the concept from her Both Sides Now cover album and said, let me reinterpret my own work. She has given a whole new meaning to many of her songs or deepened the meaning of others. When musicians perform live they often rearrange the music. Why not reinterpret it in the studio? Her voice? Joni's made some life choices but look at Marianne Faithfull and the esteem in which she is held now. Personally I like Joni's voice with the deeper wisdom better than the filigreed hippie.<br />Take this as it is. Maybe some of the original versions were better than these, but these are not replacements, just a stylizing. If Both Sides Now was standards, these arrangements of Be Cool, You Dream Flat Tires, Just Like This Train hold up the same style and swing right along with any great standard. Sex Kills is still just as searing \\"look at yourself in the mirror now\\" as the original. Slouching Toward Bethlehem is even more powerful --just to point out a few. An orchestra is real music and rightly so that Joni should go here. After all her work with acoustic and then electronics over the years, she's returned to the original source of great landscapes and musical painting. She IS a great classical jazz singer and they've always blended best with an orchestra. <br />I see two themes here. The Travelogue of one's life journey and the journey the world has taken. She blends it with current events of 'this massive mess we're in\\". Those songs were written how long ago? They are just as relevant today and that's why reinterpreting them is the perfect thing to do--listen to them in a different way now that we've travelled further.
B00003CXXR|4.0|&quot;Jurassic Park III&quot; is a good continuation of the Jurassic Park Series.  The film centers around a divorced couple played by William H. Macy and Tea Leoni. Their son has been lost on Ilsa Sorna, In Gen's site B.  Their son was involved in a parasailing accident and landed on the island. Sam Neill reprises his role as palentologist Dr. Alan Grant.  He believes that he will merely be serving as a guide for the couple while the fly over the island, but Macy and Leoni have other ideas.  They portray themselves as rich adventurers while convincing Dr. Grant that they will make a large (and phony) donation to his archaeological society for his services.<br />However, unknown to Dr. Grant, the couple plans to actually land on Ilsa Sorna.  This is where the action and adventure begins.  Almost immediately, the group encounters a huge dinosaur, the spinosaurus, who makes the T-Rex from the earlier films look like a mouse. In fact, spinosaurus enjoys eating the T-Rex for dinner. The group tries desperately to avoid the menacing dinosaurs, find the couple's son, and somehow escape from the island. The dinosaur scenes are eye-popping, especially the flying pteranodons.  The airplane crash sequences are well-done, too.<br />I was a little disappointed in the ending.  It seemed to me that the producers of the film were just trying to hurry and finish the movie, so it was a little abrupt.  Overall, I thought this was a good movie.  The dinosaurs are bigger and scarier in this movie, and the action scenes are top notch.  I still enjoyed the original Jurassic Park and The Lost World a little more, though, because they were longer (JP III was only 90 minutes), and the endings were not as rushed.  I do recommend this movie.  It flows well with the earlier films of the series.
B000003TA4|5.0|First let me start off by saying how much it pisses me off that people accuse Kurt of being a sellout. He never wanted nor intended his music to become as popular as it did. And he hated himself for it. When he shot himself, partly because he thought his music career wasn't going in the right direction, I think he wiped the sellout-slate clean. This album is important because, much like all the Beatles' albums, it has influenced every piece of rock and roll since. <BR>The music on here is overwhelmingly smart and the lyrics are genius. He knew what he was singing about, and he felt what he was playing. What more can you ask a true artist to do?<BR>Some morons have this preconceived notion that if an album enjoys even a tad of commercial success, that the artists must be sellouts. This is wrong. Sometimes, and not very often, something becomes popular because it is good. It's a strange phenomenon these days, but bands like the Beatles proved that if the music is good enough, then the music is the only thing that counts.
B0000636UN|2.0|Let's be realistic here;  \\"C'mon C'mon\\" is simply a bad album aimed almost completely at commercial success rather than Sheryl's usual goal of achieving artistic repsect.  Lacking the usual Crow brilliance that leaves us begging for more, \\"C'mon C'mon\\" is missing the great songwriting and ground-breaking production that \\"Tues. Night Music Club\\", \\"Sheryl Crow\\", and \\"The Globe Sessions\\" have demonstrated to the industry in the past. Each of Crow's previous releases have been works of art, pushing the envelope of popular music and testing waters that only Crow has dared to float upon, and with success. \\"C'mon C'mon\\" is filled with such an emptiness artistically that unfortunately even a few exceptionally great songs cannot keep this record afloat.  The opening number \\"Steve McQueen\\" rocks out with great lyrics and such a creative production that it leaves us looking forward to what's to come.  Unfortunately, there's not much to look forward to.  Crow's artistic balloon is slowly and sadly deflated after \\"Soak up the Sun\\", the overplayed theme song of this past summer, with it's great hook but no real content. The worst of the worst is the eighties-style duet \\"It's So Easy\\" with eighties king Don Henley.  \\"It's So Easy\\" sounds out-of-date and over done, as so much of this record is. But Crow deserves credit where credit's due. The true gems of this album are \\"Abilene\\", a duet with Dixie Chick Natalie Maines, and \\"Weather Channel\\", a duet with Emmylou Harris.  \\"Weather Channel\\" is a beautiful reminder of Crow's capabilities, an eerily- haunting stripped-down track with such brilliance that it leaves you wondering if it was left over from the Globe Sessions.  The bottom line is that Crow second guessed herself this time around and it shows.  Next time, Sheryl, please trust your gut instinct- If it ain't broken, don't fix it. Crow's usual border-pushing songwriting and artistic production lead to simply great albums.  This was not one of them.
B00005UEAR|5.0|While most Dream Theater fans (including myself) regard Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes From a Memory, to be DT most elaborate and stunning work to date, I would have to say that this latest offering is my favorite. It's much MUCH darker than its predicessor, and a lot more diverse in terms of thematic material. The Album comes in two discs, the first containing five songs all very good and some that are just plain exceptional. The Second Disc is a mammoth concept piece. It doesn't have a story line per say, but there is the common theme of insanity, multiple personality disorder, and other mental illness. So, lets dig into the material.<br />Disc I:<br />1:The Glass Prison-This song is the heaviest thing they have ever written. It's a dark, thrashy, monstrous riffmania. It opens with the scratch and pop of a record, which is were Metropolis Pt 2 comes left off. The vocals are done interestingly, with Portnoy and Petrucci singing parts of the song. The drumming is fantastic, sounding like a gatling gun. The bass is very heavy and noticable. The hieght of the song is in the latter half however, when Rudess and Petrucci battle it out with Keyboards and guitars. Almost worth the money for this song alone.<br />2:Blind Faith-A slower, much more melodic number, it feauters excellent vocals by James and absolutely awesome keyboard work from Rudess. The lyrics are beautiful and moving.<br />3:Misunderstood-A tad experamental, this song is a metal ballad that brings the album back to the dark side again. The lyrics are very well written and the musicianship is impeccable, especially the guitar work. Near the end of the song, things get scary as the band launches into an intense Pink Floydesque barrage of sound effects and distorted guitars.<br />4:The Great Debate-A very interesting song dealing with stem cell research. Petrucci's sucessful attempt at being a lyricist. Great intro/outro, with a churning bass line accented by media clips. The drumming is really great, and the keyboards build to a fever pitch. Labrie's voice is dark and brooding, one of his best vocal performances.<br />5:Disappear-The shortest song on the first disc, it is a heartfelt ballad about death. It's mixed with keyboard effects, that give it a very creepy nostalgic feeling. the lyrics and vocals dominate again here, with Labrie being backed by Portnoy. The singing is very beautiful and emotional, almost brought me to tears.<br />Disc II:<br />1:Overture-Of course there had to be an overture, and this is a good one. It's pretty much the same idea of SFaM, showing little bits of what is to come. Very bombastic, reminds me a lot of the overture from The Who's Tommy.<br />2:About To Crash-Starts off with all the flair as if it were a celebration song, the lyrics quickly show differently. The melodies are sharp and biting and there is great musicianship on all sides.<br />3:War Inside My Head-This song functions kinda like an intro to the following one, but it is still very worthy of praise. It talks about the metal decay that can be caused by war. The riffs are heavy and the percussion is thunder. Labrie again drops his voice, souding angry and embittered.<br />4:The Test That Stumpted Them All-Even heavier, this song is powerful, with thundering drums, raging guitars, a deep bass, and chorus's that are reminiscent of none other than Slayer. The song is very brooding, and really....just downright aggressive.<br />5:Goodnight Kiss-The most balladish one on the album, acoustic, with heartfelt lyrics. Nice touch, after the onslaught of The Test That Stumpted Them All, that is until it reaches the end. Then there is an interlude filled with the extremely disturbing sounds of a mental hospital, screams, medical equipment, sobs, intercom messages.<br />6:Solitary Shell-Aiming for a more upbeat feel, this song is a flippent poetic ode to isolation. It's almost a comic relief, though the subject matter is no less dark.<br />7:About To Crash/Reprise-A lot like the original, it isjust that, a reprise. A tad faster and a little heavier.<br />8:Losing Time/Grand Finally-The bombastic despairing ender of the album, this is one of my favorite tracks. The lyrics are beautiful and weave very well witht the song. There is a final gong strike by Portnoy at the end, signifying the conclusion of this journey into madness. The music resounds for over a minute, slowly growing softer, until there is nothing but silence.just that, a reprise. A tad faster and a little heavier.<br />8:Losing Time/Grand Finally-The bombastic despairing ender of the album, this is one of my favorite tracks.

B000002UAR|5.0|I enjoy ALL the tunes on this album immensly, but I've never gotten used to hearing this (UK/CD) version. The original US issue of Revolver didn't have Dr. Robert, And Your Bird Can Sing, or I'm Only Sleeping...They were on another VERY important album which came later titled: Yesterday and Today...Remember kids, the one with the banned cover of the Beatles with doll parts and hunks of red meat??!! Now there's a collectors item. They put a big sticker/cover on the &quot;doll' album, but one could steam it off and voila!  Sweet 60's memories eh?<BR>And by the way, don't believe anything else you hear, that's  Eric Clapton playing on Taxman...
B0000026UL|4.0|Some of the songs on this album are a little light-weight and unsophisticated. Others sound a bit too similar.  The gems, however, make up for these drawbacks.  &quot;The Man in the Long Black Coat&quot; stands out for it's guitar work, seedy atmosphere and Dylan's lurching lyrical phrasing. Some people (like me) really like &quot;Where Teardrops Fall&quot; while &quot;What Was It You Wanted&quot; is a good song although far from unique. &quot;Everything is Broken&quot; is a great romp. &quot;Most of the Time&quot; has to be the best song of the set (even though it appeared on the High Fidelity soundtrack - the same movie that showed disdain for any song used for such purposes). It's the kind of song that will crush your insides if you have someone you broke up with that hasn't been completely expunged from your heart. Overall, there's not a bad song in the bunch. Not his most ingenious work, but very enjoyable none-the-less.
B00006RU5B|5.0|\\"Go and save yourself! Take it out on me!\\" screams Chris Cornell surging through Brad Wilk's war of drums, Tom Morello's menacing guitar hooks and Tim Commerford's penetrating bass lines.  The ex-Soundgarden and ex-Rage Against the Machine members have risen from the ashes of their former bands to create a supergroup - Audioslave. In a time when everything in rock are cliches, the world needs a band that can step up against the conventional.  In the nineties, Soundgarden and Rage both took the honors of inventing a new genre of their time. Soundgarden's hard rock displayed the metal side of Seattle grunge.  Rage introduced the blend of rap, metal, and politics. Despite their successes, the two bands had musical limitations. Soundgarden did not have innovated musicians who could extend their talents beyond their genre, and Rage did not have a singer who could carry a melody. With the construction of Audioslave, the new members have been able to explore uncharted territories of epic proportions. Instrumental jams channeling from the soul and lyrics stemming from the heart have created 14 breath-taking tracks of pure genius.  Tom Morello is the guitar god. <br />1.

This blind fury of madness describes the sound of this opening track. It begins with Tom Morello whacking the strings of his guitar to get a helicopter sound.  <br />2. Show Me How to Live - Classic Rage meets Soundgarden.<br />3. Gasoline - The chermistry between Cornell and the ex-Rage members is unbelievable on this track.<BR> <BR>4. What You Are - Filtered wah sound that alternates with a pitch bend creating a devastating harmonious guitar solo.  <br />5. Like A Stone - Phenomenal Morello handiwork with a pitchglide-with-echo sound. <br />6. Set It Off - Very cool guitar intro that drops and detonates an explosive barrage of electric guitars, bass, and drums.<br />7.Shadow on the Sun - Awesome guitar solo with a \\"hummingbird wing\\" effect that is like a gated sound.<br />8. I Am The Highway - Cornell speaks from his heart to create a masterpiece accompanied by a soft, laid-back southern rockish feel.<br />9. Exploder - BOOOMMMMMM!!!!!! <br />10. Hypnotize - Morello looked to DJ's as inspiration for this album which clearly explains this Chemical Brothers influenced dancebeat.<br />11. Bring Em Back Alive - Another amazing guitar solo from the Harvard graduate.<br />12. Light My Way - Funkish groove that develops into an arena epic-rocking anthem<br />13. Getaway Car - Very traditional blues.  Something never heard before from Soundgarden or Rage.<br />14. The Last Remaining Light - Jazzy Wes Montgomery style who definitely was an influence for this song.
B000002L9M|4.0|This is a critical album for the band as they discover a darker sound to match the increasingly edgier lyrics of Martin Gore. Their evolution would become complete with the heavier beats on &quot;Strangelove&quot; and &quot;Never Let Me Down Again&quot; from their next lp. <br />The openers &quot;Black Celebration&quot; and &quot;Fly On The Windscreen&quot;  compellingly display their richer and more advanced sound which adds color to their previously more overt pop leanings.  &quot;It Doesn't Matter Two&quot; is a strange little song that uses what sounds like synthesised monks chanting for the rhythm.  Some songs like &quot;A Question of Lust&quot; are a bit syrupy for my tastes, but elsewhere &quot;New Dress&quot; sizzles while delivering an indictment against rich society and &quot;But Not Tonight&quot; closes the album with a perfect pop song like a breath of fresh evening air.
B00006LSM3|5.0|An outstanding album.........one of the best in years from anyone, and a true reflection of the talent and genius of George Harrison.<BR>There are tracks on this album which rank with the best work he has done-- Looking For My Life,Rising Sun, Stuck Inside A Cloud, Never Get Over You, Run So Far ---- and the entire presentation is exceptional musically as well as lyrically. If Bob Dylan's \\"Time Out Of Mind\\" was a \\"Best Album\\" a few years ago.............and believe me I am a big Dylan fan.........then the same honor should easily await George Harrison's Brainwashed, a far better work. He left on a high note.
B00000255X|5.0|The album's sound is rich featuring uncommon instrumentation for Dylan songs (violin, bellzouki) and two extended pieces chronicling two different peoples' lives.  There's a lively Mexican-flavored song (&quot;Romance in Durango&quot;), but most of these tunes are on the mellow tip.  &quot;One More Cup of Coffee&quot; is particularly evocative of the lonesome traveller, while &quot;Isis&quot; is a wild romantic tale in part about being a pawn of circumstance.  I haven't heard a Dylan album that sounds quite like this one. I consider it essential Dylan and one of my favorites.
B000068TPN|4.0|The movie takes you in the middle of war. You will lose your life within seconds without any warning. The bullets just go from all direction, you cannot avoid, you can survive, just because you are lucky than others. It is full of violence and blood.<br />If you like modern war movie, you will like it.<br />This is a good movie, I recommend it to every adult.
B00006JDVV|3.0|I am sorry to say that this was no where close to a great movie, but it's not an awful movie either. Reign Of Fire begins in London where we see a young boy (Christian Bale's character as a child) going down into a mine shaft. Now, here's where the movie gets confusing, and it never quite recovers. The boy discovers a dragon in the mine shaft and as everybody rushes to get out his mother and everyone but him for that matter, manages to get killed.<BR>We later learn over the next decade how the human race was slowly killed off. There are only a small rag-tag team of survivors led under the now grown up boy, Christian Bale. The next notable part of the story takes place about half way through when Matthew Mcconghey and his band of American survivors role up to Christian Bale and company's hideaway and then eventually formulate a plan to go to London and take out the main dragon. When they finally get to London it only takes them 5 minutes or so (with very little difficulty) to get rid of the dragon. Way too simple. I realized when I had finished watching this movie that I knew little more about the plot then I knew just watching the preview. All in all, it's a big budget monster movie like the hideous remake of Godzilla. The best parts are seeing the great effects used to create the dragon. Aside from that, the acting is also commendable with both Christian Bale and Matthew Mcconaghey (bald but bearded, in an interesting change of role) turning in decent performances.<BR>Other than that, Reign Of Fire is out of heat.
0684833395|4.0|Joseph Heller's Catch-22 is a great peice of literature. Filled with wit, humor, and sadness it makes reading about such a terrible thing like war enjoyable. Reading about Yossarian and company's journey trough World War II was slow at some points, but I am glad that I forced myself through these moments and read on. It picks up twards the end and makes for a great read. I was forced to read a novel for a high school project, but I am glad that I picked up this book, it does not only tell about the war, but it takes you through a great story at the same time. It shows the courage of Yossarian and others as they fly in and out of dangerous mission day in and day out. Anyone who liks books about war is sure to love this novel, it truly is a great book.
0440219078|5.0|The Giver was the best book ever!  Jonas, the main character, lives in a Utopian society where everything is perfect and his life is all well until he becomes \\"a twelve\\" and he is given the honor of upholding all of the community memories.  The Giver passes good and horrible memories to Jonas, that he will have to bear for the rest of his life.  Jonas becomes scared and he doesn't know what to do.  The Giver helps Jonas and throughout the book they become very close friends.  This book always keeps you interested, and you won't want to put it down!
0440214041|3.0|I doubt the editorial comment that Grisham wrote Pelican Brief for the movie.  The book allows the white Gray Grantham to end  up in Darby Shaw's sack. The misogamist movie downplays any final romance between the interracial couple.   Such is life in America in the `90's.<br />In this story Grisham provides a primer for using the omniscient point of view.  Out of a hundred scenes he gives Darby Shaw or Gray Grantham half of them and spreads the other fifty scenes rather equally amongst the minor characters. I think he had the reader hooked well enough that he could  have thrown  in more exposition.  He drove along that fine line between keeping the reader in suspense and keeping them in the dark.  He avoided the opportunity to educate so he could entertain.
B00005JKG9|5.0|I just find it so amazing that a film with relatively no action can be so powerful and affecting.  <BR>&quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot; tells the story of real estate salesmen who try everything to close a deal despite poor leads and treats from higher-ups.  How far will they go to stay alive in their business?  Watch and see as a riveting and sometimes sad story unfolds.<BR>One couldn't have asked for a better cast (greats like Jack Lemmon, Kevin Spacey, Ed Harris and Al Pacino), and the interactions between them are gritty and sharp.  Heck, Alec Baldwin is only in the movie for a few minutes and even he manages to make a huge impression on the audience!<BR>Fans of the film can now rejoice that this wonderful movie can now be seen with the picture quality and sound that only DVD can offer.  Be sure to look for an &quot;extra special&quot; feature on the second disc: watch the clip of Kevin Spacey on &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot; as he and a student reinact a memorable &quot;Glengarry&quot; scene.<BR>All in all, the film is brilliant in every sense of the word.  It's well-written, well-directed, well-casted, et cetera.  After viewing it, I only had one question.  Where were the Oscars???
B0000025D0|5.0|Everything the Boss released with the E-Street Band more NEBRASKA is five stars, simple as that. (I did not listen to THE RISING yet).<br />DARKNESS is the first album he recorded after the fierce judicial battle involving his ex-manager Mike Appel and the new management headed by ex-Rolling Stone reviewer Jon Landau. This battle took three years, and Bruce could not release any album during this period, only touring.<br />DARKNESS has a totally different sound than BORN TO RUN, dure basically to production, now at the hands of Srpingsteen and Jon Landau. It´s a monumental album, it´s Bruce, it´s rocking, it´s melodic, it´s hard, it´s harsh, a masterpiece.
B00006AL1G|5.0|Doug Pray has done an excellent job capturing the essence of the scratch dj movement.  Starting with the birth of the scratch and showing many of the influential figures in the development of the culture, this documentary is entertaing, as well as informative.  I can recommend this for anyone who has even the slightest interest in the genre - they will gain much insight into the oft-misunderstood hip hop/ scratch dj culture.  For a dj who is already involved and knowlegeable in the culture (such as myself), this film should provide as an entertaing photo album of sorts, not to mention.. the best tool to help your family, friends, or significant other understand what the heck you've been doing all these years! (it worked for me)  With the slight exception of a few key figures overlooked (djs- jazzy jeff, cash money, aladdin) this is quite possibly the finest hip-hop documentary ever!! also recommended - keepin' time by B+
B000000WHC|4.0|After the release of 1989´s AFTER THE WAR, Gary Moore simply got fed up. After years and years of trying to convince a broader audience of his sheer, enormous, breathtaking playing ability, he quit trying to write pop / rock hits. He did not care any longer for commercial mainstream or top 40 hits. No more.<br />After all, when you release such phenomenally great hard rock albums like 1982´s CORRIDORS OF POWER and 1983´s VICTIMS OF THE FUTURE; when you are capable of recording such complex and interesting songs like &quot;Military Man&quot; and even doing so you´re still not recognized the way you should be (mainly in America), then there´s nothing more you can do...<br />So, Gary simply change the focus of his career completely. He went for the blues. He recorded a kind of tribute to the influences of his past, more a few original tunes of his own. He invited musicians like Albert King to record with him. He recorded a low profile album that gave him immense pleasure.<br />And the result was his best-selling album ever... what an irony! STILL GOT THE BLUES is very good, strong. Of course, it´s a kind of &quot;metal blues&quot;, because no blues recording by any master of the genre was so heavy!
1400031354|5.0|Aother charming, lyrical, lovely book from McCall.  I love the way he observes things, with humor and heart.  The orphan story and Precious' fiance were wondeful additions to this book and I love the way McCall seems to value women and tries to lift all the glass ceilings around them, both big and small.  <br />When I read this book, I felt the stress levels around me fall and I felt like I was in Botswana living at a more leisurely pace.  As I stated in my previous review, I have visited Botswana once for a very short time and this book brings back wonderful memories and makes me want to return ASAP
B000005RQT|5.0|This is the 25th Annivesary edition of In Rock.  The track listing shown hear is incorrect, starting with track 6.  Track 6 is Living Wreck and track 7 is Hard Loving Man from the original In Rock album.  Those are then followed by 15 additional tracks and 35 more minutes of music.  Currently, this 25th Anniversary collection is double the price of the normal CD.  It is not worth the extra money.   <br />In Rock is a fantastic album and is Deep Purple' last great studio album.  (Machinehead is good, but not as good as In Rock).  The extra tracks for this 25th Annivesary CD are nothing special.  The only two worthwhile tracks are the first Black Night track and an instrumental.<br />The rest of the new tracks are not of any value.  Many of them are just 10 second bits of the band playing around, like doing a few chords from Dave Brubeck's Take Five.  Most of the tracks are &quot;re-edited&quot; versions of the tracks from the original album.  There are 3 versions of Speed King.  But none of these &quot;re-edited&quot; versions are significantly different than the original and none of them are better than the original.<br />Also, the original guitar intro to Speed King that was cut from the American versions of the LP and CD has been restored.  If you can find this CD at a reasonable price, then it would be OK to get, especially if you don't already have In Rock.  <br />This was a transition album for Deep Purple.  It is half progressive rock and half hard rock.  <br />Flight of the Rat (my favortie Deep Purple song), Hard Loving Man and Child In Time retain the progressive rock sound of the group's earlier days.  The songs are all long (7 to 10 minutes), and feature nice solos and interplay between Lord and Blackmore.  Ian Paice's driving rhythm is also highlighted. Note that the beginning of Child In Time was stolen from It's A Beautiful Day's Bombay Calling.<br />The other four songs on the album are just straight out hard rock that is typical of everything else Deep Purple has done to date.  <br />Deep Purple started out in 1968 as a pioneering progressive/art rock band with a hard edge.  Jon Lord was the leader and brought a classical background to the group.  Ritchie Blackmore was just developing and was mainly emulating Jimi Hendrix.  You can follow his development as a guitarist on the first three albums.  The early group had a few hits in Hush and Kentucky Woman.<br />But, the group didn't feel like it was going anywhere and kicked out the lead singer and bassist.  The lead singer went on to form Captain Beyond that had a hit with Sufficiently Breathless.<br />With the new singer (Ian Gillan) and bassist (Roger Glover), Jon Lord recorded an orchestral piece that flopped.  With that, the group dropped any art rock pretenses, toned down the progressive sounds and went hard rock all the way.  In Rock is the group transitioning through the phases.  It really sounds like two different albums.  (Eventually Gillan and Glover would be kicked out of the band and then reunite years later).<br />They are almost always great to see live.  Made In Japan is a fantastic and intense album.
1400031346|5.0|I just loved this book.  It will quietly draw you in and take you to another world.  I went to Botswana for a brief trip last year and fell in love with the country and I love reading McCall's descriptions and his own love for his country through Precious.  This is not a book full of wild, bloody action, so if you're looking for that, you will be disappointed.  Rather this is a wonderful escape from the harried world of the U.S., written with charm and love with characters that are fresh and that you wish you could meet in real life.  I read the Tears of the Giraffe last week too and it was even better, introducing more wonderful characters.

But, neither of those are worth the extra price, which is more than double the standard price.
B00005JKG9|5.0|all I can  say is finally. I've nearly destroyed my vhs copy. For those who haven't seen it.. You MUST. Amazing character driven story. True to life. ( or just about.)

0151003084|4.0|This book is so much fun.  I really enjoyed reading this book.  I bought it b/c I realized it would be nice to have around for a laugh or two.
0380729407|3.0|Recently I Read the book Something Whicked This Way Comes by Ray Bradbury. It is a very interesting book and requires some thinking to understand this book.<br />It is about two boys Will and Jim. it was in the middle of October when a carnival comes to town. This is a very strange carnival. They take all the people that come to the carnivle and turn them into a part of their freak shows.<br />I had a good experience reading this book it was very entertaining. It took me only about a week to read this book and itwas worth the time.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Not going to go into great detail, but man! What a CD!  I'm glad Christina shed that &quot;bubble-gum, pop-princess&quot; image.  She really shines on this CD and tells it like it is.  Non of the songs are bad, they are all good and an even better reason to pay the price for the CD.  I normally download songs for free from the internet, but I wanted this entire CD and I wanted Christina to get the $ and recognition for it.  Not only is she nice to look at, but she's a writer, a producer and an amazing singer...She's going to be one performer that lasts.
B00003CWL6|5.0|Both Spacey and Benning succeed in bringing their formidable skills to a peak in this extremely funny, black comedy, by Sam Mendes.<BR>The scenes are simply shot, maybe too much for some, but brilliantly executed throughout,provoking thoughts of twisted ideals and deep rooted misguided prejudices.<BR>The film manages to cover so many areas, and make so many points, that it is a tribute to Mendes skill as a director that it remains so full of wit and charm.<BR>It is bleak in parts,but I loved it's honesty and strong message of the fragility of life, often lost in every day monotony.
B00004W4UB|1.0|I'm not a Julia Roberts fan.<br />But I was willing to give her (another) chance with this story because I loved the novel so much.  And the idea of seeing John Malkovich play both Jekyll and Hyde even had me excited to rush out and see this movie its opening day.<br />Duped again.<br />The novel was great: it's the Jekyll &amp; Hyde story told from a maid's point of view.  It's faithful to the smallest detail to Robert Louis Stevenson's telling, but you're seeing it from the next room (the best way to read them is to read the original story first, then MARY REILLY).<br />But I should have known that &quot;America's Sweetheart&quot; would toss every nuance of integrity to make herself the center of the show: while the novel's tension focused on Mary's fear for the kind doctor who is obviously being blackmailed by Hyde, the movie has both Jekyll and Hyde falling madly in love with Julia.<br />A uni-brow maid who can't keep her Irish accent straight.<br />Right.<br />I wanted so much to like this movie.<br />Please do it again.<br />And leave Julia free to do NOTTING HILL II....
B00005O5JV|3.0|What can you say about this film?  It is enjoyable enough.  It certainly isn't a movie that you can hate.  I did get a bit tired of that fact that every character in the movie was a broadly-drawn caricature, but that is my only quibble.<br />Three stars for the fact that 20 minutes after you've finished viewing it, you will have forgotten most of the details of the movie, even if you enjoyed watching it.  Just rent it, don't buy it.

It blows me away in it's ability to place emotions on how we all fit in.  Particularly poignant is &quot;Hung My Head&quot; &quot; and &quot;In My Life&quot;, both excellent cover songs in his version.<br />This disc is a must for any vintage country or alternative country fan.  Johnny Cash...the voice and the heart...cannot be matched by anyone!

B00005B36H|5.0|To start off with, none of our opinions about this album really matter, it's too good to be subject to criticism by anyone, good or bad. I think I'm more of writing this for myself and to say yet another good thing about something that over a thousand praises fail short to accurately describe.<br />This is the crowning achievement of Tool's discography. They have set a standard with this album that is so high, I believe its impossible to top. I rank this album among albums like Rubber Soul, Led Zepplin 4, and Dark Side of the Moon, ect.. It is one of the greatest rock albums ever made and an instant classic. This album is a musical, and spiritual, masterpiece. (If my use of the work spiritual confuses anyone here, I would suggest that you read up on Sacred Geometry, the Ren Le Château mysteries, Carl Jung, contemporary metaphysics, Buddhism, Krishna, Neil Donald Walsh, and who knows what else for background information.)<br />They have at the same time increased the intensity of their music and the deepness of the message. This could be described as their heaviest, and most beautiful album at the same time. When the songs get heavy, it is to fit the character of the message they are trying to make. For example, Ticks and Leeches, a satirical song about Tool's fan's expectation for them to make a &quot;rockin&quot; album (&quot;This is what you want, so this is what your getting&quot;). Or The Grudge, a song about consuming grudge that Maynard calls for you to &quot;Let Go&quot; before he proceeds with the album, which is completely logical when the message of the album if taken as a whole. On the other end of the spectrum are melodic, hypnotic songs like Disposition/Reflection/Triad. Laced throughout the whole album is mathematical precision and planning, like the 9-7 beat arrangement of Lateralus, that gives the song a subtle spiraling effect as the words lag away from the rhythm; or the fact the number of syllables in the songs, and the number of songs on the album are in accord with principles of Sacred Geometry.<br />The artwork is stunning, plastic anatomy-text book style lay-overs, full of hidden messages and themes. Perfection all around.
B000069AUI|4.0|Coldplay broke through with that ever so overplayed, ever so sappy ballad called \\"Yellow\\" off the debut album 'Parachutes'.. But I like everyone fell in love with their brand of emotionally charged, sweet sounding pop-rock. Colplay return a few years later and apparently that much the wiser because their sophomore record, 'A Rush of Blood to the Head' takes the formula that 'Parachutes' created and tweaks it in every which way to make a more rich, expansive, and ultimately even more fulfilling record.<br />There probably isn't a band out there who is one bit as emotionally pulling as Coldplay and in particular the voice of lead singer Christ Martin. Martin's voice soars and swoons on every tune pulling us into his every hope, despair, and longing. From the charging thump of the rollicking \\"Politik\\" to the gentle \\"The Scientist\\", Martin proves to the be a top notch vocalist in making the listener attach themselves to the songs as he really does have a beautiful, touching voice.<br />There are some definite easily accessible singles here in songs like the crooning \\"In My Place\\" or the aforementioned \\"The Scientist\\" and the gentle \\"Green Eyes\\". But the real treasures on this record are the stuff that seem to get better on each listen like \\"Clocks\\", which is worth the price by itself, along with the title track, which keeps building up and then bursts out into an anthemic gem.<br />I, like many others, initially wrote off Coldplay as just another Radiohead clone, but with the undeniable strength of 'Parachutes' I came to my senses. While Coldplay don't yet match the greatness that is Radiohead, they certainly are a band that have staked out their place on the map and they're here to stay. I welcome anyone to continue to dismiss them because I know for a fact that they're certainly the ones missing out. (4.5 stars)
0385335482|4.0|In most ways, I am not like Becky Bloomwood, the shopping-obsessed, debt-ridden heroine of _Confessions of a Shopaholic_.  I don't care that much about designer labels and my finances are under control. I also found Bloomwood's naiveté and overall lack of responsibility for her situation annoying. But I could relate to the crux of her problem.<br />She used shopping to distract herself from an unfulfilling career. Although competent at her job as a financial reporter, she had no enthusiasm for what she was doing. Until she finds something to be passionate about, she buys things to fill an emotional void. <br />When she stumbles onto a news story that she truly cares about, her interest in buying things suddenly fades. I see this phenomenon occurring in my own life. As I am moving away from a long-time career that, while offering certain perks, is ultimately not satisfying, I'm feeling less pull toward other addictive-like behaviors.  With true enthusiasm about something (such as a new career or interest), I believe there's less need to console ourselves with unhealthy diversions.<br />This book is a quick, escapist read, with many similarities to _Bridget Jones's Diary_ (witty, young English woman with job and romance problems, dysfunctional parents, etc.).  In a fun way, it also underscores the need for us all to find something in life to be excited about. Then you'll find yourself on your right path, and things will start to fall into place.
B00006F7S4|5.0|In the world of Beck, change is a way of life. He's covered pretty much every major genre over the course of his career and never seems to miss a beat. And, for me, there's always something to like about whatever Beck's doing, although not everyone probably feels the same. He's been knocked because of his many times ironic lyrics or for the fact that he seems to change his musical arena every few years; he says he makes whatever kind of record that everyone else isn't making, which is probably the most true. Alas, Beck was supposed to making a rock record, but that's nothing like the Beck we get this time. This is sad, melancholy Beck, and very straightforward, truthful Beck and I got to admit I like this Beck as much, or more, than the previous ones.<br />'Sea Change' is pretty much in it's entirety full of glum musings concerning the breakup he experienced with his long-time girlfriend. Of course, song titles like &quot;Guess I'm Doin' Fine,&quot; &quot;Lonesome Tears,&quot; &quot;Lost Cause,&quot; and &quot;Already Dead&quot; kind of lead you to fact that this record probably isn't all that perky. The thing that for me really amplifies this to a very touching sadness is the way Beck delivers his vocals with a somber, heartfelt tone that really shows depth which maybe wasn't there before on previous records. Overall, it's really quite melodic and beautiful.<br />This record is kind of a sibling record of 1998's 'Mutations' in that it's basically acoustic oriented. Another similarity to the record is that Nigel Godrich is back as the producer and wraps Beck's sound in a nice array of strings, effects, and bleeps that keep each song fresh and adds an uplifting vibe in Beck's bare somber tones . On songs such as &quot;Paper Tiger&quot; and &quot;Round the Bend&quot;, Godrich layers a orchestrations that really make the song sound complete and make songs that could have ended up somewhat ordinary, extraordinary. Throughout the record it seems that Beck and Godrich were able to decipher what each song needed to compliment Beck's voice and guitar, such as the effects on &quot;Lost Cause&quot;, or if the song needed anything at all (&quot;Already Dead&quot;).<br />Is this Beck's best record yet? Possibly, and I'm really beginning to think it may be. This album is both immediately accessible and able to grow to display depth on further listens. All in all, he's created what may be the ultimate breakup record with it's themes of loss and sadness, but with a feeling of moving forward and letting the past be the past.e able to decipher what each song needed to compliment Beck's voice and guitar, such as the effects on &quot;Lost Cause&quot;, or if the song needed anything at all (&quot;Already Dead&quot;).<br />Is this Beck's best record yet?

This is the only one I ended up throwing away because I didn't want anybody else to have to read it.  The author has some very bizarre ideas on caring for an infant, most of which are based on her own strong personal opinions instead of medical knowledge.  The tone is a little pushy and high-handed - and don't be fooled by her claims that this method &quot;respects&quot; your baby.  The theories in this book are adult-centered, go against your instincts, and basically put an emphasis on gently breaking your baby's will from as young an age as possible.  If your infant doesn't fall into the routine, the book makes you feel like you just don't know what you're doing.  I also think the author is dangerously unclear about the age to begin implementing her practices of denying feedings, etc.  This sort of advice can hurt young infants who really do need to eat almost all the time in order to thrive!<br />Another important note is that this author is not very positive about breastfeeding and offers some stange points of view about it that counteract the advice of the AAP and breastfeeding experts.  Yet at the same time, she tries to tell you how to do it.  Her advice is not very accurate/helpful for maintaining a good milk supply, gaining breastfeeding confidence, and working with your baby.  This book probably left me more concerned and confused about the breastfeeding than about anything else.<br />I definitely do NOT recommend this book to anyone, especially in the early weeks.  You can certainly have a workable routine and structure to your day when baby is older, but not like this and not so young!
B00005YXZH|5.0|This was a record that wasn't supposed to happen. The folks at Wilco's then record company would not release this record as they deemed it wouldn't succeed so the band bought the master tapes and went elsewhere. One has to wonder how manylistens those execs gave to this record. Of course, it is far from a conventional record. Nestled within is Jeff Tweedy's all American voice, guitars and drums, but swirling all around are a variety of effects and a lo-fi production that ring of non-commerciality. But what ceases to amaze me and countless others is how someone could not see what brilliance is made up of all this sonic tinkering. It's far from top 40, but it's not exactly like Radiohead's 'Kid A' either.<br />This is probably the best 'American' album in years. It reeks of solid beats and musical craftsmanship circling around Jeff Tweedy's mellow voice and profound lyrics. Hidden under what may appear initially as somewhat ordinary tunes are layers of interesting notes and sounds hardly present the listen before. Tweedy for the most part keeps it dreary, and that makes the upbeat songs stick out quite a lot and they are much more accessible. But on consecutive listens the greatness of the seemingly bland slow songs is revealed, gaining the listener new depth in the work, which will happen over and over again on each listen.<br />To call this a record a masterpiece is almost an understatement. For myself, I have a hard time finding any second of the record that doesn't have something interesting hidden within. Each listen is like peeling another layer off, with each revealing new pleasures.
B000075BFK|5.0|How many albums of pure genius will it take to convince the world that Tupac Shakur is the best hip hop artist of all time?????  It should only take 1 but Better Dayz is in fact his 11th.  His lyrics are poetry and only god can judge him now.

B00005JL96|5.0|Let's face it: most of us think of hand-painted, high quality animation when we think of Disney. Not CGI (this is not a knock on Pixar. They do great work. I'm talking about the Mouse here).<br />The last few efforts; \\"The Emporer's New Groove\\", \\"Tarzan\\" and \\"Atlantis\\" were not Disney's best, despite the reciepts.<br />I don't know why, nor do I claim to know enough to speculate.<br />That's why \\"Lilo & Stich\\" was such a happy surprise.<br />A Hawaiian girl and her sister, struggling within the states Social Services to stay together despite many pitfalls (they lost thier parents in a car accident), end up involved with an escaped experiment from a distant galaxy. This creature was designed to have no guilt or remorse while rampaging. However, when it was supposed to be sent into exile on a deserted planet it escapes to Earth, a planet considered a Wildlife Preserve for skeeters by the galactic community. Along the way, it learns the concept of family and belonging.<br />This could have been a bad movie. It WAS in production limbo for quite a while. However, someone saw the film for it's originality and cut it loose. With minimal promotion, it went on to become a huge winner for Disney.<br />Never too slow, never too preachy and having enough humor for adults to appreciate without being gross, this is indeed a family film.<br />Buy it. You never know when they'll make a good one again.
630280082X|5.0|I saw Crossroads several weeks ago.  SInce then the music and the setting have been haunting me.  I spent a couple of years in ALabama and Mississippi courtesy of the Air Force, so the smells and sights are still with me.  The storyline - the devil and daniel webster cum karate kid is haunting.  the blues licks penetrated me.  i bought the soundtrack - it was fine, but just recently confirmed that the soundtrack is not eh same tunes from the movie due to cooder's getting [mad] at the director for cutting him out of the last \\"big guitar battle\\" scene.  The songs I really dug were by Vai.  So, with no DVD's I buying the VHS.
B00005Q4CS|4.0|'Requiem For A Dream' is one of the many films that I have been wanting to see for a long time. It must be because of the wild controvercy surrounding the film.<br />To tell you the truth, I have not seen Darren Aronofsky's other films, but, after seeing 'Requiem', I'll try to get a hold of his other movies (such as Pi). His directing style is very chaotic, but seems to flow very well with all of the Frightening things that are happening on screen. I have got to agree, with other viewers, that the last 20 minutes of the film is the most Shocking scenes you will see in a movie, for a while. The film starts out easy, giving us tame shots of what each character goes through to get their daily 'fix' or to make their 'wishes' come true, but as the film runs along, be ready.<br />Also, speaking of Performances, the actors and the actresses are Excellent! In particular, Ellen Burstyn. She handles her role (Sara) very well. In one part of the film, she is talking with her son (Harry) and just explaining what it is that makes her 'smile'. That scene is very heartbreaking, where we notice that she just wants to be loved.<BR>The supporting cast (Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans &amp; Jennifer Connelly) are Outstanding. They capure their characters in a way that is very real. Each of them put their best performances forward, and it showed, GREATLY.<br />Worth mentioning is the Effects of the film. It's a star all on it's own. Filled with strobe lights, handheld cameras, quick editing and split screens, these effects really highten the theme of the film of being in a high or hallucination.<br />After watching 'Requiem For A Dream' I have noticed that even though it's Shocking and Scary, it's at times Beautiful. Each of the characters wanted to get something out of life and that is what they got, but they paid in a high price. Overall, the main message of the film, as we all know by now is DON'T DO DRUNGS.
B00006M183|5.0|Album is great, especially &quot;love boat captain&quot; and &quot;green disease&quot;. It's catchy and rhythmic. Get now.
B00006LI4S|4.0|Different, but outstanding nonetheless.  This is simply great music performed by a legend and a group of excellent musicians.  The versions of old (and not so old) classics are performed in an \\"Unplugged\\" fashion that enhances the essence of each composition.  I could not have enjoyed this concert more.  However, my only complain is that it was to short (that is why I rated it 4 stars instead of 5).....it seems to be a compilation of songs from a much larger set.  Don't be put by this though, this is a fantastic concert DVD.  The sound is fantastic and the widescreen anamorphic image is detailed and full of color.  I wholeheartedly congratulate the person, or persons that decided to release this DVD in widescreen anamorphic, nowadays, it is the only way to go.  Thank you.

0786889284|4.0|Beyond Recognition blows open in a firing inferno.  One house after another after another is consumed by sky roaring flames.  Sgt. Lou Boldt's job is to find the arsonist/s and restore Seattle, Washington to peace.  He becomes involved as a policeman because each fire was set to kill off single moms.  The fire departments involved had no clue as to why the fires were started or who might have been involved in setting the fires.<br />Thanks to police psycologist, Daphanie Matthews, and several other faithful policemen like  Lts. LaMoia, Neil Bahan and Bernie Lofgrin the arsonist/s are snuffed out.  But before that happens, little 12-year-old, Ben Santori plays a key role in sniffing out the criminal/s.  Ben was a victim of assaults and abuse by his stepfather and in his(Ben's) attempt to get free of his stepfather he encounters the arsonist who is not much older than himself.<br />Prepare yourself for a lot of suspense, surprise and mystery.  Also prepare to learn about the various types of ways fires can be started and how fire marshalls determine exactly where and how fires are started in buildings.  You will be amazed at the technical information involved in those types of determinations.<br />So, do read this book which is one in a series of the Boldt/Matthews mysteries.
B00005QIPH|5.0|It's pretty sad that most of the people who give this album a bad review just make some weak comparison to VU or some other band and say that The Strokes are not original. I can only assume that these people have not heard either VU, The Strokes, or possibly either band, or are nu metal fans bitter at their ... genre's demise and have come here to bring down others.<BR>I was somewhat skeptical about The Strokes at first, seeing them for the first time on MTV and then reading about their priviliged backgrounds. But then I pulled my head out of my ... and realized that it didn't matter how I heard of them or how rich their parents are, they make damn good music. Yes, some of it's poppy and catchy, but some of it is also raw, balls out rock and roll. Just listen to BARELY LEGAL and TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT a couple times. Keep an open mind and you'll find yourself liking them too.<BR>I would say the most impressive aspect of this album, besides it being an incredibly fun listen, is how well crafted the songs are. They each play fairly simple parts, but they fit together in such a way and change often enough that it doesn't get old or stale. The simplicity of this album is, oddly enough, just amazing. (This coming from someone who is a big fan of Radiohead and At The Drive-In, which is saying a lot if you know anything about those bands)<BR>I am one of those people who prides himself on keeping his ear to the ground in the music scene and hearing and knowing about the indie and lesser known bands (someone people might refer to as a \\"music snob\\") because I am not happy with most of the crap on MTV or the radio.  However, I also realize that sometimes it is ok, and maybe even good, to listen to music just for the sake of pure mindless fun. Which one reason why I love The Strokes.<br />p.s. the material for The Strokes' second album is shaping up quite nicely (good luck making comparisons so VU now)<br />p.p.s. Interpol's debut album Turn On The Bright Lights is just damn good
B000069CWE|1.0|I don't get it! So much rap on this CD! Not your normal LinkinPark =(. Get their other CD's, they are much better.<br />*ADDITION* however, if you really like rap, then get this CD, it is full of rap.
B00006YXEK|5.0|Although George never churned out music in production line format, it has always been special when it arrives.  \\"Brainwashed\\" is yet another example of thoughtful and provoking music.  Thankfully most of it will not be played to death on the radio.  If you are a Harrison/Beatles fan and/or you just enjoy good music this CD is a must. And by all means; get the special edition.  Not only will it make a very nice gift, it also takes us back to the days of old when you looked forward to that new record, its cover and what may be hidden inside.
B000075BFK|5.0|I just got through listening to this cd and I love it!!!! Tupac is the man....after 6 years...his lyrics still rock...I purchased this cd from circuit city today....I was in the store for about 20 mins..every person that was in the music section left with a Tupac cd. I couldn't believe it!!! So naturally i picked one up and haven't stopped rockin' it yet...Woe to other artists whose cds dropped today.....No money for you...!!!!
0792101448|5.0|First let me say that Leone's operatic masterpiece is my favorite film of all time. Leone took everything we loved about the Western and put it in here in what has become, in my estimation, the grandest swan song ever to punctuate a genre. This film has it all: Larger-than-life characters (Fonda's turn as a cold-blooded killer is chilling and unforgettable). Sweeping, gorgeous cinematography. The most mythic screenplay ever written for a Western. And a brilliant score in which each character had their own piece of music composed for them (from the script no less!) and Leone played while filming so that each actor could move in rhythm to it. Just one word of advice to the first time viewer: never, and I repeat, never watch this film in anything less its original aspect ratio (widescreen letterboxed). You would be doing yourself a disservice and missing out on the sheer grandeur of this flawless epic.
B00006LWSF|5.0|Eminem's three tracks on this album are by far the best- they serve as short summaries of the film, Rabbit's character, and the struggles he has with his family, his neighborhood, his obsession to succeed, and his writing.  They are universal for anyone who is a writer and has suffered with writer's block, feeling like they aren't worth [profain word for poop].  Taryn Manning proves herself to have a strong vocal range, much more so than her Gap commercial allowed.  (Her group BoomKat provides a song that is one of the few non-rap joints)  However I highly recommend buying the Collector's Edition that comes with the extra 5 track CD sampler.  On it, Eminem provides \\"Stimulate\\" a song all parents should hear because he talks candidly about being an entertainer and saying things to amuse rather than be their \\"parent, friend, guardian\\".
B00000AFGM|5.0|The last time I wrote a review for this CD, I hadn't exactly listened to the whole thing. Now, with more knowledge, this CD is the best! I'm really hooked on the songs Disassocative and Great Big White World. The entire CD is perfect particularly the song User Friendly. Oh, and if my parents ever read this? For the last time, he is not a satanist! And even if he were, would I give a damn? NO!!!!! Buy this CD now! You will never regret it.
B00005OAIE|1.0|Will someone cut the guy some slack! If you don't believe this John Mayer is anything more than a Dave Matthews knock-off then you need to do alittle more than listen to the first 30 seconds of each song and store up bitterness because girls everywhere sigh when the beggining riff of &quot;Your Body is a Wonderland&quot; comes on the radio. Here is finally a young person on the radio and MTV who writes about more exloratory things than any other fresh out of college 20 something musician. He is an incredible guitarist acoustic and electric if you don't think so go hear him live and listen closely to this album, there are nice little acoustic guitar, electric guitar, keyboard, and vocal riffs that fill out the catchy pop songs and make you feel what his soft unique baritone voice is trying to tenderly portray. His lite acoustic guitar work during softer acoustic orriented songs is really the only Dave Matthews connection to be made after a good couple of listens to this grade A young talent's freshman release to a real label. This album will be good the first couple listens, then you'll adore it, then finally you'll get tired of it, then after a couple of weeks away you come back once again to realize this really is one of the best music purchases I've ever made.So as I said before, cut the guy some slack! I really don't know what more you could ask of him, you deffinately don't give Brittany Spears and Justin Timberlake as  hard a time as reviewers have been giving John. I'll venture out and say music like John is making will change pop music of atleast the next couple of years. So ignore the belly-aches of old grumpy reviewers and check out this fresh new album.
0066214122|5.0|OK, so I just bought the book today and I haven't finished yet.  I'm only 150 pages into it.  But I couldn't pass up the chance to be the FIRST person on Amazon[.com] to review it.  I've never been first!<br />OK, I've never left a review before either.<br />But I am a huge Crichton fan.  The man is brilliance personified.  As always, Crichton is on top of his game as a master of cutting-edge techno-suspense.  He knows his subject matter and knows it well.  It's hard to tell where the facts end and where the fiction begins.  He blends reality with fantasy so seamlessly, it just sucks you in.<br />Unlike other Crichton novels, it is written first-person.  However, despite this departure from the usual third-person format, Crichton's suspense-driven style remains completely intact.  He drops just enough hints and twists to keep you guessing and turning the pages.<br />Written from the perspective of an experienced software engineer, Crichton throws enough computer science jargon in the book to stimulate the mind of a programmer, such as myself.  Like I said, the man is smart and knows his subject matter.<br />Good book, thus far.  And I've never read a Crichton book that has disappointed me when I've finished... I'll finish reading it, and if by some miracle the ending really [is bad], I'll be back to revoke this review.<br />\\"Obey me, I Am Root\\"
B00005JKHP|4.0|Star Trek fans have long made jokes about this first film in the series, calling it \\"Star Trek: The Slow-Motion Picture\\" (HA, HA). The pic seems to be a bit of a hit & miss affair amongst devotees. Common criticisms are: A story that's not compelling enough (i.e. fails to sustain interest), an overlong scene near the beginning intoducing the Enterprise as Kirk & Scotty \\"space-jet\\" around it, lack of substantial character interplay, and colorless costumes & sets. Common praises are: Excellent score, a serious vibe of cinematic awe a la \\"2001: A Space Odyssey,\\" a cool bald chick in a mini-skirted white robe and high heels (Kirk dresses her -- naturally), and outstanding sets -- far removed from the cheesy sets of the original TV series). <br />     My personal estimation: Although there's validity to all the above criticisms (especially the fact that it lacks the drive that most of the TV episodes have), I feel the positives strongly overshadow them. What I am most impressed with is the serious tone of cinematic awe that it possesses. The filmmakers REALLY took the subject seriously and attempted to give us a quite cerebral Trek adventure. Not to mention the flick is a visual feast for the eyes in regards to both sets and special effects (F/X).<BR>     <BR>     After just recently seeing it again (the DVD Director's Edition) it dawned on me how Star Trek: The Motion Picture (ST:TMP) is essentially an amalgam of some the TV episodes. Most people rightly point out how ST:TMP is basically a re-make of \\"The Changeling.\\" This is the well-known episode with \\"Nomad\\" the omnipotent-but-very-small space probe that was originally sent from Earth hundereds of years before, but somehow merged with an alien space probe and consequently set out to \\"sterilize imperfections.\\" ST:TMP has the same basic plot, but, other than this, it doesn't much remind me of this segment. <br />     Here are a few other episodes that creators obviously borrowed from (though maybe not intentionally): <br />     \\"The Corbomite Maneuver.\\" This is the one wherein the Enterprise crew encounters a colossal alien spaceship in an unkown sector of space. The alien ship at first threatens to destroy the Enterprise for invading its territory and then takes it captive. ST:TMP has a similar vibe to this episode: There's not much action, the Enterprise comes face to face with the unknown (in both cases a gigantic alien space vessel) and the crew have to put their heads together to prevail. The way crewman Dave Baily willingly decides to leave the Enterprise and go off with the alien ship brings to mind the way Decker decides to leave the Enterprise and merge with V-Ger in ST:TMP.<br />     \\"The Doomsday Machine.\\" This is the very popular episode in which the Enterprise takes on a gargantuan-and-grotesque planet destroying machine gone amok. This episode has a tragic character, Capt. Matthew Decker, who loses his whole starship to the planet-killer. Decker understandably develops a death-wish (for surviving when his crew didn't) and indeed dramatically dies in the episode. ST:TMP has the son of Matthew Decker on board the Enterprise -- Capt. William Decker. He also ultimately \\"dies\\" (to all intents & purposes) in the story. The main reason this episode comes to mind when viewing ST:TMP is that both involve a humongous alien THING freely traversing the galaxy destroying vessels and planets. ST:TMP of course lacks the suspense and drive of this grand outing (but it definitely looks better).<br />     \\"Metamorphosis.\\" This is the reletively unknown segment wherein Kirk/Spock/McCoy come across a dude (Cochrane) isolated from humanity on some remote planet where he encounters a cloud-creature (\\"The Companion\\") that falls in love with him (!!). There's not much action in this episode; this explains why I innitially didn't really like this outing. Now (being older), I'm more impressed with it. It's a very good, mature serious Trek story wherein our beloved Trek characters again encounter the unknown in space and have to deal with it. ST:TMP often has the exact same vibe. Also, the way Cochrane communes with The Companion brings to mind the way Decker ultimately merges with V-Ger. <br />     Like \\"The Corbomite Maneuver\\" and \\"Metamorphosis\\" ST:TMP is a mature, cerebral type story. Most kids and young adults won't like it or \\"get\\" it. My suggestions for anyone wanting to check out this awe-inspiring flick is to put on a pot of coffee, kick back & relax and let the movie give you a good time. Contrary to what some say, there IS a lot of interplay between the characters, especially as the story proceeds. I enjoy seeing Kirk/Spock/McCoy and others dialoguing back and forth trying to figure out how to \\"defeat\\" V-Ger. <br />     I think it's important to note that ST:TMP is the only Trek movie that possesses an epic-type cinematic awe along the lines of \\"2001:A Space Odyssey.\\" The filmmakers were obviously highly influenced by this one-of-a-kind flick. Yet I enjoy ST:TMP much better than \\"2001\\" because it has much more of a story to it (not to mention our beloved characters).<br />     About the Director's Edition DVD: It is essentially the same movie with a few minutes of the redundant F/X sequences removed and a couple non-essential scenes added. Plus they fixed up some of the F/X. One scene supposedly added is outstanding: it shows Spock shedding a tear (!!) for V-Ger. He tells why, and it just helps explain the story better. Anyway, the DVD picture quality is outstanding -- buy it!<br />     I guess I'm in the minority here, but I like ST:TMP much more than the okay-but-completely-overrated Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.

B000050XXO|1.0|This is a fantastic movie, but Amazon.com unusually does not list anything to distinguish this Limited Edition Collector's Set from a regular edition. I would like to assume that Special Features are included, given the edition title, but have no way of knowing. If this is an oversight I would be grateful if Amazon.com would remedy this.
0440178002|5.0|I definitely agree with all the others who loved this book, it's truly a grand, sweeping epic with great characters, vivid imagery, historical drama, and much, much more. Perhaps the best part is the wonderful way Clavell handled the fundamental culture clash between the Europeans and the Japanese. It's downright hilarious at times to see the way the two view each other, due mainly to each side's inherent sense of racial/religious superiority over the other. The Europeans see a bunch of ungodly heathens who kill a drop of a hat, often in extremely cruel fashion, and who have no sense of the value of human life. Meanwhile, the Japanese see a bunch of uncouth, filthy, lice ridden, smelly barbarians who sit around eating greasy beef and swilling rum and ale like swine. In time, the smarter characters actually start to see certain values in their cultural opposites, marooned English sea captain Blackthorne learns to appreciate the finer aspects of the Japanese, their highly developed art and manners, their poetry, and their unique sense of honor and duty. His counterparts, Mariko and Lord Toranaga, each respectively learn the virtues of romantic love and the advantages of independent thinking and individual initiative of the Europeans, who have learned to conquer the seas and set up trading empires while the much more insular Japanese preferred to keep to themselves, rigidly adhering to ancient traditions. In due time, Toranaga becomes Shogun, supreme lord of all Japan, and Blackthorne is faced with the following dilemma: has he become too Japanese to ever go back home?
0156012197|5.0|If you liked The Little Prince here is one more great book for a child to read. My only regret is that I did not read this book years ago, when Gerald Durrell was living, so I could tell the author how much I love his book. The praises of \\"My Family and Other Animals\\" has been sung by many readers. What I would like to add is that Mr. Durrell has a wonderful gift for writing and observation. His book takes us on a journey to the sun-drenched island of Corfu, that for Mr. Durrell is a place near to paradise. The natural world he is surrounded by fascinates him, and the reader, as we are introduced to the varieties of creatures that inhabit the island. We come to appreciate the life that can be found in a ditch filled with water. Then, there are the animals Mr. Durrell collected as pets: Quasimodo the pigeon, Ulysses the owl and the Magenpies. This is to say nothing of his dogs: Roger, Widdle and Puke. I only wish there could have been photographs in this edition.<br />Coupled with this are wonderful portraits of his mother, two brothers and sister and their sometimes eccentric guests, along with the people of Corfu they meet. From the moment the Durrells arrive on Corfu, followed by a pack of dogs, their adventures are non-stop. One wishes for the chance to have been on Corfu and be able to pay a visit to whatever villa they happened to be living in. \\"My Family and Other Animals\\" is a book that you will not want to end
B000002MZ9|4.0|While this cross-generational experiment was being recorded, somewhere in a parallel universe Eddie Vedder was holed up in a cheap studio with Billy, Ralph & Poncho, running them through chord changes patiently. Eh? Neil conveniently doesn't invite Crazy Horse to the MIRROR BALL sessions, and in the process, is able to get Pearl Jam (minus Eddie) to trim their sound down, eliminate the wanky guitar solos, etc., and we get another good-to-great NY album. The rhythm section here is a tad more upbeat, and certainly crisper, to those whose ears are pleasantly accustomed to the Crazy Horse dirge-like attack. I think Eddie does a little background singing, by the way.
