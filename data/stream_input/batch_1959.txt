B00APUQRPC|4.0|A great father daughter movie.  I would recommend this movie for any one trying to understand older... single fathers... their loves; their failings, their fears, and their strengths.  Thank you Mr. Eastwood.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|From beginning to end this book was incredible. Literally couldn't put it down and stop reading. Such a good book! I recommend anyone who loves romantic novels like I do to dead this book !!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|If you like Neal Stephenson and William Gibson, you will like this book. Lots of references to the 80's pop culture. Fast paced action. I have recommended this book to many of my friends already.  I can't wait for the movie.  Yes there is a movie in the works.
B00AWTTUHI|5.0|Its how I have always wanted to see the superheros presented in a real and not cheesy situation. You can believe that this character could very well exist one day.
B000002O4X|5.0|This sound score rates high and belongs in the modern classics as one of the best of all times... !.
B000R4SMCW|5.0|This is a movie that I had seen before and like it.  I saw that Amazon had a huge DVD blowout sale and that prompted me to love for the movie titles that we were looking to add to our collection. If you haven't seen this movie, it has some interesting twists.  Can't beat Anthony Hopkins for performance, and Ryan Gosling is easy on the eyes.
B000000WFZ|5.0|This sound score rates high and belongs in the modern classics as one of the best of all times... !.
0765325950|5.0|It could have ended no other way.<br /><br />In this book, we truly see the talents of each author: the intrigue, complexity, sheer magnitude that is distinctly Jordan accompanied by the prolific reader immersion into the written world that is signature of Sanderson.<br /><br />This brings book brings together the myriad characters, storylines, plots, armies, relationships, kingdoms, and forces that critics of Jordan have so often denounced, and masterfully weaves them into a cohesive masterpiece of high fantasy.<br /><br />You'll enjoy it.
B0000042MY|5.0|This sound score rates high and belongs in the modern classics as one of the best of all times... !.
B005XTLAQQ|5.0|I need to say this is a beautiful collector doll. Well made dress ant I too love the Twilight series! I would love to see Steph Myers contiune with the series! Love her woork!!!
B00004XQ8E|5.0|The Kathleen Ferrier/Julius Patzak is by far the very best recorded performance of Das Lied von der Erde.  I agree with Mahler's biographer, Henry Louis de la Grange, that only a contralto can sing Das Lied von der Erde the way it was meant to be sung.  Julius Patzak also delivers a performance of the tenor part that is the best I have ever heard.  If you love music, any kind of music, you simply must purchase this recording from amazon.com and prepare to be deeply moved.
B009CGLO3K|5.0|Again K Stew pulls it off with her really good acting! Very much a teen movie.However it is geared for teens. Adults would enjoy it s well.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|I was not a fan of this movie. It was funny a few times but mostly just dumb.  I personally would not recommend it to anyone,  Maybe someone in early 20's would appreciate it more
0425252868|5.0|If this book were a piece of fiction, no one would believe the story.  A few years ago I purchased one of the very few fine art WWII themed prints I own simply because this story is so remarkable.  (The print is wonderful as well!!)  I purchased the print from the author's company and was thrilled when I learned that the author had fleshed out this story with a full length book.  For this reader, this book was as exciting as any I've ever read.  Most satisfying was the incredible detail the authors (Larry Alexander being co-author) were able to uncover to fully support a story which, quite frankly, without this documentation, is almost impossible to believe.  But aside from well confirming the details of the mid air meeting between Charlie and Franz in Dec. 1943, this book offers incredible insights into the war time experiences of Allied bomber pilots and German fighter pilots.  Both Charlie and Franz were able to offer up priceless details of what they did.  Franz, especially, because of his truly remarkable career, gives nearly unprecedented insights into the inner workings of many of the elite fighter pilots in the Luftwaffe.  For me, this book is easily in the top five of my library of hundreds of books about WWII.
0399157565|4.0|The book was slow moving and tedious in the beginning.  I didn't think that the ending tied together that well but it only took 2 days for me to read it.  I t was another of her books that I couldn't put down until I was finished.

B008HT4FUW|4.0|The characters in this fabulous series are perfect fits. Everything about this Masterpiece theater production is great. Can not wait to see Season 3...
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game will suck all your time. Super fun and addicting! Graphics are detailed and the story line is interesting. Can't wait to see what's next.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Jeff Kinney strikes again with another good book! I really like this one especially because of The funny characters and such.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|We love it!  This series had been recommended to us by our son, and we finished the first season in record time!  It came right away when I ordered it, and was a big Christmas hit!
B003O86FMW|5.0|OH MY GOD THIS WAS SO AWESOME I CAN'T EVEN LIKE WOT. I DON'T EVEN.. WOW JUST.. JFK IT WAS SO COOL LIKE PLOT TWISTS EVERYWHERE. IF THIS BOOK WAS A FOOD IT'D BE A PRETZEL BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY TWISTS. OMG BUT YEAH IT WAS PRETTY AMAZING YOU SHOULD READ IT O M G.
B007ME5BUG|5.0|First, the man writes well which is important in a book filled with great detail about battles and politics. He appropriately starts WWII with the Japanese invasion of China which is quite unusual and then takes us right through the fighting on every front and the political backdrop each time until the Japanese surrender. The Nazi invasion of Russia and the fighting on all fronts is much more thoroughly looked than in any other WWII history I have read. Politicians are impartially looked at each with their strengths and weaknesses.The thing that most impressed me after finishing the book was that I found myself appalled not by the extreme savagery of both Hitler and Stalin and theirs and sometimes Churchill's interference in military affairs, but by the generals of all sides many of whom needlessly exposed their troops to death and injury for their own self aggrandizement. On the other hand the admirals worked in better concert with an overall military plan and the air forces were a mixed bag. This is a rich historical work and well worth reading.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Better than I expected! A great read for any aged guy or girl! Easy to follow with lots of action.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Love this show. Lucy Lui as Dr Watson is an interesting twist.  It's also refreshing that the show takes place in modern day New York.
030758836X|5.0|I've always believed that human kind has the capability of both incredible good and incredible evil.  I much rather read about the evil side than experience it.  This was a wonderful trip through that world.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I didn't know what this book was about going into it and wow did it surprise me!  It had great unexpected twists and always kept you guessing.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Excellent reading. Wonderful love story full of action and romance. The love story is amazing and really gives you a perspective on your personal relationship. I love the story of Christian and Ana. If there were more books I would read them. I'd like to read this book from Christian's perspective. Five stars!!! Excellent storyline.

B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I use this app daily, what I like that it keeps my total, as I use this to keep the balance in my check book.
B00378VGGO|5.0|Fantastic Mr. Fox is one of my favorite R. Dahl books, and even though the movie strays (a lot) from the book, the animation is charming and the quirky character/voices entertaining.
B005XN31LY|4.0|There is a bit too much melodrama for my usual taste, but Robert Carlyle and his portrayal of Rumpelstiltskin/Mr. Gold is awesome. He's the reason I kept watching.
B0099Y2MYK|2.0|I'm a BIG Downton Abbey fan.  I looked forward to Season 3 with great anticipation...even pre-ordered this season's DVD.  BUT, talk about disappointed...and in many ways.  First, with the original \\"Upstairs/Downstairs\\", the filming, sets, dialog, and costumes improved over time...and rightfully so since it became a $$ maker.  Not so with Season 3...even though Downton Abbey is also a big $$ maker.<br /><br />The first episode was on PBS last Sunday.  There wasn't much I wasn't disappointed about.<br /><br />First, Mr. Bates appears to be getting himself into more trouble.  Oh, come on, now!  Enough is enough!  I'm weary of feeling sorry for him and his suffering wife.  The newspaper guy needs to come forward about Bates' former wife and be done with all this!!!<br /><br />And, I agree with another review I read.  It's hard to believe Lord Gratham put ALL his investment eggs in one basket.  Not the brighest bulb in the pack, I'd say.<br /><br />I had expected great banter between Shirley MacLaine and Maggie Smith.  Fellows completely dropped the ball here!!  But, he's British and, perhaps, he preferred to show a wealthy American in a negative light.  Harsh, but fair.  We're talking about the 1920's...flappers...and a flapper with big bucks (regardless of age).  Her costumes were horrible and makeup even worse.  Certainly MacLaine has aged...we ALL do, but she wasn't presented in the best light nor were her talents used wisely.<br /><br />The only person I'm happy for is Edith.  Why?  If my family treated me the way they do her, then I'd be resentful, too.  I'm hoping she'll be finally happy...and happy with a man who views her as lovely.  Her family certainly doesn't.  And, it's nice to see O'Brien stick up for her nephew...since Thomas is still his evil self.  And, what's with Daisy's attitude?  She now has a father-in-law who loves her...we all want \\"advancement\\" in our endeavors, but times are tough and she's lucky to have a job.  And, of course, cancer had to bethrown into the mix.  Cancer treatment in the 20's was practically nil except for surgery and/or death.<br /><br />Overall, I thought the costumes were substandard based on Seasons 1 and 2.  Filming seemed to be not up to par either.  Plot lines are getting tired (if your superstitious...Mary opening her eyes during their per-nuptual kiss meaning more trouble to come...sigh).  Certainly we need plots to hold our interest...but fresh ideas were needed here.  I feel like I'm viewing a gerbil in a wheel.<br /><br />I'll be watching the next episode and if it doesn't start improving, I'll be canceling my \\"pre-order\\".  I'd prefer to remember Season 2's fairy tail ending...
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Very good wish it was a little longer but defiantly worth getting since it was free great job writing the book
B0089K7DGW|5.0|Great series.  Hopefully they keep making them!  Picture quality and sound are outstanding.  If you haven't seen this series, it is as good as or better than the Sorpanos so far...
B00ACSVRJS|5.0|All the movies work great! Exactly what you think you're getting. Doesn't include special features, but it says that in the description.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The whole family enjoys this show.  It's zombie killing with a deeper plot.  The character development is well done, and the way they end each episode just keeps you coming back for more!
B003NFM3JK|5.0|I love any thing Jim Carey plays in anyway. This is an awesome version of The Christmas Carol. Recommended for the whole family for a night of fun and popcorn. Anything you purchase from Amazon always has great bargains and ships out quickly. I couldn't be more pleased than I am with Amazon and of course this wonderful movie.
B008S4FZHI|5.0|Patricia Cornwall is somone I have read since I was in my early 20s and I am now in my 40s she is never a disappointment and her characters are always indepth keep them coming
B007NG93CK|5.0|Kathy Reichs is such a great writer, I have read everything she has put out and never been disappointed great to sit with for hours
B00A31UXLW|5.0|this author gets better and better everytime he puts pen to paper, Harry grows in ways you can not see coming, his daughter is a typical teenager and the twists and turns are so intricate that when you think you have it nutted out there is always that GOTCH YA bit that you never see coming
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Absolutely love the game. The pop ups are a little annoying, but I guess they are why it is free.
B00A2IUHM6|4.0|Awesomely inappropriate! Non stop laughs. Just looks like is was a fun movie to make.  Great on screen chemistry.<br /><br />Must see the unrated version.
B0095T3H2U|5.0|Love Emily Blunt - I think she is beautiful, comedic , just a great all around actress!  Also thought Jason was pretty good!
B007JOM0GC|5.0|Katy  is just a talent....a great talent and just love her music! her personality, you name it!!!!!!!!!! Just buy you will not regret!
B0085Z3B2Q|4.0|My son loves this movie. The singing and action in it are just enough to keep a 3 year old interested, but not so much that it annoys the heck out of parents. If you love Dr. Seuss and are a fan of the Lorax, they did the impossible and took a good story and made it even better.
B005LAII08|5.0|We took our son to see this movie in the theaters and then bought it when it came out on video. I've been a Disney fan as a child and seen almost every animated movie they have made. This is by far one of my favorites. Probably because the story isn't about happiness and finding &#34;true love&#34; but about happiness, family and understanding. Merida is a character worth looking up to and we see both her and her mother grow in the span of the movie. It was nice to finally see a story where the female character did the saving and was the hero of the day.
0763644765|1.0|When we were looking at potty training books, this one came highly recommended. For the life of me, I can't really understand why. It isn't very interesting and the plot of the story makes no sense. The baby has to go potty really badly but then ends up falling asleep on the potty while he's waiting for something to happen? This book was only read a couple of times before ALL of use lost interest in it. If you're looking for a good potty book, get &#34;Even Firefighters Go To the Potty. Its a much better book and certainly much more interesting.
B004S9AK3G|4.0|interesting historical fiction  . Might have been better a bit more concise without so many side stories. worth a read if you like Follett style which I do.
B004EBT5CU|1.0|There was no CD. There was shrink wrap packaging on the container. With all of the other packages I received, there was a receipt with instructions inside on how to return it. There were none on this one.<br /><br />I do want the CD. Please tell me what I have to do. The only good thing was that this was for me. I have NEVER had any trouble before with Amazon.
B004I744AS|5.0|This an addicting dictionary. It is a dictionary but it is so much more. It is a fun way to learn.
B004GTLFNW|5.0|I've read a lot of fitness and bodybuilding books recently, and I grew tired of how many of them were written by meatheads: close-minded mentality, bold and dubious statements made without anything to back them up but the force of the author's ego, needless mucho putdowns of guys who don't workout in the author's perceived 'real man's way', and so on.<br /><br />Mark Lauren is different. Reading his bio, it's abundantly clear that Lauren is a bigger badass than any other fitness author I've read. The guy is built like a tank, survived a Spec Ops course that had a 85% failure rate, broke an underwater swimming record by intentionally swimming into unconsciousness, and has won Thai boxing championships. Yet he comes across as a seriously nice guy whose main aim is not to flaunt his ego, but to help the reader get in the best shape they can.<br /><br />What follows is a balanced, thoughtfully written and well-researched book with just about everything you need to know about bodyweight exercises. He knows that not all of his readers will want to do away with the gym forever (though he himself recommends it), and he accommodates those readers too. He covers all the basics, explains many exercises, with guidelines and variations for all fitness levels, and writes some of the most sensible and level-headed nutrition advice you're ever likely to read.<br /><br />Personally, I'm sticking with the gym as my primary mode of training. The fitness-focused environment, dedicated equipment, and easily measurable and quantifiable exercises keep me more motivated and disciplined than working out at home. But I've incorporated a few of Lauren's exercises into my routine, and even added a couple of home days to it. Having exercises like this up my sleeve also means I'll be able to workout anywhere and anytime I like, even when travelling, etc. Overall, this book has been valuable to me, and I highly recommend it.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I absolutely love this series and will be completely heartbroken when it ends. Keep up the good work Jensen and Jared!
0142410705|5.0|I love it. Good book. I'm just writing stuff to fill up the word requirement. I still need five words.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|This will rate with the best of the Star Trek movies of all times...  If you're a Trekker you'll not be disappointed with a single thing.  If your knowledge of Trek is casual only then this movie will entertain you immensly with the action and drama contained within.  Bells and Whistles don't make a movie but this one has the icing on the cake!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|One of the best books I ever read and it was funny and great can't wait for the next book
B000GCFY0I|5.0|Even though it may seem a bit childish and corny some times it was pretty good. I would say it reminds me of a more mild manner version of the Hunger Games. The entire series deserves a read even if it is a bit repetitive at times.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I need to read another book from this author. Just as soon as I reread this lovely work of art.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|First book I read on my new Kindle. Have read before, but always get something new out of this classic.
1468179993|3.0|If you read the content in these Amazon reviews, you won't need to purchase this book.  Really.  And then just watch the top 10 TED talks (and watch ones that aren't as popular to see the difference).<br /><br />I was hoping for a lot more information and concrete examples.  This book reads as if the audience is in junior high school, not the professional.  The content is an overview and provides nothing more.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|it is 10 January and I still do not have the update, what's with that?  why do some people get it and others don't?
B009SJ3H8Q|3.0|I appreciate the dark mood of the show and their willingness to take risks. But I think, compared to the first season, that this season has jumped the shark a bit. The plot has included zombies, aliens, Nazis, angels/devils, and serial killers. Are there any more creepy things that can be thrown into the mix?<br /><br />Overall the first season kept me coming back for more and delivering interesting twists as the show progressed. I will still watch this show but I don't find myself itching for the next episode like I did with the first season.
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|This is the second one I had to buy.  Made the mistake in buying only one for a birthday present.  This holds 100 pieces of ammo, so when my oldest went gunning for my youngest - of course he lost.  Now they are evenly matched, and if there are tears, it's not because one had more ammo and was being pummeled into submission.  Lots of fun, I even joined in now that there is a spare nerf gun.
B008M0NDOK|3.0|If you want to play a limited selection of Gameloft games on an iOS device using a gamepad, this gamepad is a pricey option.  For everything else however, it is completely useless.  This includes a substantial number of unsupported Gameloft games.  Ergonomically, there is a lot to be offered. The design screams budget and the edges are far from comfortable but at least gameplay is fluid.  The only redeeming factor is that it works with the very small number of games it is advertised for.  That it lacks even basic gamepad functionality with the far more tolerant Windows and Android ecosystems just adds insult to injury.  If there weren't a limited number of options for iOS gamepads this product would be ranked lower.
1451648537|5.0|Before reading, I wasn't sure if this book might be worth my time. After reading: Don't miss it. An eye opener.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Once I started reading this book I was so spellbound by it that I could not put it down.  At first I thought it would be a story of high school students who were on the fringe and without friends.  Then the plot developed further and OMG I could not put it down!  This is  a well-written story with characters well=developed and a soul searching story.  Hurray for Colleen Hoover!  Check out her blog at  [...]
B004J4WKTW|3.0|This book was entertaining and kept me intrigued, but it is definitely fanciful,  Probably not my typical reading genre, but I still enjoyed the read.
B001NLKWLW|2.0|Every chapter was in a different time frame, jumping back and forth.  I found this device was used way too often, making the reading somewhat disconcerting -- especially for the first several chapters.  Also, reading the book tended to make me feel depressed and anxious because of the themes and characters.  I'll choose a different author next time.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|Great story, great actors.  Love the feeling of love for country and fellowman.  The character is a great role model BEFORE he becomes Captain America.  Afterward, of course, he's awesome.  Benevolent, wise, and totally kicks butt.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|it was really good. we love it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !  !! !
B0034G4P80|4.0|Who could not love a movie with Chris Helmsworth and Tom Hiddleston?  It's a little corny, but that's forgivable.  The message in the story was great.
B005COO1X6|5.0|exactly what it said a good read and easy way to pass a few hours when its quiet. quick download too
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Season two was just as great as season one.  I'm amazed at how much I feel in love with ALL the characters both upstairs and downstairs.  The writer keeps a storyline going with both the aristocrats and the servants with some of their stories intertwining.  The story line is interesting, the costumes are fabulous and the scenery is divine! My only negative comment is that you do have to pay attention when dates are shown.  The series moves quickly through years.  I'm sure it's because they have a lot of story to tell and limited time to film.  The castle is inhabited full-time, so I'm sure they can't have a film-crew around at all times.  There are only 7-8 episodes, but you do get the bang for the buck on story.
0425264351|5.0|It continues on with Reacher's mission of doing that which right the wrong.<br />Childs writing just has that Wow factor which you look for in author of skills!<br />You always com away wanting the journey to continue!! Enjoy!!
0765325950|1.0|I was planning on getting both a digital copy and a signed book when BS came up to Seattle for the signing.  But the whole delayed ebook thing has kind of soured my experience with the last book, especially since I dont like buying physical copies for anything anymore.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|enjoy the game but having trouble using the points; needs a broader range of words, overall game is fun and can be a challenge
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It was good I guess. It was funny. I have no idea what to write so I'm just rambling so um yeah
B001KZG99A|5.0|Fun action filled movie! I would watch it again!  Lots of action and keeps you involved the whole movie. FUN!
1572814136|5.0|These cards are great.  They make the tarot come alive.  I am so glad that I purchased them.  I have been looking at other cards and the Rider-Waite are the best especially the Radiant cards.  They are my main deck.
B003JTHXOK|2.0|From my understanding in order for a piece to not be plagiarism it has to be changed at least 80%, and after reading this book I'm not convinced that Nicholas Sparks changed Sleeping with the Enemy a full 80% in order to write Safe Haven. Let's analyze this, shall we? Here are the main elements from Sleeping with the Enemy (I'll mark whether or not Safe Haven has these elements). Oh before we go on, I would like to say that there are some spoiler alerts in this post, but if you've seen Sleeping with the Enemy, then the book will be ruined for you anyway. Here's the list:<br /><br />1. A woman is abused by her controlling husband: Yes<br /><br />2. A woman makes a clever escape from her abusive husband, and ends up in a small town where she can restart her life: Yes<br /><br />3. She uses the bus system to escape: Yes<br /><br />4. The runaway woman is hesitant to trust the cute guy in the small town, but eventually puts down her guard to be with him: Yes<br /><br />5. The abusive husband hunts down the wife: Yes<br /><br />6. The woman has an elderly family member or friend from her former life: Yes<br /><br />7. There is a carnival/fair where the abusive husband seeks out the runaway wife in the small town: Yes<br /><br />8. There's a final attempt for the abusive husband to kill/hurt/maim the wife that somehow results in the wife finding enough guts to stand up to her abuser: Yes<br /><br />9. The evil abusive husband ends up dying from wounds inflicted by the brave woman: Yes<br /><br />10. The new nice boyfriend gets knocked out by the abusive husband in the fight at the end: Yes<br />~<br /><br />That's only a few of the similarities. There are a few differences, like the new guy has kids, instead of the woman learning to swim like she did in the movie, this girl learns to drive once getting her new life started. Oh and there's a surprise twist (this is what I think made is so Nicholas Sparks didn't totally plagiarize the story) with a supernatural element.<br/><br /> I would like to say that many artists are inspired by the work of other artists. I know that this is the case, many paintings have inspired poets to write their poems, or vice versa. But here, it's not like that. It's as though he watched the movie and was typing out the book form of the film while watching it, with only a few minor differences.<br /><br />I'd like to say that the writing made it worth it to read, but that's not the case. There were several passages within the book that were redundant. There were pages that you could literally skip because of the redundancy. I need to remind myself that this is beach book, it's not a deep book by any means. However, when I find an easy read, I at least like to be entertained and not feel like I'm reading a poorly written book version of a decent movie. I'm sure that when this movie comes out, it will be better than the book (as is the case with most of this author's books turned to film).
B00AAX68HG|4.0|It was a great game and was not the easiest game I got very confused a couple of times<br /><br />,Parker
B0072IS13G|5.0|Worth the expensive price tag - it's a beautiful representation of a dragon - bought it for our 4 year old, who isn't especially fond of angry/aggressive faces on toys

B007GFDVEE|5.0|Fun to put together with my son.  2 flying bad guys -v- Captain America on his Cycle.  Going to get more of the Super Hero LEGO ones for him soon.
0765325950|1.0|I did actually buy this book from Amazon.  The story itself is 3.5 stars, there are just too many loose ends that were left hanging.  They had 15 books to clean up the all the loose ends and they failed.  While overall this series was a great story, one of the best of all time, its hard to overlook the greed and sheer money grab done during this entire series.<br /><br />As to this particular book, the quality of the book itself sucks.  I went back and grabed some of the other books in this series off the shelf and compared them to this book.  The quality of this book is very poor, the printing is messy, ink spots and stains on the pages, etc.  The bigges beef I have is the quality of the paper they used to print this book, its like they used recycled newpaper or some other really thin cheap paper.  All the rest of the books had nice thick quailty paper, not this cheap paper.<br /><br />Harriet, I hope you choke on every penny you get from this book.  This is the first book that I have actually read in book format since the last book in this series Towers of Midnight.  To not offer this book in and E-Format is a real kick in the balls.  By not doing this book for the masses to read on our tablets is a pure money grab, which only reminds us all of your other previous money grabs, you remember them such as, not moving the series forward, but instead publishing NEW SPRING to reap even more money from the us.<br /><br />Checked this morning, and there already is 3 E-Format versions up on the torrent sites, one of the torrents has been up 18 hours, and already has 37 people rating the copy a 9/10.  I hope all the torrent pirates steel every bit of your ebook sales, shame on you Harriet.  It baffles me to no end that the people working in and around this series did not see this storm coming.  I am sure a ton of people will download the pirated ebook book just to stick to you Harriet, just like you tried to stick it to them by excluding them.
B000GRUMPU|5.0|This retelling and updating of The Poseidon Adventure (1972)<br />is nothing like the original so it stands on its own.<br />The computer graphics are good quality and don't look fake<br />even in HD.<br />Acting is superior.<br />Enjoyed this version but my heart belongs to the original.
B0022X1I90|5.0|The varying styles initially make the book hard to get comfortable with, but once you adjust to the writing style, it's quite the roller coaster.
B003QTWR08|5.0|This is without a doubt favorite Pixar movie. I love it. I got my girlfriend to watch it and she enjoyed it too. Deffinately worth the money.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's bright, big and accurate! I love this calculator. It keeps calculations visible so you can remember what you're doing. Great app and I would recommend it to anyone.
B009E3EY38|1.0|beginning to think anything bought off the net is subject to the 50/50 rule, I haven't been able to try the CD's yet
B007712XAU|5.0|From the first episode of season one, the viewer is hooked by the beautiful settings (upstairs, of course), the beautiful people, and the intrigue between &#34;upstairs&#34; and &#34;downstairs&#34; and even among the three privileged daughters.  In today's world of casual attire, drive-through fast food meals, and simpler life-styles, the viewer is amazed at the importance given to proper dress (and having another person to dress the members of the upstairs family), the etiquette of dining, and the elegence of the dining table.<br /><br />All this, plus a cast of brilliant actors who capture our hearts all while they amuse and/or irritate us.<br /><br />I highly recommend DOWNTON ABBEY.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My kids told me about Flow, I downloaded it, and can't stop playing it! It is \\"flow\\" much fun!!!  And \\"flow\\" addictive!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|handy app - very user friendly - have downloaded to Kindle fire and Samsung Galaxy without any problems at all
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Doesn't get much better than this, Van Halen 1 is probably their best album and all of the songs are worth listening to. If your intent on seriously getting into Van Halen I would buy the albums in the order in which they were released starting with this oen.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|one if the best written book I have read.  I sent it to all my family.  Lots of history about world war 2.
B003PIS5XI|4.0|This movie was one of the earliest movies to use computer animation and all though it doesn't compare to today's CGI it is done very well.  Besides, the story and writing are great.  Also the whole family can watch this.  But don't get me wrong, it's not a kid's movie.  I highly recommend it.
B002VPE1XE|1.0|This came free with a digital camera I ordered.  It is big and ugly.  Most likely designed for an old 35mm camera from the 80's or 90's.  I won't be using it.
B001RFIGQ2|5.0|It was exactly as described and it arrived early than expected. I would definitely shop there again for another order.
B00000FC5H|5.0|You can't go wrong buying this CD. All the jams are fantastic. Takes me back to the days when I was young.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|I read the book and I also encourage people to read it. The movie just has the main points from the book, but is very accurate to the story line.
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|It was a Gift for my nephew. He was really happy when he opened her present. It was his favorite movie.
B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|It's a great novel. I recommend it to someone who likes detective novels and want a different reading with antihero characters
B0007KTBIU|5.0|It was a Christmas Gift. For my niece. She was really happy when she opened her present. Her favorite movie.
B009JBZH54|5.0|3 films on Blu-ray for 27.99$? I should be an idiot if I didn't bought it last month..<br /><br />The first film, Batman Begins, although is a BR disc, doesn't feels or looks like a REAL 1080p experience.. with a dull sound and an average picture, looks more like a DVD 2.0 than a BD..<br /><br />The 2 others, are just jaw dropping gorgeous, full HD at 1080p with Dolby True HD 7.1, makes this experience far better than the movies..<br /><br />Do yourself a favor an buy this, YOU need this..!
B009VB7P6G|5.0|This was by far the best tinkerbell movie I have ever seen! I could watch it over and over again.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Every middle schooler should read it, and every parent too. I read it not knowing it was for our youth
B005LAIH4A|2.0|For a kid's movie and for it being a Dr Seuss story, this is way too geared for adults.  At least I got it for only $3.99, so I don't feel too bad.
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|The book was the best book I ever read and I do not  read a lot<br />I think you will like it a lot<br />It was my favorite book ever
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Love the book! What happens to them now?! Hopefully there's a continuation of this book. Definitely a book you don't want to put down.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book is considerably faster paced than the second one, almost too fast at times; however, the pace kept me riveted until the very end. The latter half definitely has a few surprises that make it memorable, despite the fact that it is contrary to how I would have liked to see the story end. I enjoyed the book and would definitely recommend it to a friend.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I'm really not much of a reader, but when I saw all the great reviews this book got I had to give it a try. After I started reading it I couldn't put it down! Probably the best and most well written books I've ever read! Definitely a must!
1441866213|5.0|A good continuation of the Honor Harrington Saga and without a lot of useless dialogue to make a longer book.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My son and grandson both have played this game on their phone but I had not till I played it on my Kimble. Its fun and challanging to say the least and now I see why it is so popular. Thanks for a great game!
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|Since we see many of the voice actors from Seth MacFarlane's crew in person here, and since the humor is pretty much the same as Family Guy, this was just kind of like watching a decent, very long, episode of Family Guy or American Dad. For example, they make fun of the fact that the voice of Peter is the voice of the bear at least a billion times, which is old after the first time they do it. The novelty of the talking, cursing bear, is over in about 20 minutes as well. Still, there were a few funny moments, and if you like Family Guy, or that style of humor, then renting this in non-HD format is worth it. There are no special effects, or sound considerations here, that really benefit from an HD rental or purchase. I would strongly encourage you to rent, and not purchase, this movie. Still, paying to see it was a bit much for me. Oh well, I did it, and can't un-do it.
0385484518|5.0|This is a must read book! I have read it over and over, so that is why I finally bought it. Good quality of a book too!
B008CPZNL6|3.0|I've seen this app on an iPad and it seems to work much better. I have a new Kindle Fire HD and while the content that does show up looks great, it's slow to load and respond.
B002PZC8BM|5.0|I am a huge fan of Simon Baker after the Guardian, which I preferred to The Mentalist.  But I'll watch anything when him in it.
0765325950|1.0|I have been reading the Wheel of Time series from the start, buying the first one at the Stars and Stripes bookstore in West Germany but I have made the transition to ebooks. Having to wait until April for the ebook is ridiculous when I need to have the ebook for reading ease. I really hate using a magnifying glass to read the small type size, along with the typeface used.<br /><br />Just because Mrs. Jordan is uncomfortable with ebooks doesn't mean that the public should have to be the ones who are harmed by her decision.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised at how much I was enjoyed this book.  Though I thought I would be out of the target age range for it, it kept my attention well enough. Nothing bad to say. I did hear the movie was better. Will have to see.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Another good book ! Now onto the third one ! Can't wait to see the movies ! Good work Suzanne Collins !
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I LOVED THE BOOK.  IT WAS AS GREAT AS HIS OTHER DIARY OF A WIMP KID BOOKS I LOVED IT
B00A757EFW|3.0|I found that it is hard to control pac man.  Slow to respond to change of direction with or without a stylus.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I love this CD.  It is so well put together.  You can't go wrong buying her music.  I enjoy listening to this CD over and over.
B001HTSCZI|4.0|Not as grown-up as the original three but not as silly and childish as \\"Phantom Menace.\\"  Plus, it begins to cover what I always thought would be the most interesting chapter in the Star Wars saga, the Clone Wars.  I do wonder how the introduction (and obvious later demise) of so many characters will be handled over the TV series.  My son, a budding Star Wars fan and only 5, loves this movie.
B0026P3G12|5.0|This too is a wonderful CD.  Susan's voice is just unbelievable.  I never get tired of listening to her music and can play them over and over again.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|loved it....u will fall in love with holder. was an emotional journey with a few twists and turns along the way.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised when I read this book! I had heard good things but WOW, I didn't expect to love it so much! Very good book! I am super excited for the follow up \\"Walking Disaster\\" in April! It will tell the story through Travis' eyes! Mmmmm can't wait!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I bought this album when I discovered it on YouTube.<br />I live in France and I had to order album on American Amazon store ...<br />When my familly and friends hear this album they want to have it ^-^<br />I hope this first album won't be the last !
B005LAII08|5.0|This was a gift for one of my grandchildren.  It was so exciting to see the little face when it got opened.  We all love the movie and my grandchildren will enjoy it over and over again.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|Very engaging - lots of fun to read. Characters are very engaging. I couldn't put it down. Great when you want a light read.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I read all three of these books a year ago.<br /><br />Seeing the cover made me want to read them again, and after I downloaded The Hunger Games, I haven't put any of them down. It's been a week since I've done anything other than read... I find it that any book I ever try to reread, I get bored because I know exactly what's going to happen. I guess the same goes for this time, but I counter that Collins' style of writing is so very distinct, it makes you think about what's going on in the character' head. And reading them again really distinguished everything for me.<br /><br />ANYBODY would enjoy these books, for that there's love, war, and everything in between. Collins' has written a remarkable series that always touches me heart.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|The numerous four and five-star reviews for this book and its #1 Kindle ranking really made me think that this book was going to be fantastic.  What a disappointment.  What I will say up front is that this book should definitely be classified as young adult.  At the same time, a lot of the content in it is really heavy and too mature for the younger-end of the young adult category.  People ages 17-20 would probably relate to this book the best.  I will elaborate, but I can't avoid spoilers, so I wanted to put that info up front to hopefully alert future readers.<br /><br />I am giving this book two stars, which to me means that I didn't like it, but it was not bad enough for me to abandon it without finishing it.<br /><br />*MAJOR SPOILERS BELOW (some pretty specific)*<br /><br />The first half of the book was entertaining.  The pacing was good, the characters were fun to learn about, and the day-to-day high school stuff was fun to follow along with; however, it wasn't without its faults.  Sky, in my opinion, is kind of a brat.  I just didn't find her character to be very likable.  Her ignorance about technology was a bit far-fetched, especially considering she has a best friend nearby that she gets to spend lots of time with, who doesn't have technology banned from her house.  I was okay with letting that slide.  I didn't like how she treats Breckin.  She barely knows him, he is the only person that treats her well in school the first day, and she takes his coffee and then demands that he bring her coffee every morning.  Maybe I am reading too much into that, but it seems like Sky's world revolves around Sky.  And who gives their friends e-readers/tablets for birthday presents in high school?  Then, the whole \\"crying a single tear\\" thing was really melodramatic.  It made me think of the John Waters' movie 'Cry Baby,' but in a stupid sense because 'Cry Baby' is a comedy and this book is supposed to be serious.<br /><br />I did like Holder, though.  He is endearing,even despite his occasional dramatic temper tantrums.  Something about him is just warmer and fuzzier.  Maybe it has to do with the fact that he tries so hard throughout the book to take care of Sky.  He picks her up off the ground, he protects her and watches over her, he cooks for her, he plays her stupid games ... which leads me to my next problem with the book, the characters are not teenagers.  BUT, they ARE teenagers!  BUT, they don't act like teenagers!  BUT, they DO act like teenagers!  Basically, this book has a maturity crisis.  The characters behave like teenagers in a lot of ways, but then in other ways, they behave way more maturely than teenagers.  Holder and Sky together are definitely not teenagers.  Maybe it's because I am 29, but I just could not get through this book picturing Holder and Sky as 17 and 18 years old.  I had to age them in my mind in order for the dialogue and experiences between the two of them to make sense to me.  Thheennn, there will be a scene thrown in where a character will behave like a teenager again and it shatters the work I've done to create the illusion.  This kind of problem with the story made it seem like I was reading fan-fiction written by a mature woman in order to fantasize about being in high school again.<br /><br />Another issue I had with the book is that it was very predictable.  I am not sure if it was meant to be that way or not, but I knew much, much earlier than the reveal that Sky was an abuse victim.  It was also really easy to figure out Karen's role, to a degree, and it just made me even more frustrated at Sky that she was even remotely torn over what the \\"right\\" thing to do regarding Karen was.  That whole internal battle came across a bit like an after-school special on \\"doing the 'right' thing.\\"<br /><br />Lastly, if I had known that this book was going to revolve entirely around sexual abuse, and extreme child sex abuse at that, I would not have bought it.  It would not have been quite as bad if was more contained to one victim, but then to expand it out as far as it went, it was overboard.  It kind of reminds me of when authors kill off multiple characters in a book for no good reason other than to kick the readers in the gonads.  I feel like I have to read a post-apocalyptic novel or something entirely different in order to purge the memory of this book out of my head.
0953104907|5.0|I love this book, I used it to build my first 5 string bass (neck through body design),<br />and I've read it since at least 4 more times, every time I discover new information that<br />will help me design my next axe.<br />I also used it as reference book during the building process to recheck things as i go.<br />Great book, great place to start if you're about to build your first guitar.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|Glad I got it in blu-ray.  Colors are awesome and adds to the movie.  Must try it!  You will love it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Must watch, that simple!! Beautifully written, acted, and directed. Downton Abbey gives an insight of a time in history we don't hear much about, between Jane Austin and the modern time.
B002VWNICW|5.0|I give this 5 stars because I actually saw items in the scenes that I had missed watching on DVD.  The color was excellent and viewing it on a large screem made the characters come to life!
B00AQMSJI2|5.0|Very Fun Game. I really like it. Its a great game for children and adults(when you are bored). I am glad I got this for free!!
B0086449YA|5.0|Was glad I found it. This is a very good two CD set. Music is relaxing and words are nice to listen to.
B008Y7DDBE|2.0|Plain and simple, this was just a tough movie to sit through.  I was looking for something that never happened.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|This movie was amazing! Not to mention I was able to see it with no pauses for downloading. Very good amount of time to watch movie.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|this is one of those albums that get better and better the more you listen to it.  I highly recommend.
B000YMQI6E|5.0|Many twists and turns will keep you thinking - nothing-less than a spectacular performance by Anthony and the other stars!
1451627289|5.0|I was happy to see Stephen King come out with something historical in nature!  This book kept me reading well into the night, well past my bed time ;)  Highly recommended!
B009E9QOEO|5.0|Just what I was looking for.  It didn't come with the plastic jewel case, but that doesn't matter.  I don't use those anyway.
B00441E2R8|4.0|Its a very nice watch, the material is very good and looks sophisticated, but the only thing that is not goo is that you can not watch the hands int the dark.
0307341577|2.0|Didn't like this book very much.  It was really dark and violent and several times described the bloody murder of little children.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It is entirely refreshing to read a work of fiction that provokes not only thought, but relativity as well. I've never identified more with a book.
0756688701|5.0|I got this book for my 3 year old for Christmas and he loves it!  He likes to know all the names of the cars and I can't keep up with them all so when he asks we just look it up in the book!  Great gift for any  Cars fan!
B000002KHF|5.0|Good deal, like the album a lot. Dilivery like proneced. I will buy a album again from this shop, shure !
1455523003|4.0|i very much enjoy the writings of christopher hitchens and it is no different with this book. he presents a  great argument and reminds us that those whom we worship must also be held acceptable
B001SMC91M|5.0|Good deal, like the album a lot. Dilivery like promeced. I will buy a album again from this shop, shure !
1439170916|2.0|A very well-written book that is more a history of cancer treatment than a biography of cancer.  A lot of good information.
0061148512|5.0|I read it a long time ago,and I really enjoyed it.  This time I bought the book for my son,and he is really enjoying it too.
1400069289|5.0|Great book about on a topic on which there is a great deal of research and theory.  His examples and action items are well-written and very practical.  I'm going to read it a second time to make sure I didn't miss anything (that would be a change in habit).
B00ANGSSWS|5.0|Never heard of this artist before, however, after just one time through loved it and is now one of my favorite.
B0086700CM|5.0|One of the best games EVER!! It's addictive, fast-paced, and challenging -- and one of my favorites! This game is absolutely wonderful. It's fun no matter what you put it on, whether it's an Android or an iPad, and is gets really fun when you've run for a long time and you're going REALLY fast. I won't say anything else -- but GET THIS APP!!!!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is simple but very addictive!! love it and can not seem to put down. try playing it today!!!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Les MIS is Les Mis. To criticize  this book would be stupid. It's great it's a classic.<br />Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Got this for my dad for Christmas, as this was the only thing he specifically asked for. He loves it so I'm happy.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|So much fun and very cool...loved the puzzles and how I had to collect things. One of my favorite things was the story
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I like the music mixes and the dancing. Reminded me of glee, if you like that kind of entertainment which i do.
B0026772N8|5.0|this in my opinion is one of the most interesting books i have read. it weaves philosophy, scientific theory, and engineering concepts effortlessly into a compelling story of a cross country road trip...i can see how people are reading it multiple time..<br /><br />a must-read...
B009KHCT94|4.0|So what don't they use the Nazis for. Zombies, Vampires, you name it. Well, now they are on the moon. Why not. Obviously don't expect too much from this movie, however, if you're of the group that likes different stuff then it's a cool movie. We were suprised how good the special effects were. The plot not so much. All in all it was what it was. An entertaining movie with a blend of sci-fi and Nazis doing what they do best. You get the drift. RW.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Great book-  off to book3! This was a real page turner, and I lived reading it with my son. Fantastic for the movie!
B00AHSINKO|4.0|This movie is very real and the actors really did well (I wouldn't have expected less). The storyline that is being told is way overdue and even though my husband and I are 30 years younger than these characters (Ok, maybe 20 years younger) we felt it and it helped us. Great movie but it is slow, it is for those who like to follow the scene - feel the character - and be engrossed in the storyline. I was upset it ended so quickly but it ended when it should have.
B008OJ291W|5.0|I had forgotten how great Jeff Lynne was until listening to an interview on a podcast. Great re-release seeing that my vinal is long gone....
B00A0SQBDM|3.0|Like: The narrative was nice and the pictures good. I found the hidden object scenes to be a good challenge.<br /><br />Recommend (Didn't Like): The scene transition leaves a lot open for interpretation and vs. wasting time to figure out am I supposed to be in the office or the basement in the Museum or in the galley or wherever on the boat just send me there or something. I get tired of walking around in circles guessing where I am supposed to go for the clue. Other than that I like the work of figuring out where the clue is even though most times it glows. Keep the glow and add a clearer direction for where to go - for instance just take me to the darn room. Ok I am done with the transition between scenes.<br /><br />Provide a way to zoom in to the scene.
B005SAJJHM|5.0|Funny show. Always works in perfect picture quality. I can watch on my iPad or thru my Roku box at home.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Another movie I didn't expect much from but this was super fun.  I am a choir mom so sometimes I get so tired of choral events (shhhh) but this was just joyous and a bunch of talented singers in the movie.  No one beats Fat Amy and I love Lilly, too.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Great app for twitter. It allows users to access and manage their Twitter account and that was what I was looking for. I recommend to anyone with a twitter account.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|I really thought this movie was going to be so stupid.  Not stupid funny but just stupid.  I think I laudghed almost at every scene.  Never expected Mark to be such a funny guy, he's so serious.  But Seth did it again and this movie is a must see if you want to laugh.  This is a good time....period.
B0086700CM|4.0|This is a very simple yet addictive game. I like the simplicity and the fact that it keeps the kids occupied for hours! I recommend to any game enthusiast.
B008BU70HW|5.0|I really enjoyed this as it not only highlighted the roles of the players both from the perspective of the author and the actor.  The historical background of that era and some information regarding the aristocracy of British life gives the reader insight as to why some of accounts, remarks, etc. are imbedded in their lifestyle.  The players are stupendous and makes this a must have in my collection.
B00A2H9LK6|2.0|Silent Hill was meant to be philosophical horror, slow, dark and personal. Movies like Jacob's ladder are better things to watch if you have interest in Silent Hill. This film takes everything away that made the games (1-3 anyway; the ones that matter) special. Its cheap, jump-out-and-go-boo scares aren't Silent Hill at all. I don't hate this film, its just another bad movie-game adaption. Its not surprising. These things happen a lot.<br /><br />If anything with the way Konami is treating the series the games will end up as dumb as this film. Downpour was a disaster and the Vita game an almost mockery of the franchise. Konami needs to let Team Silent get reformed and make new games and films because the last of any notable effort put into the franchise was with The Room and that came out almost 8 years ago. A damn shame.<br /><br />At least Akira Yamaoka came back to make 1 new song for the credits and a few touch ups/remixes to the soundtrack. The films best and saving grace; the music.
B005LAII3A|3.0|Nice film to watch, different from original film. Movie buffs should really like it.Colin Farrell and Kate Beckensdale are terrific.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  There were a few places where the writing seemed a bit off since it was not written in English but it was a good way to learn new vocabulary.  Very suspenseful book with good character development.
B009POCG0Y|4.0|Very nice diversionary movie to watch, Matthew McConaughey is a great actor.  Truely great movie, you can get caught up in its plot.
B009E3EY38|1.0|As a Led Zeppelin fan from way back I bought this product with high expectations of listening to their old music.  However, this was money wasted; don't purchase.
B004UID2LC|5.0|This an excellent app that my grand-daughter loves and so does the rest of the family. The price can't be beat it's free and will be getting hundreds if not thousands of uses.Kudos to Amazon for another excellent free App.
1439152802|5.0|This is a wonderful book. I loved the multiple viewpoints and the character development. The blend of history and present time worked very well and the twist at the end was fantastic.

B003WUYRGI|2.0|This book sucked monkey s*** balls. I would recommend this as a bed time book for complete bores. It SUCKS!!!!!
B007B5EDEG|5.0|A magnificant read, full of twists and turns.  HI have not read any previous books by this author however will do when I finish the complete 5 books.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Let's put it this way. I didn't put the book down from cover to cover . Action packed adventure that kept me up all night.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|My friends said it was good so I tried the free version, I was disappointed after a while it wouldn't let me play. That is why I gave it four stars, I will buy the full version just because the free version was awesome!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book started out a bit slow but once it got going I couldn't put it down. It's a beautiful little love story with a bit of a twist, would definitely recommend it!
B00280LYHS|5.0|Awesome book, I reread it from a couple years ago and it still holds up as an amazing book. A definite read for all ages
B000V8A95C|4.0|Like many of us, I usually don't have enough time/money/opportunities to go visit actual musicals. So, like many of us I suppose, I survive through the album recordings. Most of the songs I really enjoy, as they strike deep emotions behind their composition and are climactic in multiple ways. Listening from beginning to end, you can lace the story together roughly- the tragedy of a young girl who was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. I loved the story, and i loved the music even more. Defiantly buy it if you're the type of person who listens to and enjoys Broadway musicals but also if your the type of person who likes to analyze the philosophical meanings behind the themes.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Pretty good just not as funny last the past wimpy kids though<br />It was still funny but  why no the color red
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Interesting premise.  I read this book in just a couple of sittings.  I really enjoyed it though I was slightly disappointed in the ending.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|I like this game. But I really don't like that you have to pay real money for energy. I don't want to wait the three minutes to only get 1percent of energy back then lose I again, and I'm not going to pay money for more energy for a game.
0765325950|1.0|When I heard that the final book was going to be released I bought all the books on Kindle and reread them straight through hoping to finish around the release of MOL.<br /><br />I will not buy this book in hard cover! I am actually considering never purchasing it even though I have read all the other books at least twice and enjoyed them immensely.
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|Didn't see this one coming - VERY cute story that has become a family favorite this Christmas.  Hugh Laurie is excellent in this.
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|Great cast and a fun watch but feels like it fell a little short of the potential.  Tom Hardy is amazing.
0765325950|1.0|Once again, the Wheel of Time franchise is sacrificing any semblance of caring about the readers that put them where they are in order to bilk out every penny they can.  This has been their pattern all along with contrived plot lines designed to infuriatingly prolong the series artificially, release date extensions for marketing purposes, and now making their loyal ebook readers wait months because of someone's \\"legacy\\".  What is obvious here is that there is not a second thought to the readers that have been putting their hard earned money in Harriet's pocket.  I had intended on buying the ebook for immediate reading, then the hard cover next time i'm in the store.  Now I believe I'll skip both.  I don't like who i would be giving my money to.
B000SEGUDE|3.0|While I don't necessary like my books wrapped up in a neat and tidy bow, I found this book somewhat unsatisfying. I wanted something more, but that might be the point. I enjoyed the futuristic stories much more than the ones in the past - it took some getting used to the prose used in the stories of the past.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|In Mark of Athena, Rick Riordan brings together the heroes of the previous two books of this series: Annabeth, Percy, Jason, Piper, Leo, Frank, Hazel and their war-crazed chaperone, Coach Hedge. They are off to save the world, again, and they have to try not to kill each other along the way. This book is full of what you expect from this series - witty comments, oddball monsters and lots of adventure. I think because there were a lot more main characters to juggle, this book didn't flow as well as previous ones, but still worth reading.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|This is a great show! The cast compliments each other well and the content is just right-not to much violence. I can't wait for the next episodes.
B004J4WN0I|4.0|Two thousand year old druid, talking hound and an assortment of monsters and gods from pretty much every mythological background. Kind of like Percy Jackson for adults. Well written, well paced. Maybe because I had heard SO much hype about this book, I was not as impressed as I thought I would be, but still a very good book.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I am partial to physics based games. This is an excellent example of such a game. Every level gives you a different puzzle to solve, with one or sometimes several types of goo balls that you must user in different ways to reach a goal. A few of the levels are extremely difficult. You can finish the game without buying indulgences - skipping hard levels is free.
B00377Z0Y4|5.0|Always love Jethro Tull!  This album has cheerful, fresh versions of old favorites.  Absolutely love it and will watch for more new albums.
B00081U7HC|5.0|A very good performance by both Julia Roberts and Richard Gere.  Would recommend it to all adult audiences.  Very cute movie.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|I enjoyed Looper. It wasn't your typical time travel movie and the bad guys and good guys fell into the grey zone. Thoroughly enjoyed this film.
0345803485|5.0|Seems the ladies really like this book. Heard about it thru the media and bought it, she is reading it now
B005LAII08|3.0|We love to watch these movies with our grandson.  We thought this movie would really be cute, but we were very disappointed in it.  Wished we had watched it before we bought it.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|The commercials for Ted made it out to be super funny (which is the point of commercials in the first place) and my friends said it was the best movie they'd ever seen. I politely disagree. Though it did have quite a few humorous lines (most of which were already seen in the commercials), the movie itself was more gratting on the nerves than anything. The sappy crap storyline made me want to gag and the plot line was to pradicatable. The sound got messed up in a few places in a way that made it blatenty obvious which was from a recording studio and which was from the scene being filmed. Over all its humor is more for the immature, which is kind of condicending for me to say given that I am fourteen. I laughed, but it still didn't make up for the poor plot line.
B008Y1YJZY|5.0|My 6 yr old grandson really enjoyed this movie.  He watched it over and over.  Even the adults liked it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a fun game.  You have to figure out each game and score high enough to earn points you unlock more games.  You may also watch videos to unlock games.
B0053O89RY|5.0|Gave it to my wife for Christmas - she has already watched it through twice.  Loves the show and loved the gift.
145210655X|5.0|I got this for my daughters boyfriend and everyone who checked it out thought it was terrific..... quite the most enjoyable cartoon book I have ever read
B002UPA4ZY|5.0|Awesome entertainer, awesome music, awesome guests, awesome setting aweswome cd./dvd<br />stupid requirement of minimum words needed to rate4 a product wast of my time
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|the game completely hols my interest . I do not want to put it down. Bery god puzzles. They really make me think.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jonesbonce again are teamed up with a great chemistry! It is comical, but there are sad signs of two people who had given up working on keeping their marriage fresh and new.
B008ALA6DW|3.0|Apple products are so needlessly expensive but it works as advertised. I just hate that I had to buy it in order to transfer files.
B007UQRW62|5.0|I have a super duper soft spot for this movie, because it meant a lot to me growing up. The box came with the DVD and Blu-Ray, of course, but also a nice book with detailed information, small prints of the original movie posters, and of all things a cute umbrella. And it's a limited batch, so I feel a little special owning it :)
B000AQBAUI|5.0|Loud, proud and full-on in your face.<br />That's the best way to describe Leaf Hound.<br />Everything that was the hard-rock music scene in 1969-1970 is in this release.<br />Highly recommended.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|Its visually very good: special effects are fun and the sets, costumes, landscapes are all very appealing. The dialog and the characters that carry it are fairly bland and unoriginal. I had hoped for more.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|many options for personalization, I like that you can use your music for alarm tones. By far the most functional alarm app I have found
B001HN6922|5.0|He loved watching his favorite characters. DVD worked well and kept our little one entertained during such a hectic hoiday season.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I was looking for a new series and as the movie Jack Reacher was just released thought I would start at the beginning. This is a very intriguing novel - full of plot twists and turns. It really holds your attention and I'm glad I began with the first novel to get to know the character from the beginning. Since then, I have read two additional novels, however, this one is still my favorite.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book about a normal girl in a horrible reality that does what she must to keep her family and herself alive without a father. She is run thrust into \\"The Hunger Games\\" A sadistic game based around killing for enjoyment, struggle for survival, and even some romance. This is a great read and I would recommend this book to anyone. Every reader will something about this book that makes it enjoyable.
B004LSJCJM|5.0|Once again this is Bonamassa. If you know his music, style, etc.. then you already know what to expect. So far enjoy every CD we own of his which is nearly all of them. The guy is good.
B005HS00P0|5.0|Got this for a gift, and we received it quickly and in a very well packaged &#34;box&#34; just for albums/vinyls!
B00992CF6W|5.0|The game is amazing you can almost do everything you can do on the Xbox 360 version of it but you cant make armor flint and steal and nether portals
1609611543|4.0|This book changed my life and I would recommend it for anyone looking to transform the way they feel.  The reading is quite dense in may places, but overall it was very thought provoking.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|I've never read a book written from the perspective of a dog before.  I thought it was a very unique writing style.  I loved the heartwarming story
B00A9X9ORI|1.0|It was too dark to see properly for many scenes, it was almost impossible to hear and/or understand the mumbling speech, and the cutting back and forth from future to present was very confusing.  Sorry I ever paid for it especially since I stopped watching after one hour in.
B0027P2ZWC|5.0|This is a wonderful concert of a great show.  Enjoy the beautiful orchestration and fabulous voices.  If you loved the show you'll love theis CD.
B001I403MM|5.0|The first of his books on souls living between lives. Could hardly wait to read on. Easily understood with many many case histories.
B000FC130E|5.0|had to read it for class but it turned out not to be bad at all, it was rather very enjoyable
1419705849|4.0|I bought this for my grandson who has read all of the other Wimpy Kid books. He enjoys them and he said this one is very good also.
B00AFWEPVI|2.0|Took some pictures and worked fine. Tested video, it worked. Decided to try to video my dogs, but then every time l chose video, a dialog popped up saying camera has closed. So after shooting one 10 sec. test video, it shut down every time i tried video mode again.
B005LAII08|4.0|This was a very good collectors edition. This bundle is Worth every penny. I highly recommend this to everyone of every age.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Definitely my favorite Sparks book so far! Such a good ending that made me speechless. Can't wait for the movie!
B009FXIICK|4.0|Played it back on Nintendo DS and it's a simple and fun game to kill time.  Works well with my phone and also on bigger tablet.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a excellent way to see if how much battery life you have left. Works great with my kindle fire. :-)
B00756GKBA|4.0|I've been a Madonna fan since the late 1990's with her hit album Ray of Light. And maybe im not a hardcore fan, but I really don't consider her album MDNA as her finest work, nor more as an excuse, to tour for. Still, without an effort towards this album (as an personal opinion) MDNA has some great tracks that will satisfy any music junkie. To upbeat songs like Girl Gone Wild to soft-ray of light-ish songs like Falling Free, this is a great album to own. plus, the deluxe edition has some great bonus tracks as well
0316056863|2.0|- Goddammit man, sometimes I really wonder `bout you.<br />- What? What did I do know?<br />- Why on earth did you buy this book?<br />- What? They said it would be good?<br />- Who said it man?<br />- They said it! Over at [unlicensed advertising ban]. They voted it as the best `humor' book of 2011.<br />- Since when do you buy books according to awards?<br />- Sometimes I do. Man can have its pleasures. Why're you fussing?<br />- Do you even know who Tina Fey is?<br />- Couldn't care less. I just wanted to see what is considered as good humor these days.<br />- This thing surely isn't. It barely passes as a book. It reads as hardcovered blog whose Editor was drunk or vent on vacation leaving his voicemail to do his editing for him.<br />- So? It's a modern age and a modern time. Structure is for pussies!<br />- Really dude? And you ask why I wonder.... You're not even American or a woman (last time I checked).<br />- So? Are you really that biased and sexist to think that a man from SE Europe can't enjoy something like this?<br />- I would buy that if that made any sense. I mean, she spent pages and pages writing about Sarah Palin and her connection with SNL during the election year, not to mention not-so-subtle-I'm not bother by my looks-nor gender-nor biased office politics but I still feel the obligation to rant about this every single page-attitude. Do you really care about this over there? I mean, from your perspective - whole bit about breast feeding vs. formula seems pointless. That is not even a Topic in your country.<br />- Well, what can I say? I was expecting something completely different. It was classified as `humor'.<br />- Well, did you find any?<br />- I did.<br />- Where?<br />- On the back cover. That was the best bit.<br />- Wait a minute. So you agree that this was horrid?<br />- Of course it was, but that doesn't mean it's bad.<br />- What?<br />- It just means that Fey wrote for a very specific audience in mind. And I wasn't part of that audience.<br />- How would you define this audience then?<br />- No need for any sort of definition. This can be read (and presumably enjoyed) if you're either American or a friend of the family. Should explain this. Topics in this book are American (I mean, topics in DeLillo's books are American, but contrary to DeLillo, Fey doesn't write about them, she presumes beforehand knowledge and everydayness of them so if you're reading this book and are incidentally born in Nicaragua you'll have hard time caring and/or understanding for any of them).<br />- Wait a moment. I thought that you know your way around American pop-culture and history in general?<br />- I do, but consider this. Imagine I wrote a book about life in my hometown and fill it with my views on general, newspaper-topics that were really important in a town of 150000 people back in the mid `90s. Would you read this thing?<br />- Probably not.<br />- Even if I did my best to use cheap and repetitive humor that is borderline funny to a ten-year-old?<br />- No.<br />- And if I was a star spending some of my time posing for magazine covers?<br />- Well, now that you mention it...but, Fey doesn't write about some godforsaken place inhabited by old people and ghosts...She writes about New York, and SNL and \\"30 rock\\" and offers advice on how to raise you kids and be a better person of a female persuasion.<br />- All cool mate, if you would give 5c for any of it than you might find this interesting. And by the way, Pratchett's Granny Weatherwax was kicking buts and offering saner advices back in the `80s.<br />-  So you do regret buying this book?<br />- I do. Not because I wasn't the target audience. I could have lived with that (I do enjoy Jane Austen for example). Skill part, though. Writing and humor. Maybe Fey does know how to do television comedy (can't tell, never watched anything of hers) but in written form she's awful. I would've regretted buying this more if I didn't pay 1.5$ for it over at [unlicensed advertising - again]. Gonna read some Jehovah's witnesses' pamphlets now. Compared to this it will be a time well spent.vertising - again]. Gonna read some Jehovah's witnesses' pamphlets now. Compared to this it will be a time well spent.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|This isn't a pop-dance album ful of joy and generic upbeat songs. If you're looking for something like that, this album ain't for ya. The great instrumental quality of the songs, the tragically beauty of the lyrics and Lana's &#34;a lo Nancy Sinatra&#34; voice makes this album a great piece of anyone's music collection
B00364K6YW|5.0|I've loved this story for many years.  This is a fine version of the movie.  I will recommend it  to my friends.
B008645YH6|5.0|Marina & the Diamonds (meaning her fans) is still an underground artist with true lyrical talent. Electra Heart narrates the life of Electra Heart, her alter ego, the good (bubblegum bitch, Primadonna, state of dreaming) the bad (lies, starring role, valley of the dolls, hypocrites ) the ugly (fear and loathing, teen idle) to the raise form the ashes (radioactive, how to be a heartbreaker).
0783229364|5.0|Michael J. Fox is great in it. Love it. Saw at least 10x. Not for everyone. Can watch over and over.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This AP is fun, fast, and slightly addictive.  I find that I can win often with 3 suits, but it still is a challenge.  Four suits was fun too, but I like to win more often.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|David Baldacci does it again.  He keeps us guessing what is around the corner and is a master at developing a suspenseful ending.
B009DQQF7Y|1.0|I wanted to like this, but they've become so predictable that (apologizing as I write) I have to compare their songwriting to Linkin Park's, clearly there is a set formula, beyond that, Alleelujah is a total snoozefest (as if they don't agitate me enough, Pitchfork couldn't be more wrong in their assessment of this album). My griping aside, it make me appreciate their earlier stuff infinitely more than I had. As a sidenote, does anyone else find it odd that this album can be bought on Amazon? Granted, I did purchase it here, but doesn't that go against everything they &#34;stand for&#34;? And based of how awful this album is, i am really going to have to think long and hard about buying the new MBV when it's actually released.
0439023513|5.0|Suzanne Collins definitely has a gift! I read this book in one day, just could not put it down. Read it!
B0093URN4E|3.0|I think they peaked with Jane Doe and You Fail Me, this isn't bad, but it's not great. Heavy s***, but very produced (not to say they aren't extremely talented) - Although, listening to this, I kind of want to hear some new stuff by Botch.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I loved this book. I thought it was well written and the pictures were a really nice touch. I can't wait for the sequel.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|I downloaded this app as I did want to try out the camera on the Kindle Fire HD my wife bought me recently.  It is a shame that Amazon did not put another lens on the back of the Fire as getting a good shot other than of yourself is difficult.  This app does what it was described to do, however, given the difficulty in using the built in camera, it makes the best of a poor design.  When I compare the Fire camera feature with my wife's IPAD, there is no comparison. I would gladly pay more for the Fire if the option of a better camera arrangement were available.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I am a big fan of Nicholas Sparks.  He never dissapoints me! The characters and story are so real and compassionate.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|had a different twist to it and really enjoyed....I actually laughed at some of the court room drama and found it humorous and such....
1416511946|5.0|I will keep this short and sweet. This was a very moving and intruging book. Nikki Sixx is one of rock's greatest icons, and a look into a year of his life's struggles with addiction was captivating. I felt as areader I was right there with him in his \\"heroin den\\", overdosing, and on the road. His diary refelcted that of the artist he is. He has a great way with words that really invited the reader to understand his mess and sordid outlook on life. A great book. I loved the art work, and the commentaries of the people in his life during this time, it was a great way for him tohave reflection of his past. I will def re-read this again after sometime. A very real perspective of drug addiction andhow it can dibilate lives. I am so glad he was able to get help and stick to being clean and sober. Thanks Nikki for sharing a piece of your world with the public.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|great game for those that like spacial puzzles!<br />i only wish there were more free hints!<br />a really good free game!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Great movie, love wathcing on a family fun Friday with our kids. This is a movie we can watch again and again.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Very good gripping read, the pictures are great because you can actually see what they are describing the kids like.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Claire Danes was incredible in this movie! This movie really helps you understand autism better. I highly recommend, five star!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wonder what's next???<br />Enjoyed book way more then movie, but both were great. First book on new kindle, nice way to read!
B001F12J48|1.0|The 3D version I received was a very old style format and will not work on newer style projectors. I have a<br />Sony system.
013168728X|3.0|This book does a decent job of covering the field of image processing pretty comprehensively. Some material in the book was explained to briefly for me to grasp it, but the applications listed throughout the text (and the example images) where very interesting. If anything, I would have liked more discussion on compression, and a more comprehensible discussion on wavelets.
0425263908|5.0|I read the 50 shades of Grey trilogy and liked it, but Bared to You is WAY better. It's written better, and the story is more interesting. The characters have more depth and the story is actually moving. I seriously could not put down that book. Highly recommended if you are into erotic novels.
0143115014|5.0|Bought this for my girlfriend, who is a serious lover of perfumes. She really enjoyed it, so I'll give it five stars.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book! Grabbed me from the very beginning! I can not wait to read the other two books. I definitely recommend it.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|Good for just learning or serious play, menus are streight forward to get you playing fast.  I enjoy killing time with this handsome no-nonsense offering.
B003Y5RLR8|5.0|Elvis is the best intetanter of time.  You will enjoy all his concert and all his CDs.  We love hearing him sing he puts all his songs with passion and love in his music.  We love to hear and watch him.<br /><br />Priscilla Metcalfe
B000QV01AW|5.0|The vinyl I received was in rough shape since it was used. All of that aside, the album will go down as one of my favorites of all time. I've probably played the whole thing over a couple hundred times. A must have in any format, especially vinyl.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I chose this rating because there was no clear enemy to focus on, unless it is gossip.  It toook too long to get a story going and the character development was only strong with the teens, not the aduts.
1600242405|5.0|Loved this book it was fantastic and very insightful. I loved that it wasnt just about drugs but so much about the music
B0014YVC6W|5.0|I had a few hearty laughs watching this.  I'd forgotten how great it was and how much fun it was to laugh that hard.  It might be too &#34;eighties&#34; for some, but for me it was nostalgic, and a great reminder of how optimistic the human (or, apparently, robot) spirit can be sometimes.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I thought that this was going to be a really good book but alas utter rubbish. No story, boring sex and just droll
B0030MM68O|4.0|I watched it because of Jeremy Renner.  I don't like war movies but I liked this show.  It seemed to be a good representation of what our guys go through but it doesn't drag your spirit down.  The characters made you have to think.  They weren't what I wanted them to be but they were real and really ... I liked that better.
B007KOYEOC|1.0|I thoyught this book was utter rubbish. My god what is all the hype about I wa waiting for a good story to unfold
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Could not put this book down!  I can not wait to start on book two.  I highly recommend this book!
B004EBT7RI|5.0|I loved this book and it was a great story about a great chef really intersting and well written. It was GREAT
B0063IH60K|4.0|just downloaded solitaire &amp; find it fun &amp; addicting. works consistently &amp;fits the smaller screen well. I highly recommend it. reminds me of playing solitaire with cards only now dealing is very quick.
B007KZY1YY|1.0|What a load of rubbish I read all three books beause I thought there must have been a story somewhere about to unfold but NO
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I love dragon vale a lot,  but I think Dragon Story by team lava is better. It is easier to earn gold on Dragon Story, and there are more interesting dragons. But I'd definitely say Dragonvale is a great game.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|This is my favorite Rodriguez album he is an absolute genius and I could listen to him all day long
B005DOL0R0|4.0|This sleeve works very well for my Kindle Fire.  It seems well made and fits perfectly.  I really like it.

B009VA1FN6|5.0|This was a fantastic read. Well written and a great ending. finding a good book to follow was very hard
B0060ANP10|5.0|What can be said about this man and his music that hasn't already been said?<br /><br />This album is a prime example of what made blues/rock the great thang that it is. If you like Rory Gallagher,Jimi Hendrix,Stevie Ray Vaughan and the like,then you owe it to yourself to spend a few Quid,Dollars,Yen or whatever to give this a listen. You'll be well entertained!
B003E20ZQA|5.0|I loved this book it was a great read and very interesting. Patti Smith was very humble and complimentary to her friends. She had a huge group of friends crazy artists and musos.I highly recommend it
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the book and can't wait to read more! Looking forward to reading the next Hunger Games novel and maybe even see the movie!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|its fun addicting and gose on fos thos evers and you can get even more levels for cheep but theres alredy a ton of levals included
B00APUQPX6|5.0|Very enjoyable film for both adults and kids.  8 1/2 and 3 year old both stayed with it to the end.
B00A04BKA0|5.0|A skeptic turned believer provides a different perspective. I have read many books on the subject and found this one refreshingly different. I couldn't put it down until I had finished reading it so I read it in one session. Highly recommended.
B003SI7OQ4|1.0|my kids wouldnt even watch it, wish I hadnt rented it. dont know why it was even a rentable movie, what a waste.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|This is a wonderful book on life and it's challenges.  The characters and story line will appeal to everyone.  It's very well written and engaging.  Hope readers enjoy it as much as I did.
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|Bruno mars is so chill and happy when I am having a tough day at work I love listening to it!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys action thriller books. I had not heard of Lee Child until I saw the movie Jack Reacher with Tom Cruise. A friend of mine suggested this series. I enjoyed reading this book.  I kept turning the page interested in finding out what was next.  Jack Reacher is an intriguing character.<br />  I am looking forward to the next book.
B005AERS74|5.0|I love maroon 5 anyway, but this new cd is pretty awesome. I've listened to it several times and I'm still enjoying it.
B0015DROBO|3.0|With all the excellent reviews I was expecting something more exciting and engaging.  The plot plods and the characters are lacking chemistry.  The long laborious development of the geneology is boring and takes too long to make connections to the plot.
B007M45PMU|2.0|ho hey is a pretty good song but its the only one worth buying. the rest of the songs sound whiny and they really just suck. more like a karoake night then an actually produced cd.
B0043XZ8B6|5.0|Given that I own every one of Peter Gabriel's solo albums, and the fact that this album more than holds its own in the wake of Peter's commercial breakthrough album \\"So\\" I feel that this is yet another LONG-overdue review in which my two cents are a must.<br /><br />The first and foremost thing that I will say about this album is... WOW!!! How on earth has this tremendous work of art by the mighty Peter Gabriel managed to escape my radar for so long? I can vaguely recall receiving the \\"So\\" album as a present for my 14th(?) birthday, having already acquired an appreciation for classic rock music. Having been able to use a computer and the internet more skillfully in the years afterwards, I was able to stumble across the \\"Us\\" album, which I had not even the slightest clue existed until I was maybe 21 or 22. When I finally got ahold of the album at the now-closed-down Newbury Comics at my local mall in summer of 2010 (for just $5, woo-hoo!), and listened to it from beginning to end, I was flabbergasted, both at the rich, pure BEAUTY of every single song, and at how I had never really even heard any of the songs before, except maybe for \\"Steam.\\"<br /><br />As I perceive it, the album itself is an obvious shift away from the new-wave-influenced sound of \\"So\\" and a shift towards a more eclectic sound that incorporates more influence from funk and world music, most notably African. The funk influence is most prominently displayed in the songs \\"Steam\\" (which I like to describe as \\"Sledgehammer on steroids\\" lol), \\"Digging In The Dirt\\" and \\"Kiss That Frog.\\" The latter two songs are more steady-paced than the fiercely-upbeat \\"Steam\\" yet Peter still conveys an equal amount of angst. I have played all of these songs in a few of the local run-down dive bars in my home community, and they have been well-received by just about everyone present, both younger and older alike. The African influence is most prominent in the songs \\"Come Talk To Me\\" and \\"Blood Of Eden\\" both of which feature the Irish singer Sinead O'Connor, whose voice provides an excellent harmony with Peter's voice, even though it is mostly in the background. The chanting towards the end of \\"Come Talk To Me\\" in addition to the African wind instrument (I forget exactly what it is called) make for an amazing and powerful melody.<br /><br />Aside from the aforementioned songs, which I perceive as the most notable stand-outs on the album, the rest of the songs that make up the rest of the album are equally amazing in their own right, and truly make for a comforting listen. I have found this to be exceptionally pleasant after coming home from a busy day at work, or if I am feeling angry and just want something to help remind me that everything is alright, and that life has its ups and downs. It all makes sense, as this album focuses on a lot of personal problems and troubled relationships endeavored by Peter Gabriel himself. I can definitely relate to this myself in many ways, and on many levels.<br /><br />It seems to me that, ever since the explosion of success with the \\"So\\" album, Peter Gabriel simply became ever more obscured in the shadow of his Genesis pal, Phil Collins, who seemed to be able to maintain his well-known level of success. With Peter's own success with \\"So\\" combined with Phil's success with the albums \\"No Jacket Required\\" and \\"...But Seriously,\\" this equally amazing album has gone unfairly, or, dare I even say, criminally over-looked by the general public. But then again, I bet anything that Peter Gabriel himself never even cared about commercial success at this point in his career. He is, and always has been, an innovator in music, and not to mention an honest, down-to-earth and talented musician who takes an interest in the good of all humanity and the many types of music that exist in this world. He has taken some very differing paths in his career as compared to Phil Collins, but I stand firmly by the fact that BOTH men have always been equally important to music in their own ways, having both originated from the same band, Genesis.<br /><br />This album has become one of my absolute favorites outside the heavy rock/metal music categories, and I have never ignored it at all. It is a true piece of artwork in its own right, and deserves to be in the collection of anyone who has an appreciation for well-crafted, beautiful music. Peter Gabriel has always been one of my favorite artists of all time, and has touched the hearts of millions all over the world. Do yourself a favor, and buy this album if you haven't done so already! You will be very glad that you did.ic in their own ways, having both originated from the same band, Genesis.<br /><br />This album has become one of my absolute favorites outside the heavy rock/metal music categories, and I have never ignored it at all.

B005PTQPU0|4.0|I have been a Kate Bush fan for many years, and I found this album intriguing. Kate has toned down her vocal pyrotechnics in favor of a more subtle richness. This is a contemplative album, and the lyrics drive the music, so it pays to read them! Beautiful, haunting in some ways, and deserving of repeated close listening. If you like Kate, you should like this album.
0385335997|5.0|Loved following the adventures of Jamie and Claire.My daughter and I have read the series, often borrowing them from the library, now we share the most wonderful stories of Scotland together!
1401924352|5.0|Miranda!!  I looved reading your book!  What a beautiful person you are, so down-to-earth and thoroughly quality!

Thank you for caring so much about others - and yourself - and for spreading the beauty and light that is within you to the rest of the world! I hope to meet you someday : )  xoxo Julia
B008MZPVP4|1.0|I am a huge Down fan and their first 2 cd's are classics.  Down 3 had mediocre soundwriting and Phil's vocal chords were shot, much like Brian Johnson's have been in AC/DC since Thunderstruck.  Still, I ran out yesterday and bought the Down IV cd...but something was wrong.<br /><br />The engineering and mixing were so bad and the volume so low, I actually returned it to the store thinking the cd itself was defective and got a replacement!  To my surprise it was not the cd, but the horrible engineering, mixing and production job done on this EP.<br /><br />I'm used to sludge mixing with bands like The Sword and High On Fire, but this is ridiculous.  I've heard better audio from local bands demo cd's.  The guitars sound like they were recorded 500 yards away from the studio and you cannot make out a single actual bass guitar note, just an occasional added thump of a low E accompanying the murky drums (you can hear snare and bass drum, still can't hear a tom tom at all).<br /><br />I get that Phil and the guys want to have a jam feel like Kyuss and early Queens of the Stone Age, but actually go back and listen to those bands and you can hear they were trying for the best production values they could afford.  Phil and Pepper spent $10 on this recording...and got robbed of $9.00!!!<br /><br />The whole cd sounds like it was engineered with a Mute button accidentally on during the recording.  My car stereo has decent thump to it, but this cd had to be cranked to twice the normal volume just to hear it.  Literally it sounds like your friends' band setup a 1980's tape recorder in the corner of their garage and pressed Record while they practiced.<br /><br />Yes Lamb of God has the big budget and can afford a producer like Machine, but even Amon Amarth, who will never have the $$$ Phil Anselmo does, can afford a modern, clear sounding record where every instrument can be heard.  I own 3 Down shirts, every cd (no pirating), and am about to see Down for the third time in concert this Monday night...but Mr. Anselmo, you really should refund the $7.99 I paid for this.  There are good songs buried on this cd, but good luck trying to resurrect them from the worst mixing job in music history.
0670026182|5.0|So happy with this book! It's a pure pleasure just to hold it and look through. I only regret that I cannot find all the ingredients in Russia.
B004XEIEWK|1.0|I ordered Marbles but the album that came was This Strange Engine!  This was a Christmas present and the mistake was not noticed until the present was opened
B000VYX8PE|5.0|Best book I ever read in my life. It is sad fun and awesomeness I can't wait till I get the second one
B00127RAJY|5.0|If you ever had doubts that a 20 minute dvd could be a good workout, this will change your mind. It is great for those people who are looking to get some workout time during busy days. I will say though that I have not done it long enough to notice any difference in weight or inches, but I love that my endurance seems to be getting better and better every time I do it. However, don't kid yourself into thinking that this dvd alone will help you lose tons of weight unless you are following a proper healthy diet or you are really overweight.
B004KPQK2S|3.0|This movie was a little drug out.  The storyline is a great one and the actors are wonderful.  The horse scenes steal the show, of course.  It an easy watch and you don't really need to be paying a lot of attention to keep up with the plot.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it takes a long to download but awesome game lol hope u like it new players I'm also a new player and I'm stuck on it what will I do when I need to charge my kindle fire
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey is just right for ANYONE!  This ONE show has enough talent for TEN shows!  Full of twists and turns, limitless high-level humor, and romance, I hope its writers never stop!
1594744769|5.0|This book has to be one of my favorite books I have ever read. I loved it, and was very sad when the book was finished. I am praying that Mr. Riggs will write a book #2 to follow up with this. The characters are amazing, and I felt connected with them. The pictures that go along with the story are fantastic. I recommend this book, Actually, If you but this book and honestly do not like it,  I will buy it from you.(*Only if you really read the whole book and still did not like it, and kept in good shape) That is how serious I am that you will enjoy this book.,
B004XNGKBS|1.0|Would work for what I need, but it is really irritating not to have a hand guard, you have to write in a un-natural postion, or your hand leaves un wanted marks in the page. Wished I could get my money back
1451648537|5.0|This was a gift on my 40 year-olds X-mas list!  She was extremely happy, and I was very, very pleased!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I learned a lot about the seals, the technology they use and their training. They have a lot of balls!
B00417HV14|5.0|This true guitar artist has somehow skated under the nose of most of us for years! Playing since he was around 11 or maybe younger,he has learned,practiced,and honed his craft to an extremely sharp edge of fire! Eric Clapton would not agree to come and play on stage with just anyone,and the two of them together was truly a sweet treat for the audio senses.The quality of this is of course Blu-ray visually,but the best part of the disc is the HD DTS master option for your AVR (if yours has it,I hope),so that you can trully enjoy the seperation of the sounds as they were recorded. You won't be disappointed in the performance of this true blues and rock artist. There are people who are twice as famous and who have half the talent. His Acoustic guitar rendition puts to shame many others I have seen who are good,but not great!The disc is not too long and not too short,and if your like me,you'll come away wanting to buy more of Joe's music via his many CD's right here on Amazon!
B00AP9RQE4|4.0|Not up to the standard of The Curse of Chalion (but what is?) but better than Cryoburn.  I hope she writes more about Ivan.
B00000JPYD|5.0|I became acquainted with Robin's music back in the seventies,when &#34;chillin&#34; wasn't even an expression,but it certainly was being attained with Robin's mesmerizing music. Its a unique sound that can't be described by someone like me. His Bridge of Sighs title track makes you want to close your eyes and drift away on a cloud of smoke,experiencing every elongated note,until the wind floats you away.Hard hitting at times with incredible licks of guitar stokes of fuzz-buzz notes,your ears will want more decibels than they can handle. But most of this CD your gonna want to pack in the volume! They don't make music like this anymore Yo!
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Fun and additive!  Easy to learn, however it would have been nice if the instructions would have been less sparse.  This game is more fun with the timer mode on.  My only complaint would be lack of adequate instructions, which is why I only gave it 4 stars.  I haven't figured out the scoring system yet.  But, I find it fun to just simply try to beat my fastest time.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have not completed the book as of yet, but I always look forward to my time to read this book.  It is a great read so far.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Absolutely loved this game.  It was the first game I downloaded onto my Kindle Fire HD that I received for Christmas.  Couldn't put it down and kept playing until it was solved!  I do wish there were more games like this one!
B005LAII80|5.0|Absolutely stellar take on JD.  Perfectly captures the Judge's character and, more importantly, the character of Mega City One.  The Blu-ray looked incredible, and this is reference quality sound.  I will be watching it in 3d this weekend, and expect to be floored yet again.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|One reviewer pointed out that this does not work like the normal google search, and they are correct.  Knowing that it has limitations (like slowness) I think that it is OK and works well enough.  If I need faster and easier access, I just go use my computer (when at home).  Maybe it's because I have a HD Kindle, and perhaps this app isn't configured for HD, but I find the words on the menu screen to be blurry.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|The scenery in this movie is absolutely breathtaking. Along with that, a captivating storyline makes this movie a must have for any personal library.
B004EFYZ1C|4.0|This app is fun and cool!  My husband thought it was cool too.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys following the phases of the moon. This app was configured well.
B007M45PMU|5.0|I am so amazed by this album. Every song is even better than the radio hit &#34;hey ho&#34;. What's up with the word limit on these reviews? Lame.
0316010669|5.0|this is just what i needed good honest information to be utilized in the field of police work. sent quickly
B0052RDHTM|5.0|His books are great, and this one is one of the best. Just love it, really well written and the story is amazing, the way he combines history with a novel.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|A hilarious series! I love owning the DVDs for convenience and no commercials. And it's a show you can watch over and over without losing it's quality. Love it!

0767803434|5.0|Fun, thrilling, patriotic action movie.  Very Harrison Ford driven as I've come to expect in his movie. My friends and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|A must have! The collection looks great and the movie itself is amazing. Easily in the top 10 movie favorites for me and I'd recommend to any real Japanese movie fans.
B00068S41I|5.0|One of the best movies my husband and I have ever seen.  Very well written.  Recommend it highly.<br />Arrived in excellent condition.
B00005LOUP|5.0|I bought this movie for the holiday season and I love it. We'll definitely watch it every December now and I would recommend it to others if they want a cute holiday movie to watch
0765325950|1.0|Waiting to release the kindle (or any e-book)version is a poor decision. I will not buy the hardcover. I am sorry that the author (not his fault) will suffer in a very small way from my refusal to purchase in hardcover. He deserves more.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Can't live without a wireless controller. I have multiple controllers and a charging station which any avid gamer should have since it's amazing. XD
B008F5YDRI|5.0|absolutely delightful and unique story line<br />well acted<br />liked the message it sent about humanity, persistence, and understanding each other

B0031RS2HC|4.0|After reading One Shot recently, I decided I had to read the whole series. Killing Floor was a great read and I can't wait to get into the next book.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is so easy to use!  Love my devotion time.  Also, I can look up scriptures no matter where I am!  It is perfect!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I absolutely love this book. All of the Diary of a Wimpy Kid books are good. I definitely Recommend this book to anyone that are\\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\\" fans.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|The movie was so good.  We all enjoyed it!!! We watched it several times!  We liked it so much we may just have to purchase it!!!
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Like the Kite Runner, this book is a beautiful elegy of a beloved homeland lost to war and brutality. But it goes farther tracking how, if it is possible, people could recover physically and psychologically from such loss. There is no trite ending, though the metaphor of the Titanic enters seamlessly and artistically into the hope of rescue and sense I've overwhelming loss experienced by the characters. Realistic detail makes the story personal to the readers. Anyone who has suffered would connect to this book. Someone who has not might grow a little more in soul for the experience.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I've only watched five episodes , but I'm hooked . In fact it's hard not to just sit and watch one right after another .<br />Like I tend to do with a great book . I love that Watson is a female .  I f you are a fan of all things Sherlock, you'll love it I think even if your not, you'll love it too .
B007PT1PEY|5.0|I bought the Kindle version, and am looking forward to reading. This should keep me out of trouble for a while.
0439023521|5.0|The content is violent, but not graphic. I wouldn't let small children read it, but after much nagging, I let my 11 year old. It is a great book and, even though I'm a slow reader, I finished it in two sittings. As always, the book is way better than the movie.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Got it right before we went on a road trip over Christmas. Packed one video camcorder, a point-n-shoot, one DSLR, two pairs of binoculars. When we hit the beach, with the compartments layout, it was easy to take any one of the equipment out, whether to shoot video, pictures or just watch seagulls.<br /><br />The pack was light, and easy to carry around when hiking. When done, tossed in the back of the car. When we stopped at a restaurant, it was easy to place next to our seat (stands nicely on its own).<br /><br />Bottom line - well designed and fit for robust use (e.g. by our 10-year old).
B005K0HDGE|5.0|One of my favorite Stephen King novels to date.  I loved all the characters, Jake and Sadie were immensely likable.  It was nice to get away from the monsters and horror that King usually writes.  I loved how he wove the history of JFK and the 50s and 60s and made it feel like present day.  King tends to get very descriptive and verbose in his novels and this one no exception, but what a story-teller he is!
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Missed this episode so it was great to be able to use instant video. Very easy to use and quality of the video on my iPad was impressive.
B000VXLHWG|1.0|January 22 update:<br />If the Blu-ray discs are formatted for Region B as a reviewer who gave the set 5 stars suggests, why are they being marketed in the USA where most players will require Region A ?? Amazon's \\"Product Details\\" state Region A/1. If that's not accurate, Amazon should update the product description to reflect this innate incompatibility.<br /><br />January 18 update:<br />Second set arrived, and does not play. Tried all \\"work around\\" solutions offered by respondents to my initial review. Inserted discs, waited 2 minutes, and finally an hour. The word \\"play\\" shows briefly on monitor, but remains blank after. Can hear disc spinning when player drawer closes, but then the disc stops with the counter showing 0:00.<br /><br />Had hoped the first set I received was singularly defective, but looks like there is a more pervasive problem. Every other Blu-ray in my collection, including similar recently purchased concert videos, plays perfectly on my Sony player which has the latest firmware installed.<br /><br />As much as I enjoy Mahler Symphonies, I'm not going to purchase a new Blu-ray player hoping that might allow me to view this cycle. I had looked forward to seeing/hearing the Concertgebouw Mahler anniversary performances, price is excellent, but the discs just don't play on my player. A disappointment.<br /><br />January 9: Much anticipated Blu-ray video set arrived today, USA address direct from Amazon. Inserted disc in player-would not play. Upgraded my Sony Blu-ray player firmware to latest version (download)......still won't play. Player recognizes discs (4 different discs/symphonies attempted), briefly flashes play mode on monitor screen, then \\"freezes\\" at 0:00:00. Have to turn player off and back on before discs will eject. Every attempt to access menu options using the player's remote control, results in an action prohibited type of message on monitor.<br /><br />Don't know if the discs are defective, not compatible with current firmware SonyBlu-ray player......or what? Every other Blu-ray disc in my collection played fine prior to, and now after the firmware upgrade.<br /><br />Will update this review upon satisfactory conclusion, but wanted to give potential buyers \\"heads up\\" that there may be a problem with this set. I notice the two other reviews to date both seem to refer to Blu-ray sets purchased from European, not US, sources since they appeared before the set was available in the US.
B004U52VPS|5.0|This is my son's favorite toy! I love it because my daughter and my son can play this for hours together. It's built well, it doesn't look cheap. I also like that it comes with three birds instead of just two. When my son saw it, he kept saying &#34;No way, no way!&#34;. Love amazon prices also!! Great purchase and fast delivery on time every time with Amazon Prime!
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Good movie, what I would call a great one timer. I wouldn't buy it, but I would recommend watching at least the once.
0765325950|5.0|Great ending to the series. It's strange no longer anticipating something I've been waiting 20 years for, there's this giant empty feeling inside right now.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|Saw the movie and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I wanted to make sure I got this soundtrack.  I have the original.
B003IEJZUG|3.0|Slow first chapters for my taste, but the rhythm raises beautifully after a while<br />The authors writing style is fresh and graceful<br /><br />It gets a little too obvious on the phrases placed to make it sound spiritual and inspirational
B0028RXXE8|5.0|I purchased as a gift for my husband.  He loved the series which he had previously seen on HBO or Showtime.  The price was very reasonable from Amazon.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|This was purchased as a gift for a fan of the show and the Oz things.  He seemed to like it.
B00A757EFW|2.0|Too small a screen for me as I am not used to playing things on small electronic devices which I am sure is not a problen for most people
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|Good Reading, was pretty predictable!  I do enjoy the Jack Reacher character. Hope Book # 3<br />  is better!<br /><br />  Thank you,<br /><br />  Norm
B007RTAR64|5.0|This Katniss doll is great.  My daughter loves playing with the bow and arrows that came with it.  The details on the clothing, as well as the hair are exceptional!  I bought two of them.  One for my daughter to play with, and one to keep put up.
B001NHNG64|3.0|This book was very predictable.  Storylines for Jack Reacher could be spiced up a little more.<br />  Pretty hard to believe he just happened to be at the cleaners.<br /><br />  Not sure about reading #3<br /><br />  Norm
B00181JGI2|2.0|Tried watching this after enjoying True Grit and O Brother Where Art Thou, which were great.  This movie was just much slower.  Not as stimulating on the brain and easy to lose interest.  There are great nuggets but you just have to wait so long for them while it is boring between the nuggets.  Compared to modern day action and modern day comedy this one is weak.  The cast does a great job.  Very good.  John Goodman is so good being an aggravating person that I don't even want to keep watching so I don't have to be around him!
B007KZY1YY|5.0|Had to read the 3 books be E L James, good reading book flowed well. Recommend to read the series
B001F12J0C|5.0|These movies are always on TV but it has been a while since I've watched them from the begining. Hard to watch any older Bond or Jack Ryan movies after the Bourne collection was made. These will be classics for years to come.
B0020M99LC|5.0|Used for an event at my school and had no issues whatsoever. It streamed really well and everyone enjoyed the movie.
0061438294|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book and I learned a lot! I thought it was well put together in the way that it was written, with interesting stories and examples, and very helpful pictures of the nonverbals he was describing. This is a good book to own, rather than just borrow and read once, because I plan on referring back to it many times when I can't remember exactly what different signs mean. I have already successfully applied what I learned in this book!
B003Z0BWRM|5.0|The Mortal Instruments series are just great books.  As long as you're prepared to believe in fantasy creatures it manages to remain realistic while exciting throughout the whole book.  You cannot help be drawn into the Shadow World and you find yourself holding your breath waiting for the next page.
B007RTAR64|5.0|10 yro daughter obsessed with hunger games and archery... this made a great birthday present.  she didn't even know they made these so being able to surprise her was even better.
B003Y5H5B0|4.0|This movie surprised me when I saw it in theaters. I wasn't expecting it to be nearly as funny and well-done! Definitely a must see for comedy and action lovers alike.
B006O6EOII|3.0|it seemed a little on the cheap side to me but the 6 yro girl i bought it for seemed to be happy with it.
B003Y5H574|5.0|I love this movie. It's funny, touching, sad, romantic, and honest. Fantastic cast and acting. I just had to add it to my home DVD collection!
B00AL3KEE8|5.0|A fantastic soundtrack with the always fantastic Ennio Morricone and other superb musical acts. This album was reminiscent of old westerns. I thoroughly enjoyed every track.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|I love this movie. I had to convince my husband to watch it at first, because he thought it was more of a chick flick, but now it's one of his favorite movies too! Definitely a must to have in every DVD home collection.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This whole book was super duper funny.  I read it on my Kindle.  I have already told all my friends to read it.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I have always loved this movie. It's so sweet, touching, and funny. The acting is great, and of course the cast is amazing. Jude Law is in my &#34;Freebie Five&#34; too, so that doesn't hurt. ;)
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Its a great book! Its funny... but it could be a little longer!! I read it in like 2 days
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|All I can say is, best book ever. It is exciting, sad, and wonderful all times up into one package.
0756665949|5.0|Okay...people who complain about this book seem pretty petty to me.  I read some of the reviews and thought this was a book full of mistakes  and therefore didn't buy it for a while.  I'm sorry I waited!  I've looked through it quite a bit and haven't found any mistakes yet.  I'm not saying there aren't any, but they sure aren't that obvious.<br /><br />This book is pretty incredible.  If you like Lost you will NOT be disappointed with this resource.  It's a great conversation piece and it's worth having.  The in depth information, pictures, and trivia are impressive.<br /><br />The forward by the writers of the show talk about how all the extra information surrounding the show provide the 90% of the 'iceberg' under the surface, and if you want to know way more than you ever thought about the Lost universe, this will give it to you.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This book is an incredible story of heroism, and dignity.  It will leave you thankful for having been able to meet these men in the pages.<br />John Sica.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have read all of Colleen Hoover's novels and so far have given her a five star review every time.  This book touches on a controversial subject that needs to be talked about more often.  Not only is the book extremely romantic, it also covers issue's of abuse and the consequences that come along with it.  Even though this novel is much darker than her previous work, I enjoyed it just as much.  I felt the emotions with the characters and I thought the love story was beautiful.  I will forever be stocking Mrs. Hoover awaiting each and every book she writes.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|No Matt Damon, no problem.  Don't get me wrong, I love Damon in the previous Bourne movies, but this one is at least as good as the previous movies.  I was mad at myself for not spending the extra $10 dollars to just buy it, because I'll be watching this one again.<br /><br />If this is your first Bourne movie, then let me be the first to welcome you to earth.  Thanks for coming, and I hope you enjoy your visit.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read this in two days and barely got the dishes done or dinner on the table.<br /><br />After watching the movie I decided I would start with book two of the series. Now I can't wait to read book three.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is the books are too short.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Canned humor at its best.  At times, the storyline is incredibly predictable, but it is nice to watch and relax and be transported to another dimension.
B0090YHSFC|5.0|It is really simple, but my kids love the game.  The play is easy to learn and on the Kindle the screen is big enough to see what you are doing.  Good buy for a kids game.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Like seriously, could the story line get better?  No one can resist Sam and Dean with their brooding faces on the cover.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My daughter and I love this app! The puzzles come in a wide variety of levels so there is something for everyone! Only word of warning the helps are limited and then cost money to replenish.
B007JOM0GC|5.0|Love the cd. Not every cd you can listen and enjoy every song. This one, you truley can. Love her!
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Great buy for my money! I like they way this is small and able to be put on a key chain but big enough for my son in law to put right to use cleaning up some drill holes for his hydraulics! I am deffinatly getting more!
B009CPEOC4|5.0|I rented this movie additionally and fell in love with and so I had to buy it. Great work for an entertaining movie.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|What a great ending to the Hunger Games. I loved the ending. Hope the next two movies live up to the books!
1439192812|1.0|I have read a lot of his books but like some of the above people said this was not one to remember,this book was written for kids and not for grown up people.<br />Andre
B0073PPNE8|4.0|I liked most of it.  The ending was just not great for me.  You have a soldier who was protecting his woman who then hesitated to shoot the bad guy and look what happened...
B0085A9J18|5.0|If you love some serious butt kicking then this movie is for you! Great fight sequences and a lot is pulled out despite the very simpl plot line. Highly recommended!
B002ZG975Q|5.0|It was a gift for Christmas for my step daughter and she said she enjoyed it very much. Thank you
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I would recommend this to any fan of science fiction.  Excellent book, i look forward to more from this author
B005XZR4NI|1.0|It would not play. Then noticed it was for the uk so I just wasted my money. I'm sure I had said I wanted it for USA
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|I had high hopes for this movie after reading so many favorable reviews and hearing how funny it was, and I was prepared for potty humor and lots of profanity, but Macfarlane went too far in a few scenes.  It could have been so much better without the over-the-top language and sophomoric humor.  (Seth, was your goal to use every nasty word known to humans?)  I was embarrassed by several lines and scenes - embarrassed for the actors and everyone else involved in making this movie.  Having said this; the premise, the life metaphor, the lessons learned - all very clever and even sweet at times And there were definitely some laugh-out-loud moments, but mostly, there were &#34;Oh no!  Did he/she really just say that?!&#34;  I just wish Macfarlane had taken a tip from Wahlberg's character and grown up a little more before making this film so it could have appealed to a wider audience.  Definitely NOT for anyone under 16, if at all.
B005LAIIQC|4.0|the movie was action packed and had very good special effects , but the plot was slightly hard to follow
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|I rented Looper and now kicking myself in the butt should of bought the movie!!! Recommend it to a friend or family member.
B005LAZKTK|4.0|The first volume was constrained to not have too many songs they had already released versions of in '70 or '71, plus it had so many studio overdubs that it kind of lost the liveness. Volume 2 does not have these problems, it is just nice clean recordings of some highlights from one of the Dead's best tours ever.
B003FXCSU4|5.0|Didn't finish this book, yet, but it's amazing so far. Great writing style, evoking images and thoughts. I will update the review after completing the reading.
147015658X|2.0|Dont really like the print...the font is kinda weird and the print is<br />super small...very hard to read...dont like it at all.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Since I am a big fan of Michael Buble, I knew I would thoroughly enjoy the album; in fact, it's three weeks after Christmas and it is still in its slot in my car and I listen to it every day!
1449410243|5.0|I love this book ~ the drawings are wonderful and the author is way too funny!<br />I'd recommend it to anyone with kitties!
B0090EHVMC|5.0|Very ingenious way of making a point come across.<br />Lots of action enjoiyed by all the family. A must to your collection.
B009HELT3C|4.0|Funny and innovative! Carries the theme forward and puts a different twist on the series. Will and Tommy are great as usual and Josh B nails it. Don't miss this one.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|From what I understand, the first &#34;chapter&#34; of this book is actually the short story that inspired the writer to expand out into a full novel.  Well, it starts off great, and stays great through the whole edition. Highly recommended.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I Like his characters as they seem so real, like they could be people in your life. His love for hiss daughter is a nice humane touch
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I couldn't put it down. Stieg Larsson captivated my attention from page one.  I am so upset that this was the last book of an awesome trilogy.
B004GJYR7I|5.0|Probably my favorite black & white movie of all time!!!!  SOOOOOO funny!!!!<br /><br />If you like this, you'd also like 'The Philadelphia Story' with Katharine Hepburn!!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|My wife and I both love Supernatural. It a great show to watch. Can't. Wait for the rest of Season 8.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was hoping this book was not going to end.I really enjoyed all three books. E l James done a great job writing these books.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Just the name speaks for herself these days!  This CD has garnered top awards for two years in a row.  You'll love it like millions of others do... it's one of my favorites.  Doesn't get any better
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I now know how Much battery I have left and if I should stop doing something or if I have enough power left
B002UD56I6|5.0|Filled with great music, choreography and oozing with talent, this video highlights the gifts that Michael Jackson shared with us in his lifetime.  Whether or not your a Michael fan, you'll enjoy &#34;This is It&#34; for what it is, terrific and moving entertainment.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love playing solitaire on any level.  This is great in that it keeps track of the game for you.
B0052GACNM|5.0|I can listen to this back to back, over and over.  It's a great travel CD.  It's one of those where each song feels like a different CD... it's not all the same.  I really enjoy it.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This third book of the Hunger Games, Mockingjay, was pretty dark, but after reading the first two I couldn't put it down.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Michael Buble is just a great artist all the way around.  This Christmas CD is a &#34;can't miss&#34;.  It's fun and a bit retro with new songs to enjoy and old standards to join in.  Add it to your holiday selection and you'll be glad you did!
B0045XGRQE|5.0|Almost as good as the first but definitely a fan of the Iron Man. Definitely recommend this movie but watch the first one first of course
B0032Y8XH8|3.0|Mumford & Sons music is great and a little quirky.  I find though, that I skip through half the songs on this CD.  I realize it's personal preference, though, you may enjoy all of them.
B001M0HGR2|5.0|Never thought I was a fan of Robert Downey Jr., now I am!  Great movie and I didn't think I would be a fan of the Iron Man at all.  Great Movie
B000FC12ZA|5.0|This book reminds me of why we are here on Earth. To experience, to love, to live in oneness with one another and nature! Marlo does an excellent job of taking the reader into the oneness of all of life!
B003KJF2WE|3.0|Okay movie.  One of the weaker super hero movies if that is possible for the hulk but tried to watch it three times before I actually stayed awake to watch it all the way through
B003TSEEDY|2.0|I've heard people rave about this novel and it was simply not interesting. Perhaps it was that I found it hard to relate to the main character or that I'm used to reading SciFi and Historical Fiction. This book was definitely not something I recommend. I can't imagine the movie being any better.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|Love the sound track, i just wish it was longer and maybe included some of the background sounds played in the movie
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. Very well written and such a great love story. I laughed, cried, and gasped at all the great things that happened. There were so many things that were unexpected but also made so much sense after. I recommended this book to anyone who is a hopeless romantic....
B00AB0AXU6|5.0|This was the best but wasnt the worst I enjoyed it because its the kind of movie that grows on yeah the moe u watch it
0307887898|5.0|Challenges the common belief of how to start and build a new product / company.  While I am not certain of all the considerations, it is a good read to consider current practices and how to drive a more effective process
B004YM6JLO|3.0|If this is something you're interested in, than it's probably a good buy. I thought the show was just okay, but I bought the other seasons, therefore, I needed to get this one.
B008F5YDRI|5.0|great dialog. great vistas. it's my current number one film choice.  Lasse Halstrom also directed An Unfinished Life, which was also excellent.
B00742GBDM|5.0|I purchased it for 24 hours because I've already seen it, and although it isn't the exact story of Mansfield Park, it is done exceptionally well and I enjoy it tremendously.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I enjoy playing the game and others and will buy more games as I find ones that I like.  Great game
B009CPJHY4|3.0|Movie was ok but moved a little slow.  Enjoyed it, parts of the movie made you laugh, but would not watch it again.
B0063IH60K|5.0|On a rainy day, pull out ur kindle. And while away the time playing solitaire. With kids it's a great learning game, counting up and down and sorting.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I read this every Christmas.<br /><br />Great classic novel. Was the first completed book on my new kindle fire. Love it.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|Wall-e is sure to please anyone with a heart and a desire for good things. Cute and thought provoking. I loved it
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Nelson DeMille is one of my favorite writers, and his hero, John Corey, is one of my favorite characters in detective/adventure fiction.  DeMille delivers on all counts in THE PANTHER.  The research that must have gone into writing this book must have been staggering.  His description of Yemen rings true as do the activities in which his colorful characters engage there.  Corey's continuous stream of wise-cracks is extremely entertaining and make one laugh out loud.  The plot, Corey's pursuit of an American born terrorist known as &#34;The Panther&#34; is straightforward and believable.  In short, a read that is most entertaining.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|My wife and I went down memory lane, we were teens when the movie was released<br />The quality of this product and the packaging was truly amazing<br />Thank you Amazon for making it affordable
B002HUJBRO|4.0|The classic Little Women is a phenomenal book that anyone who is coming-of-age should read. It is definitely worth it reading all 444 pages. Little Women leaches lessons, and tells a thoughtful story of a family who comes close to losing everything but manages to live happily and love each other no matter what. Some tragic things happen, but the March family definitely cares about everyone that comes into their lives and stays strong even while the man of the house is fighting in the Civil War. I highly recommend this book to anyone who would love to read a story about this strong family. The author, Louisa May Alcott, is very talented.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|its good so get it. add me my profile is Connor's place.  if you add me ille send you a heart
B005S9EK5Y|3.0|I have to give this a decidedly mixed review.<br /><br />My first impression before the film's first hour was over was a silent reminder \\"don't buy the soundtrack.\\" The singing, even from Hugh Jackman who acquitted himself so well as \\"Curly\\" in the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical \\"Oklahoma!\\" is, to put it charitably, just passable. Russell Crowe does as well as can be expected since he is a non-singer to begin with, but the others do not have the kind of voices that are needed to put over this kind of material.<br /><br />Cinematically, it's a bit over-the-top with its wondrous camera views from high places. Nothing is done to suggest that the squalor isn't real. The mud is as muddy as possible and the make-up (in extreme close-ups of Anne Hathaway for example), is enough to convince us that these wretched people had nothing to sing about.<br /><br />Not being a fan of the show and familiar with only a couple of the songs, I was not expecting to be thrilled by the score alone--and I wasn't. Whether you have an appetite for these kind of musical numbers is clearly a matter of taste. Most of the lyrics are as downbeat and desperate as the story itself suggests.<br /><br />A much needed touch of humor is furnished by Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen, although some of the humor is a bit gross and overdone.<br /><br />The almost unrecognizable first appearance of Hugh Jackman as a slave hauling a ship with his comrades as Javert (Russell Crowe) looks on, is an astonishing moment. Jackman looks nothing like his real self, so part of his performance can be attributed to a marvelous make-up job. But he does well with the anguish and pain of seeing so much suffering around him. Anne Hathaway is obviously a singer/actress who does all she can with the powerful emotions she displays in her big scene, but her role, although noteworthy, is a small one in the scheme of things.<br /><br />Despite the power of some of the performances, the overall effect for me was a story that was not well told because of script problems, making it a confusing mess for anyone not familiar with the basic outline of the tale since it leaves out important plot details.<br /><br />Your musical taste will decide whether or not you love or hate this film, but it's fair to say that the songs are not rendered in the best possible way by having them performed live. The pre-recording of all the lyrics would have enhanced the big numbers which required more vocal ability and professional technique than is offered here.<br /><br />Summing up: Definitely not for everyone, but the squalor of the French Revolution period is magnificently realistic with lavish, detailed sets and costumes that convey the right atmosphere. Stunning photography is evident in the final scene where Crowe's conscience forces him to take drastic action.<br /><br />Biggest flaw: The lack of tension and connection in the cat-and-mouse game between Crowe and Jackman that was so powerfully portrayed in straight dramatic versions of the story filmed previously which sharpened the suspense. Both the '35 and '52 versions had this added strength of characterization. Instead, Crowe's realizaton that he has found and recognizes Valjean is done much too casually to have any real effect in building suspense.y that was not well told because of script problems, making it a confusing mess for anyone not familiar with the basic outline of the tale since it leaves out important plot details.<br /><br />Your musical taste will decide whether or not you love or hate this film, but it's fair to say that the songs are not rendered in the best possible way by having them performed live.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl was absolutely captivating and an definitely a great read.  Gillian Flynn did a very good job of keeping you on edge while never letting you know what was to come next.
B0015DROBO|4.0|It was complex but after a slow start moved very well. It was exciting and startling at times as well as repulsive.
0765325950|5.0|Great ending to the series that got me back into reading.<br /><br />Obviously we will all have questions that go unanswered, however, I feel like this book did its best to bring closure to the series and most of the major plot lines.<br /><br />Now I need to figure out if I have the ambition to re-read this entire series again.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|Difficult to read, too wordy goes into characters lives too extensively. The translation from French to English,makes reading too difficult to follow.
030759565X|5.0|I have been a follower on her blog for YEARS.... and don't intend to stop. Love this book! Creative, approachable, with lots of gorgeous photography. One thing I know about her style is that she doesn't post it or share it unless she's sure it WORKS... and  I've tried her stuff for years and have gotten things perfect &#34;on the first try&#34; with her recipes!
B00APUYN0I|5.0|This movie is so hilarious, I was laughing the whole time and i highly recommend it for a great date movie :)
B0011UBDTK|2.0|Ordered this as a gift for a friend that had never seen the series, but there are serious issues with several of the episodes not working.  Attempted to view on Blu-Ray/DVD player and also several laptops and the issue remains.
B00AE2I4WK|4.0|The music and dancing keep you moving in your seats and it is a great<br />Story about love and personal battles we all face within ourselves.
B00ABXA1HI|4.0|This is a must have APP if you leave your PC on at home. This allows you to remotely login just like your sitting at the keyboard.<br />I like the feature of having PC sounds redirected to your Android.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Finally some REAL music that I can listen to and appreciate.  It is great to hear people that can play instruments and truly sing.
6302227127|5.0|The Bishop's Wife is a beautiful Holiday film ! Loretta Young shines in this classic,along with Cary Grant.  If you wonder where an inspiration for Touched By An Angel came from, well this is it.
B005LAII8K|4.0|Movie is a little complicated to understand at first, but it keeps you entertain for the most part. Good movie to add to your collection.
B0045XICB2|5.0|I love this series! The DVD was wonderful! It is a must see for anyone who likes a good love story.
B004GJYROG|5.0|Bought this movie for my boyfriend as a xmas gift and he loved it we watched it first thing xmas morning! It got here in less then three days and it wasnt damaged...and brand new.
B004OZZ624|5.0|Worth watching, on the edge of your seat movie. Love is what love does. Its a 5 star movie yes! yes! it is!
B003UBTX6S|4.0|I think this book is a great book!!!!! It is decently a great book but the first book would be hard to top ;)
0345803485|5.0|Great deal. Book was said to be used, buut it is brand new. Appreciate the punctuality of recieving it too.
B0015DROBO|2.0|I gave this book a 2 stars because I thought it was just about the girl with the tattoo not other people's lives,but other than that it's okay.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I don't know why I waited so long to read The Hunger Games, but I am glad I did. While the subject matter is kind of dark, I think the heroine's<br />perseverance through it wholly makes up for that. Definitely worth the read.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Great read!  Got this as a daily deal when I got my new paperwhite kindle for Christmas.  Hard to put down!  I'm almost done with book 2 of the series, can't wait for book 3!
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Good easy listening music. I love every song on the album which never happens! I would recommend this album to anyone.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|It was very easy to put on! Also I like that  there's lots of colors & options to choose from. It makes it easier to hold & it protects the Kindle Fire very well! I would highly recommend this product to all young & old!
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This movie is very popular in my family, but we only had it in VHS until now! Im so glad that I was able to get this movie on DVD, so the family can start watching it again!
B008ALAHA4|5.0|What more can be said -- it snaps on the end of the older MagSafe charger and the fits fine on my MacBook Pro Retina.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I can spend hours on this app! I love that you can find an infinite number of ideas from this website that covers anything from DIY projects, pictures of animals, tattoos, to fitness programs.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|&#34;Ted&#34; is definitely an adult comedy that's able to take the topic of childhood friendship to the logical conclusion (i.e., adult life) in a hilarious way. We loved it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son loves it too much :) I have to ration his time spent on it.  I've even enjoyed it.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|A great film and I believe that it is the best of the Star Trek series with agreat new<br />Spock and fine supporting cast of young actors for the next Star Trek Movie. I look forward to<br />the next one with great anticipation.
034580404X|5.0|Purchased this for my wife for Christmas. She has not put them down.<br />And they are a positive for me!!
B005J2UM9S|3.0|About the same as a lot of the movies made in this style of &#34;real&#34; but not really real.  Acting is okay, plot is fairly typical.  I did enjoy it but..  Good for a night when nothing else is on.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|lots of fun and my kids and grandkids love playing it also. I think everyone should give it a try
0765325950|5.0|O.K.  We ALLLLL get that you are all annoyed about the lack of an ebook, and I understand that some people cant read the regular font in the book and need the ebook.  BUT seriously?!  The review section is meant for BOOK reviews not delivery reviews, you have tarnished what should be a very good book without even knowing if the book is good or not!  You have not written a review, you have written a rant; just like me.  but hey, if your rants are all allowed so should mine, now hows about we get some REAL reviews on here so it gets acknowledged properly.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|OK.  Need to finish series.  Sometimes hard to keep all of the characters straight.  Can be quite confusing T times.
B00333NCTM|5.0|Just on a lark, I bought this on kindle w/out reading the reviews or putting any thought into cost. I was not disappointed. Ozzy is thankfully a brutally, hilariously honest guy... not sparing the gory details even when it makes him look horrible. I did laugh a lot early on in the book, but as Ozzy's addictions got more and more out of control, I thought back on friends and relatives long gone from trying to live like rockstars on blue collar wages. I see LUCK being on Ozzy's side: meeting and marrying Sharon, and all the help she has given him as a wife and manager. This is a great book for old fans and new; maybe a good cautionary tale for some who recognize some habits that should be changed... because unless you have the Luck of the Ozzy, don't think you can get away with living on four bottles of booze a day on top of coke and pills. Only Keith Richards could keep up and live. So thanks for a great book and thanks for decades of great music. Big thumbs up...
B0063IH60K|1.0|the games is set up for you to loose almost every time. I love to play solitaire and the turn over to play the same game is to fast
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars is a very relate-able book, to which, many, many teens could find a piece of themselves in.
0385535147|3.0|It's a good, if improbable, plot with some unexpected twists making it fun, but don't expect anything in the way of character development or real drama.  Grisham is clearly in love with the main character (sooo smart and clever, sooo cool, can do no wrong and makes no mistakes ever) which makes him not particularly interesting.  All the characters are just vehicles to carry the plot along, with the simplest and most obvious motivations.  I'm generally a Grisham fan so it's not that I have unrealistic expectations of the genre.  I think he just got lazy on this one.
B009TZ7WDK|5.0|This is a wonderful album. Their complementary vocal styles are so pleasing to listen to. This is the first time I have listened to an album this many times in many, many years. Powerful, Uplifting, Moving, Sweet, Touching.  Being so young, I truly hope they have good advisers who look out for their welfare. I pray for their continued success and musical growth. I look forward to their next album.
B002SRQ214|4.0|Have had little or no problems with this device.  Did speed up the Gigabyte mother board as well.  This was a replacement for a dual core  that was running rather slowly.
B0034G4P80|4.0|It was a gift and was asked for, so I am assuming they liked it. I have heard nothing but good things about it.
B0089EHWQE|3.0|Liesl Schillinger in the New York Times called this books \\"a real weepy.\\" I thought that might be because its prose was just beautiful, so much so that one might weep for joy. But the story turned out to be not at all weepy (for me), but not much more than a tale of a tragic (albeit rich) young man and his lower-class (and poor) caretaker. Gah! I'm well within the return-this-book-for-credit timeline, but that wouldn't be honest; I'm not going to defraud the author because a reviewer in the NYT seduced me.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book and was not disappointed after reading the first book. The Hunger Games was such an intense and fast paced book which left my hungering for more while simultaneously sure any sequels thereafter could not live up to the first one. I was wrong. I truly enjoyed this book too. I recommend this book to those who have read the first book.
1401324649|5.0|&#34;Fey&#34;! the one word to describe it.  Never a story like it nor can one do more than hope for another!  We should all live to live such a life at the century mark!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Another hit and a gotta have book for you library. I purchased it for my Kindle and immediately began reading it  and did't put it down until I finished! It's a good thing it was on the weekend and I don' t require a lot of sleep :) I most definitely recommend this book- it's a keeper.  Stephen King's 11/22/63 storyline takes you down a path which eventually leads you to think, &#34;could happen, couldn't it?&#34;
0765325950|1.0|I broke down and bought the hardcover but was pissed that no Kindle edition.  Love the book, but come on, it is 2013. Get it right people!
1567184855|1.0|I started the book but can't finish it, he's way too intense explaining his theories of how everything in the afterlife works, but apparently as fact in his mind as he even draws charts and diagrams. Give me a break - too far out!  None of his dialogue has the ring of truth like some authors. I don't see how anybody can read this and agree that it's gonna be like he says. Points of light spinning around in infinity?? what would be the purpose? If you want to be inspired by a happy existence you can look forward to, read The Afterlife of Leslie Stringfellow and anything by Brian Weiss, George Anderson, John Edward. Or the Bible for that matter, mansions and streets of gold. That's what I look forward to :o)
B004LROUNG|5.0|This is a very good novel like all his books. This is an exciting novel. I would go and get it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|great game to pass the time. I always liked the dozer games at the carnivals and this reminds me of my younger days playing dozer at the local fair!!!!  slot of fuuunn&ntilde;nn!
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|This is a very good novel about the Kennedy assassination. He is a good novelist. go and get it now.
B003UNK27U|5.0|i have been looking for a way to start a home practice and this is it - it's the logic i needed about which poses to be doing with nice illustrations of the poses for each part of the month.  great book.
B005LAII80|5.0|this is the best superhero movie of 2012 and one of the best of all time but calling dredd a superhero is more becouse of its from a comic book but hes humon like batman or punisher it is violent and grity the action is great the acting is great its a shame that this movie did not do better at the box office i hope for a sequel this is a must buy it has so many of those Omg moments its well worth the ride
B005VTS4EY|5.0|very addictive game, I downloaded the free app yesterday and I cannot stop playing it. It certainly gets the grey matter working and is fun for such a simple concept.
B00004YZFR|4.0|I am the Stones Authority. This is an interesting film. Well shot and produced from a production values point of view. The documentary \\"story\\" itself is a little disjointed, but holds together well enough, but ends rather abruptly with not much explanation. Just Mick muttering something to the effect of \\"bummer\\" while in the edit suite watching Meredith Hunter getting beaten and stabbed and then a montage lead out showing the sorriest bunch of hippies you've ever seen from the Bay Area marching out to the concert site to a soundtrack of the song \\"Gimme Shelter\\". It is an odd way to end the film. It didn't occur to the Maysles to maybe capture some additional commentary from the band or the entourage regarding this mess out at Altamont?  I would have liked to have heard a fresh recap of their impressions. I have my own impression based on watching the film though, and that is this: What a mess the Sixties were. What started out wonderfully enough degenerated into what you see at Altamont by the decade's end. Proof positive that children do a lousy job of raising themselves. God help us all that these knuckleheads are now running the country for the most part. Jeez. The other impression that is reinforced for me by this movie - and I had to learn it the hard way still - is that large outdoor concerts suck. I watched Woodstock. I wouldn't have wanted to be there. I don't need dirt, rain, mud, bugs up my butt, losers puking on or near me, my girlfriend p**ing in the grass, heat, cold, Hells Angels, Guardian Angels, angels from heaven or sympathetic devils dancing on my feet. And the fact that many outdoor concerts are free doesn't help. As a friend of mine from the former Soviet Union points out, \\"Everything we had was free. We didn't have to pay for anything. And it all sucked.\\"  But you can watch this movie from the comfort of your own home. And it is a pretty good movie. The Stones concert footage from Madison Square Garden is good stuff. Seeing that mess at Altamontis interesting. Having it all preserved on film all these years later is historically wonderful and should answer a lot of questions people have about the Sixties in general. Get the movie.
B0000C9JFO|5.0|La película fue muy entrañable para mi porque me recordaba cuando me fui de intercambio en los 90`s. Entretenida, con momentos muy divertidos. Visualmente la película es muy colorida. Interesante ver la concepcion de Europa antes y ahora. Recomendable.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|this is nice. i like how it works. it really shows my battery life. it was free and that was great
B002NQ3AAQ|5.0|I think this is the best dance related films ever made and should inspire all young people regardless what their dreams might be.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|Same old same old but does have funny moments. If you liked the others you'll probably like this fine but it was nothing special.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was a good book I think better than the rest but that's what think and I think it's good
B009VB998I|5.0|This was overall great movie for the entire family!!!!  The kids loved it and it made for a wonderful movie & pizza night!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a good book that I think everyone should read including kids and adults. This is the best book I have ever read.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game. Very addictive and fun to play . Wish there was an easier way to attain coins though .
B005544V6A|5.0|LOVE this show! The chemistry between the characters is amazing! What I like best about it though is that the wit and humor in it is intelligent. From the very beginning, this show grabs your attention and holds it. Best legal show on TV.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use this alarm clock every morning. I love how it eases into the alarm which wakes you up gently! love it!
B001706I5I|5.0|This is one of those movies that we watch year after year. Jim Carey is hilarious, whoever plays Cindy Lou is adorable, and the whole cast is really top notch. Even the dog is great!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Excellent book, but difficult to read.  Actually several books in one.  The philosophy parts were the most difficult to read..
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Just love the convenience and  it is so easy to order all the current best sellers and<br />anything I need.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|** May contain spoiler **<br /><br />I usually love Nicholas Sparks' books (with the exception of a couple). I was disappointed with this one. I see no need for the violence written in this book, especially with children involved. I wish he would get back to writing in his earlier style.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|it's a wonderful game fast paced keeps you on your toes lots of different goals to get takes a lot of patients
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Before getting this game I read some reviews that disliked the fact that you had to spend money to advance. If you have the patience to wait things out and play 2 to 4 times during the day you will appreciate the game much more. I think it is a great game!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Lots of twists and turns that keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Also, an insight to marriage. Read it.  You won't be disappointed.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|Non si prende questo cofanetto per vedersi solo il film (tra l'altro manca la lingua italiana), ma per collezionare uno dei più bei film di tutti i tempi...<br />Ottimo cofanetto, non manca niente, bluray, dvd, cd colonna sonora, card, certificato, carillon...<br />Ottimo acquisto, soprattotto se lo trovate in offerta... ;) ;) ;)
B005D63ICI|5.0|I love Dexter and enjoy watching the entire season all at one time.  I will miss it when the series is over.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless is the best book I've read in quite a long time.  From the very first page, you're drawn in and unable to put it down.  You immediately fall in \\"Live\\" with Holder and Sky and each turn of the page uncovers some new element that you NEVER anticipate coming.  These \\"Hopeless\\" characters have many layers to uncover and each one is more compelling than the last.  So many twists and turns in this book, your emotions will be all over the place.  Absolutely the best book out there right now.  Colleen Hoover nailed it with this one.
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|A notification on my kindle fire pops up...only to lead me to the app in the Play Store.  There is no update button.  Nothing updates....so I close the window....only to get a notification again.  Frustrating.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I absolutely love  this series, Rick riordan has to be on  of my favorite authors. so when he brought two of my favorite things together- magic and Egypt- I couldn't help but fall in love with the stories. worth reading, every single time.
B00469J08Y|5.0|Seller<br />This was going to be a present for my wife for Christmas. However when ordered the shipping to get before that was not available. i contacted the seller and they said they would expedite the shipping. Got there way before the estimated time. Defiantly would use them again.<br /><br />Product<br />My wife love this movie and finding this was an amazing deal. When the my wife opened it up she thought it was the best thing. The book was full of details that you would never of though about. Very good and insightful product for people who love the movie.
B000P0J0A6|5.0|Gremlins (Special Edition) worked just fine nothing wrong,,,played fine in my player, not a problem. my grandson loves it. thanks
B008MEM24S|5.0|I like it, but when there is blazers etc. It gets very hard. I'm 7, so it's probably easier for older kids. I like all the different levels in the app. Doofenschmurtz is trying to make his own agency.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|Love Rod Stewart.  Wondered why it took so look for him to produce a Christmas Album.  Great songs and duet selections.  Would recommend purchasing this album, if you love Christmas music and Rod Stewart.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This well written book from the view point of a teenager with cancer feels both honest and real without<br />the over-played self-pity or heroism in other works.  I would recommend it to anyone.  My 12 year old son<br />lovedit, my 70 year old mother loved it, my 15 year old daughter loved it and so did I!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|pretty good game.  some hidden objects too dark to see.  stuck right now at the safe.  Is there a website to join for G5 games to get them cheaper?
B00009TB5G|5.0|So this was a great purchase for me, as DVDs are less expensive. The dics were in great condition, and I know we'll watch this again and again.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Even with the differences between the movies and the books, this series is still wonderful and very well done. One of the things I like best is that with the exception of Richard Harris (because of his death), the same actors were in all of the movies.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|Keep producing it and we'll keep watching. Endearing, interesting funny characters and good story. We love Becket and Castle too. Supporting characters are a treasure, especially Castle's mom.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Got really into this one. Could not put it down. Gideon and Ava had me on the edge of my seat! Looking forward to the next book!
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Very informative. Everyone should watch this documentary so we can all change the way we eat, therefore forcing the food industry to produce more healthy organic foods at lower, affordable prices.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|I used to have kindle for android on my phone and it worked great. However, now when I open the app and click on kindle store it leaves the app and opens the kindle store via web page.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I couldn't put down my Kindle once I started.  I'm looking forward to making a trip to the theater to see the movie now.
B001GXF2YY|5.0|Another great novel by Michael Connelly. Always keeps you guessing. Just when you think you have it solved, that is when it takes an unexpected turn. I recommend this book highly.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|I thought this movie was going to be original or have lots of twists. Well it wasn't and it didn't. It was OK. I liked the ending but the build up and development was just OK.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|It's a great game. It has good graphics. Half Brick did it again. And it's free! Normally all the good apps you have to pay a buck. But this game I've really become attached to. Get it now!
B006AX6ONI|3.0|I like Mark Cuban and enjoy watching him on Shark Tank. I was hoping this book would either tell the story of his success or provide guiding principles for someone starting their own company... it fell short of both.<br /><br />He added a bit of background to the book, but failed to tell the whole story of his success. The rest of the book was just a bunch of blog posts that you can get for free online.<br /><br />If you're just starting out running a business, take his own advice, save your money and just read his public blog.
0765325950|5.0|I havent finished this book yet but im going to post it as a 5 star review mainly to combat all the idiots that gave it 1 star because its not in ebook yet.  This childish behavior is very silly and amazon should delete them.  Anyway to the book itself.  It is amazing so far.  Well written the story is flowing well and is answering questions and tying things up well.  Its sad to see the deaths in the book but its not over yet who knows how it will end up.
B000FP2Z1C|5.0|This is definitely a well put together album. I would Highly recommend this on vinyl as the sound is better.
B009JBZH54|5.0|One of the best decisions I have made in life was purchasing this Blu-ray box set! I am a huge Batman fan and there is nothing better than watching this trilogy in Blu-ray! Buy this product and you will not be disappointed!
030758836X|4.0|I am about 3/4 of the way through this novel and it's been difficult to put down. I was up until after 1am, reading since 8pm last night. Had my husband not awoken from the couch and come to bed at that time, I probably would have spent the rest of the night reading. At first, the novel seemed predictable, but well written enough to keep you interested, engaged (particularly me who always has to know How? Why?) Ms. Flynn is certainly well articulated.<br /><br />Part II brings the \\"bombshell\\". And suddenly everything turns upside down. And suddenly you don't know where you are, what's happened, what to believe, who to blame. Can't wait to find out the end. And then to read her other two books.<br /><br />As others have mentioned, be forewarned that there is quite a deal of foul language, sexual, and graphic content. But then again, it's a mystery/thriller about spousal murder-- wouldn't it be a let down if there weren't?
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|I have a dog so when I saw that his dog got ran over that hit me in my heart I almost cried. It is the same storyline as the original movie with some twists to it that are great. It is a must see. If you are a dog lover or even have a pet you will defenitely love this movie no matter how old you are. I ♥ it.
B003V1WXKU|4.0|I heard about Richard Feynman from serval other books and a Ph.D. friend. It more thank lived up to my expectations.
B00785P2QC|3.0|the game is alright I play it when I'm bored. other then that I don't play the game an wish there was a way to restart ur city if u don't like the way it is looking or what ever.
B0062YADWI|4.0|Overall a very nice piece of kit. The bottle opener works great and is handy for saving the day at a barbecue when someone brings some nice craft beer and forgets a bottle opener.  I think if it were larger it would be easier to use all around.  The gate would be larger and therefore easier to clip and unclip from things and it would fit better in the hand when using the cap lifter.  But, that's just a minor flaw. Recommended for anyone looking for a keychain caribineer with a little extra added utility for a good price.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very interesting read, I love biographies, war and history, just love these books. It's very well written and I recommend it.
0142403873|5.0|I bought this book as a Christmas present for my Nephew in America and ordered it quite late so I was really pleased when it arrived in plenty of time!
B008JFUUIA|3.0|To start it of this movie was not awful-just wasn't good enough...I actually expected more than this in the movie. Only a couple of times did I laugh-no more than 5. I didn't like it only the beginning is worth it. The only thing that brought the movie with spirit was Fat Amy and the list ends there. It was fun while it lasted but not the whole time...
B005KELWJY|5.0|love the little magnetic closure, than keeps it open or closed. Wish it were lighter, though.... leather isn't light, sadly.
B0084AXZK0|4.0|While slow at times, it really is a wonderful thriller.  I read it a long time ago, and enjoyed it more this time.
B004SRPXWQ|2.0|Tom Cat is funny...for about the first 5 minutes you use it.  After that there isn't a whole lot to do with it, and it's pretty silly.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Must have! But I can't find the subtitles on it o.0 still working on that...aside from that awesome purchase !
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I bought this for my daughter-in-law for Christmas.  We both love this series. This boxed set was also a great price.
B004LWZWGA|4.0|Thank you! thank you! thank you! I still have to watch it(: my brother did...and loved it! so worth it!(:
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This app is super addictive and pleasant. It makes you think, has plenty of variety and yet is never so challenging as to completely frustrate.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I recently reread this book as an adult and it was better than what I remember from freshman English class.  Twain is a mastermind and the dialog between juveniles is just great and on point.  Very entertaining and an easy read
B004I744AS|5.0|Entertain yourself while learning - great resource too. This is one of the best apps I've used. The weather part isn't aware of the largest city in N. AZ though.
B005K15SPG|5.0|The live CD is incredible!  I travel a lot in my car for work and I listen to it constantly!
B0000C9JFO|5.0|The product shipped and arrived very quickly. I had to watch it for a class, so otherwise I probably wouldn't have purchased it. It is brand new and as described, but in my opinion the movie just sucks.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Movie great after it finally stop shutting down. Music fantasic. Amy was my favorite character. Loved story line. Would recommend.
B00122LXTM|5.0|It is the Doobie Brothers. Either you love them or you don't. This is their very best, all in one. If you need more info just take a listen.
B004PAHZMC|5.0|This Lego zipper bin is very cool looking. My son likes it a lot. I read other reviews prior to purchasing this item so I was aware that it did not close tightly. I received exactly what I expected. It is a medium sized Lego bag that unzips into a play mat.
B004MC0FO8|4.0|I like this app- I have it on my phone to. it's super handy to have around especially if you're exploring new music!
B0083GR6Y6|3.0|Hubby and I liked it except for the very end when Liam Neeson used God's name in vane!<br />That was a BIG  mistake and a BIG disappointment....the movie would've been great without that!
B0044RFT8S|3.0|This is great for young children and adults with over active imaginations.  I found myself enjoying this along with my son.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Loved this movie! It was great!<br />Another batman movie that's full of suspense....don't miss this one!<br />What more can I say?!!
B005COO1X6|1.0|I am a huge fan of King.  With that said; I felt right from the beginning that I was in a kids story.  I was bored and very disappointed in it; the only good thing was the length.  Would love more short stories or serials.  Would love to see a return to writing like Christine or The Green Mile.  Don't waste your time or money on this unless you want to read it to your kids.
B009HELT3C|5.0|Love all the 'Men in Black' movies - Will Smith never disappoints us!<br />We would recommned to all. our older grandkids loved it too!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Definitely worth the price, I got it as faotd and was happy after the first 10 seconds of playing. Inventive and fun to play.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The first book was very high school for adults as far as the structure of the writing and story line, Ive started the second book and the writing seems to be getting better.  Lets see.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|This was a quick read that really had a lot of fun with the Star &#34;Stuff&#34; shows.  They weren't making fun as much as they were having fun with the story lines and characters.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Nelson gives us a look into Yemen weaving it into a novel. I found the history and novel to be eye opening.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|While looking for the dark knight rises was pleasently surprised to find the trilogy for less than the single, Thank you
B000FA5SMK|5.0|I really enjoy the John Corey series,I look for the series to purchase since I am always entertained. John Corey is a character I can relate to some one I know.
0446554995|5.0|I love these authors.  It ties the whole series together and explains all the twists and turns at the end.
B005LAII80|4.0|Though the original Judge Dredd with Sylvester Stallone was action packed and entertaining for what it was, I'd have to say that I enjoyed this new adaption from the comics much better.  Not only is it a bit more accurate in comparison to the comics, but I also felt that Karl Urban made a much better Dredd as well.<br /><br />As far as how well it follows the comics, I am not a hundred percent sure because I am honestly not incredible familiar with them...I have only ever read scattered issues before.  However, according to what I have read and heard, this movie follows a few of the comics much better than the original one did.  In fact, as I have read, about the only thing that resembled the comics much at all in the old movie was the view of Megacity One, which was probably about the only thing the new Dredd differed on, giving it more of a feel of District 9, and that's what I thought of 2 when I saw much of what it showed of Megacity One.<br /><br />Once the movie moves into the tower where much of the movie takes place, it has more of a feel of the original Die Hard and The Raid Redemption from there on out...a little bit Robocop.  The action is good and the movie is altogether engaging and enjoyable.<br /><br />One thing I've come to understand about Judge Dredd as far as the comics go, it's very very rare that he ever takes his helmet off, and in this movie he really doesn't.  You see him ever so briefly from behind in the beginning of the movie with his helmet off, but it's on the entire rest of the movie.  The original fell short in that sense too because Stallone is not wearing the helmet for at least half the movie.  Not only that but the movie, as far as I know and have read, did not follow the comics hardly at all.  I still gave the original a decent rating because I enjoyed it overall, but as far as I know it fails as far as it's ties to the comics.<br /><br />This is the best of the 2 though in my opinion, and I really hope that they make at least one or two more of them, so long as the same characters star in them.  The only words of warning I will give is to those of you who are squeemish or don't like heavy violence & gore...stay away from this one.  There is one or two pretty brutal parts and we aren't spared from gore with each person that dies.  However, for those of you sci-fi & action buffs like myself or fans of the comic that aren't phased by gore, I highly recommend giving this movie a watch, if not a buy!  Good stuff.or two more of them, so long as the same characters star in them.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's the only calculator I use. It's the best. I will be telling all friends and family members to download and install the latest version of it.
B004J4WLPU|5.0|Pulls you clear until the very end, which will have you sitting on the edge of your seat! Loved it!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I didn't want it to come to an end, but every great story has to end somewhere. Bravo Suzanne Collins I can't wait to read some of your other great works!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Great read.  Jack Reacher is the man most men wish to be.  Still, I can not wait to finish reading future books.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Was such a helpful tool to figure out how to format pre-typed text<br />This helped me publish the book faster. Spent a week prior to purchase & was not getting submission approved by online publishing!<br /><br />Great book!
B0000VCZKM|5.0|Movie on our daughters Christmas list.  Great movie I think this is the best remake of Anne and would recommend it for anyone who loves Anne.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|Amazon gave me this free with phone purchase, but still have commercials. Not impressed with quality or annoying ads. If you like game, buy ad free version.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Liam Neeson is great! Its a great cautionary tale for young folks traveling abroad but mostly its a butt-kicking fest at the hands of an irate father.  We'll watch it again!
0061537969|5.0|Amazing book! Best story I have ever read. Story is narrated by the dog and it really allows you to enter a dog's mind and show how human they are. Couldn't put it down. Book is funny, heart warming. A must read for any dog lover.
1449410243|5.0|I have enjoyed The Oatmeal for sometime now. We have a small cat that we are sure is always plotting our demise. This books is so hilariously accurate about what may be going through her mind. Love it!
B00APUQT7I|4.0|The cast of characters really clicked in this fourth movie.  The story line was better and overall they finally made a compelling sequel to the 1st movie.  I actually walked away liking it and so did my kids aged 3, 5, and 7.  It's the first Ice Age movie they played over and over.  We may be picking this one up on Blu Ray very soon.
B0061P2L5U|5.0|This is an informative, thoroughly-researched, and excellent book which should open all of our eyes about what may be wrong with our biological systems. It is one of the Best Science Books of the Year 2012.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This is one of my favorite games. I am glad I can now play it on my Kindle fire! and I get 4 cards not only 2!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Why is it so unbelievable to everyone that Ana had never masturbated? I am the same age and haven't either. It seems you all needed something to complain about.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I downloaded this game for my kindle. It's beautiful with vibrant colors and so clear with great movement. I just wish I had this one on all my other devices, they don't compare to the quality of this app.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is one of the saddest, most sobering yet hopeful books I have ever read. I could relate to the main character because I too have problems with my mental health. Not as much as him but I understand his confusion and trying to control his anxiety. I would recommend it to others like me.
B006R1T40I|5.0|I enjoy Bonnie's music and this album, though not exceptional, is a good listen and has entertained me.  She does fine work.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|The writing level is very low and hard to get used to, but the story is powerful and overwhelmingly beautiful. I really appreciated the rare humor found in these pages. You won't regret reading it even if you don't particularly like the story very much.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The epic conclusion to Collins' trilogy of a teenage heroine igniting the flame for political change in a dystopian future. Starts fast with few moments of dullness, encouraging the reader to finish. Epilogue is a little weak - short and hokey - but will show fantastic on film.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|It was nothing you need to put jokes in the book then I will read it this time from your mom
0765325950|5.0|Prepare yourself. After so long a wait, so many pages read, you'll want the journey to continue.<br /><br />For me, The Wheel of Time began in 1991. The first three volumes are crinkled and stained from much love. Now, with the last book, one emotion overwhelms me:<br /><br />Satisfaction.<br /><br />I haven't read a series-ending book that gave me such satisfaction as A Memory of Light. It tied the threads of stories together neatly, gave me the kind of drama and tension that moved me to tears. The battle between Darkness and Light was as epic as the parting of the Red Sea, climatic, thorough, and majestic.<br /><br />Yes, majestic.<br /><br />I walked beside Perrin, threw the dice with Mat, and gasped as Rand fought the Dark One. The images created by Brandon Sanderson using Robert Jordan's notes are branded in my consciousness. The battle scenes, balefire cast, Rand's choices, Egwene's decisions, the unsung heroes; all contributed to the `heart in my throat' feeling.<br /><br />There is life and death, winners and the injured the Aes Sedai cannot heal. I sorrowed and sometimes startled my hubby with shouts of `Good for you'.<br /><br />And then the last page and Mr. Jordon's endless wind dropped me.<br /><br />I wanted it to go on.<br /><br />To the critics of Mr. Jordan's widow who initially decided not to publish this book in Ereader form, IMO, to read this epic story in any other way than paper and glue is a travesty.
B004KA9VGA|5.0|Loved it Loved. Loved it. Just a fantastiv story. So my wife tells me. She has read it three times.  One of the best books she has ever read.

0765325950|3.0|Many SPOILERS in this long, diffuse piece, which is an informal series of impressions rather than a structured formal review.<br /><br />The final volume is not horrible. It is not even all that disappointing as far as plot alone goes, given the certainty that no ending could have lived up to the expectations set by Jordan over almost two decades. Jordan himself wasn't going to live up to his promises, so I can't blame Sanderson for not doing so either. In all that follows it is understood that Sanderson faced a very hard, thankless task. Anything he did right would be credited to Jordan, and any misstep would be his responsibility. Sanderson gave us three books, which despite their flaws, had many good moments, especially in [[ASIN:B0074CTYNQ Towers of Midnight]]. And Jordan himself faced the far harder task of accepting he wasn't going to be able to finish his series himself, and trying to guide his unpicked successor. So to say the fourteenth volume is unsatisfactory at times isn't to specifically blame either man. A result can be disappointing just because of, in this case, a human tragedy.<br /><br />This book is also not great, however. The lack of specificity about what actually happens at the end is annoying, especially given how much excruciating narrative detail over the years has been devoted to various weaves to flagellate women with, Andoran dynastic politics, tricks to ignore the heat, sword-fighting stances, grain shipments, figs and mice, Seanchan hairstyles, etc. Perhaps Jordan truly did write the ending in a series of shorthand notes to himself, which somehow made it into this volume in their original cryptic form as the triumphant conclusion:<br /><br />\\"So then Rand realized that Light DID need Dark after all, and he sealed up the Dark One, who was like a little mannequin, and then he pretended to die except really he switched bodies with Ishamael/Moridin who did die, so Rand got his (Moridin's) hand back, and everyone thinks he's dead except thewomen he's bonded to, and he'll just keep letting people like Tam, Nynaeve, Moiraine, Thom, Lan, Mat, and Perrin blame themselves for not being able to save him because it's just so much cooler if they think he's dead too. And then he rode off into the sunset because he's in love with three women and maybe some of them will follow him although Elayne has several countries to run and twins on the way and Aviendha's feet are all mangled so it'll have to be Min who's the best one anyway, and it's not like Rand owes Elayne or his children anything. Oh and when I said Alivia's importance was that she would help Rand die I meant she'd get him some money so he could fake his own death. That's exactly the same thing.\\" I quote from memory but that's how it went, as I recall it.<br /><br />But as I said, the plot is what it is, and since it was bound to disappoint somewhat, it can only further disappoint by a modest amount. What I found harder going was Sanderson's loss of the Jordan strong Point Of View and character individuality. Sanderson continues to slip in and out of point of view within scenes (scenes are brief, as with screenplays, where Jordan would often spend 50 or 100 consecutive pages on the same character), and individual character voice is muted. With all characters on a side so similar, it's easy to forget whether you're with Taim or Demandred, Elayne or Egwene.<br /><br />What Sanderson does do well here is meticulously describe the physical and channeling aspects of the Last Battle. He has a good head for detail and in all his works is good at making lists, drawing up rules of magic systems, etc. We are constantly kept apprised of who is dead and how they died, who is alive but in danger, where they all are, etc. That's harder than it sounds.<br /><br />And although Jordan warned us long ago that we wouldn't get answers to every niggling little detail, Sanderson's innate neatness compels him to be as helpful in providing answers as he can be. That some ofthe answers are now long past their expiration date, and they solve puzzles people stopped caring about in the 1990s, is not Sanderson's fault.<br /><br />This last, most cataclysmic volume seems a strange place to ramp up the slapstick, but Sanderson, who never quite got Mat right (though his Mat dialogue did improve greatly between [[ASIN:1841492329 The Gathering Storm]] and Towers of Midnight), apparently made the same decision regarding Mat's utility that Peter Jackson made about most of Tolkien's dwarves: that Mat is best used for undignified comic relief, by poking fun at his dress, speech, personal hygeine and intellect, and constantly pointing out English-language errors Mat makes when he writes. So naturally to emphasize this, Sanderson has Mat write a lot of letters, because it never gets old.<br /><br />Nor does the humorous incongruity of regal Elayne swearing like a particularly foul-mouthed stevedore in front of her easily shocked retainers ever pale, so Sanderson trots that same joke out before us repeatedly.<br /><br />I was somewhat puzzled by a trait I didn't notice Sanderson engage in in his first two WOT books (maybe he did and I just wasn't paying attention), and that is characters referring to everyone who is addressed as \\"Lord\\" or \\"Lady\\" (either by formal right to a title or just polite recognition of power) by such a title followed by their surname. Correct me if I'm wrong, and I know the manner of correct address varies by particular society and specific position, but typical under Jordan was for people to often say \\"Lord Dobriane,\\" \\"Lord Perrin,\\" or \\"Lady Faile;\\" not exclusively \\"Lord Aybara,\\" \\"Lord Mandragoran,\\" and the like. Related is way that for some reason in this book many non-Aiel characters go around addressing everyone by their full names, first and last, as Aiel do, and/or using formal names (Matrim) where always it had been Mat. For Cadsuane to be saying Matrim might make sense, but for Egwene to? Why? Why does everyone, even her friends, suddenly address Min as Min Farshaw in casual conversation? It's very strange once you notice it the first time, then you keep noticing it.<br /><br />A lot of battle scenes, not as much suspense / revelation as in some of the earlier books. But what really seems skimped on at times is the personal touch. The offscreen Lan-Moiraine reunion, and many other moments like that (Mat and his father). Under Sanderson, some characters, not just Androl and Pevara, assumed new importance, while others such as Min and Nynaeve saw their roles greatly shrink. And where Jordan saw the characters as still important to each other even when they weren't specifically fixed on an important task, the example of the way Thom was abruptly thrust to the back burner once his rescue of Moiarine was done exemplifies Sanderson's too-utilitarian view of characters.<br /><br />Given the nature of the Bond, it's understandable but still a little too convenient that everyone significant who dies seems to die in pairs: Egwene and Gawyn, Siuan and Gareth, Bashere and Deira (not Bonded). Galad and Lan don't die because Berleian and Nynaeve don't. Even Birgitte's violent death is a win as it puts her back in synch with Gaidal.<br /><br />The series was comparable to [[ASIN:B003U53I3I Lost]] (and even at the end we had Androl = Dogen). I'm not sorry I invested in either work, and the journey along each was a decent reward despite the meager payoff at their ends. But for both, you had to be there at the time to appreciate the phenomena. Most of the fun about WOT was theorizing endlessly as the series progressed in real time. I couldn't in good conscience recommend WOT to anyone from this moment forward, any more than I endorse Lost anymore, because their days are already done, even WOT's.<br /><br />It's like The Simpsons' episode where Homer discovers Lost in 2012 and wants to discuss theories - but only through the middle of season four. Unless a new WOT reader finds many new WOT readers with whom to experience the series for the first time at the same pace, and they try to recreate The Wheel theory universe as was done in the 1990s and 2000s, plowing through 14 books a good half of which are unproductive, they won't get out of it what those of us who read Book 13 when it first came out, or Book 11, or the excellent [[ASIN:187937174X Book 6]], etc. did.<br /><br />The long-awaited, underwhelming revelation about Demandred's whereabouts is also straight out of the Lost playbook - they should have told us five books ago if they wanted people to really care. And like the \\"Who Killed Asmodean?\\" riddle, the Where's Berid Bel? puzzle too much depended on a weak process of elimination - since it wasn't anyone else in the whole opus, it must have been Graendal. Since Demandred isn't with anyone who's not the Sharans, he must be in Shara. Faulty reasoning, and imagine a prosecutor trying to get a convicition with reasoning like that. But the two authors seem to find laborious revelation by negation to be powerful proof.<br /><br />The sudden emergence out of nowhere of the Sharans as the main earthly foe is straight out of E.E. \\"Doc\\" Smith's space opera - have your heroes fight the villains for decades, then at the end suddenly reveal that new supersecret supervillains behind the supposed villains are the real threat. To be fair, Jordan did long ago have Sammael and Graendal briefly explain to us how channeling worked in Sharan society. Still, for the typical reader to intuit then that nine books later that minor exchange would be the key to the series was a bit much to expect.<br /><br />Remember that puzzled feeling some of us has when first finishing up [[ASIN:B002VBV1HC The Eye of the World]]? \\"Wait, what just happened? Who did he kill, that Dark One? Is it over?\\" And the same authorially deliberate uncertainty came at the end of [[ASIN:B0073WSQHM The Dragon Reborn]] - \\"So this Ba'alzamon fellow was the Dark One, and now he's dead, and The Wheel of Time trilogy is over, right?\\"<br /><br />But in those cases the uncertainty was because we were following along with Rand, and Rand wasn't yet fully up to speed - in part because of natural ignorance, and in part because Moiraine was still sheltering him from the full truth. But by the end of Book 14, we should, when inside Rand's head, be less unclear about what just happened to Rand and why than we were at the end of Book 1! Because now Rand does seem to get what occurred. His thoughts are just less well-explained.<br /><br />I see where the Eddings comparison in one review is coming from - Sanderson did write the series much more Twilighty and tween than Jordan did. He doesn't come across as a dumb or immature guy, but his fiction definitely seems to aim at a young adult level. I enjoy the [[ASIN:076536543X Mistborn]] books for what they are (and again, his logical magical systems rather than characterization are his strength), but they're no Jordan WOT. And his forced humor I alluded to earlier is very Eddings-esque. Most Jordan women always had a bit of Polgara in them anyway, and in Sanderson hands they become even more judgmental and humorless than they were under Jordan.<br /><br />As for the title of my piece, it is not 100% a joke or throwaway cynicism to wonder if there was a deliberate setting up of an eventual successor series here. There is enough left unresolved and unexplained that I would be unshocked if in 2016, whether it is planned already or not, TOR Books, the estate of Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson announced the forthcoming publication of \\"A New Age Brings New Winds: The First Volume of The Children of the Dragon.\\"<br /><br />In particular the whole future of the Aiel / remnant of a remnant / prey of the Seanchan subplot was left unresolved. Yet in this climactic volume Sanderson was still spending a decent amount of time on Aviendha and the other Foolish Ones discussing the importance of her descendant vision, Amys's confirmation of same, theneed for second and third, (and why not fourth and fifth?) trips to Rhuidean, and in general how the future of a post-Battle Seanchan tyranny can be averted.<br /><br />Because all signs are that it WON'T be averted unless someone actively averts it. Rand did not bring the Seanchan to heel. He did kneel before the Crystal Throne, validating in their minds their right to subjugate all other peoples, enslave channelers, and in general be beastly to everyone. The Seanchan version of who deserves to rule where and how will prevail. And with Moghedien subsumed into Seanchan, their slavery-based society isn't going to get spontaneously better.<br /><br />Mat suggested that Hawkwing have a talk with Tuon, but did it happen? How did it go? Did Tuon or her people realize Rand was right that the whole world doesn't revolve around them?<br /><br />Rand made Tuon sign a piece of paper, but Rand is \\"dead,\\" and without the Dragon's power behind them, the remnant of a remnant Aiel probably won't be able to stave off the empire.<br /><br />Far from his freeing the slaves the Seanchan did take or keeping them from taking more slaves, Rand actually left Min in their violent hands; raised to honor, but not free to leave.<br /><br />And what about Aviendha's possible children, and the Dragon's other children? There's a lot of scope there for a follow-up if Harriet and/or Tom Doherty start missing their cash cow series, even if Sanderson were to prefer to continue to develop his own worlds.<br /><br />The foregoing is all part of why I suspect the series may have deliberately been written less conclusively than it could have been.<br /><br />All in all, I'm glad it's over for now. I'm sure each of us had our own versions of how we'd like the WOT to end (I know that a lot of people insisted Rand had to be dead and stay dead for the series to be fulfilling, for instance), and I think very few of us had as our dream ending Rand winning by vague unspecified means, then cheerfully going offon wanderjahr alone. But presumably this is the ending the series was always going to have, such as it is.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|I enjoy reading occasionally and I enjoy Grisham's style of writing.  I found this story line a departure from his usual formula.  Held my interest making it hard to put down.  Good leisure read!

B009JBZH54|3.0|First copy that arrived at my door had to discs both with the special features to the dark knight but no dark night movie disc.  It was my first return to amazon and the process was painless but it did take 4 extra days to receive my full movie set.
B008AT71WI|5.0|Most people have no idea that the actual ending of the musical isn't a happy affair!  The Director's Cut of &#34;Little Shop of Horrors&#34; is a great way to see what was originally planned and executed before the test audiences saw it.  Most British musicals end on a &#34;down note&#34; with death and suffering.  Americans just don't understand that since everyone is raised on &#34;happily ever after.&#34;  Now die-hard musical fans can enjoy both endings on this crisp, clear Blu-ray version of one of the most underrated musicals to be transferred to motion pictures!<br /><br />The booklet attached in the cover gives really interesting information for those not as familiar with the &#34;Little Shop&#34; backstory.  The special features on the Blu-ray are also a delight to watch -- but I won't spoil any fun moments here!  You can't go wrong adding this fun show to your collection!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|When I first started reading this, I thought it was a &#34;tween&#34; book. I am 60 years old, but I was hooked and could not put it down.<br />I would recommend this for all age groups.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|I was fortunate to see this production live.  Sadly, I wasn't able to get to the Royal Albert Hall to be there in person.  But the streaming broadcast to my local theater was just as good (and more affordable) at the time!<br /><br />Now I can relive the fun (minus the people sitting around me talking) whenever I like at home!  This Blu-ray has the production in all it's newly-imagined glory and I can watch it whenever I like.  If you're a Phantom Phanatic and you've not seen this new version of the show, you're really missing a great experience!
B005LAIH4A|4.0|The movie is very well done. Great animation and very interesting storyline (which I will not spoil).  It does have a good message in it about protecting our planet without being preachy about it.<br /><br />It is good for the whole family. My 3 yr old likes the animation, even if he misses the finer points of the movie.
B007M45PMU|5.0|The Lumineers have a great album here. What's even better is I got this at a discounted price here on Amazon; and after I had purchased some new textbooks, I got the album for free. I feel like one lucky girl getting a gift with purchase. Thanks to the band and to Amazon!
B0090YHSFC|4.0|This is  a great time waster. The increasingly difficult levels provide a challenge, yet the easy levels are easy enough for my 3 year old. He really likes it, and it is a good non-violent game.
B008PCVGKI|5.0|I have recently retired as a lecturer on an Allied Health course, and I can honestly say that my students would have learned far more from this book about how research can be corrupted, and how good research should be designed, than they would have done from a year of \\"Research\\" lectures at university. Yes, some of it is scary reading, but with this and \\"Bad Science,\\" Ben Goldacre has given the world of medical research the kick up the backside it has sorely needed. As an added bonus, the writing style is also highly readable.
B004VYYA2K|5.0|This is great for storing all those Barbies and yet can be used to play as well.  Granddaughter was delighted.
0765325950|1.0|Rated it one star because Amazon won't let me post without a rating and I thought people should know it is coming SOON. I knew last year it wouldn't be out till spring, so I purchased all the others on e-book so I could read them again while I wait for the last one on e-book. I love this series and am (sort of) patiently waiting for my turn to read it.<br />From the Brandon Sanderson website: Release Schedule<br />The hardcover and audiobook editions of the book will be published on January 8, 2013. The ebook will be released on April 9.
B000F8O35U|5.0|I got this movie for my young granddaughter for Christmas. She loves music and really enjoys the animated Disney movies. This one is a nice addition to her growing collection.
B00AN93Q0O|5.0|This cd is by far the best thing I have heard in quite some time. Every single song is incredibly deep and well produced!! Wouldn't expect anything less!!!!
B001VLXNLU|5.0|I recommend this to young teenage girls.<br />It can be addicting as there are so many books in the series. My niece got me onto these books.
B0098VYCCE|1.0|Kristin Stewart continues her legacy of looking and acting completely stoned at all times.  Charlize Theron is semi-worthwhile, save for her atrocious accent.  Chris Hemsworth needs to lose the shirt and the Scottish brogue from Central Casting.  Otherwise, it's a fun movie to watch while it's on mute, though I never need to watch it again.
B003ZK58WM|5.0|Realy enjoyed this book and from what I have heard the 2nd in this series is even better. An awesome writer. Love all his books.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|The usual Gameloft Facebook type game. Well done for a freemium game it has a better feel than most of their other games.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|A huge waste of time and money.  This movie had not one redeeming quality and definitely was not worth the 3.99 I spent on it.
B0050R0YB8|5.0|I enjoyed assembling this very much.I enjoyed it so much I dismantled it a week later so I could put it together again in around a month.If youy like star wars and can afford it.Buy it!  note if you buy this on amazon for 320.00 it will never lose its value and its a good posibility that it will actually be worth more after its discontinued.
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|This movie was very hard to follow the storyline.  Overall I felt it was a waste of 3.99.  And I love Bruce and still didn't like it.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Made my plane trip better and had me rooting for them in the end. Great teen based movie and for adults like me who refuse to grow up.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It's fun but the way you control it now is hard for me. The should change it back. Good game.
1400032717|5.0|I had to read this book for the sake of an abnormal psychology course. Despite ultimately being forced to read this book, I really loved the nuance and obvious care in speech that Haddon has used in his work. It does take a bit of getting used to the way the narrator speaks - it's written in first-person, from the point-of-view of a young man with autism spectrum disorder - but it really turns out in a very caring, lovely way of writing. Please, do yourself a favor and read this great piece of literature.
B000JCSBU0|5.0|This movie is a more realistic version of how drugs effect your life negatively. There is not a whole lot of glorifying drug use. In reality while drugs may seem wonderful or fun at first, the reality is that soon it takes it's toll on you mentally and physically. If I had an older teen child I would want them to watch it.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Great read. Can't put it down! Would recommend to anyone who has a Kindle. You just fly through pages like crazy.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a very sweet book to read, yes I did shed a tear or two but in the end it is tears of happiness. Great read!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Very easy to use. I love to mix and match the sounds to get just the right mood I need. I may upgrade later but not sure. The free version works for me right now.
B004EPYZUI|4.0|This movie is just eye candy on Bluray.  Its super clear and the action scenes are just awesome.  The story is okay, and the acting is just par.  None of the characters really stood out.  But just watch for the action scenes.  Each one is about 5-10 mins.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|loved it! loved it! loved it!<br />great item at a great price!<br />the download worked fast n smooth!<br />love Rod Stewart!

B009YQJ322|2.0|I loved the original \\"Judge Dredd\\" movie in 1995<br />and I Assumed, this was a remake of the original movie<br /><br />SPOILER: IT IS NOT.<br /><br />so I must say, I was disappointed with this movie.<br />Just a warning to anyone hopping this movie is a new updated<br />version of the original it is not.<br /><br />This movie is a completely and totally different movie than the<br />1995 one and has absolutely nothing in common except the name.<br /><br />Now as to the reason I gave it 2 stars, it is because I assumed it was a remake<br />and I did not think it fair to one star this movie because of my personal mistake.<br /><br />On the other hand it really, In my opinion, doesn't even deserve 1 star due to it was just<br />about as boring a movie as this type can be. yes tons of gun stuff happened, lots of blood and<br />guts, heads smashing and brains flying everywhere... bla bla bla few good action seines and<br />mostly walking around waiting for something to happen, no real plot and I never actually felt<br />anything at all for any of the characters.<br /><br />If I had known this was not a remake of the original, I may have gone in thinking, Ok lets give it<br />a chance to make its own way, but I was completely disappointed with this movie and ahh well<br />live and learn, another twenty bucks down the drain.
B0021L8V1Q|4.0|I bought this for my son for Christmas.  Not sure if he has viewed it so we are not sure of the quality of the disc.
0425263908|4.0|This was recommended by Amazon after reading the Fifty Shades series.  I thought it was a good book and well written.  The characters are tamer than the stuff that happens with Christian Grey and Anna, but it still is steamy.  If I was to give it a movie aged rating I would say its like NC-17 to Fifty's X.  I liked it enough to give it to a girlfriend for her birthday and plan to read the follow ups in the series.
B007RI56NY|5.0|Honestly although I liked their first single Meet Virginia, I never had been much of a Train fan. However, when Drive By was released, I realized that they were a pretty decent group. I decided to purchase my first album from them which is this one because I really enjoyed their new single 50 ways to say Goodbye! Excellent album!!! Makes me now want to go back and listen to their other albums to see what other great songs I've been missing! Definitely a band worth listening too!! :)
B0000DK4PO|3.0|It was Dirty, finger printed, and unidentified mystery gunk.....other than that everything else was cleaned....but the cd. it came in one piece and in nice condition but the disk being dirty wasn't too appealing.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I may be in the minority when I admit that I liked \\"Catching Fire\\" better than the book it follows, \\"The Hunger Games.\\"<br /><br />The first book was fun and all that--kids trying to kill each other--and shooting an arrow at the pig's head, etc.  But a lot of the energy in that book was expended on world building.  This is usually the curse of the first book in any series.<br /><br />The second book, \\"Catching Fire,\\" picks up where the first left off.  But now that we know pretty much how the world works and who the people are, the action starts off more quickly.  This book has more plot and more twists to keep things interesting.<br /><br />For one thing, it shows what happens in between successive Hunger Games.  Certain events happen as an aftermath to the ending of Book #1.  President Snow tries to smooth things out and to try to stop a rebellion from rising.<br /><br />Some may not enjoy several \\"false starts\\" where the protagonists consider carrying out one plan and then another, but they don't even come close to fruition.  But I enjoyed these several twists, as that's what life's about.<br /><br />This book offers a view into the government itself and the tricks they use to try to control the twelve districts.  It shows how even the winning District from book 1 is basically hosed.  For example, much of their extra food rations arrive in a rotten state.  Several of my friends point out that this is a terrible way for a dictator to maintain control, and such tactics would definitely kindle rebellion.  I tend to agree, but it's just a story.  The book's more about how citizens react to some crazy concocted civil situation, and not about whether such a situation could arise in real life.<br /><br />Since the book is written in first person present, there is a lot of action that happens off the pages.  When the climax occurs, there's this big info dump explaining what just happened.  It's all coolness, but I couldn't help but feel that I missed out on a lot of the action.  But then after reading, it's fun putting everything together in your head ... \\"Now that's why this thing over here happened that way.\\"  It'll be interesting to see how they handle this in the upcoming movie.<br /><br />My verdict: Well done, Ms. Collins!  And if you read Book #1, it's definitely worth continuing the series and reading this worthy sequel.action.  But then after reading, it's fun putting everything together in your head ... \\"Now that's why this thing over here happened that way.\\"  It'll be interesting to see how they handle this in the upcoming movie.<br /><br />My verdict: Well done, Ms. Collins!  And if you read Book #1, it's definitely worth continuing the series and reading this worthy sequel.
B005LAIH4A|2.0|This movie is cute and if you can look past the messages in it you'll like it. It is anti capitalism, anti free enterprise, anti business, anti logging, etc... While my younger kids loved it my 13 year old, husband, and I hated it. My 13 year old said it makes all business look evil, and tries to indoctrinate kids.  Not a fan.

B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|This book was a good easy read for a few days off. I enjoyed it but it is probably aimed at young people.
B008DKBPTO|5.0|This Kindle case is small enough for me to slip into my pocketbook and light enough so I don't realize it's there.  I looked at many but this was the best for me.
B008S4FZHI|5.0|I love the Scarpetta books and this one has really been a wonderful read. Back to Cornwells best writing for a long time! Thoroughly reccommend!!!!!
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I love the case cover.  But in my haste to put it on my Kindle Fire, I snipped<br />off the elestic band that holds the Kindle on the top right corner.  I use it anyway.<br />It is sort of lopsided at that corner, but it works
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was fantastic!!!  I could not put it down, wonder what happens next; I would highly recommend this book to anyone!
B001FA0W5W|4.0|I feel like I should preface this review with the confession that I am not a numbers man. I am horrid when it comes to even the most simple of calculations, and while I took Calculus and Economics in college, they were by no means easy and I am still uncertain how I passed Calculus 2.<br /><br />So, what possessed me to buy and read a book built around theoretical statistics I do not know. However, luck (randomness) was with me and Taleb wrote this book primarily through anecdotes that were easy for someone, mathematically illiterate (yours truly) to understand.<br /><br />This book really changed my way of thinking about the world and added some substance to things I had heard all my life. There were some places where I had to reread a couple of times to make sure I understood correctly, but that was less a matter of the author and more a matter of the esoteric nature of the subject.<br /><br />I will give this warning: I almost put the book down towards the beginning because of the (perceived) arrogance of the author. While this arrogance never really leaves (Yes Mr. Taleb, I understand how sophisticated a lover of poetry and the French language you are) it becomes seen in context.<br /><br />Overall, a good introduction into randomness in the financial markets explained by anecdotes. I plan on picking up the second in Taleb's \\"trilogy\\" \\"The Black Swan\\"
B007SUW24W|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my 22 year old grandson who sings and plays guitar.  He thought the cd was very good and compared Mr Sheeran to someone like Donovan.
B0074EIQQU|4.0|It pains me to only give this album 4 Stars because i had such higher hopes for it.  I think that there are some interesting parts on this album, and they definitely are treading new territory.  But its just doesn't grab me like their earlier releases.  It just seems kind of disjointed and uncomfortable at times.  This is an album that you may need to give a few spins before it really sinks in.<br /><br />If i were to recommend The Mars Volta to a friend i would tell them to check out Frances the Mute, De-Loused In The Comatorium, or Amputecture first.  Bedlam In Goliath and Ochtehedron are also damn good albums in their own right.  I feel like Noctourniquet falls a little short of what the band is capable of.  If you are a fan of Volta, you might think about picking this up.  But if you aren't, I can't say i'd recommend starting here.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love this application. it puts me asleep every time I  use it. I would highly recommend it to everyone

B005NJU8PA|2.0|Coming from a professional chef and overall foodie, this is a terrible book. Not only does it drag on but he also discusses his personal life along with a very cheesy sense of humor. It is not all about cooking either. It's also about hunting, crafting and chemicals, other BS that I stopped reading when I was 75% done with the book. I give him two stars for all the work that he put into it, but overall, this is trash. No he is not creating future 4-hour chefs with this book, it's just a nerdy self-finding journey published.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This was an excellent historical novel. It has been researched to the end. The fictional families are wonderful and become your friends as you are reading. I have finished the second in the trilogy and am anxiously awaiting the final book.
B006YMLE7G|5.0|If you love racing and guns, this is a great movie to pick up. The animation style is amazing, very beautiful and vibrant. There is romance involved, but they dont weigh the movie down in it. The focus is definitely on the race. Kind of a throwback to speed racer but not as corny. Very likely to pick this up on Bluray
B0027MJU00|5.0|This was a great book, I couldn't put it down.  Keeps you on your toes and guessing the whole time

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in a long long time! I guarantee if you read this, you will fall completely in love. It's beautifully written and you'll fall in love with Skye and Holder right away! READ THIS BOOK!
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|It's a great novel. I just read the full story in two weeks!! I just think is for younger people. But still be a great story!!
B003G4W49C|4.0|I recommend this book to anyone who is into science fiction. Ender is a prodigy child who is battling in school as preparation for an upcoming bugger war. Lots of surprises, and very compelling.
B009PNQUXO|1.0|It doesn't work. It finds the videos I want to watch, but it doesn't play them, so I guess I need to get back to my laptop or phone for this particular application.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|Loved this movie so much I watched it three times in 48 hours. I can't wait for the sequel to come out!
0765325950|5.0|If you've read the other 13 books, then you're going to love this book as well. So enough said there.<br />I was quite impressed with this booked being shipped in a timely matter so that I could receive this book on the day it came out.
B004SOR4H6|2.0|I do not care for twitter would rather communicate throught facebook with my friends, family, etc....  This is more for teenagers.
0345803485|2.0|My thoughts:<br /><br />Media hype and curiosity got the better of me and lured me into reading this twisted story. In my opinion, it is definitely not a literary work of art. The heroine's dialogue in a backstreet language weaves between her subconscious voice and her desires creating a never ending spin that goes on and on. As I read page after page of descriptive sex scenes from vanilla to kinky and the more explicit it became the more I wanted to laugh. The whole premise borders on dumpster sex.... maybe hamburger but definitely not haute cuisine. The author has created some sustained tension to tease her readers but sex and one's dreams are definitely the meat of the plot. To say this novel deploys every cheap clich&eacute;s in existence would be an understatement. Enough said time to move on....
B007J4T2G8|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read so far I love it..I can't wait to read the other books..
0385535147|3.0|An easy read, as are all Grisham's books. Somehow it did not really get me as involved as in others, but it does keep you wanting to finish, on edge that is. I can recommend it to all, but if you are not already a reader of Grisham it may not entice you into reading others.
B0002KZAKS|5.0|I needed a couple of mics for wedding videography and was cautious about ordering these because they were so much cheaper then other similar name brand mics.  I took the chance and love these.  The quality is great.  They definitely have some heft, showing that they are constructed soundly.  Highly recommend.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|If you're looking for a good shoot em up movie then this is perfect and then some. It actually has fantastic cinematography and offers a decent acting job from Karl Urban.
034580404X|5.0|Once I started the Fifty Shades Trilogy, it was so hard for me to put it down. I read all three books in a week then after a few days, I read them over again. When I was reading the Fifty Shades Trilogy, it made me laugh, blush, smile, and wanting to read more. So far the Fifty Shades Trilogy are on my top book list. Now I am hoping that E L James writes and publish Christian's perspective.
B0055SWM08|5.0|i love any game that force me to use my brain power.this game is definitely challenging, but dont play on the job or you will never get any work done.
B003UAKE9Y|2.0|I'll put this 1st for those who don't read past the 1st line. This DVD release has no extras on it other than narration by the director/music composer. Would like to have had some behind the scenes stuff.<br /><br />I know I'm late to see this, wasn't a big movie goer until recently. I loved Paranorman and heard good reviews of Coraline which was done by the same studio. Unfortunately I had watched some trailers (which I rarely do) so nothing in the movie was really a surprise. I can't say too much about why I don't like it that much, without giving out spoilers. I guess movies are a bit like relationships. You are either drawn to them or not and explaining why is often fruitless.<br /><br />Without giving away the story line, I felt they missed on charactor development. It was too cartoonish for me to really get drawn into the emotional drama. That is where I felt the difference in stop animation was between Coraline and Paranorman. In Paranorman, the charators were close enough to actual people that I could better relate to them. The best example of this in Coraline was Mr. B. A totally disproportionate character who had a line with 'um pa' in it that reminded me of 'um pa lume pa um pa te do' from 'Willie Wonka's Chocolate Factory'. Yes this ages me. Mr. B even had bluish/purple skin like the um pas.<br /><br />I was surprised when I read a reviewer's line somewhere that claimed this was one of the most imaginative films anywhere. The idea of souls being trapped when their bodies have no eyes comes from Native American Culture. I didn't feel anything in this movie was new. It felt very 'Walt Disney-ish to me.<br /><br />UPDATE 1/13/13<br /><br />Watched the movie a 3rd time and like it even less.<br />Coraline is basically a brat, that always wants more and in this movie always get what see wants. Even at the end, her parents give her want she wanted. The other main thing going on, is the main male character, Coraline's friend is emasculated, which continues thetrend in society. Coraline calls him names, (calls him \\"why were you born\\")beats on him and his body language shows he has low self esteem. I actually like movies with morals, but in this one, the brat gets her way and gets rewarded for being a brat. The entire world revolves around Coraline snd I think it is symptomatic of current society, in the way parents spoil their kids, yet it just makes the kids want more. Then being unhappy when they have everything you think anyone might need. Our tech society just creates addiction because social interaction is totally lacking. Not all that is in the movie, but this movie is disturbing, in a way that it never intended to be. The movie has no deep social interaction whatsoever, and no one even notices it missing.<br /><br />Great movie for someone who is morally bankrupt. I guess that explains its popularity in our society.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I like how the author describes every scene, it makes it interesting! I will buy the other books, thank you
B009IEXKXI|4.0|If you are a facts junkie, this book is for you. I don't know if any of the solutions would actually work, but found them fascinating. The main character is stranded on Mars with limited supplies. How he survives until he can be rescues  keeps you glued to the pages. I almost didn't read it because of the language on the first page, but quickly realized that is exactly what one would probably say in that situation. There were some typos that his computer didn't catch or he didn't review the final copy himself. I look forward to more books from this author.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|It was enjoyably to not see sex, guns,  monsters, and mockery in a movie you could watch with your family. Purely inbreeding and showed great talent. Good movie.
B00009YUPY|5.0|I seemed to go through a LOT of wireless mice and working at IBM for a spell I had one of these and liked it so I bought two of them for my work-at-home systems.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. I think it's the best game in the world. If you like temple run then you should like subway surfers.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|You can always read critics reviews or other when it comes to the movie.  Needless to say Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law shine.  The movie is fun and re-watchable.  This is a solid DVD package.  I loved the movie in the first place.  This really is a fun romp bringing the good action.  I've been to the graveyard they filmed at in London.  Totally made gift recipient ecstatic, who had to watch it that night.  Also, got it for a total steal on top of it.
B007TK77QE|2.0|Very strange.  Nothing flows and it has a pointless and mundane storyline.  Very disappointing from such a highly thought of author.
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|This is such a sad story, and to believe our justice system was so close and didn't do their job to the full extent of the law.  This poor young woman, how her mother must have felt all those years.  I can't imagine.
B00AI5AQPQ|5.0|I loved it .it was a story of friendship and love with Matilda and Ms. Honey .it also was funny
B006O6EOII|5.0|My granddaughter wanted one for Christmas, and she was so thrilled with it.  I'm glad I purchased it through Amazon.
1592402038|4.0|I bought it because he said &#34;my story was good, but the teacher marked it down because of the punctuation!&#34; He felt persecuted: &#34;isn't the writing the most important thing?&#34; I don't know how much effect this will have, but initially he found it entertaining. And I think he has more appreciation for the work that punctuation does for us.

B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I love having the google app. on my kindle.  It is the search engine I use for everything, very simple to use.
B008UFUOH6|5.0|I heard this on NPR's Saturday Morning and immediately ordered it for myself and three other friends who'd lost close family members this past year. The lyrics are not inane or empty. For someone who's facing a first Christmas after a loved one's death, this is music that is not only bearable, but like a hug that will help them through the season.<br /><br />I can't wait to play it again next year.
145210655X|5.0|I love this book.  I bought it as a gift for my brother and he got a kick out of it.

B0059XTU1S|4.0|This is a tough one to critique. Is it good? I suppose so. I enjoyed it, but there isn't much here that you haven't already seen in the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy, so you pretty much have to take it as an extension of those earlier films.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. This is the story of Bilbo Baggins as he goes on his first adventure. It's the adventure whereby he tries to help the Dwarves regain their home. A home from which they were displaced many years prior due to the assault of a horrid, fire breathing dragon. It is also the adventure where Bilbo first meets Gollum and comes into the possession of the all important ring from the subsequent trilogy.<br /><br />This has a lot of great stuff in it and is full of whimsy. You have a forest wizard who allows a bird to nest on his head and gets pulled along by a sled driven by a bunch of rabbits. Mountains that fight it out with one another and a band of Dwarves with more personality than one can readily digest. But there is also much familiar from the earlier three movies. Some of the landscapes and vast underground caverns will be all too familiar to viewers. The sweeping, overhead camera is, by now, a trademark of Jackson's directing. The CGI and a few other effects are essentially identical to the original three movies. Some of the costumes and set ideas were tweeked a bit but the overall look is familiar. The actors all do a stand-up job and Martin Freeman was a wise choice for a young Bilbo.<br /><br />I did like this movie but I think it needed something to separate it from the originals. Some could argue, soundly, that, being cut from the same cloth, this movie needed to look like the others. IMHO, the other movies total nearly 12 hours and we've had an eyeful of these things. I think it time to come up with something new.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great game. Tons of stuff to do and good objectives. Really enjoy it!<br />Seasonal themes provide constant updates and new projects to work on.
0765325950|1.0|This decision not to publish the ebook at the same time was made as a public relations move. It's hard to express my disappointment. I'm going into the hospital on Friday and I knew that my trip there would be a little more bearable as I would be able to lose myself in this long awaited conclusion to the series. I would probably still get the hardbound if I felt my condition would allow me to hold the much heavier book up for hours at a time, but that's not possible. I have never felt that as a person I have been discriminated again, until now.<br />This was done with the intention of preserving Mr. Jordan's legacy, but it's obvious from the reactions that were generated by this decision, that it has backfired. I don't pretend to know Mr. Jordan's personal desires, but I feel that the man who created such a wonderful world and characters with such integrity, would be more concerned with how his reader's feel inside about his work than the results of some list. I feel the results from the sales will be so overwhelming that it will be moot in the long run. In the meantime, I can't help but feel disappointed that the powers that be cared more about a title that they care about the people who want to experience it. I hope I have the opportunity to experience A Memory of Light
0062059882|5.0|My first Neil Gaimain book, and it was fantastic, directly and indirectly. Directly because, there are some fascintaing scenes, vivid details and visuals, unexpected plot twists, excellent characters, a very satisfying ending, and some pretty great writing. At times, the book is mellow, at others chilling, but it is certainly always exciting. Directly, the book is an excellent weave of fantasy, mythology, some horror, and even a little historical fiction throughout.<br /><br />Indirectly, this book is even more fascinating. One thought that remained in my head throughout was how easy it was to follow the story. I remember thinking, if not written correctly, this book would have been extremely confusing and hard to follow. However, Neil Gaiman turns a deep, multi-layered tale, and makes it as easy to read as the latest James Patterson novel. This to me is incredible. You'd think, based off how easy it is to read, that it was easy to write, but I'd bet a lot of money that this was very difficult to do. Not for nothing though, as Gaiman makes some very far-fetched fiction seem not so unbelievable. As a reader, I appreciate the effort of Gaiman.<br /><br />I like reading for a number of reasons, though one big reason why is because of the imagination. Clive Barker, Issac Asimov, and many others just come up with incredibly imaginative tales, and Neil Gaiman, with American Gods, presents certainly one of the best imaginative pieces I've had the pleasure of reading. I've read the bio where Neil Gaiman says \\"I make things up, and I write them down.\\" I would actuallly expect him to be that kind of guy, who isn't exactly a genuis because of any specific reason, just because he was born with an incredible ability to write excellent tales and take the mind places where few others have been.<br /><br />Really, really great book, and certainly not my last by Gaiman.
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|...you'll love Groundhog Day. An iconic comedy, well played by the entire cast. &#34;This is one time where television really fails to capture the true excitement of a large squirrel predicting the weather.&#34;
B008HT4FUW|5.0|This stunning production is in a class of its own.  Beautiful scenery, great acting and good story line.  Waiting now to purchase Season 3
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I thought Fifty shades was touching and then I read the crossfire novels and then Gabriels Inferno and Beautiful Disaster - and I loved all of them BUT nothing prepared me for Hopeless. I was blown away by it. \\"The best first kiss in the history of first kisses - without even kissing\\" WOW.I get hot flushes just thinking about it! I loved the witty banter between Sky and Holder when they were gettign to know each other and then the intensity of their relationship afterwards.Anyone who is unfortunate enough to go through what Sky did deserves a Holder by their side...
B000SEIK2S|3.0|I was pleasantly surprised by the premise of OMW, and even more surprised that it hadn't already been introduced into science fiction literature. Kudos to Scalzi for injecting new life into military sci-fi.<br /><br />The writing style is easy, which makes the story flow. And rather than getting all caught up in trying to invent and explain plausible technical details, he just presents them as fact (one exception is the skip drive; he does present some explanations which I think could have been omitted). By doing so, he keeps the story concentrated on the men and women of the CDF, rather than letting it become bogged down by mumbo-jumbo.<br /><br />The character of John Perry is well described, and his thoughts and memories of his deceased wife bring a welcome emotional depth to the story. I found myself deeply touched by his love for his wife, carried forward not only through time, but across light years of space.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B005PK1G76|4.0|It was a great add on to the stroller. Easy to install, price was reasonable too. We are happy that we have it
B008AK8FHM|1.0|If you are  a Christian and hold true to what the Bible says, you will find many conflicts in this book. You will then have to choose which one you believe. While the Dr.s experience was an interesting read, i have to dismiss it as I choose Gods word as the untimate authority. The fact that God was referred to as \\"Om\\" was a little disturbing and \\"new agey\\".

0374264260|3.0|Silver Linings had a great cast of characters.  Much like &#34;One Flew Over the Coocoo's Nest&#34;, the reader will get to see the world through the perspective of someone who lives his life in an altered reality.  Over time, that reality adjusts through his interactions with the people around him.  If you are a fan of the movie.....read the original book, not the one adapted from the screenplay.  They are two different stories, each one good in their own way.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|the game is fun. I got to lvl. 24 and then it somehow deleted and wants me to start over. Unless I can find a way to get my data back then I wont be playing this game anymore
B003Y5H574|4.0|This is such a great movie to remind you about how sometimes in a relationship you lose your way and get stuck in a rut but you can overcome. And oh yeah Ryan Gosling is super hot as a womanizer and shirtless that alone should make you want to buy the movie. Emma Stone is a great actress and she and Ryan Gosling have great onscreen chemistry which is very obvious since they are starring in another movie together. In this movie every girl wants to be Emma stones character. Sometimes the movie gets slow but don't worry it all makes sense in the end. And oh yeah Steve Carrell is funny too.
B0086QS7N2|5.0|Okay so for all you people thinking about buying this album. you must buy the one with the digital booklet, there is an introduction to each song in the digital booklet, to really understand the album and the over arching theme of all the songs. you must read the booklet and more importantly the introduction to each song which is presented in the digital booklet above the lyrics of the song. it really connects the entire album, the metaphorical glue, that binds it together.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Heard a lot about angry birds, but wans't sure what it was all about.  Our son downloaed it for our new kindle, and it pretty fun!
B00846REIS|4.0|Another love story with like able, rich man and slightly annoying woman. Looking forward to 3rd book! A little overboard at times, but good storyline.
B00APUQJLO|1.0|I really wanted to like this movie.  Cronenberg has done good work in the past, and so have Pattinson and Giamatti as well as the others.  But what was this all about?  It sounded as if everyone was reading from a book until Giamatti came along.  And whatever political and social commentary was there got lost in the strained intellectualism.  It was so dull that I had to force myself to finish the DVD.
B001LRTT5I|5.0|I am a fan to all 3 main characters in this movie.  Ed & Viggo are the good guys saving towns from bad guys like Jeremy.  I've seen better westerns but for the value it was worth watching...looking at the men don't hurt either.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Looper is a great sci-fi movie with a unique story line, good action, and good specialFX.  There have been similar time travel movies, but this one puts a twist on the typical time traveler movie with the idea of the &#34;looper&#34;.  The acting was pretty good and JGL does a great job.  Bruce Willis is his typical acting self (in other words, nothing extraordinary here).  Overall, the action was good and the movie kept my attention the entire time.  Highly recommended for fans of movies like Total Recall, Blade Runner, and Lockout.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|Not sure which device I got this on as I'm not really using it. It might have been a download for my phone.I must have worked well when I used it the first time.
B008B3MZNI|1.0|I love Supertramp, and I was excited about viewing this blu-ray of their concert. HOWEVER, I was so disappointed by the quality of this disc that I did not even finish watching it, in its entirety, before returning it. This disc should NOT be labeled as blu-ray, and should not be sold for more than $10.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I can't believe how completely mesmerized this book has me. I HATED Fifty Shades of Crap, but this series, this book. I'm obsessed. I love it so hard and I'm terrifically shocked and amazed by that. Can't wait for May!
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|One of the best books I've read. Even if you are not a fantasy fan you'll enjoy the pace and story.
B00785P2QC|4.0|started playing yesterday and I cant put it down! only thing I'm not a huge fan of is how much its pushed to share on facebook. nobody wants facebook to be spammed<br /> out with game pics.
B000G1ALRK|5.0|We like this album it has some really great songs on it. I bought it as a gift for Jd and he loved it
B007SGLZP8|4.0|However, not all that I would have wanted. I feel that he could have done more at the end to keep mixing things up, but he was comfortable coasting on in after giving us a good legal thriller (though not a great one by his standards).
B002G1K82Q|5.0|Story line was great, very entertaining.  Husband even liked it and that says a lot.<br />If you're a Beatles fan and love their music you'll enjoy this
B004EPYZQ2|4.0|This movie has Spielberg's influence all over it! But, it's the best rip-off attempt I've seen, and even though there's the usual over-use of anamorphic lens flares that J.J. Abrams loves to pollute his films with, I still enjoyed this film very much.  The music by Michael Giacchino is very effective, and makes me sad the the show &#34;Lost&#34; isn't around anymore.  I've heard complaints about the alien and the CGI quality, but I don't have any qualms there.  Aliens have been shown in so many ways over the years that it's hard for me to expect total originality in creature-creation these days.  Anyway, the heart of the story isn't about the alien, and that's what makes this movie stand out more than most.  Video is superb, and the first couple of special features let you get to know the filmmakers in a wonderful way and you even get to see some of their own Super-8 films from childhood!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is soo addicting. Don't be turned away from it by how easy the first levels are, they get more challenging and fun
B008MU8ZNO|3.0|This movie has quite a reputation.  I've heard it mentioned many times, and I had a roommate who would beg me to watch it with him on a regular basis.  Leave it to Netflix Instant to finally coax me into viewing something I wouldn't normally be interested in.  I watched the movie a little over halfway through before I felt like it was a solid buy.  I jumped on Amazon and it was on sale for under five bucks! On blu-ray! Now, this is no hi-def treat by any means.  But for the price, it was certainly worth it for me and I got to finish the movie a few days later when it finally arrived.  This movie is good, but not great as far as low budget &#34;bad&#34; movies are concerned.  It's certainly no &#34;Night of the Creeps&#34;, which is perhaps the best hidden treasure Netflix ever gave me!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|We love it! We like this game better than angry birds, you do not hear the constant angry birds, angry birds. lol
111846446X|5.0|This is a great addition to my library for the Pi it helped me get the machine up and running really quickly.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|My daughter loves the challenge and I enjoy playing it as well.  We play it everynight for a bout an hour.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|love the game! cant wait for the next one! great plot great graphics great everything! only way it could be better is if it was free!
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|This movie was completely star-studded with action non-stop.  It may have been a bit light on the storyline - like how Gunner came to return to the team after being outed in the first movie but it ws very entertaining.  I enjoyed it and despite the light story details, I felt satisfied.  I'd watch it again.
B0002TT36G|3.0|I got one of these for Christmas in 2011.  It was GREAT.  It was very sturdy and made really well.  I got three more of the same thing in this order, and the binder rings aren't as thick and sturdy.  They don't protrude into the book as far so it won't fit as many as the original one I got did.  It is a great buy, don't get me wrong.  But based on the exact same product I received from the exact same store on Amazon a year ago, this isn't quite as good as they used to make them.  Must have outsourced to China.
B009POHHPS|5.0|Art similar to kingdom come and great story.  Looking forward to the movie when it is released  interesting way to put in the characters
0765325950|5.0|I had to write this review when I noticed all the 1 Star reviews that have nothing to do about this product.This is reviews for the Hardcover and to help others make a decision if they want to read this book,to those e-book readers I understand the frustration but please find the proper forum to post your complaints.<br /><br />I have been reading this series for several years I just re-read the entire series in anticipation of this book.I am now reading slowly to savor the experience of this Final book, I am half way through reading this book with a smile.I have been enjoying a return to this amazing world and characters and all the battles.I encourage anyone with a love for fantasy and epic stories to read this series.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|These books are great. From being a fan of the show, I can really hear the characters voices. I already bought the next book!
B000VDDDVO|5.0|For anyone who has forgotten or needs to be reminded of what's important in this life. I watch it every year during the holidays!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Loaded on my Fire. Easy and simple to use. I have not had any problems or issues with it. My local weather report is just a touch away!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I went in with low expectations but was shocked at how quickly I got sucked in. Lots of areas missing the plot, completely unrealistic, but aside from that I enjoyed myself tremensly and look forward to the film version and any more novels.
B00656C6KK|5.0|This CD was a present for my father. He has always like Doris Day and has really enjoyed hearing new music from her.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I went in with low expectations but was shocked at how quickly I got sucked in. Lots of areas missing the plot, completely unrealistic, but aside from that I enjoyed myself tremensly and look forward to the film version and any more novels.
B0006TSSNG|5.0|Band of brothers is a historically accurate account of what happened in some of the worlds hardest hours of war. These movies are at times emotionally hard to watch. Great Films!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is the best trilogy of 2012!!!! I can't wait for the movie to come out, it's worth the hype!
1452111014|5.0|I expected a lot from this book, and that's what I got! It's interesting to see all the character concepts, and how the virtual world of Wreck-it Ralph came to life. It's a great gift for fans of the movie, art enthusiasts, or both!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|it works anytime ,I can keep up with my far flung family. I play online games with people all over the world. easy to use
B007VUA7VO|1.0|Sucks does not work completly worth less.<br />Do not buy this<br />What a rip off<br />nuff said dude<br />the ned
1419707663|5.0|Seems a little hard core compared to what I was reading in 2nd grade so I'm watching them closely for anything too negative...
B0083P1QUM|2.0|I found myself skipping over pages of repetitive descriptions of the same scenes and never was \\"riveted\\" by who did it.  And when I was almost at the end of the book I thought \\"Who is going to be the culprit?...\\" Being an old mystery novel fan, I usually have many thoughts about \\"who did it\\", but not in this one. And when I was almost to the end of the book and didn't have a clue, it sort of ticked me off. And when the name of the suspect raised I had to go back to find out who he was. Disappointed.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|great  for reading while lounging , sunning at the beach. eliminates having to hold the kindle fire upright to read, just rest it on your lap.
B005LAII08|5.0|one of the first holiday gifts bought this year and all have enjoyed the movies, love getting the 3D, blu ray and dvd in one package.  Movie itself very cute , but the accents of the characters are different (scotish)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Although some of the games are hard to control on my Kindle, I like most of the games and they are fun to pass the time. Plus it's FREE!!!!
B007MDB548|5.0|very cute movie and the 3D is great , love the &#34;package deal&#34;, easy to share with family that doesn't have 3D and yet keep copy at home also
0307341550|4.0|This book was good very deep and psychological.  Takes you to some dark places.  Good read for those looking for something different
B004WE01YA|5.0|LOVE, LOVE , LOVE this movie, the 5 disc combo is great and the grandkids watch this over and over.
034580404X|5.0|Loved this series.  A very nice change.  It's not a literary masterpiece but its something different and the characters are very intriguing
B0030V0PEW|5.0|couldn't put it down. Helps hit home the reality that human endeavors have surpassed our human abilities and to flourish we must seek help from each other or reason.
0425263908|5.0|This series is the best book series I've ever read.  If you thought 50 shades was great, you will love these.  They are on a completely new level and I loved them even more than 50 shades.
B0092S4WLY|3.0|It's a challenge in that you are not given any real directions. You look for clues and connect the dots.
0425263916|5.0|This series is the best book series I've ever read.  If you thought 50 shades was great, you will love these.  They are on a completely new level and I loved them even more than 50 shades.
B005LAII1C|4.0|As much I enjoy this movie so much saw it in the cinema and  bought it on Blu-ray but truth must be told this movie is offensive and thats part of it's appeal it's the closest thing to family guy the movie. It's has some offensive and I am not talking about foul language.<br />If you get offended from cancer jokes and similar things stear away from this one.
0307341577|4.0|This book was good very deep and psychological.  Takes you to some dark places.  Good read for those looking for something different
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is one of the most delightful book I have ever read. The author's writing style is vividly enthralling. Well worth your time.
0061900656|5.0|Really cute book.  My son really enjoys reading this book. Good at showing them things they can and cant do with the new baby.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Excellent read!  Got my attention immediately - never dragged!<br />I will want to continue reading the whole Jack Reacher series.
030758836X|4.0|This book was good very deep and psychological.  Takes you to some dark places.  Good read for those looking for something different
B0091REZMW|3.0|nice graphics but too slow<br />should just be straight forward explore where you want depending on points not on gems or coins
B0091REZMW|4.0|I'm addicted and now I don't like any of my other games. Thank God you have to run out of stuff or I would play it all day.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Great animation, direction, and story -- and the child I got this for really enjoyed this film. He has watched it repeatedly. Totally recommend it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Lots and lots and lots of fun! The game's description says it all - simple, challenging and addictive. Definitely worth a buy or download...and the extra level packs available for purchase seem waaaaay more than worth it if it means more game time. Get &quot;Flow&quot; now!
B008JIFJ4W|4.0|I am a big fan of Passion Pit and while Manners is still my favorite, Gossamer has not disappointed. Plus, you can't beat a $5 deal through Amazon!
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|This soundtrack is as perfect as the movie itself. The emotion that the actors and actresses put into these songs is just amazing. Flawless.
0425263916|5.0|Very happy with the purchase of this book.  The shipping was fast and the book was amazing!  Looking forward to reading the next book in the series.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|Was excited to see this, but it turns out all of the family guy characters are just shoved into &#34;Ted&#34;'s teddy bear brain.  Kinda lame for the most part.  Very disappointing.
B000BW7QX6|5.0|It took me some time to watch Firefly - but once I saw it I had to have this movie.  Recommend to anyone from the Star Wars era.
1451695195|5.0|I left this book in my guest room for holiday visitors to read. They were astonished! I hope many more people will read this amazing book.
B0040HJNKC|5.0|I have been listening to Buddy Guy for years - I am 82 years old and love music - have always been partial to the blues.
0307593525|5.0|I purchased this item as a gift for a family member.  I was so happy to find that I could purchase a set of Julia Child's cookbooks rather than just a single book. The set was an added bonus for the recipient who loved receiving it.  The books are hardcover and the case is nice and sturdy.  The design is unintrusive when sitting on a shelf or desk.
B003ASLJK4|5.0|Eastwood and Streep are great in this movie.  I could watch this over and over.  I have the book and the movie is so true to it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|An incredible book that left me speechless.  Once I started, I couldn't put the book down.  Definitely did not need a \\"chapter break\\" (you'll understand when you read it). Without a doubt this book is on my top 10 list of favorite books.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I found this to be an interesting and entertaining read.  Each chapter kept me wanting more.  Katniss is a complex heroine.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is quite easy to read yet stays interesting all the way to the last page.  I can't wait to read the next book.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|Amazing series! Can't wait to read the rest of the series. Full of mystery and suspense. Amazing author and plot.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|You better pay attention while watching this or you'll be completely lost! That being said, it was a great movie with a great ending. I wish they wouldn't have tried to make Joseph Gordon Levitt look like Bruce Willis (other than maybe contacts to make their eye color the same) because it was distracting. We all know who JGL is and we all know who BW is, so it was completely unnecessary. Emily Blunt was fantastic, as was JGL. Overall, I reccomend this to anyone who likes to watch a movie that makes you think.
B0084TWN9K|5.0|I'm a devoted Munro's reader.  I'm always looking forward to the release of her next collection.  She can evoke for us how life was in an Ontario, Canada town circa 40s-80s.  The tone of her writing is detached but not without passion.  And she is masterful in capturing a time and a place that somehow tells us about a person's open and hidden feelings, in short, a life.  I always get the feeling, reading Munro's work, that she's in a corner seeing and taking in everything that's going on around her.  A minute, common detail is written so deftly that it becomes an indispensable telltale of the story; and it is in the observation of these little, almost forgettable details that Munro evokes for her readers the lives of ordinary people who, in turn, command not only our attention but also arouse our tender feelings, something approaching kindredness.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Good read. Some language (more than I realized I guess) but overall would recommend it. Started on a Monday and was done by the following night.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It's a well written, easy to read book.  The characters are believable in their own world and well written. Just bought the next in the series and I hope the story line and characters can stay as strong an believable as in this book.
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|I loved &#34;Born to Die&#34; so much and I think this is even better! I love Lana and her voice is great :)
075669812X|5.0|Perfect, fast and easy loved it ... ... .... ... .... .... .... .... .... ... .... ... .... ...
1451695195|5.0|Dr. Alexander gives a rare report of his journey into the afterlife while experiencing a near-death coma.  His being there shows proof of what we are all wondering . . . is there life after death?  There surely is in this very revealing work by a neurosurgeon with science on his mind and not spirituality.  A very good read.  I loved it and even wept a few times during the day I read it cover to cover.
0765325950|4.0|I'm torn about rating this book.<br /><br />On the one hand, A MEMORY OF LIGHT closes out a series that I've been following since high school, and does it in style. I don't want to give spoilers, but I'll just say that it gives closure to the most important parts of the book, that there are some scenes in here that I've been waiting for for so long, that I invented in my mind for years when I couldn't get that closure from Jordan.<br /><br />The reality of seeing those moments in print were almost overwhelming. I read some of those scenes with tears in my eyes. There were moments of real greatness--in fact, many moments of them.<br /><br />I have a few tiny complaints that marred my enjoyment of this book; these complaints necessitate some tiny spoilers (but nothing near the end of the book).<br /><br />1. Mat. I felt that the reason Mat gave for going to Ebou Dar was not consistent with the character growth we've seen from him thus far. The Mat who ran away from responsibility, who would abandon the Band of the Red Hand and the last battle just because it scared him... That was the Mat of The Fires of Heaven. And that Mat has moved on. There were better reasons to have him end up in Ebou Dar, and the choices made here transgressed six books of Mat's character arc. Ugh.<br /><br />2. The very ending--I meant the stuff revealed on the last few pages--how does this happen? By what mechanism? There's really just no explanation. We're just told of the result, but there's no explanation of how. I wanted at least one sentence. ONE, hinting at this. I can come up with explanations, but... it seems like Rand EXPECTED this to happen, and how did he know? What did he do to make it happen?<br /><br />3. In some ways, I felt like there was too much action in this book--like I never got a chance to rest. This last might be my fault for reading it straight through in one big gulp. I'll have to go back and reread it in a more leisurely fashion. Not that I think it could have beendone any differently--not without making this monstrosity even LONGER--but it still felt like I was falling down a hill the whole way reading the book, falling without having a moment to catch my breath.<br /><br />All things told, I give this book somewhere around 4.5 stars--with so many five star sections that I want to round up--but Mat is my favorite character, so...<br /><br />And hey, Brandon Sanderson? On the very off chance that you're reading this, you did good. Thank you so much for giving me closure for a series that I read, reread, and reread until my books were in tatters, and for doing it in style. I can quibble with individual choices you made, I'm sure, but you did an amazing job. I'm a huge fan.<br /><br />Final note: I'm bothered by the lack of ebook, too, but let's have some perspective--not having an ebook version available is not NEARLY as bad as those middle books filled with arm-crossing, braid-tugging, and aimless wandering through snow-covered forests.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Not the best written, but very important to our recent past and current world situation.  Hats off to these dedicated military heros.
B0030IIZ1A|5.0|As a first time buyer of dvd's online, I was so pleased with how fast I received this product and even more impressed to find that it was an &#34;original&#34; and not a bootleg:) I will definitely bur from you again.. Thank you
B009ZQ8FQG|2.0|Audio was out of sync.  Was not worth $1.99.  Would not recommend it. I hope future video purchases are better.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like having tons of games all in one app it really keeps u from getting bored. its a must have!!
0786168765|5.0|This book is long but what an incredible tale,  love it on tape.  The audio book reader is awesome.  The book gives you a great sense of Bombay and India!
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Cute story from a different perspective... it was a nice easy read! I'm not into race car driving so sometimes there were chapters about that only so I would get a little bored...but those chapters were real short and got the story picked back up right away!
B005UG542S|5.0|Note: I just saw this movie with XFinity On Demand in 3-D.<br /><br />I just finished watching HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS PART II, and I'm very impressed with the entire saga. I saw three of the first four movies last month via XFinity On Demand & one on television, and the final four films Monday, Tuesday and today (I saw the fifth film on Monday, the sixth film on Tuesday and the II part conclusion in the morning & afternoon today). As I was watching the first movie, I could see why Ms. Rowling chose to go the way she did as per the romantic relationships in the books. I was even more impressed when I saw how much a close friend of mine resembles Ginny in the movies. It made me think about her a lot. There's a scene late in the sixth film that I really like, because it reminded me that she is that way with me as well. In the films, Ginny is never mad at Harry, and the scene in the sixth movie is which reminds me of it just so moving I nearly cried.<br /><br />Of course, the books provide more information, and much of it was omitted from the scripts. A loss, though the decision to excise key points of plot & exposition was made for time constraints. I'm glad that the scene in the fifth book where Harry smashes Dumbledore's office in a fit of rage did not make it into the script, as I really hate that scene.<br /><br />I recommend the films. Great acting, good storylines and wonderful scores.<br /><br />Rated PG & PG-13 (intense sequences of action violence, frightening images and brief mild language).
B005P06AAO|5.0|I love this show! The disk was in awesome shape. It arrived to me how I thought it should. Great purchase!
B003AVPV1O|5.0|what can you say. one is on the computer the other is on the tv. works just fine. would recomend
B008UG0JJI|5.0|One of the fabulous live performance ever!She is absolute brilliant!The key word about the other  two musicians ,Anthony Jackson and Simon Phillips  is:perfect!
0765325950|5.0|Having picked this series up in 1999 and having read most of the books (with the exception of the final two) multiple times, I can say that Sanderson has done an excellent job with a Herculean task. At times I thought this book was set more at a macro level, but the reality is that this is the only way it could be finished.<br />14 books, 10,000+ pages, thousands of characters - I don't think we will see its like again. For those that wonder about some plot parts seem skimpy - I thought the section on Padan Fain / Mordeth / Ordeith was weak - give some thought to the size of the task and the desire to get it done.<br /><br />Congratulations to Mr Sanderson and Mrs Jordan for the finish.
B0015DROBO|5.0|The book is filled with hooks and twists - the beginning can be slow to get into because it is laying down the foundation for the rest of the book. Definitely worth the read!
B002FRNCG0|5.0|Brand New Eyes is my favorite Paramore album, so glad I have a physical copy now! The condition was great, no issues. Smelled great too (still does) :)
0374532990|5.0|I read about the High Line project several years ago in a murder mystery.  During a recent trip to New York I was able to visit the High Line and found it fascinating.  The authors did an exceptional job of presenting their respective stories about their project to develope the High Line.
159102594X|5.0|For those of you who like their fantasy dark and with a touch of grit -- this is a very, very, very talented author. Well worth the time I invested in it.
B005HJWWW8|1.0|This does NOTHING to improve your sound. Just picture those previously set amplifier settings that you can click through on your TV, yep, that's what this is.<br /><br />Junk.
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|This movie was super predictable and not funny in the slightest way. Save your money, there are far better movies to watch!
B00513HXE2|3.0|An amazingly slow piece of work that takes forever to get anywhere, and makes you wonder why you got there. Yet somehow the random good scenes with Qui-Gon make it somewhat interesting. It seems at times to be a mix of random books jammed together, each a little bit interesting but together not very satisfying.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|MIB 3 ask the questions, Answered the questions, and take you on a ride from  A to Z or J to K. much better than I hoped.
0425263916|5.0|im looking so foward to read this book. i cant waity to read where the characters are going to be in the book.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|Loved the special effects and CG, great cast. I wonder why it got such bad reviews in general I thought it was very entertaining for an action movie.

B0049VZ222|5.0|I heard my colleagues at work talking about this every week and I thought &#34;meh!, zombies, not my cup of tea&#34;  Here I am having watched the whole 1st season! Love it!
B001706I5I|5.0|I love this movie. I'm very found of the original cartoon version but jim carrey is awesome in this remade classic
B00APUYWYA|4.0|It is not an Oscar winning production but it was very entertaining and cute. Nothing wrong with some silliness. Want a good laugh, watch this.
B0063GORYU|4.0|This is a great app for a spider solitare addict, but obviously not as good as pc versions. Still it is worthwhile and enjoyable
B004J4WNL2|4.0|I wish I had read this book 30 years ago.  Would have helped me through years of questioning myself.  Am giving to my wife to better understand our \\"shy\\" child.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|Found it to be very suspenseful and liked watching it because it made it easier to recognize the characters in the second series!
B008XG1X18|5.0|i love pinterest! the app is fantastic. i love being able to share stuff from my phone or kindle to my boards. I pin projects I'm working on, projects I want to work on, stuff for my daughter, school stuff, party planning, recipes, books I want to read... and I keep coming up with more ways to use this wonderful service.
0375507256|5.0|Many wonderful reviews here that capture the essence of the story and acknowledge author's phenomanal effort. Missing only is recognition of how David Mitchell changes not only the spoken but written language, even punctuation, to reflect the growth--or devolution--of English over time. That is why it is not sufficient to merely view the dramatization; reading the written words is a must. David Mitchell is a multi-faceted genius.
B004P12SSW|4.0|I liked the progression of the movie and I further liked that it showcased everyone but Cher.  As a seasoned actor and performer, I like that it showcased the newer talent and stayed true to the store.  Of course Stanley Tucci makes everything worth a look.
0812982622|5.0|This is the ultimate feel-good book. Meaning, whatever you perceive your lot in life to be, you'll feel better about it upon reading. If I'm drawing effect ahead of cause, it's because I found them to be indistinguishable from one another: Adam Johnson's second novel is one big, extended impact.<br /><br />He throws you into the story like onto a moving crazy train, though the first part about the ascent and deep fall of title character Pak Jun Do is a traditional, relatively levelheaded tale of adventure. Its tug is irresistible, and a long passage at sea is especially powerful, with one terrific scene that drives home what patriotism, pure and proud, really is. It's when support and courage are needed, in brief, in trouble you know a hero. Our main hero does some horrible things, he does some good things, and when he gets into BIG trouble, our spirit sinks with his.<br /><br />It's the second, twice-longer part, where some stylistic pyrotechnics come in and the breakneck events truly derail. Truth in fiction is a discoursable subject, and in a novel set in \\"modern\\"-day North Korea (with a fateful detour to Texas) it is more acute than in others. I'd use the word \\"dystopian,\\" if the definition didn't require an imagined place, and North Korea, with all it stands for, is real. How real is left to some imagination by necessity, as those who ought to show and tell can't or won't. From this twisted perspective it makes sense, then, that the three narrators in this section are all more unreliable than the next: a brainwashed, nameless police interrogator of the enhanced kind; his favorite victim impersonating a markedly vicious military figure who may or may not be gone for good; and, lastly, the broadcasts forced into every space in the country of the regime-sponsored Best North Korean Story.<br /><br />It's impossible to do justice to all layers of complexity in this work. As in Arabian Nights, there's the lifesaving aspect of fabulation, there is suspense, there is love. I don't recall ever having preferred politics and fighting to love in literature, but here I am. In another humble admission, to once more borrow from the Telegraph, I tend to underrate plot as subservient to idea, the deep musings devoted to the human condition. I stand corrected. There is character study and human condition galore here, but it's the good old basic question of \\"what happens next?\\" that drives reading to the point of neglecting normally not negligible duties.<br /><br />Sure the plot's ludicrous. But there's good ludicrous (Kafka, Pynchon, just so I name him) and bad ludicrous, for which I'm not the arbiter, but people who are think there's a lot of it. Johnson extracts feeling from, and for, his bad guys, including now-late superbad guy Kim Il Jong himself. He's smart within his wacky world, and Johnson gives him a solid rhetorical leg to stand on. He veers into caricature only with the loudspeaker bits, and it's so deliberately hilarious that it leaves an awful unease of wonder about how close to the real deal it gets.<br /><br />Reality might be elusive. For awareness, though, does it matter how many foreign citizens were kidnapped, how many own citizens starved, subject to bogus trials, falsely incarcerated, tortured and killed, as long as there's been one, and it has? Is it crucial for conscience which exact methods the secret police use to break body and mind, or whether someone heads for the gulags for life or only 15 years, or if they lose all toes to frostbite or only five?<br /><br />I can't promise that you'll like this book, but I can guarantee it will make you reevaluate.
B003JHKORK|4.0|I like it when the story line is NOT &#34;reality TV&#34;!  Thanks for fantasy, escape, and a good watch.  Fun to watch.
B008FRFN7A|1.0|It installed fine, recognized my printer, but wouldn't print.  I kept getting an error message and just didn't have the time to figure out what was going on.
B00936A0RU|5.0|Living in Southwest Virginia it's nice to see movies about our heritage coming out in theaters nowadays. I've read terrible reviews about the movie, but after watching I cannot see why. Hardy does a wonderful job portraying Forrest Bondurant and even though he doesn't talk a lot throughout the movie you'll grow to love his character quite quickly. Shia Labeouf really sheds his real world image and surprised me in this movie. You see his character grow right before your eyes and I was quite surprised by his performance. My only problem with the characters is the directors decision to only briefly have Gary Oldman make appearances. However, for his limited screen time he does a great job as the likable villain. Many people have said Guy Pearce did a wonderful job in this movie and if I liked him as an actor perhaps I'd agree, unfortunately I am not a fan.<br /><br />-Excellent character development in the movie that covers the entire cast.<br />-Near nonstop action with a story that really keeps you interested.<br />-Some surprising gory moments that will make any man cringe.<br />-Short full frontal nude scene(just a warning for the parents).<br /><br />Even if it's just a rental, everyone should check this movie out.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|I enjoyed this book. While some editing and replacing a few words with the correct word would be helpful,all in all I liked the story. It is just a shame that the sequel is not out yet.
B00009RAJJ|5.0|This two disc CD was basicily treated like something not worth buying back when it was issued after mega hit album Rumours. I owned this on cassette back in the day.I've always loved it and I'm so glad I was able to find this deluxe edition.Tusk was a classic before it time if you don't own this Fleetwood Mac work of art than I highly reccomend that you buy it to discover what your truly missing.A classic before its time......TUSK..........
B005LAII8A|5.0|All time travel movies will have inherent inconsistencies.  Just go with it, the movie is enjoyable on its own terms.  I won't spoil it by giving you the plot, there are so many reviews out there that tell you the whole megillah.
B009AMANH4|5.0|I saw this movie opening day in theaters.  I was blown away by the movie and as a person that loves history, I was impressed.  There has never really been a great movie about our greatest president, and this truly does justice when portraying Lincoln and the last few weeks of the American Civil War.  The movie does run a bit long (amazon says 120 minutes, its 150) but content is the ultimate factor, and not one scene should be taken out.  I bought this movie on blu-ray the second it was up for preorder.  I take care when choosing movies, and this without a doubt deserves a place in my collection.
6305428042|5.0|My granddaughters (age 8 and 6) asked for the movie, and have watched it several times, as have I.  The acting and production values are top-notch, the story is cute not scary.
B00AAX68HG|1.0|When I saw that this was from the makers of Cut the Rope, I was expecting so much more. I didn't really understand the game and it didn't really find it entertaining. Sorry.
0345803493|5.0|This book series is extremely addicting. Once I started the first book I became obsessed with knowing what happened to Anastasia Steele.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this site to start with, but the App is great! Displays wonderfully on the screen and makes viewing pins and boards effortless and fun. Thanks!
B000O8OTNC|3.0|Based on the reviews I read, I expected this thing to be the cat's PJs but it is just OK in my opinion. It is useful for sharpening in the field based on its small size but it is certainly no substitute for larger sharpening stones at home.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Works very well with the device and is super fun! My boyfriend loves this game so I knew I had to check it out. It's addicting and I'm glad they have so many levels available to keep users interested / busy.
B00932AA5G|5.0|Initially, I was bummed that it was subtitled because I was tired when I ordered the movie on my kindle and didn't want to have to read to understand the movie.  That didn't end up being a problem because the movie is really exciting and entertaining so it kind of woke me up..
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was a very good book.....it had me in tears @the end. I have to read the next part: book 2
B009GEEMLY|4.0|It's hard to say why I give this film 4 stars when all I can think of is the negative. Not being a 15 yr old boy, I found the frequency and length of the fight scenes boring. The dialog for Tony Stark is smarmy to the extreme. It does not make the Stark character funny, edgy or quick witted but actually makes him obnoxious and very unlikable. As a matter of fact, the only Avenger I did like was The Hulk. Mark Ruffalo as Dr. Bruce Banner is wonderful. I also think Tom Hiddleson is outstanding as Loki. Samuel L. Jackson chews up the scenery, as usual. Thor is boring. Captain America is extremely trite.  Scarlett Johansson as the Black Widow is very good as an actress. Unfortunately, she does not have much screen time. So how on earth can I give it 4 stars? Because, above all that, it was entertaining. It looks vivid and fun on screen and while after having rented it for 48 hrs I was not tempted to watch it more than once, nor would I purchase it, I was fairly well entertained for 155 minutes.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I have read all the Diary of a whimpy kid books and they are so good I was so excited about this book, and let me tell you it wasn't a disappointment either I enjoyed it but that's my opinion you just have to read it yourself!!!!
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|I have fallen off being a big Disney fan, of late. I think the superior movie making skills of Dream Works has spoiled me. That said, Brave has gone a long way in redeeming Disney in my eyes. I rented it mostly because it features three of my favorite actors with Emma Thompson doing a lovely job as Queen Elinore and Billy Connelly as King Fergus and Julie Walters as the Witch. Kelly MacDonald is spot on as Merida and Craig Ferguson and Robbie Coltrane are wonderful, as always. It's visually stunning and the celtic music is wonderful. The story is as unbelievable as...well, Sherik, but hey it is a cartoon, ( I mean &#34;animated feature&#34;)~eye roll~. I thoroughly enjoyed this charming movie and intend to buy the 3D version.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|This book had the same flow as many of Philippa Gregory's earlier books. I become emotionally involved with the main character and could not stop reading.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Out of everything in this book, I most liked the footnote, \\"I love you, mom,\\" at the end. Very nice.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|awesome show. never have missed an episode since season one episode one! I have 1-6 on DVD:) and a couple books.

B006LSZECO|3.0|Started out slow but hang in there it gets very exciting.  There are a few surprising twists!  Leaves you with a smile in the end.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I love it _ when you master three on a. row you get bee challenges and tools that you can store and used when you feel the need to.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Yet another Angry Birds game that will keep you occupied in a good way.  Keep up the good work, guys!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved every second of this book, however, I feel it left me guessing some. I wish it talked more about peeta and katness's relationship o r what happened to Gale. Overall tho, amazing
B009NXV2RK|3.0|I enjoyed the book, but it wasn't up to the standarrd of previous Clancy books and he is not preparing his plots as thoroughly as his earlier books. I think he is now complacent with his success.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|If you like the genre of &#34;Bring It On&#34;, then you'll like &#34;Perfect Pitch&#34;.  Story revolves around collegiate acapella groups, all competing for a coveted prize.  Includes themes from &#34;Bring It On&#34; with a little &#34;Romeo and Juliette&#34; thrown in.  Totally predictable and a real no-brainer, but I still liked it!  No Oscars for acting but the music and dancing was fun.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great story!!! Must read!!! Finished in 3 days couldn't put down!!!! Would have finished in 1 day but had to work!
B0070Y46UY|2.0|Ok so there was a lot of hype about this movie coming put about a boy a boat and a tiger. I prefer to read the book from which movies are lately being made from before I actually see the movie. However I think this movie might just be better than the book. Way too many chapters about nothing. A slow read. Very boring to tell you the truth. I kept waiting for something, anything, to happen.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love this book you should buy it I was up till 1 in the morning trying fitness it with all of its suspense you really should get it!!
B00005JPCF|1.0|This movie was very disapointing... not only did it show up in a standard CD case instead of a DVD case but most importantly, It never played  properly... It would get stuck and pixalate and then skip... we would try skipping a section and it would continue... to the point we might as well not watch it at all... It would have cost me more to have it shipped back than what it was worth... I was sad, because I loved this movie and was getting it for my daughter...
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really love this game. But I think I should warn anyone thinking about downloading this game it is highly addicting.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|Wonderful movie!! Very fun!! My daughter loves all of the bright colors and fun story! So glad we got this one!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Some people say this app is &quot;Not worth the money.&quot; They are wrong. I have a little comment for them....GIVE IT A CHANCE! Thank you for your time.
B009T3AHDE|5.0|of something I followed the making of was very satisfying. The people Cronenberg is able to have appear in his films is wonderful. Everyone  is good. It's unusual and entertaining. Paul Giamati and Rob Pattinson's last 20 minutes or so of the film is great.
B005USZYDU|5.0|I love the book! I am a pre teen and I think of myself as a kid my dad likes the author and recommended the book to me and I know that this book is for kids and I would recommend it to kids. I read some of the reviews and they said that they didn't like it, but they also said that they are not kids it was written for kids and all kids I know that have read it loved it. including me. I don't know about adults because I don't know an adult that's read it but it looks like some adults don't like it and some do. I also don't know about young adults I just know I give this book 5 out of 5 stars great book.<br /><br />please excuse all my grammar and errors
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Nicholas Sparks never disappoints me!  He had me waiting until the very end to find out if Amanda and Dawson were going to get back together.  Never saw the ending coming!
1423113462|5.0|This was a gift for my nephew and he has enjoyed reading it. he has not recieve other books from this author
B0000AQS6R|5.0|Even the traditional National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation marathon which is on every holiday season isn't enough viewing for this movie.  I have a copy in Houston at my house, but am in California for a while.  I couldn't live without the movie.  I watch it all year long.  Chevy Chase has never been funnier, and the cast is soooo perfect.  If anyone has any holiday depression over anyone and anything, this movie makes life a lot more cheerful!
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This was a gift for my nephew. He had seen the movie in the theater and wanted to watch it again
B0094BB4TW|4.0|all had a poo up for Bingo that continued to open before Facebook not able to get if to stop therefore removing the app and will try to reinstall
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book is amazing! I usually don't like sci-fi, but the stories woven in this book are gripping and keep you turning the pages into the wee hours of the night. I hadn't read Stephen King for about 10 years, but I am very glad someone suggested I read this!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Excelent app. great to take notes on the go. And plus, its free and sexy!  Download it and enjoy. dont miss it
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Cute and fun and easy to spend way too long playing this game. Easy to do, but be sure to turn on parental controls so you don't end up buying $40 worth of gems you were not expecting.
B009KHCT94|3.0|This is a B movie with a B plot and B acting.  If you want a Nazi B movie, this might be for you.
B0034JKZ3G|5.0|I had been looking for this everywhere and I found the best price here! This was a gift for someone and they loved it!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Just wish it had been a bit longer. However, it was entertaining enough that it was hard to believe this was an app rather than a PC game. I'm going to look into more games from this developer.
B006BG7RI0|5.0|This is perfect for any movie enthusiast! It comes with so many extras and you can't really beat the deal!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|17-year-old Sky Davis has a bad reputation. She and her best friend Six are labeled as whores for the fact that they sneak guys into their bedroom windows at night. Sky merely kisses them, but only to feel the numbness that sets in each time one of them touches or kisses her.<br /><br />Sky has never felt anything with a boy, until Dean Holder.<br /><br />From the moment the two see each other, sparks fly. Holder makes Sky feel things she's never felt before, and does it without even a touch. This is something Sky finds terrifying. After asking her best friend about him, she finds out he has a dark past and decides to avoid him for her own good.<br /><br />But Holder is relentless. Sky finally caves to his charms and forms her own opinion of him, and that opinion is this: Dean Holder is passionate--passionate about life, love, and the people he cares for. Sky needs passion in her life, and Holder is just the one to give it to her.<br /><br />  \\"I want you to keep them open...because I need you to watch me give you the very last piece of my heart.\\"<br /><br />The problem is, Holder knows more about Sky than he lets on; things Sky herself has long forgotten. A secret so massive and horrifying that it'll rock the foundation of Sky's life forever.<br /><br />- - -<br /><br />Where do I even begin with this? Even thinking about the book makes me want to burst into tears all over again. Sigh.<br /><br />Okay, I guess I'll start someplace safe and talk about the characters and all their glorious glory. Sky. Ohhhh, Sky. I love her! If ever there was a strong heroine, Sky is it. If I was put in the position she was, I'd of fallen apart. Sit-in-the-corner-sobbing-forever type falling apart; complete breakdown. Did our protagonist do that? Heck no! She cried for an evening, took charge of the situation, and decisively took action. She was brave and inspiring. It was a true honor to read from her perspective.<br /><br />Holder. Dean Holder. Sizzle! Misunderstood bad boy, broken soul, passionate, drop-your-panties sexy. This guy takes the cake on broody bad boys. He's not just temperamental, he's got a reason for it. He isn't just overprotective or jealous. He's experienced his own tragedies in life and deals with it the only way he knows how. Little does he know, he's the key to Sky's past, and she is the key to his future. Together, these two make quite the pair. They're full of passion, wit, and chemistry. They are a world unto themselves; living and loving with abandon. They are beautiful.<br /><br />The plot is something that you just can't put into a review. Not only would it spoil the story, but it just can't be done justice. You have to read it for yourself. But I will say this: this plot is a heavy one. Don't go into this book expecting a light, fluffy romance. It's anything but. It is romance within a tragedy. It's sadness. It's anger. It's hopelessness. It's a tear-jerker and it'll leave your heart in pieces on the floor--and you won't even want to pick them up. Sky thinks she knows about her life, but she doesn't even know who she is. She's lived a lie for the better part of her life. Ever heard the story of Pandora's Box? Holder is the one to open up the box that is Sky's past. Once that happens, her entire world crumbles down around her. What's left after that? Hope.<br /><br />Hoover leaves us plenty of clues to this big revelation, trust me. You can see a piece of it coming, but the rest will completely blindside you. There's not just one twist to this story, but many. You may want to grab a blankie or teddy bear to cuddle with when you read this one. It's not pretty. It's ugliness wrapped in pain wrapped in betrayal wrapped in sorrow. Emotional rollercoaster.<br /><br />The bright spot? Holder. In Sky's sea of pain and confusion lies Holder. An ever-present figure of strength and love; a constant in her life. And does she ever cling to him like a life raft.<br /><br />  \\"I swear I will spend every last breath thanking youfor allowing yourself to love me.\\"<br /><br />Without a doubt, these two will be my favorite couple of 2013. I don't even have to read another novel to know it. I feel bad for any other book I read this year. Hopeless is going to be an impossible act to follow. The connection between these two characters is tangible. It breathes. It's sparkling and beautiful. I just want to reach out and touch it. ♥ Sigh. Just read it. You have to read it.<br /><br />Colleen Hoover's writing is impeccable. Her attention to detail is astounding. I love her ability to interweave so many plot twists with flawless perfection. Her words are enchanting and her stories are life-changing. Every single scene will suck you in and leave you feeling completely drained in the end. Reading one of her novels is an honest-to-God treat. I could cry right now simply because I don't have anymore Colleen Hoover to read. *sniffles* :(<br /><br />Overall, I just cannot put my love for this book into proper words. My review sucks because this book is just too fantastic for me to even convey it. I strongly urge you to just go buy it. It's worth every penny and then some. Hopeless is a flawless story of love, loss, deceit, passion, tragedy, and most of all... Hope. Hope for a broken soul. Hope for the future. Hope for forgiveness. Hope for a new love. Hope for a little girl whose life was ruined by the one person she trusted most. This story will take hold of your emotions and wring them out 'til your completely dry. You'll laugh and you'll cry. Like me, you'll find it impossible to put down once you begin, but impossible not to at others. There are pieces of this novel that deserve a moment of silence afterward. It's truly something amazing. Colleen Hoover know how to write. The characters. The romance. The plot. The revelations. The ending. It was the absolute most perfect book I have ever read. Whatever you are reading now, just STOP. Put it down. Read Hopeless. It's a book you simply cannot miss. It will stay with you for the rest of your life.<br /><br />*Ages 17+ only!

0765325950|1.0|Unreal... No ebook version.  Wish there was something we could do to voice our displeasure.. oh, wait.. we can use the interweb.  Not that it would do a lot of good, but I will certainly now not buy it, and I will just \\"borrow\\" a copy from somewhere else now...
B002LFAHBO|5.0|This is a great movie...contains a little of everything and the story develops nicely without any boring deadspots in it. It's especially nice to watch during the holiday season.
0765325950|1.0|This one star review is strictly in protest of the E Book delay.  You don't protect an author's legacy of consecutive  Bestsellers by hurting the fans (and trees).
B0063IH60K|4.0|Loaded on Kindle Fire &amp; it works fine especially since it was free.  Ads are easy to skip and are small anyway.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|the best game ever made even better than temple run and more you need to get this app it is so awesome
B00321MGPG|5.0|Planet earth is an incredible series. Watching explorers discover this amazing earth we live on with such clarity and informative explanations on what's being unveiled is quit astonishing.
B000641D2Y|5.0|My fave of the HA series... Kevin is so funny and has every right to be the way he is with that terrible family he has, what kind of father runs in front of his child at an airport and doesn't even looks back... and I can relate when some family members put other family members (like the uncle and his fam) before you... poor Kevin always got the short end of the stick.

B004UXUX4Q|5.0|Fantastic  A chick flick that men also liked.  The scenery was beautiful and the music was authentic.  I also bought the C D to listen to in my car.
B006JD48NM|4.0|The info is nothing that isn't available elsewhere and is not new for the serious F1 fan.  However, having all in one place is nice.  Some of the race footage is too choppy for my taste.
B00030ERII|1.0|What I mean by that is I can't play the D.V.D. It was the Europeon verssion. I have returned it. Please send me the correct one.<br />I live in the U.S.
B002BWP49C|5.0|It is an excellent installment of the Twilight series. Full of drama as usual, and I really enjoyed all the extras on the disc. The documentary was very interesting to watch.
0307744434|4.0|I have very conflicted feelings about this book. When I first started reading it I was not a fan. I didn't like the different perspectives, I didn't like that the author seems to find herself so clever, and I thought it felt very slow. But there were also things I liked. I really enjoyed both Celia and Marco's characters, I actually really liked the magic aspect which really surprised me, and I even came to like many of the supporting characters (the Murray twins, the clockmaker, Isobel).<br /><br />But even with all of the good things I still can't say I really enjoyed the book. I liked the story, I loved the rich descriptions, but it was just too subtle for me. I actually think I would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't read the description. After reading the description I pictured a much more fast-paced, direct book, but it wasn't like that at all. The battle that Celia and Marco are fighting is never explained and if you hadn't read the description (and I think most people read descriptions before reading books so I don't think I'm spoiling anything) you don't even find out it's a battle until the death until about 80% of the way through the book.<br /><br />I also hated, with a strong passion, the passages that were written as though the reader was walking through the circus. I found myself skimming those parts. Then I got to the final one, after I had decided that in the end I actually liked the book, and that was just the worst. I wish I hadn't read it, it annoyed me so much. But I hated the way the book ended overall. I'd say from about halfway through I really found myself getting it to and then, after the big moment, it totally just petered out and was so disappointing.<br /><br />All that said it's an immensely creative book and I have a lot of respect for that. I really enjoyed the idea of all these tents in the circus and I thought the descriptions of them were amazing. And, much to my surprise, I found myself identifying with the idea that there is magic all around us and that people just don't believe in it/know how to harness it. In the end I even enjoyed many of the different perspectives as they allowed readers to get a better feel for the circus and how/why it functions. But, in the end, I still can't really say I enjoyed the book.all around us and that people just don't believe in it/know how to harness it. In the end I even enjoyed many of the different perspectives as they allowed readers to get a better feel for the circus and how/why it functions. But, in the end, I still can't really say I enjoyed the book.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book is hard to put down. Not the ending I wanted but it was still very good. If you enjoy time travel, Love story and a good twist you will enjoy this book.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I always like to watch Columbo Detective series.<br />Good quality DVD both pictures and sound.<br />Good clean story.  No gory scenes.
B000SW4DH6|5.0|nice to have this film on demand. Plays well with good quality. Will look into using Amazon for more on demand viewing.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Nice story.  No violence.  Very good acting.  I highly recommend this DVD.<br />Good quality DVD in terms of picture and sound
B005LAIHSG|3.0|The parts that you see in the previews are 1/2 of the best parts of the movie, the actors were okay but the story line was lacking, the queen's lines sucked and I am still shocked that there are &#34;rumors&#34; or confirmation of a 2nd one being made.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|This movie started out a little slow in my opinion, but definitely picked up the pace about 20-30 minutes in. In my opinion, the storyline had changed enough that it lacked some of the punch of the trilogy centered around Jason Bourne rather than Aaron Cross. Other members of my family absolutely loved it, so take my review with a grain of salt, of course.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I played through all of the games when I got my Droid.  I was thrilled that I could get it also on my Kindle!!
B00AAX68HG|4.0|It can sometimes take 3-4 swipes to get the critters to move. Fix and I'll buy and give it 5 stars.    Edit: v1.1 (with \\"City Tour\\" level added), is now up on Play store. When is it coming to Amazon?    [...]
B00002N9ER|1.0|A most useful product, thanks for the good deal.  Just a thought why not include them in any large Maglite sale.  Just a thought.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It kept me engrossed from beginning to end. I know there will be a sequel. I can't wait.
B0052GACNM|5.0|Tony has mastered singing within the range his voice allows, given his age, and sounds terrific. Equally important, each arrangement manages to highlight the positive virtues of each singer's voice. Makes for a great, diversified album. Made me go back and buy every album in the series.
B009WMWWU8|5.0|Does a nice job of drawing graphs for quadratic equations, which is all I used it for. Graphs can be zoomed in or out. Haven't tested all the other functions.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|We watch this movie every Christmas season but we only had it on vhs and our vhs player finally broke. Now we're back in business!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Just as good as the first one. Just as addictive too. I couldn't help but get absorbed into this book.
B00407PNWO|5.0|True acting.  No graphic violence, drugs, sexual absurdities are needed to entertain like today's hollywood requires.  An era that today's hollywood writers cannot comprehend.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The perfect ending for the series. Had a sad moment when the cat came back. Love the ending. Will definitely re-read.
B004GYY714|5.0|Has a huge variety of stations.  Looking forward to using it while traveling (hotels, airports, etc).  Think it will be great to check in on local events.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|Love Love Love Phillip Phillips and this CD!!  I LOVE his recording HOME and listen to it all the time as the rest of the world has been doing!! BUY THIS ALBUM PEOPLE!!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Jaycee is one strong, brave woman to have gone through such a terrible ordeal and then be able to write her own story about it. She sounds like she is a bit insecure now, but then she was never able to have any control over her life. Who wouldn't be insecure. She is on the right track to recovery..one day at a time.  She has the right professional people helping her and one fantastic mother.
0743277465|5.0|I would feel very guilty if I do not write a review on this book because it has taught me so much, brought my learning skill/mindset to much higher levels and shown me the clear path ahead to follow. Every time I reread it, I always find something new and meaningful for my current stage of life.<br /><br />If you are searching for a book that acts like a wise and honest friend, always giving excellent advices for your learning through profound stories, this book is for you.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I enjoy this game very much.  It is very addictive and I can sit and play for lengthy periods of time.
B009XY97VC|4.0|Two Steps from Hell and Thomas Bergersen never fail to impress me. This one however can sound a little more modern the previous ones and I even heard some dubstep in some of the tracks. If one was looking for epic medieval fantasy in previous titles, this may offer a little different taste. Even though this could not beat Illusions (2011) in my opinion, the track like &#34;Breathe&#34; still make it a very good album.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|Im soo in love with this book! Everyone should read it, ive read it 3 times and i still wanna read it again
B001KVZ6HK|1.0|When i got the movie in the mail, at first the box was in poor condition, which i didn't really care for, but when i opened it the DVD was crushed and the cd was scratched inside.  not to mention it shipped very late!
B000F8O35U|3.0|Disk skips so I was disappointed. Fortunately I have a machine to create the issue. In good condition. Thank you.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Again love to watch these at home, because I can pause and do what I have to do. Great price and a lot of action. I have a home theater setup so I get the same effects that I would if I sat in the movie theater.  I have Amazon Prime so that helps too.
B009JBWOU0|4.0|This series never 'slipped' into the sad territory the previous Batman films did after Keaton and Burton left. Although I was sad to see Katie Holmes have to go, much more convincing on a billionaire's arm, the series held up well to the end and was fun to watch, worth the tickets and popcorn. Hope DC/WB can finally get Superman off the ground in the way Chris Reeve promised and delivered (with the first two movies, at least). Why does everything USUALLY go to heck with movie number three?
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Pretty good entertainment. Little long so nice to be able to pause and do some business and not miss any of the movie. reasonable priced and pretty well made. I like jeremy Renner so that helped lift up the rating.
B002ZG981E|4.0|It's really a nice movie and this version is at low cost. However there is another version with a 3d effect in his box that's better. I lost that and bought this one. But, insist, movie is nice, audio and image are well performed in a hi fi system and at low cost.
B0016MJ6T2|1.0|Anyone who bought it doesnt have closed caption or subtitle. I need to know since I am Deaf. Please help me.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I been a fan of Vince Flynn books for years.<br />The details, the suspense, and the way Mitch Rapp speaks...<br /><br />Excellent.<br /><br />Hope to see the Movie soon.....
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I was very pleased with this product
B008S4YZCO|5.0|This is a great game for all ages. The levels are fun, but not overly challenging, and while you have the option of using real money, it's never really necessary. A great way to pass the time.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this game from the simple games to the more challenging! Once you start you won't want to put it down! Two thumbs up!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|As usual Sparks does not disappoint. Nice relaxing read, takes you away from the daily grind. The characters are well written and engaging. The plot is kinda predictable but there is a decent twist at the end. Recommended read.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|As a peer of Harold and his wife I could relate to many of their feelings and situations so well spoken by the author.  It was a good story and kept my interest throughout.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|I would recommend this for anyone who enjoys a good page turner and/or some historical \\"fiction\\" that keeps you wondering. Dan Brown's way in which he set up the suspense made it read just like a movie thriller.  The main character's profession and passion in symbology coupled with the objective to solve a century old puzzle equates to a very entertaining book. Also, the supporting character, noetic scientist, Katherine Solomon, is a great compliment to the race against time thriller.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book was interesting with lots of twists and turns, but it did drag on.  I really disliked the ending.
B000FC10WU|5.0|This is the second Miss Marple Mystery I have read.  Once again Agatha does a great job of keeping the book moving and a surprise ending.  Some mysteries put in filler to make the book longer and hold your suspense, however Agatha gives you little hints in the character's description which had me changing my mind several times.<br />Good read and I will purchase another.
1451695195|2.0|No mention of Jesus at all in this revelation? My discerning inner self is not getting a good feeling.<br />New ageism - more than one way to heaven? No way Jose.<br />Jesus ONLY saves. Eben, you really think you went to a higher level than all other travellers?<br />Only the meek and humble shall inherit the earth.<br />Lets not get into the surgeon God-complex.!
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|I had just purchased prime and thought this was part of the free movies online.  It's not.<br />That aside, I thought the movie went at a slow pace.  Because my speakers on the HP Pavilion are limited I had problems hearing the show but I'm not sure I missed much.<br />The ending was good.  It wraps everthing up very quickly.
B008K5T5AI|5.0|Classic Banks with a fast paced, intriguing story, plenty of intrigue and a nice close look at while bunch of minds. Read it.
0062060562|5.0|My sister said she picked up this book and we usually like the same stuff so I went ahead and got it. I ended up reading the whole book in one night. There are some parts the seem slow ....like most books...however, once you push through it...its SO WORTH IT!!! This book is one of my favorites and ive already talked 3 of my friends into reading it and all of them loved it as well!
B007W8S2MG|5.0|Amazing story, great graphics (especially cut scenes), WONDERFUL professional voice acting, and WELL over a 100 hours of gameplay. Honestly, I could write an essay on why this games so amazing, but I think you would do better off going on youtube and watching any of the reviews on there since they can show you whats so amazing about this game.
0525952926|5.0|I'm ordering the DVDs because I enjoyed reading the trilogy so much. I'm anxious to receive them. I lose myself in the books, seeing the people in my mind etc.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|Amazon video on demand should provide closed captioning on the streaming video.  The sound level in this movie varied so much that we missed the dialogue in order not to be blown out of our seats by the high volume special effects.  Watched it again as a DVD from Netflix with the closed captioning and could understand the plot and sub plots.
0765325950|5.0|This book is hands down the best book of the series in my opinion. It is a strong ending to an unbelievable story that has captivated us all for the last 20 years.
B008KMHFJY|4.0|I really liked this book.  There is just enough intrigue to completely captivate me.  I literally stayed up all night reading.
B0055PMJMW|5.0|My husband really enjoys Michael Connelly's style of writing and this one did not disappoint.  Looking forward to his next.
B00866H7SS|4.0|Finished reading Bared to You and gave it 4 Stars. Crossfire Novels are a great series, I didn't want to put them down.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Very well written. Very enthusiastic fantasy. Maybe to much sex, but it does not annoy me as it does in TV series (where it is boring). And to much violence. But that is the cruel world of that fantasy. I have become addicted.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I totally loved this book... I can't believe it's over, I hope the author comes up with more because she did a fantastic job!
B00AE2KZNQ|4.0|The movie had a good story line and action scenes. Although it was a little violent. I enjoyed watching it.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Delightful and moving renditions of the music from the Motion Picture.  Very enjoyable to hear these accomplished actors sing.  Would recommend the purchase to any lover of the play or the motion picture.
B009SQOGZ2|5.0|It was a very entertaining movie. Fun to watch with my child. The movie was exciting and my child has watched it several times.
0439796636|5.0|Well written, engrossing, heart warming & heart wrenching story. Once I started it, I couldn't put it down. Reading this book provides a deeper, richer story and understanding of the characters than was possible in the film. A book to keep and add to your library - a story any horse lover will treasure.
B00004YX39|5.0|You can't go wrong with the classic group Steely Dan...this one takes you back to the fine Gold and Colombian,lol...a special time indeed...
B00004XQ83|5.0|I purchased this soundtrack as a gift and the receiver absolutely loved it. This was a great buy for the price paid.
B00067BBSC|5.0|This DVD serves as a historical record of a great group...it came with a cd also,what a deal! all of the hits are here and if you love Toto,this is a must have concert...
B00003CXRM|5.0|I purchased this item for someone else, but ended up watching it several times myself.  Great movie and the laughs were endless.  Would definitely recommend to others.
B000002VRZ|5.0|This remastered cd serves as a notice that the Outlaws brand of music will live on in music history...it's all here,and you won't get tired of the musical mastery these musicians employ...a treat to enjoy...
B008QTVNUI|4.0|I just started watching this show and I absolutely love the story line. The only thing I wish was different is the nudity and language. I'm still trying to figure out why people think that a show needs these things in order to be good. The story can stand on its own and I wish they would let it.
B00797MB0O|5.0|Nobody reads long reviews, so I'll try to make this one short.  This is the tale of an alcoholic \\"young teen\\" who searches for her lost youth by trying to reconnect with her high-school boyfriend.  He is, however, happily married.  She is in denial of her alcoholism, her lost youth, his marriage, her lost dreams, and, like many alcoholics, repeats an alcoholic pattern in her life only resulting in further despair.<br /><br />The trailer did not do the movie justice.  The trailer gives the mistaken impression this is, somehow, a comedy.  It isn't.  The character Ms. Theron plays is complex and difficult to analyze.  The protagonist, a partially-crippled, slightly overweight high-school classmates whose locker was next to this \\"prom queen\\" reflects how evil high school can be--wrath so many of us know as coming from the prom queens and \\"jocks\\".  Yet, all over America, high school continue to nominate, and vote for, their \\"mean-girl\\" cheerleading squads and \\"jock\\" Homecoming Kings--only to, in reality, despise them in later years.<br /><br />This is that film.  But, here, the \\"mean-girl\\" really despises herself, her failures, and in reflection somehow seemingly makes amends with her old chubby classmate--only to, in reality, use him to fulfill the same cylical alcoholic spin-cycle.  Her old boyfriend?  Not a major player.  He isn't the story.  She is.<br /><br />It's a great movie.  If you want to retroflex your hatred for high school, reflect on your own failures, and bury yourself in another drink of bourbon, watch this movie.  I'd love to see a high-school literary class rip this one down to its educational basics.<br /><br />And, I dare say, if you're every nominated to be homecoming queen, or prom queen, or head cheerleader, you have just been relegated to being hated the rest of your life.  We all know it, but this movie shows it.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|For all runners or aspiring runners, this is a great book! The recipes are included with the chapters. Scott's life is truly an aspiration for people everywhere.
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|Just enjoyed it great book and the first book I read on my kindle but I just can't wait  to finish inheritance
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love this game. It moves along so well. And I love the card action when you win. I could play for hours.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|If you like dogs or Formula One racing, this book is a must.  A most articulate canine narrates the story, realizing that his tongue and his absence of thumbs are the primary barriers to his becoming human.  He has studied humans, especially Formula One drivers, and is prepared to be a racing human in his next life.  In the meantime, he has to help his family get through all the bumps in their lives.
0765325950|5.0|A satisfying finale. Some plot points could have been elaborated upon, but it's already 900 pages, so maybe I am asking too much. Very cathartic to read.
