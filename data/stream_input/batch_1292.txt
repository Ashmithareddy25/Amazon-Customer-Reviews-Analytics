B0007TKNII|5.0|I've seen the Broadway productions of Phantom of the Opera several times, and was so excited when the movie came out.  Seeing it close up brings things to life and gave me a new perspective, especially \\"The Point of No Return,\\" oh MY!  Now I can see this wonderful production whenever I want.  Love the music, the sets, the costumes, the whole thing!  One of my favorites!
1423136802|5.0|We ordered this set as a Christmas present for our 10 year old daughter.  She LOVED it!!  It's only been a week and she's already on book #2.  We have to tell her to take a break from reading!  Would recommend this series.

3836503050|5.0|The most beautiful collection of pin-up art I have ever seen.  Each piece transcends sex; the poses, the colors and textures evoke a sensual respect for both the power and beauty of the feminine form.  The book is a masterpiece celebration of the human form, and a confirmation of life's promise of discovery, fulfillment, and delicious expression.
B006FLGBGA|4.0|It's a nice movie, i liked to see human emotions on apes. The CGI is very good and blend very well it reality.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|really not a good game. but you kind of get hooked into it. maybe it will get better I only have been playing since last night.
B004LWZW4W|5.0|I thought this was a great prequel. I am not sure what people are talking about with the poor quality. I ordered the Blu Ray DVD from Amazon and with it came the free rental of the movie so I can watch it while I wait for delivery. It was the instant SD version for free so I thought I would watch it (yes I plan on watching the Blu Ray version when it gets here in a couple days) but I didn't see anything wrong with it. When I was watching on my TouchPad I saw the letter box, but it needed to be in order to fit my screen right, but I didn't notice it on my TV...if it was there it wasn't noticeable but I was pretty into the movie. I didn't notice any grainy scenes or backgrounds. Excited to watch HD Blu Ray and the extras once it gets here!
B002DQUP6S|5.0|That is right this is a novel about the history of philosophy. It was written by Norwegian professor Jostein Gaarder. Gaarder Now writes other novels and has a large following. I personally found it fun to read and intriguing.<br /><br />Some readers may think the ending is a little strange however it fits the story perfectly. This novel is used as an introduction point to philosophy. So it would not be appropriate for those that already have a background in philosophy to dismiss this as sophomoric. Everyone has to start somewhere. If you are already a philosopher then it is still an interesting novel with an interesting twist.<br /><br />Receiving a mysterious letter in the mail, Sophie Amundson is about to embark on a mysterious journey that is mosty correspondents and may become mutch more. We get to join her on her discoveries.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001R88C6I The Thirteenth Floor [Blu-ray]]]
0937381888|5.0|Easy to read for the novice, and hard facts for the expert. I found that I am somewhere in between those two positions. The book was given to me in my brew kit, and has served me well. Step by step I was instructed in the fundamentals of both equipment, and ultimately brewing beer itself. It does need a index for future editions for fast finding information.
B004KD5TQI|5.0|I had to wait to see this movie on DVD, and was so impressed with the match of the music to the film I got the soundtrack right away. I wish there was more music on it, but the selection is excellent (except for track 4). This is one of the few soundtracks (along with \\"Great Expectations: The Score\\" from the 1998 film) that may be better than the movie,

0307477479|5.0|This review originally appeared on my blog, which can be found on my site [...].<br /><br />I just recommended this book to one of my beautiful friends.  I've always been rather stunned by a particular kind of physical beauty.  In both men and women.  I'm not talking seduction.  I'm talking a more substantive, sexless, almost holy admiration for the aesthetics in the human production (how it's all put together).  I'm serious.  I've always been this way.  In college, the beautiful boys kept my attention (join the crowd, right?).  As a young adult, I just stared, going to the Met for beauty one day , checking out people on the street for beauty the next.  Despite my own average appearance, I'd marry \\"up,\\" if you know what I mean.<br /><br />So this friend.  I won't fully describe her, since she probably wouldn't like that.  But she's capable of walking into a room wearing the pointiest yellow high-heels you've ever seen and fishnet-stockings with a businessy skirt, button-down blouse, and maybe red lipstick.  If I wore it, people would whisper and point.  Someone would say, \\"What's up with that?\\"  When she wears it, you think, \\"Wow.  That is the most sophisticated, elegant, chic, bold, magical creature ever.\\"  Canary yellow today, fuchsia tomorrow.<br /><br />It's true.  I have a thing for beauty.<br /><br />But this is the real story:  It's not just a physical beauty thing, it's an age thing.<br /><br />Just as I've always been a beauty freak, I've been captivated--okay, obsessed--with aging.  At first, I couldn't wait. While friends still talk with longing about the joy and freedom of childhood--and how great it all was--I always wanted adult experience.  (I'm not sure what I imagined, really.)  Get on with the aging.  Obviously, I didn't get it.  Once the aging starts, it never stops.<br /><br />In college, even though I was happy only a fraction of the time, I was already nostalgic before actually graduating.  My college life was well-documented in photos, scrapbooks, journals; it was filled with intense friendships and wistful moments.  I lamented its passing--and when that life slipped away, I tried to hold on.  I'm still friends with many of the individuals who haunted that era, and I'm still blown away by our adulthood, our marriages and children and mortgages, our skin and hair texture.  As each new phase of life comes and goes, the acute awareness of time has grown, morphed into a full-blown affirmation of a running theme of Jennifer Egan's novel:  \\"Time's a goon.\\"<br /><br />Don't I know it?<br /><br />At first, I didn't like the title, A Visit from the Goon Squad.  I suspected, having no real clue about it or its author, that it wasn't quite up to my snobby literary standards.  (Don't hate me, Jennifer Egan.)  Too trendy, too contemporary, too hip.  But it came highly recommended by a friend who really reads, so . . . .<br /><br />Okay, I loved it.  The novel is about a bunch of interconnected characters, mostly involved in the punk rock industry, who--in one way or another--are shown in light of their pasts, which may involve punk rock in San Francisco, kleptomania in Naples, a lion attack in Africa, or snorting gold flakes, among other things.  There are numerous narratives focused on different characters (though this is a novel and reads like a novel--not like a short story cycle).  They work together to express, ultimately, the weight of time.  There's something especially unique here; Egan doesn't do the usual thing with time:  talk about how the past haunts you for your whole life (though this may be true and, yeah, it's there--doesn't it have to be?).  Rather, she just shows that time is passing and it has its profound effect on our lives.  We change.  We're connected to others with equally profound and passing lives.  Time is, indeed, a goon.  She isn't particularly hopeless at all.  The book is sobering, but sweet.  I wasn't left with a bitter awareness of sagging breasts and bald spots, nor was I reminded ad nauseum of how, as in Bambi (which I just saw again), seasons pass and new babies are born (though there are babies in this book).  There is some of that, but there's more:  it's a portrait of the changes that occur over a lifetime, a picture of changeability, malleability, shifts in our worlds that work together to define us.<br /><br />More profound things could be said about the phenomenon of time, though Egan's portrait is fully satisfying.  More could be said, but she didn't have to say it.  I wasn't super crazy about the \\"slide show\\" she includes in one of the narratives.  But here's my big praise.  Every time--every time--we left one character for another, I was sad to leave him or her.  With each narrative, I was hooked.  The writing was great.  Contemporary, but definitely literary.  Smart writing.  Hip writing.  (Hey, it reminded me of my own!  Tongue is in cheek, okay?)  I like the New York stuff, from the neighborhoods to the attitudes.  I was impressed with some of the emotional landscapes (she describes how one husband, increasingly disaffected by his wife, folded his desire for her in half, and then in half again, and then in half again, till there was nothing left).<br /><br />Alas, it's a good book.  Though it may sound pretty harsh and negative to indict time as a goon, I felt rather happy at the end.  Life changes, but sad things may become happy things, the childless may have children, the lost may get found.  Like the punk rock industry, the music keeps changing.  So, yeah, time is a goon, but there's still good music coming.
B00000J2SR|4.0|Bent Out Of Shape (1983) is a very good Rainbow album that features Joe Lynn Turner on lead vocals.  While nobody, in my opinion, can truly replace Ronnie James Dio as lead singer, Turner does a good job with the material.  His distinctive voice and style of singing fit the music very well.  I feel this album is about as good as the band's previous release, Straight Between The Eyes (1982).<br /><br />Bent Out Of Shape is more commercial sounding than the Dio years, but it does contain some hard rockers, such as \\"Drinking With The Devil\\".  My personal favorite song is the instrumental \\"Snowman\\".  It's a very atmospheric, eerie song with good keyboard and guitar work.<br /><br />Overall, a solid album.  4 stars.
0375701427|5.0|This review originally appeared on my blog, which can be found on my site at [...].    Fifteen minutes for Philip Roth.  That's all I've got, even though I loved this book and spent a couple weeks with it.  Two caveats (like the word \\"literati,\\" I like to use \\"caveat\\" often):  this was my first Roth and I did no scholarly research whatsoever.    So, imagine my pride and joy when I arrived upon--all by myself!--the comparison between AMERICAN PASTORAL and F. Scott Fitzgerald's THE GREAT GATSBY!  Wow!  Look what I came up with!  This is the new GATSBY!      Others thought of this already, I quickly realized.    So be it.  Still.  This is a darker GATSBY.  It is an ugly GATSBY.  Unlike Fitzgerald, it's not breezy, musical, or colorful.  But it's intelligent and so impressive for its narrative depth.  I was completely absorbed in the glove-making process.  This, from a girl whose eyes glaze over at the sight of instruction manuals or the sound of computer talk.  Roth goes on and on about gloves because his characters are glove-manufacturers.  And yet it's breathtaking!    But that's not all this book is about.  It's about the same stuff as GATSBY--though, dare I say, with more complexity, reality, and philosophical depth.  (Hey, please know this:  I love THE GREAT GATSBY.)  This book is later, post-GATSBY.  We're talking post-WWII, nuclear threat, the Cold War, Red Scare, the Vietnam War--up till Watergate and the mainstreaming of porn in the form of DEEP THROAT.  The American Dream had opened up and shut down.  Gatsby, so white and preppie in Long Island, had now become Jews escaping Nazis and poor Irish seeking a Promised Land too.  And forget the Hamptons.  We're in Jersey.  That last, remarkable page of THE GREAT GATSBY is turned and  . . . .    AMERICAN PASTORAL picks up with its own protagonist, Swede Levov.  And its own Nick Carroway too, who tells the story from the sidelines:  Nathan Zuckerman (imagine my own ego bursting when I put this together, thinking I had made an original discovery!).      I, of course, don't ever really \\"review\\" books.  This one intrigued me completely in that it really explores the American psyche.  I can't find the passage, but there's a wonderful one on the loneliness within the heart of humans--the inability to truly find communion with another.  And then he does this--possibly unintentionally:  he spells out the secularization of America.  At the very end of the book, Roth writes a seemingly tangential conversation between Dawn (a former beauty queen--how perfect is that for a symbol of the American Dream?) and Mr. Levov (a nice Jewish man belonging to another era) in which they \\"negotiate,\\" if you will, the marriage between a Catholic and a Jew.  They discuss who gets what:  baptism, bar mitzvah, Christmas, Easter.  But the truth:  it doesn't really matter.      I found the conversation brilliant, and I found myself wondering if Roth knows how brilliant it is.  The American Pastoral disappears as meaning is lost.      One final note.  The end of the novel.  I'm not going to give it away because I really hope you read this book.  But it ends with an interesting scene with an Academic, an intellectual.  At first, I felt that disappointment that comes at the end of a lot of literature because I wanted something else.  But then I found it brilliant.  Feel free to tell me what you thought.      This book also served as an opportunity for me to get into it a bit with my Jewish uncle.  Our family is an American Pastoral in its own right; we've got Jews, Catholics, Atheists, and Protestants.  (Jews who escaped Nazis and Poor Irish!)  Perhaps others?  But my Jewish uncle gave me the opportunity to escape my major summer preoccupation of making peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and applying sunscreen to preschoolers.  We got into it over Roth and the portrayal of Jews.  We touched upon such intriguing topics as Woody Allen, Mel Gibson, and Michael Jackson.  Thank you, Uncle Saul, for the Roth banter.Last night, prior to finishing this book, I read a goofy article on James Franco (Jewish!).  I guess he's behind a new Museum of Non-Visible Art (MONA), in which there's no actual art--just descriptions of it.  James Franco is a post-PASTORAL Renaissance Man--filmmaker, writer, even an Academic--so his MONA is the appropriate finale to these fifteen minutes with Roth.  Franco may be the ultimate postmodern artist, actually.  There is no real art in this museum.    I think Roth saw it coming.

0316056863|4.0|This is originally posted on my blog, which can be found on my website:  [...]<br /><br />When I was driving the kids to school today, my five-year-old daughter--known for her wit--asked, \\"Mommy, can you do anything silly?\\"  Like what?  Stand on my head?  Wear a clown's nose?  What?  (See, I can't even think of anything silly.)<br /><br />My kids will tell you that I don't do silly.  Daddy does silly.  Every night, I read them a story and then we trek into their bedroom, and they literally look for the silly thing daddy has done.  Perhaps the stuffed animals are hiding under covers, behind curtains, on top of the doorways.  Perhaps the stick horses are rodeo-bound in their race for secret closet recesses I simply don't know about.  The girls shriek because daddy--not mommy--is a blast.<br /><br />I'm funny.  Wow, am I funny.  Silly, I am not.<br /><br />For some reason--and I don't fully understand it myself--my writing has become humorous.  (I should say, so my three to four fans know, that Love Slave--book number two--is the really funny one.)<br /><br />I wasn't always so hilarious.  Once, I was a bore.  And then it changed, oddly enough, when I almost died in a car accident, and then--bam!--I was funny.<br /><br />I'm still a bore in person, though.<br /><br />This is most clearly demonstrated in the first phone conversation I had with the editor of Love Slave, who's highly respected in publishing.  I mean, when other highly respected people found out I was working with him (I was the sole seedy person involved), there was a rush of literary enthusiasm.  When he called me on the phone for the first time, he probably expected a regular stand-up comedienne, and--alas--it was just me, trying to quickly swallow my peanut-butter-and-banana sandwich so I could articulate respectable things intelligently.<br /><br />I prefer to exist in print.  Sometimes, though, one is required to speak to others in person and, yeah, that sucks.  Thankfully, I can write a witty line or two.  You better believe that when that first phone conversation ended with my highly respected editor, I rattled off a charming, smarmy, gut-splitting e-mail about copyediting.  Commas and periods!  Stop Now!<br /><br />Four things inspired me to write about humor-writing.<br /><br />First, I just finished Tina Fey's book, Bossypants.<br /><br />Second, I recently read an essay by David Bouchier called \\"The Comic Point of View:  Putting Humor in Your Fiction,\\" in the Julie Checkoway edited anthology, Creating Fiction, and it occurred to me (not without some surprise) that I may actually be one of those comic writer-types.  A humorous writer?  A humor-writer?  I never thought of myself like that.  I still don't, but it interested me nonetheless.<br /><br />Third, I've been an in-and-out-of-the-closet fan of Judd Apatow ever since I saw The Forty-Year-Old Virgin.  I kinda feel weird about liking him so much, since his films can be really raunchy.  (Incidentally, if those of you who know me personally knew who my Apatow-film supplier was, you'd be pretty surprised indeed.)  But I'm going to admit it now:  I'm a fan of Judd Apatow, especially of his Superbad.  There.  I said it.<br /><br />Fourth, I think I recently shared on Facebook an Onion post that was apparently in bad taste, and it got me thinking about one of the purposes--just one--of humor.<br /><br />Let's begin by personally addressing Ms. Tina Fey:  Tina, this will be the best thing you've read about your book.<br /><br />(I like to say those kinds of things in order to set myself up for disappointment when Tina never reads this, when it fails to live up to the promise and thereby launches an inferiority complex, and when others realize I'm all talk and no action).  You hear me, Tina!<br /><br />But, yeah, I've only recently become the hit of the party.  Let's see if this translates well.  I wrote one of my favorite jokes--I write jokes just like Tina!--for the wedding toast of one of my best friends.  Iguess you need to know that my husband is named Tim, and I like to present him as my own personal straight man.  This is a little unfair because he's quite funny himself.  But unlike me, he's private.  AND I'M PUBLIC!<br /><br />So I was the Matron of Honor (Matron!  That's a riot!), and I knew the man who performed the ceremony well.  We'll call him Mad Max.  I said this in my toast: \\"Mad Max has said that Tim and I remind him of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie in the movie, Mr. and Mrs. Smith.  I'm still trying to figure this one out.  Mad Max, is that because of their amazing good looks, or because they were trying to kill each other?\\"<br /><br />Does this translate well, or not really?  Because if I had one particular criticism of Tina Fey's book, it was that her favorite script moments--which were no doubt hilarious when performed on \\"Saturday Night Live\\"--didn't come off that great in writing.  I know how that goes.  So, did my joke work or not?<br /><br />Okay, let's think about my four influences for this post.<br /><br />First, Tina.  I do love when people my age succeed.  There's that.  I tend to read one \\"humor\\" book a year.  I think the most recent ones include Stuff White People Like by Christian Lander and I Am America (And So Can You!) by Stephen Colbert.  This time, I picked up Fey because of these words on the back cover:  \\"Once in a generation a woman comes along who changes everything.  Tina Fey is not that woman, but she met that woman once and acted weird around her.\\"<br /><br />Oh, I love that.<br /><br />Here's another similarity that we have.  We both went on cruises for our honeymoons, and we both fondly remember the towels in the shape of an animal left on your cabin bed each night in lieu of a mint.  Maybe you got a mint too.  I don't remember.<br /><br />And another one!  We both have scars on our faces!  Tina, I have MULTIPLE scars!<br /><br />I think my favorite chapter--I'm gonna make a point eventually--was about photo shoots.  This ishow it opens:  \\"People sometimes ask me, `What's it like to do photo shoots for magazines?'  `Do you enjoy that kind of thing?'  Let me be completely honest here.  Publicity and press junkets are just part of the job.  Your work is what you really care about because your work is your craft and your craft is your art and photo shoots are THE FUNNEST.\\"  And then she details how she'd be taken care of by the stylist's assistant, who \\"will be a chic twenty-year-old Asian girl named Esther or Agnes or Lot's Wife.\\"<br /><br />Why does this crack me up?  I'm about to make a point, I think.<br /><br />It has to do with Judd Apatow and The Onion.  My Tendency To Like Things In Poor Taste.  Am I about to say that Tina Fey's humor is in poor taste?<br /><br />Nope.  What I found especially funny about this chapter and others in her book is that she hones in on something true to human nature.  In this case, it's this desire for attention, this maybe feminine objectification thing in which we-hate-that-sex-symbol-shite-but-want-you-to-want-me-so-we'll-contort-and-pay-homage-to-photoshop.  And let's not forget the authentic details:  pretty Asian girls with Special Names.  The combo is what does me in:  the truth and the detail.  It makes her disarmingly funny.  That is the same exact thing that got me with Salinger's Catcher in the Rye.<br /><br />What about the Asian girl?  Is that offensive?  It is not. But it could be if someone else uttered it.  Tina Fey is no racist, and it isn't even worth discussing.  I'm not advocating that whole thing where people get to say racist things if they're a member of that group or if they have it in good with that group.  I hate that stuff.  What I am advocating is this:  telling the truth is funny.<br /><br />Humor is, then, a truth-telling device.  This is so not original.  Sorry.  I'm thinking aloud, trying to figure out why I like that \\"Lot's Wife\\" business so much.<br /><br />Let me make a confession:  I was a little envious of Fey's ability to make fun of her physicality.  I think many of the people I personally find funny give up this kind of vanity--they make fun of their bodily imperfections.  Their bodies become tools.  And I'm just not there.  I don't like to draw attention to my physical appearance.  You don't believe me, do you?  I mean, yeah, I think I've talked about aging, breasts, et al.  In truth, I'd have a hard time putting myself up for physical scrutiny--and I envy the comedian/comedienne who does.<br /><br />Second, Am I A Humorist?  Is That What You Should Call Me?<br /><br />No, please don't.  I want to be a literary fiction-writer, okay?  That's what I want.  Sure, I'm funny.  Sure, Tina and I both went on cruises, but I'M A LITERARY FICTION-WRITER.  I WRITE LITERARY FICTION.  END OF STORY.  THAT'S IT.<br /><br />No one puts George Saunders in that box, do they?  You don't hear Lorrie Moore pigeonholed in this way.<br /><br />Yeah, I thought Me Talk Pretty One Day by David Sedaris was hilarious.  And, while we're here, I want to pay tribute to one-time Arizona resident, Laurie Notaro.  Laurie, a successful writer (Are you a humorist, Laurie?  What are you?) moved to Oregon, but she used to write a column in the Arizona Republic's weekly entertainment paper, \\"The Rep.\\"  (I hope I have my facts right.)  Laurie, you were the best writer there.  I will now admit that the protagonist of my forthcoming novel, Love Slave, is a columnist--and Laurie Notaro's very, very funny columns did influence me.  I loved her columns and, with others, mourned her departure.<br /><br />But what are you, Laurie?  What do you call yourself?<br /><br />Third, Judd.  I could go in many directions with this.  I could talk about the differences between an Apatow \\"sex farce\\" and others in the theaters--the redemptive ends, the centrality of something tender and sweet, etc.  But it's the Tina thing again:  honing in on something true to human nature and combining it with the authentic detail.<br /><br />I remember seeing that lovely, that perfect, that supreme moment when Steve Carrel, the Forty-year-old Virgin himself, races away on his bicycle while Asia's \\"Heat of the Moment\\" plays in the background.  That's a Lot's-Wife-Moment, if you ask me.  I can't explain it.  But do you see it?  Do you see how funny that is?  Is it me?<br /><br />I love a good Judd Apatow film.  And isn't the sex-stuff; it's the other stuff:  the true moments.  But note something special about Apatow:  his true moments are rendered in a sweet way.  Apatow's people are nice.  It's McLovin' in Superbad.  It's the talk of James Franco's \\"bubbe\\" in Pineapple Express.  It's the Dracula Puppet Opera in Forgetting Sarah Marshall.  These are glimpses into human nature.  I mean it!  I love this stuff!<br /><br />Fourth, my Onion offerings in poor taste.  I recently posted the following \\"news item\\" from The Onion:  \\"Nation's 10-Year-Old Boys: 'If You See Someone Raping Us, Please Call The Police.'\\"  This was, of course, in response to the Penn State child-molestation horrors.  I didn't get many \\"likes,\\" I gotta admit.  Not many folks wanting to laugh aloud about that one.<br /><br />But I will!  Yes, I will!<br /><br />Because I'm a believer.  I believe in Truth, Beauty, and Goodness.  I believe in irony, especially:  its power, its bite, its charm.  And I'm willing to risk poor taste.<br /><br />You know why?  Because that's how strongly I feel about the downright wickedness involved in the rape of children.  And it's not terribly rare for funny people to call us on our obliviousness, our blind eye, our polite deference to good taste.<br /><br />I sound a little incensed, don't I?  I offer a half-hearted apology.  I am a little sensitive about this.  I do draw the line at times.  Here's one little example.  Tim and I were in tears when we watched Borat.  We turned off Brüno.  Too gross.  That said, I'm skittish about quick dismissals of things in poor taste.<br /><br />I guess I should say somethingabout Russell Brand.  Why him?  Because of our recent Brand experience.  I can't really call myself a fan--not like I can with Apatow.  I do think Brand is over-the-top.  I feel pretty Protestant when I hear him.<br /><br />But, one lazy night, Tim and I watched a Russell Brand concert on TV.  (Tim, incidentally, is usually right there next to me on all this stuff; he may not agree with me--I won't speak for him this time--but he's present, okay?)  I'll be honest with you.  It was too much.  Too much sex.  A little yucky.  I kept wanting to make sure the kids were asleep.<br /><br />Though there was this:  He came off as smart (I know nothing about him whatsoever), and one of his jokes was so true, so bitterly true, such a moment of insight into the meaning in life, reflected in a very particular way about what it means to be human, that I felt--momentarily--slayed.<br /><br />I can't repeat the joke, though.  Because it was obscene.<br /><br />Now all I want to do is raise some questions:  Is that insight, that moment of enlightenment, worth the overall obscenity?  How far is too far?  When do you throw the baby out with the bathwater?  What does it mean to go too far?<br /><br />Humor is a freakin' weapon!<br /><br />You know how I like to think of it?  You know those crazy terrorists who use women and children as human shields?  Well, a humorist uses him- or herself in the battle.  They'll expose themselves, standing vulnerable, for the joke.  It may boil down to this:  What Is The Joke?<br /><br />\\"That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore\\" is a Smiths' song, by the way.  And, if this is a book review of Bossypants, perhaps I should offer a little harsh criticism--just a little (besides the translation of the live performance into the written word).  Tina, is this okay?  I mean, I feel comfortable being honest with you, because we're--you and me, You and I--the SAME.  Okay?<br /><br />Like Tina, I too have stood over the kitchen sink eating my kid's dinner till she demandedit back.  Like Tina, I definitely/absolutely/completely/utterly/all-those-words-meaning-\\"fully\\" had the breastfeeding issue presented to me much like the Problem of Good and Evil.  Like Tina, I'm a working mom.<br /><br />It was the Working Mom Thing that gave me pause.  It struck me as, um, well, mildly defensive?  A little guilt-ladened?  Tina, do you hate me?  I don't know--maybe it's me.  I do know that I'm a little hypersensitive when it comes to the topic--so it's not entirely impossible that I'm misinterpreting it.  Because, yeah, I know about Working Mothers and Guilt.  And, boy, am I defensive.  So, well, I kinda recognized myself in you!<br /><br />But here's the thing I'll say about myself, and I'm not sure Tina actually says it:  I work because I want to.<br /><br />There.  So, yeah, I like Judd Apatow films AND I enjoy working.<br /><br />That would be my one (of two) harsh criticism on Tina's book:  I sensed a little defensive tone shift on this topic, and it didn't fit with her overall candor and wit.<br /><br />Tina, if you would like to discuss these things over lunch, please let me know.  Might I suggest a place at which we can get both cheesecake and taco salads?<br /><br />I'll end with another word for Tina:  I know people say you look like Sarah Palin.  Well, ironically, it's been said that I look like you!  (One person said this.)  I don't, of course.  Except for my glasses, and sometimes my hair.  That, and the MULTIPLE slash-like scars on my face.<br /><br />That's in poor taste too, I know.<br /><br />You can order this book by going to this crazy link (I can't figure out how to make it simpler):

B0063IH60K|5.0|if you like solitaire you'll like this. nothing bad to say about it. its easy to use and fun to play. I really like this fun, free app.
B006BDHAX0|2.0|I love to play this game, but usually when I am about to finish the second level of it, it shuts off on me. like 'what the hell?!' but I love mahjong, but this game shuts off on you.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really enjoyed the first book and the second waas in no way a let down. It was a great sequel.
B004ECDNJU|2.0|In this game you need to direct different shades of colors to their correct place, which is not easy if you cannot do it quick enough. If you can distinguish them then this game easy, but still not much fun.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|That was a great read, I have recently finished the second book as well.  I love how this book delves into that one question, \\"What would I do if my life depended on it?\\"  I had to force myself to put it down so I could go to sleep.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this video after having my baby boy. I was used to getting up before work to go run a few days each week but with baby at home, my husband and I had to alternate days to work out. I wanted something I could do from home. Now, I've never been one who is into workout videos or dvds, but I thought \\"I've got to do something! This flab is not going away with my new twice weekly schedule!\\"   So, after a few recommendations from friends who tend to be more into the dvd workout world, I decided to just order it. For 9 bucks, I could give it a try. And I love it!! Like other reviewers have said, it's a pretty fast workout. 3 minutes of strength, 2 minutes of cardio, and 1 minute of abs--do that three times for level 1 and you've gotten your workout in (sandwiched by a warm-up and cool-down). I love that I can had a hard core work out in 20 minutes and feel the rush of the cardio as well as the tightening in my muscles from the strength and abs. And even this tired mom can manage to get up 25 minutes earlier (factoring in time to change and hit play).   Every working mom is looking for an efficient way to get in a good workout--this is it!  None of us want to add more to the full schedule or take more time away from playing with our kiddos. Also, I'll tell you, one weekend, I did the workout after my boy woke up from his nap. He thought it was hilarious, watching me to jumping jacks, sit-ups, lunges...so I don't even think this is something I have to work into a weekend nap schedule or wake up earlier for. And one month in, doing level 1 four or five times a week, I am seeing a difference in my body. It gets addictive. So...go get it. If you want to avoid shipping fees, try Target, too. I ordered mine along with a few other things I needed so that I could get free shipping.   PROS:   Efficient workout (20 min)  Not boring (changes up routine--3 separate circuits of 6 min each)  3 Levels to choose from  Only requires some light hand weights and a small patch of floor(enough to lay out and extend your arms)  CONS:  I wish there were an audio option to turn off the music and keep Jillian's voice.  There is the option for the oposite but I like to turn on my own music and keep her voice coaching me.  That's what I have for you!
B006BDHAX0|2.0|Just as other reviews state it crashed a lot. But was free today so I tried it out. This appears to be more beta software than full version.
B005ZUR724|1.0|Game does not work due to update bug. No fix since the 24th 6 days and no update. Looks good but if you can not play it is a waste of money. If it gets fixed it is worth it. Gameloft customer care is lacking. So beware, you have been informed.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it. I play it every day for hours. some of the games are a little boring but that's because to me they're too easy.
0545265355|5.0|Books have a beautiful story to tell amid all the madness! This trilogy is amazing. Especially enjoyed bookks one and three...In book one, we learn about the Hunger games and feel for Katniss and Peeter both....cannot side on who should win. In book two, my stomach turns upon finding out it truly ISN'T OVER! Finally in book three, there is a realization that Katniss will die or have to choose!....but it takes a surprising twist and this book is full of descriptive action. These books took the edge from the stress of the holidays. They allowed me to slow down and SMELL THE ROSES...ugh! and lol...No pun intended...if you read the Hunger Games trilogy... you will understand! Enjoyed this so much that I am starting on \\"The Maze Runner\\" trilogy! Don't know what to expect next....\\"Hunger Games\\" is a novel with a touch of Sci Fi. A very good mix when you add \\"futuristic (with doom and gloom) along with a touch of \\"love story\\" and you have a wonderfull and anticipating \\"Read\\". Sorry, I am not an English major but I have tried to describe the books as a lay person. If you decide to read \\"The Hunger Games\\", kick back and \\"ENJOY\\"!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Fast paced, great interaction and first class acting.  Just when I think I have the plot figured out in comes another wrench thrown in.  I can't wait till the 1st season comes out in DVD.  I also can't wait for the new season.
B004OBQQPY|1.0|Though it was probably my mistake, this film was in Portugese or Italian without an English subtitle option.  This was not clear at time of purchase.  Aslo, it arrived a day after Christmas, which was within the estimated delivery time (Dec 15?-Jan 18), but still disappointing.
B005CA4SQK|4.0|It was a gift for Christmas / I'm sure he was delighted; shipping was fast and the condition  was excellent.
145551389X|5.0|I love love love this. Mind you, this is not a book with text, beyond the first page. It;s like a sequined photo album. The pictures inside are so real and so raw. I feel as if I am closer to Lady GaGa as a person now. Before, I could only see her as a celebrity and a performer. But this book really hits a home run by showing you the inside dirt and the emotions that you feel through the images don't cease to amaze me. This may be cliche to say, but I understand [[ASIN:145551389X LADY GAGA x TERRY RICHARDSON]]

B000IJ79V6|3.0|I actually enjoyed the First Superman movie more so than this(hold the Brando please),the 2nd one seems more drawn out and even less plausible.(I am aware it is a superman movie,even so.)I do love the Product placement in this one however and that bossybroad hanging out with Zod,What matters most Is Christopher Reeve himself(God Rest his soul)Because Hackman makes a Bad \\"Badguy\\".Still any Reeve Superman is better than none.
B006C45CFG|1.0|The storyline is so weak and disorganized I was embarrassed to be watching this stupid flick. Really felt bad for the actors that took the money to make this ridiculous movie. It is essentially unwatchable.
B000IJ79UW|4.0|The Original Superman while probably looking dated thanks to all the CGI/Special effects of now is still an enjoyable treat,You have Christopher Reeve(RIP-Best Superman,only one I know.)and The Beautiful but ever annoying and selfish Lois Lane,Despite not being a DC guy myself(if I am,I always prefered Batman.)I enjoyed the movie,Hackman makes a crummy villain however,but his woman who returns again in the next of many installments is beautiful,Why Ned Beatty(Deliverance) I am not sure,other than few of my pet peeves with the movie I mostly enjoyed and would watch again but not buy.
B004WGGQPQ|3.0|I drew a very pretty pic and it deleted it!!! other wise I thought it was pretty good on the kindle fire. I would recommend it it people who don't get irritated easily.

B002ZG99QS|4.0|OK, I probably missed this but, I thought that Flynn escaped in the first movie? Well, either way....still a good movie. My only issue.....Flynn Sr. gets a little cheezy. He says things like \\"Digital Jazz, man!\\" So much for the coolness factor.  Special effects: 10 out of 10  Plot: 9 out of 10 - The ending was a little weak - still good though  Acting: 8 out of 10 - Sometimes the acting was not that believable \\"digital jazz\\" etc.  Overall, it was a good movie but they should have spent a bit more time on the ending. I can't imagine they put lines like \\"digital jazz, man\\" in by accident so, it's just not my taste....didn't seem believable from a guy that was \\"cool\\" in the 80's....but then again look at Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley....they would say it....give me a break. ha ha ha!  Worth Renting (which is what I did)

B005R2S3VE|1.0|Bootleg DVD.<br /><br />The sole DVD of Chicago's classic '70s line-up, including the guitarist Terry Kath (just before his untimely death) is, unfortunately, a completely unauthorized TV-to-videotape affair off a circa-1977 VCR, by the looks (and sounds) of things found here. Horrible audio throughout, BTW, with lots of drop-outs. Chicago is in good form, but you can't really see much through the dark, blurry murk.<br /><br />Why does Amazon sell anything by \\"XXL,\\" the firm taking credit for this video piracy disaster?.
B004ECDNJU|5.0|Fun puzzle game that kept speed in mind for all.  Good for all ages!  Helps build cognitive reasoning.  Levels increase in difficulty.
B004132I20|5.0|If you're a fan of Sherlock Holmes, you'll like this updated version of him.  It's always a little dicey when trying to move something into a modern day context, but I would rate this a rousing success.  The show stays true to the nature of Holmes; his condescending attitude towards Scotland Yard; his thrill at the hunt, etc.
B0055SWM08|5.0|easy to grasp. some puzzles are a decent challenge. others are solved at a glance. haven't listened to.the music at all, but the art style is nice.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|This is less a movie and more a prayer, a whisper of the heart searching for the meaning of life, death and creation itself.  It must be seen many times to begin to see that every scene, every word, every blade of grass has meaning.  It's beautiful!

B003XF1XOQ|1.0|This was by far the biggest let down ive ever read. The first two books were great, then she wrote this. Overall, the last book was ok but the ending was terrible! She left so many loose ends and the entire last chapter felt so rushed. I had to go online and read an alternate ending by an amiture because it was better than hers. I hope they change it for the movies.

B000053GTF|2.0|Bought this several months ago, too busy to watch until now ..... and still can't.  I guess I failed to see the made in Germany sticker on DVD wrapper until it was too late.  Can't play it since it's wrong region ??? I thought Amazon only sold region 1 DVD's and that I didn't have to worry about country of origin. Or am I too naive to the process ? Can't find receipt, so I have no clue who duped me on this.  So be warned - look closely when DVD arrives.  In the mean time, I'll ring in the New Year with another Celine DVD.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very addictive game. Could easily spend hours playing game. Downloaded it to my Kindle Fire and have been playing it nonstop.
B005G02RIC|4.0|For an open air production of Tosca, you cant get better than this. I am impressed with the way that the producers and audio recording personnel have gone about their job.<br /><br />I have always had a thing against open air productions, and there are some very lousy recordings from the same venue that I have trashed just because the audio as well as much of the video was not up to the mark. But they seem to have redeemed themselves beautifully, given the limitations of the venue.<br /><br />I would always enjoy a Tosca recorded from an enclosed theater. Yes, most of the other Toscas I have are better sounding than this one, but I have to admit that Alvarez and Cedolins do a great job. I could not have expected more from Raimondi in that role. His voice is not really up to the role, is what I feel about this wonderful singer. Comparing his Scarpia to the likes of Tito Gobi or even the recent Brynn Terfel I think would be unfair. Maybe 20 years ago, Raimondi may have pulled it off beautifully in an auditorium, but the open air venue seems to have got the better of him, in spite of the electronic help. Cedolins pulls off a rather 'un-fiery' Tosca in this - a totally new approach. The murder of Scarpia is not very well done, just OK. She is no match for some of the other Toscas, of which there are plenty, but still, comes through quite competently voice-vice. Cedolins seems to be better suited for La Rondine, a part she has pulled off superbly, and of course in the Donizetti opera, Maria Stuarda, where I actually noticed her first.<br /><br />This is the best of Alvarez I have seen.He towers above the rest of the cast and really pulls it off fabulously.<br /><br />The sets, being where they are situated are not really adequate (or convincing) for the Puccini Opera. I wish they could have done a bit better. The staging however, is quite good.<br />The Video is superb, and I must take my hat off to that crew<br /><br />All in all, really worth owning. There are really lovely moments in this production, especially for Cedolins that are worth watching over and over again...<br /><br />BUT WAIT...<br /><br />There is a huge huge bonus of clips from other operas and a smattering of ballets, which is really worth flipping through and can fill an evening of varied works of different moods, that makes this blu ray doubly worth buying. In fact, if they had sold this without the main opera, it would still be worth keeping as a potpourri of attractive pieces..olins that are worth watching over and over again...   BUT WAIT...

B005NGKMOU|4.0|\\"Blackthorn\\" is an interesting spin on a classic western tale. Sam Shepard is excellent playing an older version of the legendary Butch Cassidy who survives, in the movie, in Bolivia until the mid 1920s when he decides to go home and trouble ensues. The movie touches on a number of the genre's major themes--and Shepard drives the film even in its slowest parts. The supporting cast--Stephen Rea, a touchingly vulnerable Magaly Solier and Eduardo Noriega--are good. Director Mateo Gil filmed the movie in Bolvia and there are some spectacular and unique shots. Gil is smart enough not to try to remake \\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\\" and Shepard, thankfully, does not try to play Paul Newman in the film. The end did seem a bit rushed and anti-climatic.   The DVD is solid though I wish there more features. There is a fine look at the making of the film and a collection of deleted scenes--much of which, though not all of them, were rightfully cut.   While not a great film, \\"Blackthorn\\" is one of the more unique westerns that I have seen in the last half decade and fans of the genre will enjoy the movie. Shepard really holds the film together--he is one of the often overlooked gems of the last few decades.
0385534639|5.0|This currently rates as my favorite book. It definitely lives up to the hype - it's a mesmerizing story, amazing description, entrancing love story...I'm using a lot of fancy language to say that I adore this story. I want to be part of the Night Circus. I want to be Celia!
B0049985XW|4.0|We enjoy the old movies and when Amazon comes along with bunches of them for under $5, well, how could we resist?  Add to that speedy delivery (thanks for shipping via USPS Priority Mail) and we win all the way around.
B004EPYZXK|1.0|The movie starts off with \\"real footage\\". The story is horrible it relies on cheap thrills and scary music, and quite honestly horrible acting, most of the movie is spent in the L.E.M. so all you get is a bunch of dialogue. Definitely save your money, barely worth watching all the way through. Great idea for a movie, just low budget and horribly executed.
1595822003|5.0|I've loved Bernie Wrightsons art for a long time and as an illustration teacher I have shown his work to my classes.  The book I've shown is \\"A Look Back\\", which is an art retrospective of most of his work.  Near the end it shows a couple of plates from this amazing book.  I'm glad I got a good deal on this book, but would have paid more knowing what I know now.  If dark horse is listening they need to get Bernie to take the helm once more and do a Bram Stoker's Dracula in the way only Bernie could do it. This book is one of my favorite purchases this year.  Also, lets face it, art books need to be books and not on electronic devices so by the book.  Buy it before it goes out of print.
B004ECDNJU|5.0|This game is a great time killer.  What you do is redirect colors into switches that close once its received usually 2 colors. You have to tap the arrows so they end up in the right spot. If you send a Color the wrong way, you lose a life. if you run out of lives, you lose and may repeat the level.  5 star rating.  Thoughtful gameplay, if you like puzzle games you will enjoy. Very simple, but requires thought and reflex. Something to note may be if you are colorblind, this app is not for you.

0060873027|1.0|Bad plot. Bad characters. Bad dialog. Bad writing. Just ... bad.<br /><br />I was wondering if this was something Crichton wrote in college and it's been moldering in the bottom of a box all these years. Maybe he submitted it in his Entomology class instead of a research paper. \\"Look, Professor, it's all about bugs! From a bugs-eye view!\\" \\"Nice try, Mr. Crichton. Stick with science, you have no future as a writer.\\"<br /><br />Fortunately, that didn't happen. I learned from the other reviews that Crichton didn't actually write this book. My faith is restored.<br /><br />So to review this non-Crichton book: The plot is straight out of a 1940's monster movie. (In fact, does anyone remember \\"Dr Cyclops\\" (1940)? \\"A mad scientist working in the South American jungle miniaturizes his colleagues when he feels his megalomania is threatened.\\" Sound familiar?) The \\"science\\" is just as hokey. The characters are wooden. The dialog (what there is of it) is stilted. Most of the book is descriptions of what's happening. In painful detail. Here's how one of the characters makes a dart:<br /><br />----------<br />He needed to fasten a \\"puff\\" of soft material to the tail of the blow-dart, so that the dart could be propelled through the tube by a person's breath. In order to attach this tail-puff to the shaft he needed thread. \\"Amar--is there any more of that spider silk?\\"<br /><br />Amar shook his head. \\"It got used up saving Peter from the snake.\\"<br /><br />No problem. Rick rooted around and found a coil of rope. He cut a short length of the rope, then picked it apart into strands with his fingers. This produced a pile of very strong threads. He held a piece of fluff from the mattress against the end of the dart and wound a thread around it, lashing the tail-puff in place. Now he had a real honest-to-goodness blow-dart ...<br />----------<br /><br />This could have been said in a couple of sentence or two. \\"Peter tied some fluff torn from the matress around the end of the dart with thread he had picked from a length of rope.\\"<br /><br />There is also endless information about all kinds of insects and other small creatures, give to us so that we can understand what the characters are about to say. For example:<br /><br />----------<br />The individual legs of a giant centipede end in pointed fangs --- foot-fangs. Each foot-fang is loaded with venom, and can deal a sting. The Scolo's forty legs hammered around, dribbling venom.<br /><br />Amar had been sitting on the leaf roof of the shelter. When the centipede crushed the roof, Amar fell down among the coils. He threw himself facedown to the ground, trying to protect himself.<br /><br />Karen knew something about centipede anatomy. She shouted to Amar: \\"Watch out for the legs! Each leg has a poison barb!\\"<br />----------<br /><br />The other thing that really got irritating in this book is that the author kept referring to the main characters by both first and last name. \\"Amar Sigh struggled ...\\"; \\"Karen King saw it first.\\"; \\"Danny Minot whispered to Jenny Linn.\\" There aren't any other characters in the books with the same first names as the main characters. By the first few chapters we know who they are.<br /><br />Nice try, Mr. Preston. Stick to non-fiction. You have no future as a thriller writer.n about all kinds of insects and other small creatures, give to us so that we can understand what the characters are about to say.

She is going right on to my I-Pod in a playlist I hope she is around for a long time, I look forward to a lot more from her. I don't rate someone the best I just have a number of singers who I rate as sort of prima singers, she joins Sarah Brightman and Norah Jones in my list. They are both great singers although different as is Adele. I also place Janice Joplin in that group. You might say you can't compair one of these singers to the others which is the point.

0060582545|5.0|Matilda was, according to Roald Dahl, one the most difficult books that he ever wrote, but it is also one of his most popular, standing alongside Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, BFG and The Witches. It is a story that revolves around an exceptional little girl, whose intelligence is unrecognized by her parents. Because of this, she learns right from the start that she has to do everything by herself to get exactly what she wants. Very episodic in its first half (incidents with Matilda's parents), the story's plot shifts in a straight path in its last half as Matild enters school and has to face an extremely vicious Headmistress, both to the students and to the teachers.<br /><br />Those that have read Roald Dahl's books will know that children in his stories face difficult and cruel situations from imposing figures of authority. This will not please certain parents or adults who may consider those things too scary and upsetting for children; even accusing those books of promoting rebellious ideologies. But to me those opinions are just rubbish and untrue. Instead, I think this book is an excellent way to warn children and adults that there are adults who have no respect for them and that it is essential to stand up to them. In fact, every time I have read Roald Dahl's books, I have always felt that he is one of those writers who treats children, and readers, with respect because he is showing to them the brutal truth about the world, the adults and the bullies - including those that are respectable authority figures - who think that they can get and do whatever they want because they have the higher power.<br /><br />As for the audiobook version, I was amazed by Joely Richardson's reading.

0743289692|5.0|Whether or not she intended to, Ayaan Hirsi, a lowly apostate in the eyes of her family, (but a hero in mine), totally kicked Allah's ass, and considering the so-called timelessness that is supposed to be Allah's Word, she did it in relatively short order.   In writing this book, which describes her courageous, painstaking journey from a torturous home life as a child, to the clarion for equality for women that she is today, she has bravely brought eminent condemnation and the prospect of death to her door from other so-called lovers of peace.  If the Muslims are so peace-loving, then why did Theo van Gogh end up with his throat cut, and a knife in his chest, and why would Ayaan ever need a bodyguard? Her father, (a walking contradiction himself), warned his daughter to shut her mouth about her discoveries, or she would be killed... by who??? But course such a task would befall someone within the realm of benelovent \\"peace keepers\\" who subscribe to Islam, which asssasins might have included yep... her own father. (note: such duty is also referred to as \\"honor killing\\", which apparently is acceptable practice in some Muslim circles in order to save face)  I consider this book to be absolutely relevant reading in today's society, especially in lieu of its criticism from the Muslim community, regardless of its potential flaws or any imagined shortcomings of the author herself.  Of certainty, there will always be those Muslims who do not want to be aligned with the damaging revelations or the rational observations that Ayaan has made, so naturally these apologetic defenders will appear on Amazon.com and elsewhere to formally deride her description of Islam, Allah, and the teachings of the prophet Mohammed.    But WHERE ON EARTH is the evidence to the contrary? Will any peace-loving Muslim, from any clan, in any corner of the world, step up and deny that it is the truth that \\"Muslims schools DO NOT teach their children that men are equal to women\\"? That \\"homosexuals andnon-beleivers (infidels) are worthy of death if they don't convert or conform to the ideals of Islam\\"?   I can only conclude that Ayaan got it right, and Muslims (in general) are not the peace loving nation they want you to think they are... and as Ayaan would say, they are consumed with self deception, filled with hypocrisy, and given to double standards. They are controlled by their own superstitions and belief in a narcissitic pagan God that does not exist anywhere but in their own minds.   Moreover, the evidence shows that in spite of their vows to promote and uphold the peace; Muslims are easily conduced to take up arms in defense of their superstitions, their holy bloodlines, and their world view. Islam itself condones violence and inequality and criticism in all of its forms, unless of course, any of these types of negativity is directed towards the Muslim men, or their Prophet, or their god.  The author did not leave the reader without hope of a lasting resolution to curb the violence and inequality that I too believe is \\"the law of the land\\" in the minds of all,[yes ALL], Muslim men.   Ignoring her death threats as always, Ayaan suggests we stick to the facts, as \\"the facts\\" are described by her as a beautiful thing. She reminds the reader that they [the facts] are about method and reason, which have no regard for emotion or irrationality. She advises that one needs only organize a body of experts to look more deeply into whether or not the social problems among Muslims are anything like she says they are.   Wouldn't that be the SANE thing to do?   Wouldn't you expect a rational person to agree with this advice?   So how come it wasn't a MALE from among the billions of Islamic men who are supposedly filled with untold peace and love for others that is writing this book or giving this advice? Why is it that A WOMAN, (who had to escape the tyranical hold of her life-long MUSLIM oppressors, both male and female) is the only human being to come up with such a simple strategy outlining the path to lasting [world]peace?    Why didn't the outrageous murder of Theo van Gogh prompt any of the respected MALE members of the Islamic community (including the revered Imams)to initiate peace talks with their violent counterparts in Islam?   Where is the coalition for Islamic belief that tells us that there is no such thing as an \\"INFIDEL\\", and as such, no one has a thing to worry about?  Hmmm... I'd say that Islamic apostates and whistleblowers had better retain their bodyguards... at least until Islam doesn't exist.     FWIW, I like the idea of a task force being put together from among the experts of the world's  most respected citizens to investigate Ayaan's reports. I would think that such a body of \\"experts\\" would include both men and women who are mostly Muslim, therefore experts on Muslim teachings, culture, and history, as well as Ayaan Hirsi herself who I deem to be an expert on human suffering, and someone who cannot be hoodwinked or intimidated into filing a report full of falsehoods. I would have expected such an investigation to be almost concluded by now, but here it is years later, and there's still no interest or affirmative action on the part of the Islamic faction.    Is this lack of determinatioin NOT evidence enough that Islamic men cannot be trusted to do the rational thing?  To me and myself, it seems apparent that Islam is a farse that is out of control, and that Muslim males are somehow too busy, too arrogant, and so offended by this woman crusader that they simply cannot afford to lower themselves to address, much less reprove, the complaints registered against them in this book.  Such lapse and lack of regard for the human suffering that is described within these pages reveals the lack of civility, while exposing the actuality of their barbarism and apathy towards anyone (everyone) who is NOT themselves.  To witness such lapses on the part of Islamadan, I can understand the anxiety some people feel towardsall Muslims. It seems to make sense that a Holy War is their only option, so brace yourselves folks, more brutality...   and more bloodshed...

B000QCS8TW|5.0|The Game of Thrones is an excellent story with well developed characters and story lines.  Please do not let those naysayers deter you regarding the slowness for which the author writes his stories because you will miss out on what has already been developed.<br /><br />Martin tells his story from several different character points of view.  I found myself yearning for more of certain plot lines while at the same time gaining new insight into the other story lines.  Even the most evil characters, at times, can be justified in the actions based on some occurrence from their earlier life.  You don't develop a liking for these characters but an understanding of why they do what they do.<br /><br />I highly recommend the reading of this series.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|This is my first review. My wife read \\"The Hunger Games\\" a few months ago. She loved it!! I just got my Kindle Fire for Christmas and this is the first book I read. It took me one day!! That is how hard it was to put down. I was surprised to find out that this is a \\"teen\\" book, not because of its content but because it was written so well. I will be starting the second book in this trilogy tomorrow but I am not as excited just because I know how trilogy's normally go... the second book is usally the one lacking, but I am hoping Ms. Collins proves me wrong. This is a great book for teens and adults alike. If my daughter was old enough to understand the story I would have no problem letting her read it. Anyways I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did.

B006ANJ4BW|1.0|Lets get the record straight, Conan was a name made up by authors in a book. I know that Hollywood will try to exploit this as they have done in  the past. There is no.... Record of such being ever recorded in history. Another attempt by Hollywood to immortalize Muslim Religion to the masses of people in the USA who try to rationalize the middle east religion as one that is rational. Don't be fooled by Hollywood as they try to immortalize self created beings such as Conan for their personal gains... yes a good movie... but with alternative motives altogether. My Opinion of Hollywood IS not to be taken lightly.

B004LWZW4M|5.0|Usually, remakes, prequels, sequels and reboots of a formerly successful TV show, or movie either try to repeat the formula of the original or rework the idea so badly it becomes contorted and contrived, such as, 2001's Tim Burton/Mark Wahlberg version of \\"Planet of the Apes\\" which probably set back plans for future movies for a decade. \\"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\\" will convince you this is the planet of the apes!<br /><br />In \\"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\\" James Franco plays Will Rodman, a scientist trying to find a cure for Alzheimers, for the very personal reason of curing his aging father Charles Rodman (John Lithgow). One of the chimpanzees, Caesar (Andy Serkis) is exposed to a genetically enhanced drug that expands his intelligence to human proportions, and he's raised by Franco and Lithgow. In the act of protecting the elder Rodman, Caesar is taken into custody by animal control facility that specializes in apes. In being abused by the system and the keepers Caesar comes to feel abandoned by Franco, and he starts to assert his dominance over the other apes until he effects an escape to get more of the intelligence expanding formula which he then exposes the rest of his simian inmates to.<br /><br />\\"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\\" is able to suspend your disbelief and as events unfold on the screen lead you to believe the rise of the planet of the apes could happen. In \\"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\\" the stars are the apes and the CGI, and for once this isn't a bad rap on the special effects, the CGI really makes the apes appear as individuals, gives them more mobility and believability than either trained apes or people in ape suits could. The facial expressions are a good mix of quasi-human and just simian enough for an audience to empathize with the characters while still seeing the essentially as apes.<br /><br />One moment that could have totally ruined the movie was the inclusion of Charlton Heston's iconic line in \\"Planet of the Apes\\" \\"get your paws off me, you damned dirty ape!\\" It almost comes off as a clumsy, cheesy usage, but the filmmakers immediately gave it a twist that redeems and makes the moment memorable unto itself. They didn't try for a twist ending that was the hallmark of the 1968 original but was contrived and doomed the 2001 TimBurton/Mark Wahlberg version.<br /><br />Any version of Planet of the Apes that convinces you this is the planet of the apes, is a movie that gets it right, and \\"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\\" gets it right.<br /><br />The DVD includes the bonus features of deleted scenes, a featurette \\"Mythology of the Apes,\\" and behind the scenes look \\"The Genius of Andy Serkis.\\"ape!\\" It almost comes off as a clumsy, cheesy usage, but the filmmakers immediately gave it a twist that redeems and makes the moment memorable unto itself.

0439813786|4.0|Although \\"The Invention of Hugo Cabret\\" contains over 500 pages, it is deceptively short. I was able to finish the book in an afternoon. This has much to do with Brian Selznick's illustrations as well as his compelling story. In reality, the book is a graphic novel. Images are as important as words in telling the story. That seems fitting considering the prominent role that the movies play in the whole story.  The story focuses on Hugo Cabret a boy who is twice an orphan. First he loses his father tragically in a museum fire. He is then forced to live with his drunken uncle at a Paris train station in 1931. Hugo's life is difficult. He is mistreated until the uncle's untimely demise caused presumably by alcohol. Hugo desperate to connect with his dead father discovers another world in the person of Georges Méliès.  At one point in the story, Hugo tells Isabelle, goddaughter of Georges Méliès, \\"Did you ever notice that all machines are made for some reason...Maybe that's why a broken machine always makes me a little sad, because it isn't able to do what it was meant to do...Maybe it's the same with people...If you lose your purpose..it's like you're broken\\" (374). Hugo and Georges both are broken, and only by finding each other do they get \\"fixed.\\"  Brian Selznick weaves a story of clockwork, automata, fantasy, magic, and movies. I am actually a little surprised how well he does it. Today, we have a separate understanding of magicians and movie makers, but in the early days of film, the line was blurred. Selznick successfully creates this world and makes a fun book.  The only part that I found distracting in the book was the emphasis on deception and stealing. Characters are constantly hiding secrets and stealing from one another. No character seems entirely noble in this regard. At first, I wondered if the deception was part of the brokenness. It certainly gets in the way of the characters finding their purpose. However, Hugo recalling a picture of Prometheus that he saw at the Academie du Cinema Francais fondly describes the god as a thief. This is done without any irony or explanation. Moreover, movies and magic are both about deception. They both create the illusion of things that are not there. Still, there are distinctions between Prometheus and your average thief or a magician and a liar. I would have preferred that the author helped us see those distinctions.  That being said, the \\"Invention of Hugo Cabret\\" was a great book.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Exactly as advertised. The Matrix trilogy, on Blue Ray disc, in a boxed set. Works for me. Doesn't get much easier than that.
0307949486|3.0|I just finished THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO.  Haven't seen the European trilogy of films, haven't seen the new American version with Daniel Craig.  Haven't read the other books.<br /><br />But, for a \\"thriller,\\" I was a little underwhelmed.  Over 600 pages?  No, I don't demand bare bones formulas and slick writing for a story...but this book did read rather cumbersome for a thriller.  The two main characters, Blomkvist and Salander, don't meet until halfway through the book.  Up until then, the extremely thorough investigation into the Vanger family was starting to drag.  When clues turn to answers, the scenes become the sparse and obligatory melodramas of pulp detective fiction.  A record of murder victims is mentioned...but then a huge financial scandal overtakes the book.<br /><br />Last year, I saw these books everywhere.  Someone was reading one in the airports and aboard every flight I took.  I wondered how such long books could make effective thrillers.  This is just my opinion, but they don't make effective thrillers.  At least this first one didn't.<br /><br />Maybe I'll like the films better.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|I first saw this in a theater and thought, this is definetly a Tarentino movie. I don't think another director except maybe for Zombie likes so much blood. I laughed at the overkill and the movie, to me, was a riot. Brad Pitt, as usual, gave a great performance. It was just a good bit of entertainment. People couldn't understand why we were laughing but Tarentino and his overkill, is just so funny. Had to own it.

B005K0HDGE|2.0|It's hard to get lost in time travel to the past when things jump out at you that just aren't right.  For example, a little girl plays with a soccer ball.  Really?  In 1962?  I don't think so; soccer did not become popular with US youth until later.  And someone drinks Dos Equis, which was not imported to the US until the 1980s.  In another scene, black and white characters in the South are friends and ride the bus sitting together, something that just didn't seem authentic to me.  One more thing that didn't ring true was the language most of the characters used; I'm sure people cussed in the 60s, but not the types of people in this novel and not to that extent.  I was also disappointed in the plot.  I never understood why the main character accepted and pursued his mission (to change the events of 11/22/63) without question and with such devotion.  It's not like he was a JFK history buff or conspiracy theorist to start with, so why would he drop everything and spend years of his life pursuing this based on the suggestion of an acquaintance?  It just didn't make sense.  Even if you can accept that premise, however, the resolution is anti-climatic.  The novel builds and builds to that day, and then flashes forward to the consequences, without any explanation as to what happened in the intervening years.  Wouldn't it be more interesting to know how the change in history caused the results it did?  Again, it just didn't make sense.  Overall, the book was a disappointment.
B000001GQR|5.0|I grew up listening to Karajan's Schubert 9th on EMI. As a classical music neophyte I never cared much about different performers. Then I heard Furtwangler's version and everything changed. The introduction in the first movement changed from being soporific to a grand introduction. The second movement came to life. The third movement acquired a powerful yet playful personality. The last movement turned into a well deserved grand finale.<br /><br />If you thing the Schubert's 9th on this album was good, then wait to hear the Haydn 88th. At first I thought \\"Oh just another boring Haydn symphony\\". Never in my life have I been more wrong. Furtwangler was able to turn this underplayed symphony into a spectacularly fun listen.<br /><br />Furtwangler drags things out whenever they needed dragging out, and rushed passages whenever they needed rushing. He combines his original artistic vision with the composer's making for a truly unique and original product.

0670022950|4.0|Before the first world war a long period of relative peace, growing international trade and Englightenment science, art and cultural development led people to think major violence was obsolete. Oops. The point is that violence often comes in spasms. It takes a generation or two for pressures to build up and for people to forget or recover from past wars. I think the fundamental reason people fight is to get stuff they need or want. Now that we know that chimps fight genocidal wars for territory, we can surmise that violence between in-groups versus out-groups goes back millions of years, perhaps tens of millions of years. Fighting for territory, females or resources goes way back and is hard wired in pretty strongly. Takes strong institutions (international treaties, education, violent sports as surrogates, etc.) to keep peace. Hard to overestimate the key role of demography. I made a list of 28 countries that used to fight but are now peaceful (Germany, France, Japan, China, etc.)and another list of 28 countries where at least 100,000 people had died violently in recent decades (Iraq, Guatemala, Bosnia, etc.). Average fertility rate for the peaceful former \\"hereditary enemies\\" was 1.6, TFR for the violent countries was 4.7. I rest my case.<br /><br />It should be noted that framing responses to the 9/11 attacks as a \\"war on terror\\" condemns the U.S. to never ending violent conflict. Technology exists to kill historical or more than historical numbers of people, although, with 7 billion of us, it takes a lot of deaths to match historical percentages. If we can get through the next century of resources shortages that seem likely due to the collision of growing populations with declining resources (especially soil, climate and fossil fuels)Dr. Pinker's idea that violence is going out of fashion will get more credible. Right now feels more like a pause between collapses to me. But we do have the tools (birth control) to reduce demographic pressures and demonstrably on the evidence, undercut the fundamental drivers of violence.<br /><br />Dr. Pinker might want to check out a few videogames that seem to me to teach a culture where violence is a preferred means of conflict resolution.Or visit a rifle range where he might find Evangelicals teaching kids to shoot in preparation for Armageddon. Also gun sales statistics. We ain't out of the violent woods yet.ce, undercut the fundamental drivers of violence.

B000001GXB|5.0|In this album, Pollini brings out the important inner voices of the Beethoven sonatas with his clear cut and technically perfect rendition. He does not divulge in passionate outbursts or unnecessarily quiet meditations, but rather plays the sonata with an objective vision and thus letting the music speak for itself.<br /><br />A fine example of Pollini's talent can be heard in the notoriously challenging Hammerklavier. He maintains perfect posture and vision even at the most difficult passages (listen to the last movement).

B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I bought this case primarily because of its small and sleek design. I wanted something to prevent my kindle from accumulating scratches during transport. It does this while adding little weight/size to the kindle. The material has a  softer plastic/rubbery feel which I prefer over leather. The stand works but does wobble a little if you are touching the screen. As I use it mostly to read/play games (not movies), the stand is of little concern to me. Taking everything into account, it is a great case I would highly recommend.

I haven't got The Open Door yet, so I can't fairly compare it to that album. But Fallen is definitely my all time favorite album. So now the band is back, but they no longer have Ben Moody and a couple of other members. I've given up on another Fallen, since Ben Moody was obviously such a big part of that... but Amy Lee is still here, and she also was a key piece.  Pros:  Evanescence is still here. Amy Lee works magic into this album, just as she does into all of her music. \\"What You Want\\" is a catchy start to the album, but my favorites are \\"My Heart is Broken\\" and \\"Lost in Paradise.\\" I like how they combine Amy's singing and piano playing alone at first, and then with the rest of the band (sort of like the Band Version of my Immortal). There are a couple of tracks I don't care for much (out of 16, no complaints!), but most of the songs are very inspired and beautiful. The bonus tracks and the DVD make the deluxe edition much better than the regular CD.  Cons:  I miss how on Fallen, I could always tell where the song was going. Some of these songs feel like they go all over the place, with only a weak sense of direction and unity. It makes it hard to either like or dislike the music sometimes. But this is kept to a low enough level that I'm okay with it. That said, I admire how the entire band really wrote this album as a team. It shows in the music and gives it life.  So like others have noted, don't get this and expect another Fallen. It's not coming unless Ben Moody and Amy Lee decide to write more music together. But in it's own right, this is definitely a quality album. There's no music out there like Evanescence, so magical or heartfelt. This is \\"What You Want.\\"
0553573403|4.0|This is my first time reading from George R.R. Martin. As my first time reading an adventure book based on the hype of George Martin's book series, I was not disappointed. Don't come into this book looking for artistic literature, but rather artistic sensuality. He is very good at creating a great story, a story that lasts for hundreds upon hundreds of pages. If he decided to write the amount of detail described in a book like \\"The Road\\", then the book may have become two thousand pages long. I chose four stars because I am not a fan of some of the gross sexuality involved in the story, but of course, opinionated.<br /><br />Long story short, read this for the adventure rather than artistic language present in many popular novels. You will most likely be compelled to turn the next page every time.

B00000E2VC|5.0|I am a teenager going through high school who checked out this CD from the local library on a whim. I didn't expect much since I've never heard any of the pieces on this album, nor have I had any experience with Michelangeli. My friend, who knew a little bit of Chopin, asked to borrow it before I had the chance to listen. Since she quickly fell in love with this album, I decided to give it a try while studying. First impressions were positive - the pianist was good and not too showy and the music was typical Chopin. Little did I know that this would become one of my most treasured albums.<br /><br />It grew on me. This simple album of simple Chopin pieces somehow acquired well over a hundred full listens on iTunes. I would listen to it walking to the bus, while it was raining, while I am bored, whenever. I would recall fond memories when I hear Mazurka No. 47 or Scherzo No. 2. Mazurka No. 43 would make me feel sad while the next Mazurka would try its best to comfort me. I would hum the melody of Mazurka No. 45 for whole days. Never before has an album made such an emotional impact on me.<br /><br />What is the deal with this album, then? How could a bunch of simple Chopin pieces get to be so loved? It's simple - Michelangeli took these pieces under his wing and infused them all with a job - to make us FEEL thoroughly sad. After all - the most important things in our lives spur a strong emotional response - it can be our lover, or the sunset, or even a good old shower. Thus, these selection of Chopin pieces acted as a source of empty sadness.<br /><br />I simply cannot put into words the emotional power of this album. Maybe it's like waking up on a nice, perfect day but feeling supremely dominated by sadness. Maybe it's the feeling of true loneliness. Maybe it's a sense of nostalgia. What I can say objectively is give this album a listen. You won't regret it.

B005TPCQ5I|3.0|So, I knew nothing of the story line other than it was a romance set over time.  I have a completely free weekend to catch up on movies so I'm like \\"hey, I like Ann Hathaway. Why not see this movie?\\"  I liked it enough - up until the ending.  I won't ruin it for you, but don't rent this if you're in the mood for a classic hollywood happy ending.  On the other hand, if you're in the mood for a more realistic/tragic love story then this is perfect.  Note: If I wanted to see tragic endings I have nothing more to do than to look around.  Movies that leave you with a sad feeling, or shall we say a more \\"analytical reflective feeling,\\" can be just fine... I just wish I would have known that was what I was getting from the beginning.

B0018QQQKS|5.0|The book is fantastic. That's not an issue. I have the hardcover edition and have read the book twice. The problem I have is with the price for the Kindle edition. Why does it cost $12+ for the Kindle edition and only $10+ for the paperback. If anything, the price of this book should be less for the Kindle edition. Come on, Amazon, it's time to start kicking butt!
B0053Q9DHW|2.0|This version is beautifully filmed, the actors are wonderful, but you just can't change a classic story this much and leave true fans anything but upset. I saw this version in the theatre last year, and just re-watched it after receiving it for Christmas. I remember being disappointed then, and now remember why. Without going into detail on the liberties taken, I'll just say, there are WAY too many. Which is so disappointing as the actors may be my favorite of the versions I've seen. I don't think I will ever watch it again. I'll stick with the Masterpiece Theatre version of 2006 in which the actors weren't my favorite (though not bad at all), but the story is the truest to the the original that I've seen.
B0043URV5U|3.0|With a heavy canon worth of material to choose from, Capitol Records could not come close to fleshing out 2 CD'S worth of Seger material.

0316069485|4.0|Bosch and Haller are half brothers, as has come out if you follow the series. Bosch has become a bit more domesticated, now that he is a full time dad and has a niece and a brother and an ex-sister-in-law and I am not sure if I like it. I like the brooding intensity of the earlier installments of the Bosch series.<br /><br />Not that this book does not have its creepy moments, its dramatic moments and action. It has all of that, but it just didn't feel like a Bosch book - and that was all because of the inclusion of Haller and the fact that it was a hybrid book.<br /><br />In The Reversal defense attorney Mickey Haller has been asked to step in as a special prosecutor in a 24 year old case involving a child murder. The case was resolved 24 years ago but a DNA test has cast doubt on the verdict and a court has ordered the conviction to be reversed. The prosecutor has chosen Haller to re-try the case and Haller has picked his ex-wife to help and Bosch to be his investigator.

1451648537|5.0|An outstanding biography and history of a most extraordinary man and the products he fathered.  Steve Jobs, was not the nicest guy, but his life defined what is the best and most magical quality in great people, vision.  He did change the world. I don't just carry 100+ tunes in my pocket, but, with my iPad, much in the world that matters to me is virtually in my pocket.  Walter Isaacson makes writing look easy.  STEVE JOBS is the marriage of two perfectionists.  It's a superb story told by a superb story-teller. This isn't just a terrific biography about an interesting person; it is also a textbook for both entrepreneurs and writers, a book everyone should read or listen to.  It is full of hope and optimism, two things we can never have enough of.
B004IZMQI2|4.0|It's always good to know that others(individuals that have chosen to go down my chosen path before me) have failed and failed miserably.  It's not that it makes me happy that they have failed. It's that they have succeeded after such failure. I take great comfort in hearing their stories. It gives me the courage to continue the journey in the face of my failures(past, present and yet to come).  This time it is Steven Pressfield's story that accompanies me in my journey into the new year. His story is one of years of failure, of novels nearly completed  but thrown away, of living out of a van, of his screen play's critical and popular disasters. Yet Pressfield is the author of numerous international bestsellers including The Legend of Bagger Vance.  Book One entitled \\"Resistance : Defining the Enemy\\" explores the greatest stumbling block to the artist: Resistance. Resistance is not only the enemy, but it is also a stone cold killer whose only goal is keep you from doing what you were meant to do. Pressfield reveals the importance of resistance in our personal evolution. . Resistance, according to Pressfield is like a compass, pointing towards our self's true North. \\"The more important a call or action is to our soul's evolution, the more resistance we will feel. . .\\" (Pressfield, p. 12) In other words, the more you resist, the more you ought to be doing whatever it is you are resisting.  Procrastination and fear or near enemies of resistance. According to Pressfield, \\"Fear is an indicator. The more scared we are of a work or calling, the more sure we can be that we have to do it. (Pressfield, p. 40) \\"So if you are paralyzed with fear, it's a good sign. It shows you what you have to do..\\" (Pressfield, p. 41)  Book Two is called \\"Combating Resistance: Turning Pro.\\" According to Pressfield the only way to overcome resistance is to do whatever it is you are afraid of or whatever you have been putting off. If you want to be a professional, he gives the following advice: 1. Show up everyday. 2.  Show up no matter what.  3.  Stay on the job all day.  4.  Stay committed over the long haul.  5.  Master your craft.  Equally important a a professional must expose her craft to the real world.  Pressfield didn't become a professional until his first screen play met with critical and commercial failure. His movie, King Kong Lives, was so bad that an employee at a theatre that was playing the film remarked to him, \\"Miss it, man. It sucks.\\"  Book Two further examines what it means to be a professional; Pressfield identifies several character traits that exemplify a pro: patience, persistence, humility, love and courage. All of these traits are necessary until the gods decide what to do with your work.  Book Three entitled \\"Beyond Resistance: Higher Realm\\" explains my last statement. According to Pressfield that the creative process belongs in the spiritual plane. He invokes the muses( daughters of Zeus) each day befores he begins his work.  He understands that he is not ultimately responsible for the art he creates. In invoking the miracle of creation he is merely an instrument of the great creator.  Pressfield's most compelling and perhaps controversial argument deals with the implications of an unlived life.  The question he asks is what happens when we let resistance persuade us not to persue a higher calling: \\"Could our unlived lives have exacted their vengence upon us in the form of cancer?\\" (Pressfield, p. 134-5) If we are blocked in our creative and spiritual lives, we are not who we are meant to be. \\"Our job in this lifetime is not to shape ourselves into some ideal we imagine we ought to be, but to find out who we are and become it. If we were born to paint, it is our job to become a painter.\\" (Pressfield, p. 146)

0307463745|4.0|Interesting book.   I never read the 37 signals blog, or used their tools (though being an embedded electronics/firmware designer I have heard of them) but amazon showed this up as related to other things I've been reading lately. I found the sample really readable, and so grabbed the rest to read.  Overall I found it was nice to go through in book form. Chewing through all this in one go in blog form would be annoying, and that's worth the price of kindle admission alone to me.  I found some of the promotion insights very interesting, and my Wife and I will be applying some of them pretty much immediately in her accupuncture business (not being bitchy about her competition though - that would be way too tacky)   Based on the outside funded startup disasters I've been employed by in the past, I feel their focus on real sellable product and real customers as soon as remotely possible rings very true with what I've seen from previous employers that dragged on and on with development of nothing actually sellable, but an idea that when we got \\"there\\" we'd make millions. Somehow.  But I can't also help but think that business plans do need a bit more substance than 37 signals seem to be suggesting.   And I know that as frustrating and slow as meetings can be - they can be one of the best ways to transfer fundamental knowlege and expectations that different people have for a product being developed, especially if you have an organisation that isn't just 14 people you have hand picked yourself for perfect fit in your own company.  ANYWAY - bottom line is, these words were absolutely worth the money I paid for them in this format.   I will get use from some of the ideas now, and when I start my own contracting business in the near future I'll be coming back here and spending a bit more time in these little essays to see what else I can gain. And probably in the SVN blogs too.   Cheers, 37 signals guys.

B004EPYZXU|1.0|I wanted to like this movie, I really did.<br /><br />It's good for the first 30 minutes and then it's all down hill from there.  Seriously, the most entertaining parts of this movie are when they are in the ship and landing it and doing research and gathering the rocks.<br /><br />And the villains of this movie?  Rocks with legs.  Seriously that's it, rocks with legs.  Plus they're about the size of a potato.  Really?  Something that I could just step on?  Good lord and if that wasn't bad enough, the camera work is just horrible!  I can't even see what's happening!  Stuff like that works for Blair Witch and Paranormal Activity because there is tension that is building and something is actually HAPPENING.  In this move there's nothing going on!<br /><br />It's just these two guys saying: \\"Did you hear that?\\"  \\"What was that?\\"  \\"Is there something outside?\\"<br /><br />Plus what's even lamer is that toward the end when the one astronaut is running around looking for the other one he's doing it in the dark with a flash every 10 seconds or so and we briefly see rocks moving.  You mean to tell me that NOBODY at NASA thought to give their astronauts flashlights or lights on the outside of their space suits?<br /><br />Another big complaint is that at one point the landing craft is rocked by something HUGE and we never see any creatures bigger than the potato sized ones.  So what was knocking the ship around?  Never explained.  Also, NOT ONCE does the movie show that there is less gravity on the moon than on Earth.  If you didn't look outside you'd swear they were just on Earth, they're walking around like normal, nothing is falling down slowly, it's just normal.<br /><br />And the movie doesn't even TRY to tell the audience why they were up there to begin with.  Here, I can re-write the ending so it makes sense and the writer has an opportunity to give an explanation:<br /><br />Astronaut: \\"Okay Houston, look, I know I'm screwed I've come to terms with that.  But just level with me, what were we doing up here?\\"<br />Houston: \\"Well since you're going to die and never speak to another human being again, here's why we sent you guys up there..\\" *Insert explanation*<br /><br />There, I wrote that in 30 seconds!  If I can do that, I would suspect that a Hollywood writer could do it!<br /><br />Don't waste your time or money.el with me, what were we doing up here?\\"<br />Houston: \\"Well since you're going to die and never speak to another human being again, here's why we sent you guys up there..\\" *Insert explanation*<br /><br />There, I wrote that in 30 seconds!

1451637500|4.0|It's hard not to read this book as a commentary on our current  economic problems with ruthless financial organizations and even more  ruthless top executives out to rip everybody off, along with social  action and protest groups.  On Kibou-daini, a world with a large  Japanese population, the oligarchy of cryogenic companies have managed  to vote the proxies of the people they have on ice.  One of these  companies decides to expand into the Barrayaran Empire, so Miles is  dispatched to investigate and figure out their angle.  A lot of the  humor came from the horror of the very staid Barrayaran consul  personnel for Miles' more than fast and loose operating style.  Some  very slick moves follow.  I loved the child, Jin Sato, and wished more  had been done with his love of animals.  Roic is wonderful as Miles'  armsman.  The book is a bit fizzy, with coincidences and sudden reverses, but  is a very easy read that took me less than one day for over 350 pages.  There's the usual glittery clever dialog.  McMaster has done it  all before, perhaps better, but it's still fun.  The ending is a big turnaround from the book's lightness, and left me in tears.  I hope this won't be the last book but if it is, it went out as it started, with both wit and great feeling.  This is definitely not the place to start; go back to \\"Shards of Honor\\"  and get to know Cordelia, who eventually becomes Miles' mother, in one  of the more interesting romances I've ever read.

B005JE7WKI|5.0|If you're considering this movie and haven't seen the trailer, do yourself a favor and go into it blind. Strong script, great direction and stellar character work is threatened by spoilers from an extremely showy trailer. Nearly every major kill is previewed which...for a horror movie...is a deal-breaker. Thankfully, there's enough comedy to save Tucker And Dale vs. Evil from being the Tucker And Dale Vs. Evil trailer: Directors cut. Great laughs, fun gore and an overall really strong film;  definitely give it a look.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|I watch the show \\"Castle,\\" so I thought I would check out the books. I bought and read all 3 of them and want more! After watching the show, I feel like I can visualize the characters and scenarios. The writing style puts you in the action.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|I sat engrossed for 2.5 hours watching Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds, absorbed by a stunning reworking of history, Nazi-occupied France, and the way an SS officer Hans Landa (played with reserved maniacal genius by Christoph Waltz) pits his cunning against American Lt. Aldo Raine (played by Brad Pitt) and his band of Jewish commandos.<br /><br />There's much to praise about this film, the incredible cast, the impossibly beautiful (in a melancholy way) women principals, the imaginative fantasy of WWII history, the lush scenes, but for me the jewel of the film, and a recurring motif, is watching the exaggerated manners and niceties of SS officer Hans Landa as he interrogates while drinking milk, eating apple tarts with cream, and smoking a pipe. He is a master of effusive politeness coating a velvety veneer over what's really roiling underneath: diabolical violence, opportunism, and menace.<br /><br />The disparity of his manners and his lurking evil made me squirm and wince with anxiety in scenes that are excruciating in their tension. It's no surprise to me that I learned Christoph Waltz won an acting award for his masterful, memorable performance.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|The Kindle Android app (currently at v3.3.x), available here on Amazon, won't install on a Velocity Micro Cruz T100-series Android tablet with the most current version (v2.2.1) of Android which is offered by Velocity Micro on their Cruz web site. Realistically, Velocity Micro will probably never release an Android version 2.3 for the T100-series tablets; most likely due to hardware limitations of the T100-series (hey, what were you expecting for around $100 in the year 2011? They already admit on their support web site that no version of Angry Birds will work on the T100 series tablets. Angry Birds WILL work on their T400-series of tablets, but those tablets are $199 [T408] and $299 [T410.] AND, even at that, those T400-series tablets still only run Android version 2.3 [again, what do you want for $199 or $299 in the year 2011?])  To download a special OEM version of Kindle for Android which WILL work on the T100-series Cruz tablets, use the Cruz Marketplace app on the tablet to download version 3.1.x from Velocity Micro, which installs and works fine.  For those of you who are \\"new\\" to the Cruz T100-series Android tablets, please note that Amazon's auto-identification system will \\"identify\\" the Velocity Micro Cruz T100-series tablets as \\"ingenic T100\\" devices. Amazon will also place a green check mark next to the \\"ingenic T100\\" on many apps to indicate that the apps \\"will\\" function on the \\"ingenic T100\\" device. This is a 50/50 proposition. Sometimes they WILL install and function fine. Other times they will NOT install! And if there is an \\"x\\" in a red circle next to \\"ingenic T100,\\" don't even try to buy/download/attempt to install the particular app on a Cruz T100-series tablet... it WILL FAIL TO INSTALL! This is usually due to the fact that the T100-series tablets lack a working CAMERA and/or a working MICROPHONE. Or because the Central Processor Unit (CPU... the \\"brain\\" of the computer) is an older design which is not supported by the particular application.
B006KSAPV0|1.0|It is advertised as a science fiction but a better description would be a weak horror story.   **** Warning this review contains spoilers *****  A woman commits suicide after a sexual experience that involves violence and possibly rape.  Her father, who has a history of tragedy in his personal life in revenge kidnaps the guy who had sex with his daughter. The father then does a sex change operation on the guy against his will. Soon the guy is transformed into a beautiful woman whom the father falls in love with. Then she like Frankenstein, kills her creator and runs away.  There is little in the characters' development that I found interesting.   The acting was poor although Antonio Banderas did have his moments.  The filming is rather ordinary but nothing wrong with it, just ordinary.

Not only was it boring and the music completely annoying, Amazon fed me a standard definition version, which made the experience that much worse.

B005COO1X6|3.0|As has been pointed out in another review, the ending destroys the story.  I am a huge Koontz fan and never really ventured too far into Stephen King.  I figured I would give a single a shot as I didn't want to get involved in a long book at the moment.  King does a good job at putting you in the story.  You can smell the mildew, you can feel the branches brushing you as you walk down the path.  The story rolls along at a perfect pace.  I found myself turning page after page without realizing how fast I was going.  Then all of a sudden...BAM...it's over.  It's almost like he was writing it right until the deadline and then the time came to send it off so he just ended it wherever he might be.  Not the kind of ending that leaves you wanting more. the kind of ending that leaves you wondering if all the pages got delivered to your Kindle because, surely, you are missing something.  I really enjoyed the story until the ending. Some of the language was off, not because of the words themselves, because I just don't see kids talking like that.  I know kids swear, but I can't see a 6 year old girl even thinking of calling her brother and a-hole.  It was just odd.  For the money you spend on \\"Mile 81\\", it's probably worth it.  Just be prepared for an ending that leaves you hollow.
B00006AFUR|3.0|30 Seconds To Mars, in 2011, is a pretty lame band.  Listening to their 3 albums in order of release, you can hear the band devolve from cool space-prog album rock to the frilly pop that they produce today.  This is a music review of their debut album... I will not be talking about the fact that Jared Leto is an actor.<br /><br />When I first heard that this was a concept album, and that it was produced by Bob Ezrin - I had to check it out.  30 SECONDS TO MARS is a powerful, concentrated blast of fresh art metal that tells a great tale of aliens invading planet Earth.  The music immediately reminds me of everything that influenced the band ... Nine Inch Nails, Tool... it's all here.  There is a decidedly industrial sound to this whole album - which lends to the concept-album legacy... every song is mixed identically.  The mix is full of presence and volume.  Everything is loud and normalized - not anything I expected from Ezrin.  This is an album you can just press play and leave on as background music... there are no weird orchestrated moments or any distracting voice-overs (well, except for that bit at the very end - which is thankfully tasteful.)<br /><br />Since I'm a prog junky, I need to take a little time to scrutinize the performances enclosed here:  The rhythm section is consistently tight and pounding... the drum parts are definitely one of the best things about the album - and one of the most prog elements of the album as a whole.  Leto's brother does a great job and plays with a lot of passion.  This is a GREAT drummer.  Not super-technical.. but consistently tight and almost machine-like - just listen to the last minute of \\"The Mission\\" and you'll be playing air drums before you know it.<br /><br />The guitar tone is brutal.  The tone of the guitars layered with the thick synths create a juicy wall of sound that lends a great tone to the entire album.  The playing isn't anything remarkable, but it serves a purpose.<br /><br />Leto's voice is really strong throughout the album.  This guy can hit some sick high notes (as further evident in the band's newer material).. a lot of vocal edits, but they're tastefully done. The vocal mix is a huge part of the band's futuristic sound on this album.<br /><br />In closing, this album will forever be a sleeper.  The new radio-pop direction (and success) of the band in 2011 really tosses this album into the bargain bin for life.  Any prog fan who might enjoy this album will be unlikely to ever hear it, while fans of the band's new sound mostly have written the album off as a mistake.  It's a shame, because the album is good - and worth a listen.<br /><br />Highlights - \\"Welcome to the Universe\\", \\"Fallen\\", \\"End of the Beginning\\"an hit some sick high notes (as further evident in the band's newer material).. a lot of vocal edits, but they're tastefully done.

B004LWZW4W|2.0|The original Planet of the Apes was a thoughtful political commentary despite its primitive special effects. The 2001 remake was more action-oriented, but at least entertaining. This remake just feels completely lacking. The acting is lousy. James DiFranco just can't pull off a scientist and his girlfriend fades into the background. While I'm a big fan of Andy Serkis' performance-capture CG work, his portrayal of Caesar the chimp didn't really do much for me - certainly not nearly as emotionally powerful as his Gollum. However, perhaps the biggest disappointment was the special effects themselves. Sometimes the apes looked OK, but more often they looked fake. I was really surprised given all of hype. I actually thought the apes from the 2001 Planet of the Apes looked better.
B004ECDNJU|4.0|Nice, simple, fast-thinking game.  I will keep it around for a while.  Plays well on HTC Inspire.  HAPPY NEW YEAR!
B0063IH60K|3.0|stop asking me if a want to.download spider solitaire... I already did... I don't need to install it again. stop asking me to follow you on twitter..... EVRRYTIME I OPEN THE APP!!!!!
B006BDHAX0|2.0|This game was one of the Best, until the program started shutting down and today tiles started Freezing up! Definitely wish someone would fix the problems...  :(
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Fun games. I don't like that you have to unlock games...esp when they cost a lot of coins to get. So this game is just okay.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I purchased this Fire for my 8 3/4 year old daughter.  She has mastered the use and the downloading of this product. She is reading Nancy Drew and playing games at an amazing rate. This product is very simple to use and watching Netflix is a great asset.  Over all I recommend the Fire as a reasonable solution to the intro tablet market.
B005ZUR724|1.0|This app worked beautifully when it was initially installed.  Now, since Dec 26, 2011, the app requires an update that is currently unavailable.  The app simply does not &quot;play&quot; without the update.  The game itself is awesome.  I noticed very few glitches.  Highly addictive gameplay.  Typical MMORPG.    Will change 1 star review to 5 star once it functions correctly.
B004EPYZSK|2.0|I wanted to see this movie only because Harrison Ford was in it. It was slow, long and boring at times. Overly bloody, body parts flying everywhere, horse's heads getting ripped off.. It was quite gorey. It was a novel concept gone typical, \\"Aliens killing humans and destroying everything..because they can\\".  I was expecting a better story, more info on the aliens, like who, what, when and where? But it's always good to see Harrison Ford...one of my favs.  I think they relied too much on CGI and should have paid for better writers.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|i just got a tablet and have been waiting for hours it wont install :( sadface whats up. i totally dislike this game!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|some of the games are easy some games are hard. I give it a 4 star rating instead of 5.
B006BDHAX0|2.0|Nice pattern and puzzles, but forces close unexpectidly and does not save game. Annoying and I will be looking for a better version.
0439023521|5.0|I wasn't too sure about this book since it reminded me of \\"Lord of the Flies\\" or the poem \\"the Lottery\\". The concept is pretty sick but the story behind it is what totally enamored me. The writing style is fantastic and the characters are personable. You start to cheer and grow fond of Katniss and the other characters. I highly recommend this book as well as the second. Though I have yet to get through the third since I sort of lost interest. Almost like the author lost interest as well. It almost got predictable. But I will finish it so I can give it an honest review. But I really really loved the first and second books. I highly suggest it!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app is trustworthy (has never quit mid-game), is responsive and has beautiful graphics.  I'm addicted on my Kindle Fire!!
B005HIBWFW|1.0|Despite the magnificent music of this great Romantic Era composer, and the acting of the great Richard Chamberlain, this film is just plain tedious.  The story's attempt to be clever, imaginative and interesting fails on all counts.  I recommend using this film  for the treatment of insomnia -- if you must play it, close your eyes.
B0063IH60K|5.0|its exactly what you think it will be. the ads can get annoying but easily dismissed. could be a bit harder. works great on my kindle fire
B005HSL626|3.0|my dad has it in his phone and I love the game. the only problem is I cant buy it on my kindle fire. it always says that I need a credit card number. I already called the amazon people and gave them the credit card number. Uggggghhh!!!!!!!  it aggravates me A LOT!!!!!! I need to call amazon and straighten things out.
B006O5XYWG|5.0|No words can describe how I felt watching this movie. my one annoyance is that I need to even write anything. 5 stars to everyone involved in this movie.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great App! Lots of different  games to choose from, can also earn free coins very fast to unlock the other games.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have this app on my iPhone and now on my Kindle Fire and I really love it. You can play as hard or as easy as you like.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great way to read the Bible and do Bible studies. I especially like the Bible plans. This year I will finally read through the Bible in total.
B0063IH60K|5.0|after playing the game as many times as I do, this one works just as good as any other. try it out
B004NELBPC|1.0|every single slide show is entourage. what gives?? fix it please!  this app would be great if the slideshows were of what they say they are.
B006O5Y0SS|1.0|Woody really lets his fans down with this absurd, poorly acted romp through a Paris in the 1920s that never existed except in his own mind. Faulkner, e.g., was there only 2 months and not when Bunuel or Dali were there. And the Hemingway character sits around and spouts quotations from a book he would write 30 years later, pontificating like some pompous, boring literary pope--which he was most def not at that point in time having only written 1 thin book. Toward the sugar sweet end, I expected to see Dorothy and the Wizard marching down the street while Mr. Rogers sang about his neighborhood. And why Woody keeps that surfer dude-faced actor in lead roles must puzzle everyone--but no one wants to argue with the \\"master\\" I guess. And a 20 second spot where Louis XVI says, \\"Off with his head\\" about a private eye following surfer dude---well, right out of a high school play. I made it through to the end but only because the champagne of NYE was still flowing.
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|This is a very good movie with a very simple yet modern plot. Many adult scenes which is to be expected. I give this a 5 star rating.
B006PKQQJS|1.0|I'm highly upset I purchased this game for it not open! I was really excited to play it but it wont open on my kindle fire...maybe I should request a refund smh
B0063IH60K|4.0|So happy to have this game on my new kindle fire.  Has ads, since it is free.  But not at all obtrusive.  Also fewer options.  Like it very much.
0439023513|5.0|\\"Mockingjay\\" read more like an adults' book than The hunger games and Catching fire did. It is not as intense in terms of plot, but just as good in a very different way - this is a book about revolution and war, and so quite grim.<br />The undertheme of manipulation by the media to support power, which to me is where the true originality of the trilogy lies, remains.<br />In this last book, after the cliffhanger ending of \\"Catching fire\\", we peep through Katniss'eyes into District 13 super-disciplined world as she realizes in the real world, rebellion and power struggles are not all black and white.
0385535139|2.0|Mr. Grisham is arguably one of, if not the most talented authors oflegal fiction.  I have to say, as an attorney, \\"The Litigators\\" did not please me.  While it is clear from Mr. Grisham's website that this book may be a (slightly) humorous novel, it sets back the legal profession at least 20 years.  To call a lawyer an \\"Ambulance Chaser\\" is probably the most derogatory comment available.  I stopped counting the number of actions by the main characters which would be in direct conflict of the Rules of Professional Conduct after the first few chapters.<br /><br />As a member of an honorable profession, I find parts of the novel offensive.  At the very least, Mr. Grisham should have put in an introduction that the acts discussed are not indicative of members of the legal profession.<br /><br />While his novels generally has a foil who does not portray the professional well; this entire novel is nothing but negative stereotyping of lawyers.  As a lawyer, he should be ashamed of himself.
B004XNGKBS|1.0|Was able to create one text scribble but that was it. None of the icons at the bottom did anything. Total waste of time and money.
B003KGBISY|5.0|Is this not the one title we all point to when we are asked about what films Akira Kurasawa produced? That is all I will say.  We all know the plot, we all know the ending, so I'll not add anything more here.  What I will say is that this is a 2-bluray package (disk1 -film, disk2 -supplements) and there is a 50+ page booklet included. Criterion has done an exceptional job with the restoration of the film, and the sound (uncompressed mono or, my favorite, uncompressed 2.0) is still simple but quite nice.  I do appreciate Criterion's the reluctance to \\"create\\" a full blown 5.1 audio track, as MGM/Fox did for the Leone trilogy for example.  Sometimes more is not better and this is one of these times.  And my reference to simple for the soundtrack here does not mean without subtlety or without punch.  It has both, when needed, and as much as needed.  This is one to sit back, and enjoy.
B003O86FMW|5.0|As incredible as it seems, the author manages to make Katniss face a new, harder challenge in this sequel (after a rather slow, unnecessarily romanced beginning in this second volume).<br />As a character, Katniss is still as distrusting and much more vulnerable than she would like to be. She grows in complexity in this book, which, added to the breathtaking plot, makes it a great sequel, ending in suspense - you will want to know what happens next!
B004ECDNJU|4.0|Going to give it 5 stars just to make the trolls mad.Nobody said you a holes HAD to download it just because it was free... Do you get a chill of recognition when you watch The Simpson's and see Comic Book Guy bashing things just because they're popular?
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|We have been enjoying the Dexter video.  It was shipped very quickly and in excellent condition. I would buy from this seller again!
B000VUQ4HW|4.0|This is a classic movie, filmed well before my parents were even born and defined the entire \\"Dracula\\" movie genre.  Disk 2 in this 2-pack DVD contains the \\"original\\" release with the German intertitles. Disk 1 has the version with English intertitles and a goodly number of extras (more on that later). I recommend to \\"view\\" this film from Disk2 as this version shows all the surviving original intertitle artwork.  Keep in mind that Murnau presented this film with various \\"tinting\\" schemes (to evoke particular moods perhaps) and so, staying true to the original, this restoration is \\"tinted\\".  This is perhaps the one thing I do not \\"like\\" about the film.  It is artistically glorious but it wreaks havoc with picture uniformity.  Fritz Lang did not tint Die Nibelungen (1924) and that film & restoration is sooo much cleaner, but uncle Friedrich wanted mood tints... oh well, c'est la vie I guess.  That said, let me be clear.  This is a great film, and a gift to the world of the 7th art from the Weimar republic.    Moreover, we should all bow low to the masters who did the restoration work.  They have done wonderfully, admirably, magically.  One can compare the details seen in the background (church, houses, other buildings, fountain, gateways, walkways) with what survives today.  It is miraculous that all these elements have survived the allied bombings of WW2, but they are still there.  The extras in Disk 1 guide the observant tourist in how to will pick these details up.  If you love classic cinema you'll appreciate this as well.
0812550706|5.0|Ender's game is one of the best SF books I've ever read.(And mind you, I'm a girl and not particularly interested in warfare and video simulations).<br />It's a book about leadership, strategy and bullying as much as warfare.<br />Not only is the plot enthralling, with a couple of incredible twists, Ender's psychology and development is absolutely brilliant as he is confronted to more challenges by his teachers and classmates alike at Battle School - a stifling place indeed.<br />What I really liked too : some chapters open with dialogues between the teachers/soldiers judging Ender's progress and difficulties; it gives a splendid depth into their perspective.
B005HSL626|5.0|now this game is the BOMB!! take it from me and everyone else its awesome! its very addictive by the way!
B0063IH60K|4.0|what can I say. it's a free game and it works. for a free game I wouldn't expect a lot.
B005AUWY90|4.0|Unlike the original Cars movie, which is enjoyable at many different levels by multiple generations of audience, this is a film just for kids, and I do not mean 7 or 8-year olds.  All the James Bond-like references to the \\"spy plot\\" are well over the heads of most 1st/2nd graders, but what can I say.  It is true however that my children enjoy this film with all the racing (and the two bonus shorts) immensely.  And the studios will undoubtedly make a ton or two of money with all the merchandising...all these new, pretty, shiny, colorful, race cars, not to mention all the \\"lemons\\".  I have already gotten a new Santa list with prof Z in it... I for one found the \\"story\\" uninteresting, as it is sooo predictable.  I must admit though, the visuals (especially in the bluray) can be seen with amazing clarity.  The artwork and the soundstage/sonic performances are unmistakeably Pixar grade A, it is the story which is lacking here.  Oh well can't win them all.
B006QKKMBA|5.0|I am a fan of all the Final Destination movies. They do a great job at setting up the insane deaths that take place. If I have any negative feedback, it would only be that they could have lengthened the death scenes a little more. All and all, if your a fan the the previous movies you will probably like this one. I hope there are more to come!
1416955070|1.0|I have not read Cassandra Clare's fan fiction, although I do know that she started in fanfic. You can tell. For a fanfic, I would consider this to be very good, but I expect more out of a published novel.  Clare's writing style is nothing to get excited about. It moves the story along, but does nothing to add to it. I give her props for not abusing fragments (a pet peeve of mine) as a lot of YA writers do these days. However, she writes like someone who has just started getting into creative writing--she has figured out how to string words together, but she hasn't figured out how to use them to tell a story. Instead, she tries to find out clever ways to describe something or pulls out a thesaurus where none is needed.  However, everything in this book--plot, characters, settings--is cliche. This book has been written many times before and better. Since you know how everything is going to play out from page one, there's really nothing to get excited for in City of Bones.  She goes out of her way to reference things in anime and fandom which I assume is supposed to be cute, but I find it obnoxious. In fanfic, that might be acceptable, but not in a published novel. She also distracts from the plot by having her characters have a lot of \\"witty\\" banter. For the most part, I didn't find it particularly witty or funny, and it's never a good sign when another character in the book has to remind the other characters (and you) that the plot is still happening. That's very sloppy writing.  I really did not care for the main characters. Jace, the Love Interest, is one of your typical \\"Bad Boy\\" types who we are repeatedly told is \\"charming.\\" Over and over, Clare will tell you that he is charming, oh so charming. To quote The Princess Bride, \\"You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.\\" Perhaps as a 14 year old I might have been fooled into believing Cassandra Clare that her character is, indeed, just so charming, but as an adult... His actions, hisattitude, and the way he talks do not make him a charming or attractive character. If I met Jace in real life, I would think he was a rude, obnoxious brat.  Then there's Clary. It is painfully obvious that Clary is a self-insert of the author herself. This is not inherently a horrible thing. I would be perfectly willing to overlook it if the book and character were better written. The trouble is, Clary is not a sympathetic lead. She comes off as being jealous and hateful. Important, plot-related things might be going on, but Clary can always find the time to be jealous of and \\"hate\\" someone for having nicer eyelashes than she does. There is only one other female character in the book, Isabelle, and of course the two of them don't get along because they're so jealous of the other's beauty (but of course Clary doesn't think of herself as beautiful) and because they have to compete for all the boys' attention (naturally). Like Jace, I have a feeling I would not like Clary Fray at all if I met her in real life.  The biggest thing that bothered me about City of Bones and the character of Clary was the constant bashing of people who aren't thin and/or conventionally attractive. Of course, all the main characters are thin and conventionally attractive--that goes without saying. But Clary spends an inordinate amount of time in the book picking apart her and other people's physical flaws (or more likely being jealous of their perfections and hating them for it). Then, of course, there's the lovely quote, \\"She wondered if there were any ugly vampires, or maybe any fat ones. Maybe they didn't make vampires out of ugly people. Or maybe ugly people just didn't want to live forever.\\" I realize Clare is going for humor, but that's still a very offensive line and definitely not the kind of thing I want to see in a YA novel. The implication is that people who are \\"fat\\" or not conventionally attractive have nothing to live for. Considering most readers of this book are likely to beyoung girls who may already have problems with their self-image, is that really the message they should be receiving?  Perhaps she's going for some kind of realism. Maybe there are a lot of teenage girls who spend a lot of time focused on the physical looks of themselves and those around them and are jealous of others and hate them for looking better than they do. I was never one of those girls, and I don't find that to be a sympathetic trait in anyone--fictional or not. Had Clare written the story as if she were aware of Clary's mental/emotional flaws rather than just her physical ones, that would have been acceptable. Instead, Clary is portrayed as the Every Girl and we are meant to sympathize and agree with her. Unfortunately, I don't.  Cassandra Clare is a capable writer, and she could even be a good writer. Unfortunately, in City of Bones, she is too self-indulgent, and too lacking in originality and self-awareness to pull off a decent novel. I have no desire to continue this series, but I would hope that her later works show improvement because thus far the talent is there, just not the ability.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|I have always loved Kelly Clarkson but honestly don't pay much attention nor buy music. However, since Kelly has the guts and intelligence to support Ron Paul, I thought I'd listen. I love \\"Dark Side\\" and \\"Honestly.\\"  Kelly's voice really puts me in a trance in those. So beautiful. I rarely would buy an entire album but this one is worth it. You go girl.
B004K7HMJ6|5.0|I gifted the CD to my mother and not only was the CD amazing in sound, but it was not scratched up and in great condition. There was nothing but praise from her, and the gift made her very excited and happy! :]
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I purchased this dvd set for my girlfriend. I shopped around and nowhere else had this neat box set. Once i received it was very pleased with the set and so was my girlfriend. The price was also about 20 to 30 cheaper than anywhere else i shopped. If your a Friends Fan you cant beat this deal.
B000002JOH|5.0|I have bought this album probably 20 times in the last years mostly for friends to discover, even people who normally prefer softer stuff. This album kicks you in the face with a steel toed boot of devastation. This album rocks harder than anything prior or since. In my opinion veteran metal head opinion it ranks in the top 3 albums of all time.
1451648537|5.0|Wow! Reads like a novel. What a wonderful peer into the mind, life and values of one of the 21st century geniuses.  I was both inspired and deeply saddened by the loss of this great entrepreneur. I especially loved Jobs' emphasis on building great products vs. \\"making money\\"...a message sorely missing in our culture today...Job's mindset would turn our economy and country around.  This book has the potential of rippling throughout the world.  K. Pichola
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|The book was interesting but a bit too far out there for me. The pictures were something new. I wish I could put the number of stars without writing an entire review.
B004ECDNJU|2.0|Welcome to 2112!  Amazon's resident idiot boldly goes where he has often been before...  Today's post was one of your greatest.  Look forward to these little gems of wit each morning.  Have a great new year.  Oh, I almost forgot--this is a game review site.  Well, Dragon Fire is worth what I paid for it. today--free.  Rather uninspired.  But thanks, anyway, to Amazon for your daily treats!
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Enough has been said about what a great voice she has, so that needs no further elaboration. She sings 21 completely, plus some very excellent covers, along with 1 or 2 songs from 19. Some people did not like the editing of the concert, but I thought it was appropriate to the setting and very professionally done. It did not have the badly done \\"jump\\" cuts that you see in some concert films.  Adele comes across as a real person, warts and all. I can recommend this DVD or Blu-Ray without reservation. She does use some foul language, so if that's a problem, get the edited version of the same concert.
0307474259|2.0|It has been very hard for me to get to the bottom line of Mr. Taubes book.  What I finally get after much struggle is that he thinks that research regarding human feeding has been faulty and inconclusive.  Not much argument there.  Hardly any research in this area is ever perfect.  I don't know how it could be.  Also, he says that there is a hypothesis which is contrary to the generally accepted assumptions but it needs and deserves more research.  The hypothesis is that we get fat not so much by eating fat but by eating refined starches and sugars that stimulate insulin and convert to fat.  We can always use more research, right?  Anyway, the problem is that he says that until that research is done, which may take at least a generation, we should take a leap of faith and go to the extremes of all that this hypothesis implies.  He criticizes others for taking leaps of faith but proposes one himself.  I think mostly what he has succeeded in doing is selling books that prey on the desperate hopes of the obese.  Better to go with Ornish or Fuhrman.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this series! Lots of twists and turns and keeps you coming back to watch it more and more! If you love vampire and werewolf movies, you will love this! Can't wait for Season 3 to come out on DVD!
B001NLKT60|5.0|wow.  I am so impressed with the writing of this book.  It seems to me that this book is better than the first book of the trilogy, \\"girl with the dragon tattoo\\" but maybe it is because I have become accustomed to the author's writing style.  My jaw dropped and I gasped out loud at some plot twists, and I found myself cheering out loud for Lisbeth.  I was hooked from the beginning, and I kept asking questions, which kept me reading..  I am about to purchase the 3rd book..
0671027344|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. Author develops the characters very well, and you can see how he put effort into Charlie's point of view. It draws you in and has good lessons. Very good read for young adults. Can easily become a classic.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|This works fine on fire even though no SD card.  I would pay a lot more. I mix the three sounds and run all night. helps block traffic noises and the music the ass next store plays day and night even if not home.  buy it and you wont be sorry.<br /><br />update: now use app on my droid razor maxx every night. have noisey kids next door (the noisy ass moved) and this really helps me to sleep later into the day as I am night person. Also great at campgrounds or really anywhere.  worth it to me to get pro version vs free as more sounds I can mix and match, volume control for each component of three max for each grouping, and ability to save different grouping to change if I want without starting from scratch.

0786958731|5.0|D&D is a staple in my household.  Video games are great...but this is better.  This is our second D&D board game, and it brings the family together.  I like that it helps my kid use his imagination instead of just spacing out at a computer monitor.  Fun for all!
0439023521|3.0|I purchased this book, because I was curious as to why people liked it so much. Honestly I found myself being bored with this book, and Suzanne Collins' style of writing did not draw me in. It's a good book for those who like action, but it did not appeal to me with the aspect of emotion. I like the idea as a whole and and the setting was well developed, but the characters did not do much for my taste.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I got this as a gift for someone and they loved it, I am so glad I used Amazon I received the item fast and with no issues I am very pleased with my purchase thank you :)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the app. It is flexible and I love the reading plans. The only thing I wish was a little differrent on the reading plans was a quicker way to go where you left off instead of whatever is set for the day.
B0063IH60K|3.0|size of cards is great and clearly visible. use of the 7 inch screen is awesome. but ads that pop up after every game; and an inability to win even a slight majority of the hands dealt make playing this version almost maddening.  unfortuantely it seems that this is the best version. of solitaire on the amazon market so I guess I'll have to deal with it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The makers of youversion have hit a homerun. this is the best Bible app available. with multiple versions and reading plans, notes &amp; community connections this app is terrific! highly recommend!

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I'm a regular list-maker and this app works just the way my brain does--love it! Easy-to-use, attractive, well-thought-out. And the cross-platform syncing works great, too. I have it on my Mac, my Kindle Fire and my iPod Touch.
B005ZUR724|4.0|and you people that are MAD because of the update, dont be mad at gameloft. amazon is just making sure there is no way anybody will have their info stolen. just be patient, 99&cent; isn't that much anyways.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|I am not an avid user of either the internet or purchasing items online. However I couldn't be more pleased with my recent purchase and the length of time it took to arrive. I have yet to see the same item cheaper any where. I am currently looking for a stereo receiver and will continue to check Amazon for any deals they may have.  Very Pleased
B004BJMEO6|5.0|I waited long to see this film... maybe too long. I am always eager to watch the latest lesbian releases, however I usually end up getting dissappointed by shallow stories and women that don't have enough professionalism to carry out their roles, or that are very good actors but simply don't have the chemistry it takes... That being said, I give \\"Elena Undone\\" a 5 star review (would give more if possible).<br /><br />Not only does the story have the deepness it takes to transmit emotion, but the chemistry between the two main roles (Necar Zadegan & Traci Dinwiddie) is nothing but delicious.<br /><br />Lesbian films usually fall short or just show so much they end up looking like a porn film. Elena Undone has the perfect mix, I could not help it but I just felt so related to the movie the 1st time I saw it (and every time later) by my past relationships and of those that are close to me... This movie is the real deal.<br /><br />The soundtrack is equally exquisite (listening to it while I write this review)... It is going to be difficult to go back to regular films after watching this one... Can't wait for the next Soul Kiss Films film.... :D
B004SUWR2C|5.0|This is for all of those bad reviews, y'all are just being idiots. UNO is a classic! I have it on both IPODs, my phone and now my Fire. To the people that griped how they had it on their android phone and have to purchase it again. As with everything else, you have to purchase from each company. When you buy something for your phone then unless Amazon is your phone provider, or where you purchased it, then yes, you have to buy it from them as well. I had it on my Nano and since that version was not compatible to my Touch,, I purchased it again because the game is that awesome. Now to the people who complained that it wasn't \\"UNO\\". This is UNO with a twist. You have to watch the directions for each set, it is not your basic normal UNO. You get to switch hands with people, you get to go out of turn, etc. You just have to pay attention! It's an awesome game and one of the first must have purchases on my new Fire.

B003DKJ5ZU|5.0|I caught this movie on my Tivo in Nov. 2011 and my 2yr old daughter loves watching it so much that I got her the Bluray/DVD combo for Xmas.  Compared to all the other movies that she likes to watch the Tinker Bell movies are much more enjoyable for parents to watch along with her.  It doesn't have any hidden jokes for adults like some other movies but it's also not so overly cutesy and annoying as other kid movies either.  Also if you're paying attention the later installments of the Disney Fairy series you'll see things carried forward from previous movies.  As a dad with a science and engineering background I appreciate the fact that Tinker Bell is a Tinker Fairy which means she builds and fixes stuff.  She's not a Disney Princess that is simply looking for a rich prince to marry.  That makes her a pretty good role model for a little girl (other than the fact that she's a fairy and not a human).  Also Tink isn't a perfect character.  By that I mean she makes mistakes and learns from them rather than doing everything perfectly all the time.  Her tinkering doesn't always go as planned and she tends to get mad when things go awry which only make things worse.  Eventually she learns to control her temper and fix her mistakes which is a good lesson for kids.  She also has to learn to ask for help from time to time which is another valuable lesson.  The Bluray and DVD are great as expected and the animation is top notch as you'd expect from Disney CG.  I use the Bluray in my PS3 on my big screen TV and the DVD in our portable player in the car when needed.  p.s. I'll be posting this on all of the Tinker Bell movies we've purchased since we like them all equally.

B000AQJPQE|3.0|The model was what I expected and compared to many other solar system models on Amazon this one is pretty good.  The description of the product must be for an older model.  Mine came with only 8 planets (no Pluto) and the batteries required are 3 AA for the model and 2 AAA for the remote control.  All of them look closer to what they should than some other kits but keep in mind the balls are plastic and have a shrink wrap image over them that doesn't cover the whole sphere.  The 8 planets vary in size and are somewhat in proportion even if they're not in a single scale. Mercury is the smallest (the size of a marble).  Earth and Venus are roughly the same size and about 1\\" in diameter. Mars is sized between Mercury and Earth as would be expected.  Now as you progress onto the gas giants the scale changes.  If they were to the same scale as the inner planets Jupiter would have to be 12\\" in diameter which it's not. Jupiter is the biggest followed by Saturn (it's rings are bigger around than Jupiter).  Neptune and Uranus are smaller than Saturn and about the same size as one another.<br /><br />Assembly was easy with no tools required except for a philips head screw driver to put the batteries in (kids toys seem to require a screw to hold the battery compartment closed).  Each planet has it's symbol marked on its south pole and has a specific anchor point on the rotating rings.  The inner planets all rotate on one ring which moves faster than the other ring that the outer planets rotate on.  The distance of each planet from the Sun are not to any kind of scale.  They're simply out further than one another from Mercury to Neptune.  As for mounting it on the ceiling ... if you don't want to drill big holes to use the included butterfly molly bolts I suggest going out to get a pack of 3M Command Strips for posters (http://www.amazon.com/Command-17024-Poster-Strips-12/dp/B000HHI6MA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1325461808&sr=8-1).  I put four strips on the mounting plate so that the removal tabs stick out and stuck it to the ceiling.  When the model is attached you can't see them and it doesn't weigh much so they should be more than enough to hold it up.<br /><br />If you're going to buy this (which I'm glad I did) you have to keep in mind this is not a scientifically accurate educational model.  If you tried to do that a 1\\" earth would mean a 12\\" Jupiter and a 10ft Sun which is completely impractical.  You can also forget having the planetary distances to any kind of consistent scale.  Don't believe me check out this online calculator. [...] With all that having been said, I put mine together and hung it on the ceiling of my 2yr old daughters room and she loves it.  At night she likes to point out the Moon and any planets in the sky (currently Jupiter) and so she likes having the whole solar system in her room.  She points out Jupiter on the model and asks the names of any she forgets.  She knows that Mercury and Venus are really hot and says \\"we have to blow on them.\\"<br /><br />My only real complaint about this product is that the light inside the Sun is really weak.  I plan on hacking the light and upgrading to a bunch of really bright LEDs.  I haven't tried to open it yet but there are screws holding the Sun together so you can presumably replace the bulb if it burns out.he removal tabs stick out and stuck it to the ceiling.

0345529057|3.0|I read somewhere that this guy's supposed to be the American Tolkien... If so, then he's defineitely a poor man's 2nd cousin 3 times removed and adopted to boot version. The story lines are interesting enough overall but not much happens to advance the storyline or develop the characters within each volume so you're left with partial characters meandering throughout the made up world with seemingly little purpose. Also, the author seems to relish in killing off the few likable characters and writes the remaining almost likable characters into situations that seem to hide the noble and shine the silliness. He also seems to build up to these almost moments (like Arya meeting up with Catelyn or Bran meeting up with Jon Snow) only to direct the storyline to a more senseless dramatic shift - almost like someone told him he needs to make sure the characters suffer more and really shouldn't have any happy moments along the tortuous journey their respective lives have taken.   The HBO series got me interested so I bought this to read further but should have just waited for the series instead. Anyone interested in signing a petition for the author to strike any future \\"You know nothing Jon Snow\\" sentences?

B002PQ7JQK|5.0|If you already own TOS on DVD, then I would be torn on whether to recommend this.  But if you don't own TOS, or you only own VHS I would highly recommend this purchase.  The much talked about special effects enhancements are not as exciting as you might think.  For the most part they are mostly just shots of the Enterprise from space, and view screen shots.  Still since the original effects are included as angle 2, you can easily compare the old v.s. the new.  What you'll discover is the old effects just did not scale well to high resolution, so if you are consistently watching angle 2, they will actually distract from the episode.  If you are watching the new special effects on angle 1, they just blend in well so you won't really notice them after the first couple of episodes.  Consequently, at DVD resolution it probably would not matter.  But if you are watching 1080p on a large screen TV the blu-ray with the enhanced effects is exactly what you want.  Chances are if you are reading this review your are huge Star Trek fan.  The cost works out to just a few dollars per episode, so you should just buy this and enjoy.

1400052181|5.0|The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks explores the life of a woman whose cells are used in medical laboratories worldwide.  Henrietta Lacks, an African-American woman living in Georgia, discovered that she was terribly ill and sought the help of doctors. In the 1950s, when segregation was loud and proud, Henrietta received treatment from white doctors. While Henrietta slowly died, her doctors discovered that her cells were immortal. That is to say they needed no assistance in multiplying. Her cells could be multiplied and used repeatedly in various research efforts. Before and after Henrietta's death, doctors collected tissue samples from her, without her or her family's consent, and began using her cells in medical research. Doctors would eventually sell her cells for hundreds of dollars while her children and family lived in poverty. The total amount of money generated from sales of the HeLa cells is in the billions.<br /><br />Rebecca Skloot spent years researching and writing this text. Her dedication to telling Henrietta's story is evident, and readers will appreciate her commitment to presenting the facts in an accurate and bias-free manner. Many of the concepts discussed in the text are complex, but Skloot breaks down the issues so that individuals who have a loose grasp on science can understand. This book examines medical ethics and race and how the two intersect. It is a compelling read that will encourage readers to think about their medical rights and how little control we have over the tissue samples and blood taken during routine medical examinations. Skloot's debut novel is thoughtful and engaging.<br /><br />You should read this book, because it is a fascinating account of a mother who died tragically, but whose cells continue to thrive today. The text will help you understand how African Americans have been used in medical experiments for years. If you are interested in learning more about medical experimentation and bioethics, this is the book for you.

1400069181|5.0|I received this book through the Books for Bloggers program.  I felt special that such an amazing company and group of people thought to invest in me by giving me the power to sound off with my opinions on this book.  I was right to feel flattered.  This book contains 1/3rd entrepreneurial business support, 1/3rd social change engine focus, and 1/3rd soul and love for humanity.  I found myself tearing up from just the beauty of humans caring about each other multiple times throughout this book.  I recommend this book to any entrepreneur, anyone hoping to manage or lead others, and finally to anyone that just wants to believe that a business can have a heart.  I was having trouble with having a focus in my own business.  Its a tiny start up but I wanted a portion of every sale to go to something that I believe in.  I am doing that now.  For every sale in my store 10% goes to research to fight Multiple Sclerosis.  I narrowed down what I was most passionate about and why.  I felt like Blake Mycoskie was speaking to me, through the whole book.  It was like receiving the type of mentoring that would be impossible with his busy schedule and my lack of accessibility to a famous and important person.  Not to mention, keeping with the whole one for one thing, for each book sold a book goes to a child in need.  Come on...soooooo good!  I like to take my hard earned money and buy myself things...but when I can do that and feel like I am supporting good dead doing in the world.  Ah-maz-ing.  I feel like there is nothing holding me back from not only achieving my dreams but battling a vicious disease that is threatening my friend and many other peoples family and friends.  Hmmm...all that from a book...from ideas.  I recommend this book.  I recommend it to anyone who needs a boost, pick me up, or renewed since of faith in humanity.    Very Respectfully, Janna Foland
B005HPY8LU|5.0|I watch very little mainstream media or news so I never really was introduced to Kelly, but when I saw that she supported Ron Paul I felt obligated to take a listen and I really like what I found. Thank you for supporting Ron Paul and for your beautiful music.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|This  app is very easy to use. I lke the yearly plans to read my bible. I also like the bookmark feature.  Great design.
0060873027|1.0|Any reader (myself included) has only himself to blame for going anywhere past the character list in the preface of this book, which says (in part):  \\"Karen King--Acrachnologist (expert in spiders, scorpions, and mites).  Skilled in martial arts.\\"  Yeah, right.  This is going to be great literature coming up.    And when the climax builds up to lines like \\"But wait--Rourke had armed the planes with machetes,\\" and \\"Rick tripped while leaping over a human hair, and he sprawled,\\" then you know it's all been a waste.  I really do enjoy wild stories along with anyone else.  I like Firefly and Mission Impossible.  I've watched some episodes of Warehouse 13 and of Fringe without shame.  A yarn well spun is fun.  But this is a really bad book.  It may use words like \\"nano\\" and \\"genomics\\" to seem up to date, but it's a bad B sci-fi movie from the Fifties.  It's the premise of \\"The Fly\\" and \\"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids\\" piled onto some nonsense about homicidal CEO's.  Don't waste your money on this, even if it's a used paperback on sale.

1609611543|5.0|I love this book and hope to God it is the answer for ME.  I have been obese for 30 years, am an insulin-dependent diabetic and now have sleep apnea, as well. Most of my fat is in my tummy. On July 11, 2011, I started a weight loss program that included joining a gym and hiring a trainer for 2 30-min sessions per week.  I went from 250 to 225 fairly rapidly, but then the weight loss stopped, because I was eating too much and not drinking enough water. I was making better food choices, but could NOT control portion sizes.  Today is the 14th day I have been without wheat, as a result of reading this book and I am very encouraged.  Two weeks ago, I was back up at 231 and today I weigh 228.  I genuinely feel better, have a decreased appetite and decreased cravings. On Christmas, I ate too many mixed nuts, but I did NOT eat a single cookie or other source of wheat. It seems that I am not as annoyed with people and situations as I have been.  Finally, I am stronger in the gym!  I do 30 yards of a Bear Crawl as part of a set of exercises, repeated 3 times.  I used to struggle to do each one, stopping once or twice along the way every time.  After being off the wheat for only 4 days, I did all three Bear Crawls without stopping once.  I had done the first one without stopping but never the second or third.  That Thursday, I not only did two, I did 3! Last Monday, I cleaned out my refrigerator and pantry and then went to the grocery and got gluten-free products for my newly chosen life style.  I also purchased two gluten-free cook books from Amazon and I am on my way.  Yesterday, I bought 34 more training sessions. Try this! I'm increasingly hopeful day by day and no, I do not have celiac disease, but am doing this strictly to loose weight in a healthy and permanent way.  Joanne

B002BU0DPE|2.0|I received this headset for my birthday in 2011 and that was towards the beginning of the year.  I had a great experience with them because I never had to charge them or worry about them breaking until December came. I put the headset on and one of the pieces that held the ear cushion with the headband snapped and made the one part just fall off and only the one wire held it together.  I never treated these badly so I wondered what was wrong.  Then a couple weeks later the other side snapped too after I sort of fixed the other side(I just used a metal thing to hold it together).  So if you are wanting to buy this headest, the sound is great just remember this headset might break on you. I looked it up and a lot of people had thisa same problem. I am probably going to buy another headset that has better reviews or made by Sony themselves.

B004EPYZU8|5.0|This movie definitely requires a certain taste in movies and an open mind. Out of all the people I've asked if they liked it, my mom & I have been the only ones that really liked it! The sound track is also great! :) If you can very easily decipher whats going to happen next in movies you'll have fun with this one, parts are predictable while other aren't. :) I say give it a try if you havent already! It wont hurt right? :)
0553584537|4.0|Good thriller which begins when State Trooper Bobby Dodge is called to a hostage situation and is forced to kill a man threatening to kill his wife and son.  Naturally things are never as simple as it they seem and all hell breaks out.  On the one hand I stayed up late to finish it so it clearly kept me in suspense.  On the other I felt that some of the set-ups were too familiar for comfort.  I also felt that some of psychological analysis of the main character was simplistic.  This is supposed to be the first in the Gardner's D.D. Warren series, but surprisingly she plays a minor role in the story.
B0061JPYX2|4.0|This posthomous release of Winehouse's music is a sad reminder of the talent the world lost with her demise but wonderful display of the artist's talent and range.  From soulful hits to updated classics (girl from Ipanema) there's no sign that producers struggled to find enough appropriate material to release this album.  Philosophically though, I wonder whether it's fair to an artist's legacy like Amy Winehouse to release their work after their demise seeing as there's no way to know which of the pieces she would or wouldn't have wanted to be tied to public.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I really love this game.  The music is wonderful and the graphics are cool too.  I would recommend this app to everyone.

Her vocals are amazing-and she actually sings every song!! The dancers are incredible! Above all the sets are phenominal-unlike anything I have ever seen. I purchased this 3d version in hopes of owning a 3d TV sometime in the near future, so for now the 2d will have to do, however I have to tell you...I just might break down and buy the 3d TV just to see this concert in all its glory!!! That is how GREAT it is!! I am a fan of Kylie and a huge fan of her last CD Aphrodite!! I didn't know she was such a great live performer. WOW Kylie!!

B0063GORYU|5.0|Good game to keep you occupied.  It is rather basic,  but doesn't lack anything necessary to run properly. I recommend it highly.
B005ZUR724|3.0|its a great game, controls are pretty good. a little glitchy but nothing game breaking.  Interaction with real people is lacking.  servers are never populated high...why not have less servers?  I dont like that you have to pay for a 3 month subscription AND charge for things in the game as well.  I dont like being nickel and dimed at every turn.  pick a payment method, monthly subscription or in game payments, NOT BOTH.

B006BDHAX0|2.0|It's difficult to enjoy a game when it continually freezes up and/or crashes. But for free it's a solid game if I am able to play it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love this game. Yes you have to earn points to unlock the games but that's part of challenge of it. Some of the controls could use a little tweeking to work more effiently but it is still a great game.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I bought this game based on the reviews and I was certainly not disappointed.  It passes the time and challenges your mind at the same time.  I play a little bit everyday just to get the brain juices flowing.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really like being able to play anywhere.  It is so much like having an Ipad.  This is a great game.

B004ECDNJU|5.0|Simple game that has been well thought out.  Straight forward controls that's easy to learn.  Don't be lame and downgrade an app because you're colorblind.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|This DVD/CD is just awesome!!!! I received it safely packaged! Definitely recommend you buy it!! Great music from a great voice!
B005GVA2L0|5.0|I love this latest album from Evanescence!  Amy's vocals are so strong, and I love all the different musical influences in the chord structures (Hindi, etc.).  I naturally love complex music, and this whole collection is really lovely.  There's head-banging metal to rev you up to ballads that will make you swoon.  At first it didn't hit me all the nuances in each track, but as I kept listening, I caught more and more phrasing and new intriguing sounds.  I'm thoroughly hooked!

B0067QPVD2|5.0|My expectations were low and I was BLOWN AWAY! Great prequel, fills in gaps. Quality, cast, story first rate. Others crying about CGI - they would have cried anyway even if they didn't use it. Get a life. Looked fine to me. If you loved the JC 1982 version, you will love this prequel. Remember to stay for the credits - truly awesome tie-in. Something you don't see much these days.

B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Great price for what you get, if you are a fan of the movies (or even just the first one) it's great to have the extra disc with additional behind the scenes material
0385343175|5.0|The book arrived earlier than expected which is a big plus.......in perfect condition, the price for the book and shipping price was less than I anticipated.

No complaints.<br /><br />I ordered this book through Amazon which I will continue to use.

0385334176|4.0|Inaction is action. Like the symbolic neutron bomb that wipes out the inhabitants of Midland City leaving all the inanimate stuff intact, Rudy's attempt to make himself a \\"neuter\\" hurts those around him. For example his insistence on referring to himself as a \\"murderer\\" breaks up one of his brother's marriages. even so he does succeed in limiting his effect on the physical world as he builds no family and has no lovers. For him after the neutron bomb wipes everyone out, nothing has changed. I read this while struggling with my own guilt over a bad thing I did in my past, and while Vonnegut says point blank that Rudy's accidental shooting in his childhood of a pregnant woman is meant to stand for \\"all the bad things I have done\\", don't expect any feelgood message about forgiving yourself or letting the guilt go. The message I took from it is that causing others pain is inevitable for a living being, and since some things you do or don't do will have bad side effects, trying to do nothing - to be a neuter - will have bad consequences too, except it is even worse because by its nature that life won't lead to anything good; it's pure bad side effects.  Take Rudy's father's friendship with Hitler before he became the devil. \\"Only an hour before, Hitler had sold his overcoat so that he could get a little something to eat, even  though winter was coming on. So there is a chance that, if it weren't for my father, Hitler might have died of pneumonia or malnutrition in 1910 [...] My father could have strangled the worst monster of the century, or simply let him starve or freeze to death. But he became his bosom buddy instead. That is my principal objection to life, I think: it is too easy, when alive, to make perfectly horrible mistakes.\\" But if Rudy's father had strangled Hitler when he was a nobody, Rudy's father would have gone either to jail or, if he had tried to convince people that Hitler was going to become the next Hitler, to a nuthouse. To anyone who did not know Hitler's destiny - which would have been everyone - letting him freeze to death would seem a perfectly horrible mistake. Rudy does not know that the baby in the belly of the pregnant woman he accidentally shot would not have been the next Hitler, but the lack of punishment for Rudy - the pregnant woman's widower, rather than taking an opportunity to beat Rudy up, writes a statement in the newspaper blaming firearms rather than Rudy - seems the worst possible punishment as Rudy is blessed with the curse of a mind that always finds ways to punish itself. So it goes.

B002WCLG48|1.0|I'm a halo fan and have played all the games and read most of the novels. Each of these short stories had Elements that were inconsistent with facts from the other media. Most of the shorts didn't fit the mood of the halo universe. It's a fail.
B004EPZ06Q|1.0|The first Movie was Great. This second one was totally stupid. I forced myself to laugh once. The acting was lame, story line had promise, writer and producers should be embarrased.

B000B5XOY8|5.0|SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />\\"Batman,\\" director Tim Burton's 1989 film, is a modern classic of its genre and is arguably the original standard-bearing film in the \\"Batman\\" filmography.  Starring Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson, it redefined the character after decades of prominence for the more campy Adam West TV series and movie.<br /><br />The screenplay is extremely sharp, as a whole yielding an involved, relatively deep story which draws a compelling connection between Batman and The Joker, and gives each character a considerable amount of depth. Both Mr. Keaton and Mr. Nicholson offer exceptional performances in giving, for the time, the definitive portrayals of their respective characters.  There are also a wealth of one-liners throughout the script which reveal the characters in witty, pointed fashion.<br /><br />The supporting cast is also exceptional; from Michael Gough appearing in the first of four \\"Batman\\" films as Alfred, Bruce Wayne's butler and closest confidante, to Kim Basinger as Vicki Vale, ace reporter and increasingly mystified girlfriend to Bruce Wayne.  Billy Dee Williams also appears as idealistic District Attorney Harvey Dent.<br /><br />Also featuring a classic dramatic score by Danny Elfman, \\"Batman\\" is highly recommended as both a companion piece to Christopher Nolan's great \\"Batman\\" films, and is a towering classic of the superhero film genre in its own right.

0380730405|4.0|Don't worry, my review is not going to give away any key plot points. In fact, I'm not even going to discuss the plot since the suspense of this novel rides on the story's unpredictable twists and turns. \\"Rebecca,\\" published in 1938, is a Gothic thriller in the tradition of \\"The Mysteries of Udolpho\\" and \\"Jane Eyre.\\" All of the elements required for a creepy Gothic romance are here: 1) a Byronic hero haunted by his past who may or may not be a villain; 2) a beautiful dead woman, the novel's titular character; 3) a mysterious stone mansion overlooking the sea; 4) a village idiot, who appears to know more about Rebecca's death than he lets on; 5) a scary housekeeper; and 5) a high-strung, impressionable narrator given to reverie and fits of bravery who periodically is seized with the urge to explore the mansion's uninhabited west wing.<br /><br />Daphne DuMaurier has a special gift for creating ambience. In \\"Rebecca,\\" Manderley, the ancient estate in Southern England where most of the novel's action takes place, becomes a character unto itself. Manderley, with its high-vaulted ceilings and stone terraces, its lawns extending down to the sea, its woods, its coves, its gardens, is at once welcoming and forbidding. DuMaurier uses botanical imagery to convey these contradictory qualities: \\"blood-red\\" rhododendrons, impressive yet ominous, form a wall fifty feet high at the entrance to the house; in the wood, which is carpeted with bluebells, beauty commingles with horror as the flower-filled \\"Happy Valley\\" abruptly gives way to the sea and the cove where Rebecca died; beech trees \\"with white, naked limbs\\" come together like an arch over the serpentine driveway leading to house, creating a claustrophobic atmosphere. Throughout the book, flower imagery is used to sustain tension; the character of Rebecca is associated with the intoxicating fragrance of Manderley's azaleas.<br /><br />DuMaurier is quite skilled at keeping the reader in doubt as to which characters are the good guys and which characters are the bad guys. Is ghoulish housekeeper as evil as she seems? Is the brooding owner of Manderley to be trusted? Is the narrator, whose name is never mentioned, a reliable source? And what was Rebecca __really__ like? This is a great novel and a fast read. I highly recommend it. There's a reason why it's considered a classic.od guys and which characters are the bad guys.

B005Z271Y6|3.0|Obviously I am missing something.  Adele is universally loved.  Just read all the five star reviews. That's why we bought the concert. I agree with some of the technical critcisms of the blu ray disc, but they didn't bother me too much.  I find most of her songs boring, with most sounding to me like the previous one.  Her voice is powerful even though at this concert it was obvious she wasn't 100%. Her between song patter was also very difficult for me to understand.  She does not speak a sophisticated English, and the between song patter is like the disclaimers you hear at the end of a radio ad.  You know, motor mouth. She can be funny when you can understand it.  It would have helped greatly if there were subtitles to turn on.  That way you could get familiar with the song lyrics easier and understand the patter.   One last thing.  Her voice was so over amplified with an annoying echo to it as well.    I love all kinds of music but I was very disappointed in this performance. I know she has a great voice. I'd love to hear her perform some music outside of whatever this was.    I await my beating!!

B0015DROBO|2.0|The opening chapter starts out with the intriguing and slightly eery mystery about a series of framed wildflowers arriving on the yearly anniversary of Harriet Vangers disappearance. However, the next hundred pages delve into the Vanger family history, providing far too little in clues, suspects, or red herrings.<br /><br />Interspersed is the acquiescing trial of journalist Mikael Bloomkvist. We learn that this main character is sensitive, politically liberal, easily duped, and likes coffee and sandwiches. His main nemesis is a Hans-Erik Wennerstrom, who never appears in the book. With no job and his white collar prison time looming, Bloomkvist is invited up to the isolated Vanger estate to investigate the 40 year old case of Harriet Vanger.<br /><br />The secondary protagonist, Lisbeth Salander, is an anorexic, punk dressing, drop out. She has a photographic memory, which she is embarrassed by, and crazy mad hacking skills, which she accomplishes on her store bought Apple laptop. And yet, she can't even manage her own bank account despite being able to manipulate the accounts of the most wealthy man in Sweden.<br /><br />I did like how Bloomkvist and Salander were on the surface so opposite, yet underneath both were emotionally sensitive, with a strong moral compass, and a craving for isolation. Their \\"political correctness\\" leads them to making a very unusual, but pleasing, decision on how to serve justice to the criminals.<br /><br />The violence does not seem disproportionate to the story. Most of it happens offstage, read to us through old newspaper accounts. Of the three violent acts that happen live in the story, two of those where inflicted onto men. To be sure, violence against women is a major subject of this novel and addressing this problem is a serious and worthy topic. Which makes it all the more perplexing and insulting that the English language title: The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, would be describing a 24 year old, smart, independent, and powerful woman. And again, as a 26 year old woman in The Girl Who Played With Fire, and still older in The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest.<br /><br />As a social commentary, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo has some merit. But, as a mystery it is pedestrian. It has the length and scope of a literey novel, but lacking in poetry or wit.man in The Girl Who Played With Fire, and still older in The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest.

0446573019|3.0|Baldacci has been real busy this year, and I am getting confused. So many different books, so many different styles. From \\"One summer\\" to \\"Zero Day\\" and counting. Not that the book is bad. It is a Reacher look alike  and I suspect  the first in a new series. It might work but it needs improving. Too many technical descriptions,  a very weak plot and an even weaker ending which defies logic. Still, one keeps on reading (while skipping a few pages here and there). So - three stars, mainly because it's an engaging hero. Maybe the next one will be better.

B001UV4XJ2|1.0|I'm not reviewing the movie itself, but rather want to address the digital copy. Instead of using the industry standard iTunes / Windows Media options as in the past, Warner Brothers is trying to push their own proprietary \\"Ultraviolet\\" content protection scheme. So, not only do you need to download the Flixster app on your desktop + your mobile device, but you need TWO new accounts (Flixter and Ultraviolet) to keep track of and log into.   This isn't being done to combat piracy, meanwhile, it's just a cash grab. WB hopes users will switch from iTunes to Flixster and share more personal information with WB. But unlike iTunes, all you get is a horrible and inconsistent user experience, one that I predict is likely to disappear in a few years rendering your digital copy worthless (as opposed to iTunes, which is currently a monster and powerhouse).  WB needs to get their heads out of their behinds and realize that if they make digital copies hard to work with, people will save money and buy the regular disk, then crack the encryption and make their own with the Handbrake converter software. Additionally, what the heck is up with all of these digital copies having EXPIRATION DATES? I bought Deathly Hallows Pt1 and couldn't get the digital copy because I waited for it to go on sale. Another reason to make your own digital copies is that you can't be punished for not buying on launch day.

B004FOA84A|1.0|I read through the reviews and people said it was relaxing. They said they were disappointed that it was so easy. I wondered if we were all playing the same game! This was one of the worst games I've played. Had NO idea where to look, what to do next... I had to get cheats for it and I hate that! Don't. waste even the .99 for it. Even the end was awful! If I could get a refund I would.

He could not wait until he got back to his house later in the week to watch so we just had to get him in quiet place and turned on this movie.

B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a great game and easy to play on the kindle fire. I played the windows version a great deal prior to this app and the games are relatively the same.

0439023521|5.0|At first I was reluctant to pick up this book because I thought it wouldn't be my kind of read, but once I got past a couple chapters, I was hooked. Usually I am not a person who reads for hours a day, but when I began to learn more about Katniss' and Peeta's fate and their journey into the arena, I couldn't put the book down.   Suzanne Collins' fantasy involves the future of North America, a new country called Panem. Panem is divided into different districts, which are all ruled by the corrupt Capitol. Every year there is a type of \\"event\\" run by the Capitol, called The Hunger Games, which forces 24 teenagers into an arena. The object of the game? To be the last one alive. The book revolves around the District 12 competitors, Katniss and Peeta, and their struggles in the horrid arena. Collins' imaginative obstacles and tortures in the arena caused me a spew of emotions, which ultimately made me want to continue reading.  This book is definitely a read for all ages. If you want to read a quick and exciting fantasy, read The Hunger Games. I can't wait to read the next two books of this trilogy!
B0067BERKU|4.0|This is a good set of tracks for someone that is just now learning of the Gorillaz.  Its got a lot of good songs and the videos are cool.  The videos, because they are videos, are good sized.  If you are concerned about hard drive space be aware that this album is larger than the average CD.
0439023491|5.0|As Catching Fire is the second installment of the Hunger Games series, I was expecting a bit of a downgrade in action and suspense. The first book ends with the protagonist, Katniss Everdeen, winning the Seventy-Fourth Hunger Games, so I was suspecting the story to be a little dry knowing going in to read it that Katniss was now wealthy and not in need to hunt anymore, which used to be her entire life. However, I was fortunately mistaken - the novel was filled with page-turning action and conflicting emotions with Katniss's best childhood friend, Gale Hawthorne, and her fellow Hunger Games victor, Peeta Mellark.<br /><br />Since the Seventy-Fifth Hunger Games, the Quarter Quell, occurs this year, a new sense of danger emerges within the districts - and no one, not even those exempt from future Hunger Games, is safe. A spark has been lit, and Katniss Everdeen becomes a symbol of danger to the Capitol, and a symbol of hope to the districts. Endangering her friends, family, and even her fellow district twelve members by her actions, Katniss strives to set a rebellion into action that she hopes will \\"catch fire\\" and persuade the districts to take action against the tyrannical Capitol.<br /><br />This is a book I could barely put down, due to wanting to discover the fates of the characters and how the plot would unravel. Collins also envelops suspenseful cliffhangers at the end of almost every chapter, making it almost impossible to leave the story behind. After reading this novel, it left me asking myself questions, wanting them answered as soon as possible, and wishing only to read the last book of the series.
B004ECDNJU|2.0|game gets depressingly boring after a few levels same thing over and over .  if its free go for it if not forget it
B000ATQYT2|5.0|This is a brilliant and deservedly great movie, and one of our family's very favorites. Congratulations to whoever was responsible for removing that dreadful song in the middle of this 2005 edition! What a great move! I have always had to fast forward through it. It was truly horrid. Such a relief and a real joy to watch now from beginning to end! That song should have ended up on the cutting room floor a long time ago. The Muppets are wonderful, captivating, hilarious, and, in the case of Miss Piggy as Emily Cratchet, sublimely funny, and Michael Cane is a revelation as Ebenezer Scrooge. Timeless.
0439023521|5.0|I closed the book, found my car keys, and drove to Barnes & Noble to buy the second part of this trilogy. I couldn't wait for Amazon Prime's two-day shipping; I needed to start the sequel sooner than that.<br /><br />I had hardly put the book down by the time my wife picked it up. She stayed up until 1 reading it. She loves it. I'm not sure that I'll finish the second book soon enough for her.<br /><br />Yes, The Hunger Games is in the young adult genre -- Amazon recommends it for Grade 7 and up. Yes, I felt judgmental eyes wondering at my choice in literature as I read on the train. But yes, you will enjoy this book.<br /><br />Don't assume the popularity is a passing fad. Ms. Collins has written a fantastic tale for all ages.
B004B8RXQQ|5.0|I had heard about Sherlock from some friends of mine, and I was immediately skeptical. I love the canon stories; always have since I got them from our library as a young teenager. But my friends told me they thought I'd actually like it, so I got online to watch the trailer. That intrigued me! I saw enough of the Sherlock Holmes references to reassure me that the writers probably also had a deep respect for the original work, yet a modern-day version was a fantastic idea--if it could be pulled off well. And it was! I saw the first two episodes back-to-back last night from Netflix and I'm completely ready to watch more! I just hope this series continues for a very long time--at least long enough to adapt all the best of the canon stories into today's world! :) As long as the show remains as excellent as the first season, I have no complaints. Very well done, gentlemen!!
B0000AI44Q|5.0|Best concert I ever saw. He performed for 3 hours straight.  And I saw the Rolling Stones do Exile on Main Street, Tom Petty, Traffic, ect. made those concerts look and sound like kids  And have to give Crazy Horse credit also. His last song was the Star Spangle Banner. I was numb!    Michael D Kubicki
B003YFIUW8|4.0|I think that having Jack narrate gives this book a unique style.    The first half really grabs you and sucks you in.  I couldn't read it fast enough.  The second half is harder to read.  There are some inconsistencies in the second half.  I had a hard time understanding how Jack knows such big words, but his language was so poor.  In the first half it was consistent.    The subject is so interesting.  To try to imagine what a child would understand about the world when he had been raised without it, is huge!  I give the author kudos on doing her research.  Ma is an appealing character.  As a mother, I found that she was so strong!  So heroic!  She did things to survive but mostly to protect Jack.    Great book!

I saw it in the store and contemplated buying it, I had book cash totalling $20.  It was so big, though, and I'd gotten a Kindle Fire for Christmas, so I bought the Kindle version instead.  I can't wait until the movie is made (although the movies haven't been nearly as good as the books). If you love Stephen King, this book is for you!

B0011UJMK2|5.0|I don't often write reviews but I read this book and absolutely couldn't put it down. For one thing it is quite educational and shocking because of it. Also I believe that the incident in the book was based on something that actually happened but not exactly the way the book depicts it. I don't want to give it away so no details on that event from me. This is the kind of book that I keep and read again. It's still hard to believe how people were treated during those times.

I have been listening to this for six months now and I just find this music to be absolutely beautiful and interesting and the list of musical guests only enhance each track. Fantastic!
B0058VW36U|5.0|Amazon is new to this whole thing.... And the update was just recently realeased for the kindle, so just stop complaining and chill bros! Anyway amazing game, well worth the money - have a wonderful 2012!

0143038419|5.0|(Audio version) As a depth psychotherapist, I found this book captivating and the author's experiences absolutely authentic. I applaud Ms Gilbert's bravery in baring her soul and exposing her conflicts to the world. We all want to get over our hang-ups, find our true selves, and live our lives to the fullest, but few will do the soul-searching necessary to accomplish it. When in anguish, Ms Gilbert uses her journal to dialogue with her inner voice, and finds solace. Some call this inner voice God. Jungians call it the Self. Jung developed the method of inner dialogue, but it is an ancient and valid practice. In her journey, Gilbert opens herself to her scariest and most shameful (to her) parts, and not only examines them, but welcomes and accepts them. This is the essence of analytical work. One can accomplish it in the consulting room, in an ashram, or anywhere one can find a psychologically safe space in which to do it. It does not require travel or money. Readers who are disappointed at not being presented with the secrets of the universe miss a subtle point. Each person's experiences are different. We tend to forget that once we have experienced an enlightened state, we must bring our insights into the world and live them concretely. If we stay in our heads we have learned nothing. Through self-examination and inner dialogue, Gilbert puts her previously complex-ridden ego on the back burner so her behavior is no longer dictated by it. Her actions in the end of the story are clearly those of an integrated person who has learned to consult her whole self in making choices.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|From a more technical, literary standpoint, The Hunger Games is written in an extremely simple fashion. It isn't particularly eloquent or overly descriptive. However, its tone is perfectly suited for a young adult reader. Set in the (very dark) future of North America, the general plot surrounds a suppressed and demoralized populace smothered by a spiteful, totalitarian government. In this world, starvation is common and the death of children by means of forced gladiator-style combat is the highest form of entertainment. The characters in the story feel beautifully flawed and carry a level of striking realism that contrasts wonderfully with their far-fetched, dystopic surroundings. The protagonist, Katniss, is faced with unbelievable hardship, violence, and impossible choices, which engages even the most demanding and seasoned adult reader. This book is a must-read for all lovers of adventure, suspense, tragedy, and justice.
B003VANOFY|5.0|This headset is by far, the best headset I've used for long-term gaming.  Sound quality is excellent.  Battery life outlives however long I spend on gaming.  Integration works seamlessly with both Vent and LotRO in-game voice chat.  As a female gamer, I often find that headsets are way too large for my ears or my head.  This one is neither, it fits comfortably and snugly all while delivering excellent voice/audio.  I typically hot-key the G-buttons for separate applications, but they also work easily for push-to-talk while I'm away from my keyboard.  Given the change, I'd certainly recommend this headset for my friends.
014241543X|4.0|I read this novel for two days straight. I loved it. I needed to find out what happened to Mia. It felt very real to me, the event that landed her in this situation. It made me realize how precious and delicate life really is. I loved how Mia bounced back and forth from her being in her situation to telling stories of her family members and friends. Memories of everything that came together in her decision at the end of the book.  I did feel a little unsatisfied by the ending of the novel. Leaving a cliff hanger. (Thusly the 4 stars). But I suggest that you read the 2nd novel (Where She Went) RIGHT after finishing this book. After reading the 1st and 2nd novel in 3 days, all my unsatisfied feelings I was left with by the 1st book were completely gone. Everything explained, and putting both of the novels together I would give them 5 STARS as a package.  Please read both of them! They are amazing books! I very much enjoyed them on my Kindle and have them saved to suggest to my other friends. I wish I had bought hard copies of both of these books though, so I could pass the books around with my friends to read.
B004ECDNJU|5.0|does exactly as it says it does. five stars to balance rating, would give it four normally. Doesn't steal your info or screw with settings. Game is decent, especially for free.
B005W3G2D4|1.0|I'm a huge fan but this is not a good album. Please do not waste your money. I love Kelly Clarkson's rock music even the country tune done with Jason Aldean was phenomenal but this poppy crap has gotta go! She is trying to be something akin to katy Perryish and it sucks. I can't believe she even released this trash! So disappointing!!!
B001HN6922|5.0|I bought this as a gift for an adult who likes animation movies.  There was nothing wrong with DVD or transaction.  His comment was on the storyline, not as good as the first.  That didn't stop him from watching it again the next day.
B000J5XS3C|4.0|This mixer is perfect for the price that is specified. Although the blue LED power light is near blinding; the overall quality and functionality of this product is fantastic.   I would suggest this anyone who is on a budget and would want a good quality mixer.

B004EPZ06Q|1.0|I concur with just about everyone else who watched Hangover Part II just because we enjoyed the original Hangover.  The original was good for about a thousand laughs and was so original.  The sequel is just depressing and was good for maybe 1/2 of a laugh.  No hot women in this one folks, instead you get to see male junk.  The torture they put the characters through is a bit unbearable to watch, you think you are watching a horror movie.  Couldn't they have one joke in this movie at least?  One laugh?  The screenwriters probably wrote the script while high on coke it seems like.  In any case I didn't watch this movie in the theatres thank god even though this movie became the highest grossing Rated R movie of all time.  Just awful, don't see it.

B0063IH60K|4.0|This version of Solitaire is very fun to play but not as fun as that which is preset into the iPod Classic. I enjoy this version vlbetter than that on the computer though for some reason I cannot state why. If you're looking to have a fun time playing Solitaire on your Kindle or such, then I do recommend this one.
B000DZ6VAK|5.0|Uchida is among the very top players of Mozart in the world today.  This set of Mozart Piano Concertos demonstrates this fact very well.  Everything is well-played, and the sound is perfect.  This is a great reference set to refer to for Mozart Piano Concertos!
B004ECDNJU|3.0|Perhaps it's part of the &quot;difficulty&quot; setting speed bar thing, but i'd really like the ability to hold down a button to speed things up momentarily. I was expecting a &quot;swipe to deflect&quot; mechanic, but instead it is a &quot;click the intersections&quot; type. Worth it as a FAOTD, wouldn't pay for it, or play it very much.
B000069KJ0|5.0|To put it quite simply, I don't think you can go wrong with this complete set.  I like this as much as Bolet's, but this set is complete.  Berman takes a more \\"virtuosic\\" approach to these pieces, while I think Bolet plays them a bit slower and more poetic.  I found no problems with the sound at all.  Great set for sure.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This case is perfect for me.  I can't imagine a better case. The case is super light weight but still feels very durable.  It's professional which makes it good for meetings.  It doesn't feel like a case... instead it feels like it's a part of the device... like it is the Kindle Fire and not something wrapped around it.  Easy to use and even looks cool.  I really can't say enough good things.  I hate extra bulk... I like to travel very light... and then case is PERFECT! Very good product AND the packaging was Eco-Friendly.  It's not really a selling point, but it's cool to see the company take that extra step.
B0042LJTQO|5.0|This is my favorite set of Schubert works for piano.  I don't think you can go wrong with Brendel's Schubert or his Beethoven.  He is renowned for playing these two composer's works probably more than anything else he plays.  This would make a wonderful addition to your classical piano library!
B00005JOA0|4.0|It does not stick to the book but it is still a good movie. It is realistic and really makes it easy for you to hate her husband.
B0000012XV|5.0|When I think of Debussy's piano music, the first pianist who comes to mind is Michelangeli.  His playing is effortless.  The sound quality of the recordings is first class.  I prefer his Debussy to Gieseking as the sound quality is a huge improvement.  Get this & hear how Debussy's piano music is supposed to sound!
B004QK5N5W|5.0|This is a great product to own for anyone with a Hi-Def TV.  I use this product mainly to display netflix on my TV through my iPad. You should also note that with most apple accessories you may have trouble using this item if you have an aftermarket case installed on your ipad.
0439023491|5.0|After surviving The Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen thought her life would be easier from then on.  However, the Capitol is facing uprisings throughout the districts and Katniss is the face and symbol for the rebellion.  President Snow of the Capitol is determined to teach her and all the districts a lesson in the most cruel way imaginable.<br /><br />While not quite as good as The Hunger Games (which had me unable to put down the book at all), this is still an excellent read which shows the reader a bit more of all the different districts and the Capitol.  Looking forward to Mockingjay.
B0058EBNAO|3.0|I use the 4x1 widget and it no longer shows future data. Only todays data. The app itself works great.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I greatly enjoyed GRRM first 3 books.  I even enjoyed A Feast for Crows more or less.  I was yearning for some action and/or resolution in this book.  I thought for sure we'd see the dragons finally controlled and used by Dany- nope.  Maybe Jon Snow would come into his own somehow - House Stark or lead the Watch against the wights- nope.  Tyrion would do something of consequence- nope just wander around.  There was lots of wandering around and not much action or resolution.  There was a lot of rape and flaying though.  George, I got it already.  Ramsey Snow/Bolton is evil!<br /><br />Bottom line is it is a drawn out book with some interesting threads but nothing gets resolved. You are left wanting much and more.  I guess I'll just have to wait another 5 years and hope GRRM closes the story lines (or one of them) in the next book.

B001E7X4M4|3.0|This record has some pretty cool riffs, but not many hooks. Some pretty good lyrics, but iffy vocals. Some pretty fancy instrumentation, but boring songwriting. I've loved Unearth since 2004's The Oncoming Storm, which is my favorite record of theirs. True, bands change and evolve and I accept and welcome that notion. But on this record Unearth sounds like they have run out of ideas. They capture some great guitar work and musicianship, but fail to write anything that really sticks in your head, except for \\"My Will Be Done\\" and \\"The Chosen,\\" which are the two best tracks from the album. Trevor's vocals also seem different. It's like he's yelling now, not screaming. I still like his voice, just not as much. He writes great lyrics though. Overall, this is a good album. I own it and like it. But I probably listen to it once or twice a year, whereas I listen to The Oncoming Storm and III: In The Eyes of Fire once a month or so.

1591843790|3.0|\\"They are joined one to another,<br />They stick together and cannot be parted.\\" -- Job 41:17 (NKJV)<br /><br />Enchantment is Guy Kawasaki's extension of Robert Cialdini's classic, Influence, in trying to integrate lessons from behavioral psychology to the level of creating a marketing program that makes enough of a lasting impression with a superior offering to make people change their habits. The book is mostly based on summarizing research done by others, with examples drawn either from the research methods or Mr. Kawasaki's personal experiences as a consumer. For someone who wants to understand how to be more influential in encouraging engagement and stickiness, the book is a decent summary that will save reading a lot of other sources and assembling them into a program. However, the book doesn't add much beyond being a digest of that research.<br /><br />I mainly disagree that the book lays out a program for creating \\"enchantment,\\" a psychological state that captures how people behave when they are doing something they love, just for the joy of it . . . such as finger painting with a child and not caring about the mess while having a giggling good time. Now a book with a title like \\"Enchantment\\" is going to sell a lot more copies than one about \\"Engagement and Stickiness\\" so I don't blame him for using it . . . but I think he's overselling his contents.<br /><br />I appreciate that Mr. Kawasaki clearly states that he is on the side of ethical \\"enchantment.\\" I found that the advice didn't always seem to match up with that standard. One glaring example is calculating how much swearing to do and when to make the best possible impression on listeners. To me, that seems more manipulative than enchanting.<br /><br />A lot of behavior is also defined so narrowly that it will create an impression, but one that may well be forced . . . rather than free flowing. Smiling is a good example. Study the smiling countenance of some celebrity you like. Chances are you'll feel that you are in the same room with the person, and that you are being looked upon as if you were the celebrity's favorite person in the world. That can be enchanting for brief periods of time until you realize that the celebrity is really just putting on a practiced smile for a camera. It's an act.<br /><br />Personally, I have been much more impressed in my business career by people who expressed actual interest in talking to me, acted with the absolutely highest integrity in every little thing, and honestly told me their innermost thoughts about what was good and not-so-good about their offerings. I didn't quite get that sense here. It was more like being prepared to put lipstick on a pig and present the pig as the greatest thing ever.<br /><br />I think the lessons and the storytelling would have gone a lot better if they had been applied to a recent launch of an offering that Mr. Kawasaki helped with. Then, the practical problems would have been more obvious, and some good advice could have been presented about how to apply the research. But perhaps Mr. Kawasaki is more of a speaker than a marketing consultant. It was hard to tell from reading the book.<br /><br />There's a quiz at the end that emphasizes remembering factoids from the book, rather than how to integrate the pieces together. That's emblematic of the book's overall limitations: It's more a pile of pieces than an integrated whole. It's easy to put the pieces of so many little rules together in a way that creates a Frankenstein monster clumping along looking for love rather than an enchanting engagement.<br /><br />One particular weakness is that the book is probably an attempt to describe now to work with the early triers in a new offering category. These people are intrigued by anything new that offers advantages. Geoffrey Moore has written well on the subject. But most offerings must shift their appeal to meat-and-potatoes advantages if they are to reach a mass market. All of that is mixed up together as though all customers were the same. That's always a mistake.<br /><br />Read, remember, and apply very cautiously.member, and apply very cautiously.

1434404374|4.0|It is always odd to look back at beginnings. No one, surely not Agatha Christie herslf, could have guessed what a long run Hercules Poirot would have. He was already of a certain age when he took the stage in The Mysterious Affair at Styles.<br /><br />When she wrote this book Christie was still acquiring her voice and her main characters, Hastings and Poirot had not yet developed into the full formed personages they were to become.<br /><br />Nonetheless, The Mysterious affairs at Styles would be a perfect introduction to someone about to embark upon The cannon of A. Christie and it is a treat to go back and read it again now that I have read all that I can find of her work. Christie was my light reading while completing my M.A. and remains a fond favourite. Not all of Christie's books are great tales. This one is. See also my comments on The Murder of Roger Ackroyd.<br /><br />N.B. I want to make it clear that I am commenting on the story, not the binding or production values of this edition.

B006NXIO7O|2.0|When I saw the preview of this movie, I already knew what I was getting into.  It wasn't just an action movie but it has box office gold \\"Zoe Saldana\\" in it. The problem is the story and production of this movie leave a great deal to be desired.  The story is highly predictable and as a result cliche and frustrating. I found myself checking my watch on more than one occasion as the film dragged on.  This movie misses the boat and I am being generous with 2 stars.  Watch something else.

1451648537|2.0|I was looking forward to this book based on Issacson's biography of Einstein, but I couldn't wait to be done with it. What a disappointment on numerous levels. The narrative is barely above standard reporting, better done every day in the WSJ. I understand that Jobs is inseparable from Apple, but it's more about the rise of Apple than a true biographical portrait. There's a whiff of sycophancy that's disturbing, as if Issacson allowed himself to be drawn into Jobs' aura. The inappropriate overuse of the word \\"genius\\" was irritating, applied to basically a super-salesman undeserving of the accolade. The only true geniuses mentioned are Da Vinci and Robert Oppenheimer, whom Jobs aspired to be; it didn't happen. Most of all, the book became a crying towel for one of the great narcissists of our age, who abandoned the welfare of his family to his LSD-enhanced ego by forgoing cancer treatment that could have saved his life. But, in the end, one acknowledges his business achievements, however much gained at the expense of those around him, painfully chronicled here. Try instead the finely written American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer for truly satisfying reading and insights into a true genius.
B001C4CI8U|4.0|If you like the X Files, you'd like this show. It is very different than the X Files, but similar in the way it brings us in a whole new odd way of entertaining extreme possiblities.<br /><br />The cast perfroms a theatrical quality show. John Noble is one of the best actors ever to watch on prime time TV.<br /><br />Each season progreses into a new kind of Fringe twist. It never loses it's mystery and it is fun to watch the cast grow with the show as we do.<br /><br />I don't have time to explain the plot details. I will say that there are the odd sci-fi X file like episodes filling in between the bigger story of an alternate universe playing out.  If it seems mind blowing, it is but the characters will guide you through the experience. It is a well acted, directed and written show.<br /><br />I have it in my collection along with Haven, Millenium and the X Files.  I am now enjoying that new show, Grimm. If you like these also and have not seen Fringe, it is worth a try.

B006IGZWB2|4.0|I'm not a big fan of message movies or of movies that preach too loudly into my ear. This movie certainly had its messages, but it never felt preachy, it never got to the point where a drama becomes self-indulgent melodrama. Instead, a good dose of humor and exceptional supporting performances kept the messages human and honest.  I have to note that aside from the racial and human issues raised, car buffs will enjoy the big old American iron. Not particularly important to the soul of the story, I couldn't help but sit and enjoy the view now and again.   Highly recommended.
1609611543|5.0|I personally found Wheat Belly by Cardiologist William Davis, M.D., to be \\"life saving.\\"<br /><br />In the past, both Atkins and The Carbohydrates Addict's Diet (Drs. Richard & Rachael Heller) were very helpful for me. If these worked for your body type, then Wheat Belly is probably your next step.<br /><br />My body type is endomorphic, and  I have struggled with weight since childhood. There have been periods of thin and fat, and prior I was able to make progress through discipline. As I reached middle age, compounded by job and family stress, discipline was insufficient. Despite daily exercise, I suffered from excess weight, poor blood test results, and pre-diabetic symptoms ... I was losing the fight.<br /><br />Dr. Davis discusses why wheat is so different from other carbohydrates, and more of this literature is making its way to mainstream, e.g., University Florida discussion on how gluten products permeate the intestine [...]. Davis discusses how unlike most other carbohydrates, wheat can create addictive products that cross into the brain as well as products that permeate the intestines and trigger autoimmune responses.<br /><br />Davis provides plenty of references to papers to support his arguments, and where scientific support is lacking, he states it, e.g., AGE (aging substances). He also discusses his personal scientific experiment using bread from today's genetically engineered wheat and comparing it to bread from \\"old\\" wheat.<br /><br />I enjoyed Davis' writing style with his mildly sarcastic tone. Of course, everyone has their own sense of humor, but for me, his humorous style made the book go quicker and the message easier to incorporate.<br /><br />Considering that it took a decade for Professor Rowland's work on ozone to be accepted, and that only threatened the refrigeration industry, I shudder to think of the ridicule that Dr. Davis will face on behalf of the giant wheat industry ... an industry so large and pervasive, tied to global politics and world hunger, that it dwarfs Freon®. This book will probably remain controversial for decades, but possibly/probably proven correct with time.<br /><br />If you are carbohydrate sensitive and having health problems, my suggestion would be:<br />Buy the book, and read it slowly, cover to cover. Education costs, and this is a relatively cheap education ... better money spent here than on a pizza.<br />Try the wheat free approach for a month (of course, under a doctor's guidance for legal reasons). If this is your problem, it will be night and day.<br />Keep a food log that counts BOTH carbohydrates and calories. This is my personal advice that deviates from Davis.  I find that unrestricted eating of say high calorie raw nuts allowed by Davis doesn't work for me. I need to cut BOTH carbohydrates and calories to lose weight.<br /><br />For me, the results were dramatic after two weeks. Better digestion, much less hunger, better sleep, etc... Prior, I would end up unconsciously pecking away at an open loaf of bread until it was gone a day or two later, or eat half a pizza and look for more. After removing wheat and detoxing, this urge vanished, and I am able to live without bread or pizza completely. I kid you not!<br /><br />Who knows if it will work for you? Worse comes to worst, you spent a few bucks, learn some important information, and you end up helping someone else that has wheat issues.

B004U52VPS|2.0|If at any time while playing this game you think \\"The video game is more fun\\" you're right.  It is.<br /><br />Building with the plastic blocks of wood is a little tricky.  The birds are cool, launching them are fun.  It's neat when you knock down all the blocks and pigs.  That's about it.<br /><br />We played this for maybe 10 minutes, then just built stuff and launched the birds at it until the things fell over.  That was more fun than playing by the rules.<br /><br />The dog had fun with the birds flying around.  I'd say throw in more building blocks, more birds, another launcher, and just make it a building set where you can knock stuff over with your angry birds.  Then it would be better.
0439023513|2.0|After reading the first two books, I was quite excited to read this novel.  I thoroughly enjoyed the first two novels, especially the way they built suspense throughout the text. Unfortunately, this enjoyment never really began with this novel.  I felt that it was very poorly written when compared to the first two, almost as if the editor from the previous novels had been let go.  In addition, the novel seemed to end abruptly.  For a moment, I thought the build up to a good ending was coming; however, I was greatly disappointed.   I would recommend reading this only as it is the final book within the series.  Unfortunately, if the first book was written like this, I doubt I would have bothered to read the second.
B004FGMV0W|5.0|I was a bit skeptical about the quality of \\"Goodbye Lullaby\\", even after hearing the awesome rock-pop track called \\"What the Hell\\". I purchased it anyway, to see if Avril evolved since her 2007 album \\"The Best Damn Thing\\". In a word, yes. Instead of the heavy rock and roll, she strips away the instrumentation to produce 14 straight-forward tracks that rely heavily on piano, strings, acoustic guitars, and drums. The exceptions to this rule are \\"What the Hell\\" and \\"Smile\\" which provide some comic relief in comparison with the other serious elements presented. Avril scores some of her best work with \\"Wish you were here\\" and \\"Goodbye\\", which has a lovely string arrangement. She also includes songs describing her break-up with now ex-husband Deryk Whibley, which will make you shed a tear or two as she bares it all and full-heartedly explains why their relationship crumbled. Don't worry, these tunes won't distract you from the otherwise pleasant and charming nature of the album. My only negative, the \\"hidden track\\" (as she calls it, although revealing that this song lies on the CD takes away the \\"hidden\\" part of that title) known as \\"Alice\\". You might remember hearing this in the film \\"Alice in Wonderland\\". She extends it and tags it on the end of this album, but this track is her most forced effort as she tries to belt out notes far out of her range. She simply sounds strained and somewhat agitated. Ignoring this track, \\"Goodbye Lullaby\\" is a fine album, and one of Avril's best if I might say.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele lured listeners in with her 2008 hit \\"Chasing Pavements\\". Her debut album \\"19\\", fell flat for me, as it seemed to be singing the blues over and over again about being a teenager. In 2010 she reappeared with a new smash hit \\"Rolling in the Deep\\", and the release of \\"21\\", which was her age at the time of the recording sessions. I did not expect \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" or \\"21\\" to be the successes they are, as \\"21\\" has exceeded 15 million copies sold and \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" was named song of the year by Billboard magazine. All of this hype surrounding this production might seem to make this album just that, all hype but no quality. Fortunately, nothing could be further from the truth. Adele was 21, but her song-writing and vocals say otherwise. She can not help but seem wise far beyond her years as she delivers beautifully in \\"Love Song\\" and \\"Don't You Remember\\". In \\"19\\", Adele seemed to be stuck in a ho-hum bluesy sound, but \\"21\\" changes that and becomes more accessible to audiences worldwide. Pop-lovers will sing away during songs such as \\"Set fire to the rain\\" and \\"Rumour Has It\\", while those interested in soul will certainly love \\"I'll be waiting\\" and \\"Take it all\\". Even better, the producers of this album has simply outdone themselves as they show less is more, and the let you know there is no auto-tune or any voice-altering device here. What you are hearing is the true, genuine Adele, and when you listen through one of her near six minute songs all the way through, you'll be amazed how much worth while the experience was.
B000EOUSJU|4.0|Mott (The Hoople) / \\"The Hoople\\" (bonus tracks edition):  This is a good album but it is not a great album.  It is enjoyable but not essential, with the exception of the hit \\"Roll Away The Stone\\".  Fun to listen to but it is not terribly memorable.  The numerous bonus tracks are a nice addition but not enough to change the feel of the album.  It is Just good enough to get Four Stars.

B0000C23DO|5.0|Grateful Dead / The Very Best of Grateful Dead: I am not a deadhead but I like the band and the whole San Francisco scene.  The Grateful Dead are best heard live and so I bought the great CD live set titled \\"Ladies & Gentlemen: The Grateful Dead\\", which is the only live set I own (and it is terrific).  However, the Grateful Dead did make some great studio tracks and the best of those tracks are on this \\"The very best of...\\" CD.  The 17 tracks on this CD make it long enough to enjoy the music without it becoming tiring.  This is a Great best of CD for us casual fans.<br />Five Stars.
0307279189|4.0|This is a very interesting book on running. I thought I knew almost everything about running (I run about 4 miles every other day when it is nice out), well I was wrong. I learned a lot from this book. It is written in a great form focusing on a super-race but going off into detail about each runner in the race and great facts about running. I did get a little bored when reading about how people evolved to run, I think he could have cut a few pages out of that part. I was looking for a book that would inspire me to get out of the house and go running during the long Maine winters this book didn't succeed, I doubt any book will. Oh, well. Still a fascinating book.
B00026WU7I|5.0|Bob Dylan / Blood On The Tracks:  By 1974 it was the popular opinion that Dylan had seen his best days and no one was expecting much from him anymore.  Then Dylan released both `Blood on the tracks' and `Planet Waves', and showed the world that not only was he still a great writer and performer, but that he could still do both better than his contemporaries.  Blood on the Tracks is a Masterpiece album.  This easily gets Five Stars.
B006C1DH92|1.0|The app wont load on my samsung mesmerize. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app many times and it still wont load. Im very disappointed because I read reviews saying how great of an app it is and I cant experience that because the app wont load.
B000088E7Y|4.0|Good Old Boys / Randy Newman:  This is a Randy Newman concept album.  The concept consists of his impersonation of the Huey Long era of the south.  The problem is, Randy Newman consistently writes with his tongue in his cheek (writing the opposite of what he really thinks) and that style really does not work well with an album that is trying to evoke a specific period in time.  This is not to say that this is a bad album (it has several very good songs) but overall, this is not his best effort.  This is a solid Four Star effort.
B004EPYZSU|1.0|Poor film with such a great actor. Will be traded in ASAP. Should have listen to my wife and not made this purchase, she said the clue was in the title.
B00026WUBE|4.0|Bob Dylan (and The Band) / Planet Waves:  This is a very quirky album from Dylan but is very entertaining nonetheless.  There are a few great songs here and a few so-so efforts as well, but it is still one that I really enjoy listening to.  Four Stars

B005IZLPKQ|5.0|I rarely have seen an action movie I have enjoyed lately; I heard the new Mission Impossible is rather good. The historic blending of fact, and fiction, and Marvel Comic charaters is awesome in this movie. Almost letter perfect special effects. Great acting; Comic book characters come to life, but still retain that almost one dimensional quality.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|The changes Lucas made really don't distract from the films. I almost didn't get the set after reading all the negative reviews. I wouldn't have noticed the changes if I hadn't wasted twenty minutes reading the negative reviews on here. Buy it and let your kids enjoy it in all its Blu Ray glory. They wont even know that there were any changes :).<br /><br />My only regret was that my TV wasn't bigger!<br /><br />- May the force be with you!

0307592839|1.0|I finished this book, only because I remember someone saying she never started a book without finishing.  By the end, I couldn't even tell you what it was about.  Is this the mark of a good book?  Not in my opinion.  All I can say about this book is \\"Que?\\"  Why on earth did it win a Pulitzer Prize?
B005RUUUAI|5.0|The Walking Dead tv show on AMC is absolutely lifelike. I have never seen better zombies than the ones on this show. I give this 2 thumbs up and I would rate it 5 stars for almost every episode! I recommend this show 100%!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|just started playing but I like the games so far, I love that you get points by playing and that even after completing a round you still get points tod playing again.  :)
B004U52VPS|4.0|I think this game is a very clever concept. It's just a little bit difficult.  The \\"slingshot\\" included in the game is very inaccurate and unpredictable. I recommend practicing for a while before beginning the game in order to get a feel for it. Even still, the birds don't always go where you want them to. My girlfriend and I are both college age and we had difficulty with it. We tried shooting the castles from different distances and angles but could never get the same precision like in the iPhone game. If we had trouble with it, I cant imagine how hard it would be for a 6 year old. We ended up changing the rules to where you just shoot as many birds as you need to until you knock SOMETHING down. Also, there were a few castles that were challenging to build. The physics of this game are obviously much different from that of the iPhone app.  The game is pretty fun once you get the hang of it. It took about 45 minutes of play to get consistent to the point where we could hit something on every turn. So like I said in the title, not the same instant gratification that you get playing the app on your phone, but it is fun. Especially since it is a multi-player game.

B005MYEPXC|5.0|I love Paris.  There is something special and magical about it.  I had only recently returned when I first saw this movie in the theater.  I knew I had to see it - not only do I love Paris, I love movies that have a  feel for the city, like Amelie.  Knowing how well Woody Allen makes NY a character in his movies I knew this had to be good.<br /><br />I picked up the Blu-Ray for my wife for Christmas and watched it last night. It was as fun as I remembered it being in the theater.  Maybe even more fun because I could stop and discuss the different references with my wife.  \\"Who's that?\\"  \\"Man Ray - he did avant-garde photography\\"  \\"OK, I remember him.\\"  And there are quite a few references - unless you have spent your life studying the ex-pats in Paris in the '20s you couldn't catch them all in one sitting.<br /><br />The plot is sort of silly and the characters a cliched, but the movie was so much fun that I didn't care.  Amazingly Owen Wilson played Woody Allen better than Woody can himself - his phrasing and everything was exactly Woody but without the whine - he is much more watchable.<br /><br />And yes, Woody has a feel for Paris that rivals his feel for NY - it was like being back in the city again.  I know exactly what is around the next corner in every scene and can almost feel the breeze and smell the fresh baguettes...

B006QKJZMW|2.0|Part 1 was about in sync with the Saw movies, then part 2 came out & that movie really wasn't that great. Now with part 3, this one is much worse than the Saw movies, and too disturbing for me. I'm not really sure about all the violence & gore, yet this movie might be suitable for some people, it was not a hit with me. Beware if you have a sensitive stomach!

0670022950|5.0|This book is a page-turner.  Graphs, statistics and scholarly testings of a thesis don't normally appeal to me, with my little science and less math and my preference for fiction, essays and memoirs over tomes with big ideas. However, I'm a sucker for serious writing when it's executed with a human touch.<br /><br />This is certainly a serious book, stuffed with a big thesis and mountains of research.  It manages nevertheless to seem light on its feet and sometimes even whimsical: it's surprising how often the lyrics of Tom Lehrer turn up here, sometimes in the company of the thoughts of Hobbes and Hitler.  Even Pinker's personal experience gets into the act - he tells us of an inhumane lab experiment he once participated in, feeling it was wrong at the time but doing it anyhow.  He analyzes the reasons for his actions in the chapter on \\"Inner Demons\\".  The mundane is never very far from the horrific in that chapter.  It's where he describes the \\"Abilene Paradox\\", so named for a family trip made one afternoon in the summer of 1957 from one dreary Texas town to another.  Individually no member of the family wanted to make the trip: each was under the mistaken impression that all the others wanted to drive those dusty miles, eat that wretched dinner, see those unexciting sights and drive back home, everyone sweating like pigs before air conditioning had arrived in automobiles. (They each made the admission after the event, and one of their number went on to become a scholar and write it up.) Now that's the kind of experience we can all understand, and it may go some way to explaining why any of us might have been capable of torturing a rat in a lab in the 1970's or of carrying out orders in a concentration camp in the 1940's.<br /><br />We also learn from Pinker that though as a kid growing up in Montreal he was not much good at hockey or any other sport, he discovered a work-around for this deficiency: he found out early on that he had the ability to endure pain without too much complaint, and this was a capability he shamelessly exploited to get respect from the jocks who would otherwise have had no use for him. Such an observation goes far to explain the sort of cheerfulness that keeps breaking through the gloom of Pinker's depiction of the history of our species. We unprofessional and unscholarly readers can understand a thing like that, seldom as it is that we find ourselves in the readerly company of an engaging human being who happens also to be a first-rate thinker.<br /><br />I have to admit feeling another source of pleasure - perhaps a guilty pleasure - as I slowly read my way through this long book: moral uplift.  Could it actually be the case that our species is moving in the right direction?  That we are getting smarter, more imaginative and, yes, even more moral with every passing day? What serious writer since the days of the late Victorians has dared to say such things?  And make them seem plausible and worthy of intellectual respect to boot?<br /><br />I reckon it will be another century or two that the jury remains out on this one.  Will someone then dust off and read \\"The Better Angels of Our Nature\\" and find there a grand synthesis of all that was going right in the world at the beginning of our century but which remained unacknlowedged until Steven Pinker spoke out?  Or rather will the book be seen as a lonely and discredited exercise in middle-brow wishful thinking indulged in by a charming if utterly mistaken member of our inherently violent species?  I know where my heart wants to go on this one, and I am grateful for the book for having given my head some reasons for thinking my heart could be right.laint, and this was a capability he shamelessly exploited to get respect from the jocks who would otherwise have had no use for him.

Rue was my favorite character, I was crying when she had died! Though, I like the idea of the author making the reader gasp.  *End of spoiler*   I book was amazing, I can't believe i waited this long, then finally gained some sense to read the book.  I'm truly amazed with it.
B006BQI1V2|5.0|SARAH'S KEY, novel:Tatiana de Rosnay, film:Gilles Paquel-Brenner<br /><br />The best plot summary of this film are words taken from a starred review by Publishers Weekly of the novel appearing on the Metacritic internet site:  \\"Julia Jarmond, an American journalist married to a Frenchman, is commissioned to write an article about the notorious Vel d'Hiv round up, which took place in Paris in 1942. She stumbles upon a family secret which will link her forever to the destiny of a young Jewish girl, Sarah. Julia learns that the apartment she and her husband Bertrand plan to move into was acquired by Bertrand's family when its Jewish occupants were dispossessed and deported... She resolves to find out what happened to the former occupants: Wladyslaw and Rywka Starzynski, parents of 10-year-old Sarah and four-year-old Michel. The more Julia discovers - especially about Sarah, the only member of the Starzynski family to survive - the more she uncovers about Bertrand's family, about France and, finally, herself.\\"<br /><br />This is a French film that stars the acclaimed actress Kristin Scott Thomas as the journalist, a wonderful and versatile M&eacute;lusine Mayance as the young Sarah, Niels Arestrup as the farmer who hides Sarah from the Germans, Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Pierrot as Jarmond's husband, and American actor Aiden Quinn in a small but stellar role in the last third of the film.  Although it is a Holocaust movie, there are very few graphic scenes and several glimpses of happier days: young Sarah playing on the bed with her brother in the Marais apartment; Sarah and another girl ripping the Star of David from their clothing, frolicking in a field of wheat, and bathing in a muddy river after their escape from a detainee camp; the two young girls sleeping in a farmer's barn with his guard dog.<br /><br />The true star (or villain) of the film is the Velodrome d'Hiver, an indoor bicyle track and sports stadium which was located in Paris near the Eiffel Tower. Built for the World's Fair in 1900, the small track was enlarged and moved several blocks farther away from the Tower to house events for the 1924 Summer Olympics. Damaged by fire in 1959 and demolished, the glass-topped structure was reconstructed for the movie by its crew. A bonus feature of the DVD shows the amazing reconstruction.<br /><br />Of the 28,000 Jews deported from Paris and Northern France by French police at the request of German occupiers, 13,152 men, women and children were placed in the Vel d'Hiv in July of 1942 for eight days. No toilet access and little food or water was available...and the comparison to the New Orleans Superdome catastrophe is drawn early in the film. (The film's modern-day action is updated to 2009 to allow this comparison.)<br /><br />This DVD is the film with English subtitles that had a limited USA release in July of 2011 to be touted as an Oscar 2012 contender. I had hesistated to rent a DVD with subtitles...but about a third of the film (the modern-day events) is in English...and the transition is smooth and not disruptive. From other Amazon reviews, it appears that the film closely follows the novel. Tatiana de Rosnay collaborated with Director Paquel-Brenner who wrote the screenplay.<br /><br />SARAH'S KEY is one of the best films I saw in 2011.<br />Highly recommended.<br />Janein 1900, the small track was enlarged and moved several blocks farther away from the Tower to house events for the 1924 Summer Olympics.

B005K0HDGE|4.0|I have to admit it: if this book had been written by someone *other* than Stephen King, I would have rated it at five stars.  I do judge Mr. King more harshly than others because when something is written by America's storyteller, I expect more.<br /><br />It isn't that the plot was poor, or that the story was badly written.  It's that 11/22/63 didn't have the punch I've come to expect from a really great Stephen King novel.  Although there were some wonderful Stephen King-esque moments (such as a grisly murder, a bizarre individual known only as the 'Yellow Card Man', and the idea that the past has teeth), the plot dragged.  At times, it was as if I was living the story in real time.  The book would have been twice as good if it had been half as long.<br /><br />A problem with with writers who love their characters as Mr. King does is that they want to keep them onstage as much as possible.  Unfortunately, this can become like watching a friend's vacation photos: the friend may love their 200 pictures of Old Faithful, but after five pictures, everyone else is bored silly.<br /><br />Despite this, the story is engaging for the most part, and I did read it fairly quickly.  But it wasn't the gripping novel I'd hoped it would be.
B005LZW8FO|4.0|What would you say to yourself if you discovered another you, exactly like you, living on another planet?<br /><br />That was a very interesting thought experiment that the movie offers to us. It offers us a way to view ourselves more as other people might see us, and that can offer insight and surprises. Try to 'lose yourself' and think of what it would be like if you saw another person just like you. How would you describe yourself? What advice would you give yourself? What might you change for the better? What would you keep the same?<br /><br />Truly an eye-opening experience and an 'extension' of the movie that makes it very worth your time if you are the type to enjoy contemplating things of this sort. The movie can serve as the 'platform' for the experiment in which you find your 'other you' and try to see yourself more objectively.<br /><br />4.5 stars

B004X80QNG|1.0|I love Pocket Informant on my iPhone and thought that it would be the same on the Kindle Fire.

Who cares about a calendar if you can't keep it in sync with your other devices? Very disappointed.
B004A7UVLC|5.0|This contemporary retelling of Sherlock Holmes is fantastic.  The acting is excellent and the stories are believable and witty.  Never has a Watson been so put upon!  Can't wait for season 2 to become available.
B005LJK3AC|5.0|I think this movie is great!  And not that sophomoric, '80's boob-fest, cheesy, trashy or slapstick-humor kind of funny either.  I think Jason Bateman is seriously funny, loved him in Arrested Development; I also love Charlie Day in It's Always Sunny, so it's no surprise to me this is a good movie.  Well, let me take that back...when this first came out I thought it was going to be stupid.  Colin Farrell isn't my favorite, Kevin Spacey can go either way for me in movies, and Jennifer Aniston (I thought) has seen her better days in comedy.  WRONG!  I watched this by myself and laughed numerous times, was never bored, and want to watch it again when my husband gets home.  It had a good beginning, the plot carried itself all the way through and the end worked out reasonably.  It didn't leave me thinking, \\"That's how this is going to end?  Are you kidding me?\\" like so many other movies do.  I recommend this movie and give it \\"Two Thumbs Up\\"!!
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|After \\"Lord of the Rings\\", this has definitely got to be my favorite fantasy novel of all time.  I was worried in the beginning as it started a bit slow and was too reminiscent of \\"Oliver Twist\\" with the hordes of beggar children working for the old thief, but that introductory minutia was easily overlooked once the proper plot started up, and oh what a thing of joy it was.  I won't spoil any details, but really the main thing I love in ANY book is an intelligent main character and we have that in spades with Locke Lamora.  Unlike other books who profess to have intelligent characters, I was rarely if ever able to outguess Locke Lamora, but his actions fit so neatly into the overall scheme he worked on that it was just a beautiful thing and a wonder to behold.<br /><br />The second book is almost as good as the first, and I can only hope that more will follow as soon as possible.
B005XY67WI|4.0|The picture and audio is great. Shakira's performance is great too. But the blu ray maker is foolish, they don't put subtitles when Shakira is singing. How can you expect me know English, France, Spanish? Even English I can't hear clearly when she is singing. This is happening on all living Blu ray/DVD.
1569242739|5.0|The cupcakes in this book are absolutely incredible.  My non-vegan friends, family and coworkers were amazed that the treats I fed them had no animal products.  While there are a few facy gourmet exceptions, one of the most important things to me (aside from a high standard of deliciousness) was that the majority of the recipes used common ingredients and didn't require a pricey trip to whole foods for exotic flours or extracts!<br />I am thrilled with the results of every batch I made and can't recommend Vegan Cupcakes Take of the World enough!  Go for it!
B005QI4TP8|1.0|Her voice is like fingernails scraping a blackboard, she can't sing on key, her performance style can best be described as bizarre, and she's the ugliest thing to come down the pike in many a full moon. And she's a superstar? +, what's with the + sign in the band's name? I've never heard them called Florence Plus the Machine. Pretentious, boring, and downright annoying.
B004V5QWU2|3.0|Good variety of sounds. cool ability to mix sounds to your liking. Unfortunately there is an audible gap when it loops back to begin playing the sound again. Some sounds are quite short so you hear the dropout a lot. It seems like seamless sounds would be a part of a paid app. I still use it, but tend to use the longer sounds now.
B001BNFR6W|1.0|This item was purchased as a gift for me. The item was sent back 3 times for an exchange and finally simply returned however was not given the full amount of the purchase. The DVD's were scratched in multiple places and I literally sat to watch and test vs. enjoy my gift. Over 90% of the DVD content was scratched.<br /><br />Simply, the packaging was to blame. However, each time that I attempted to explain this, I was only given the option for an identical exchange. I went as far as to ask them to remove the product...a loss of money and time.
B002TYZKIM|4.0|In a way, Kenny Ortega`s \\"Michael Jackson's This is It\\" is more interesting for what it ISN'T than for what it is.  What it ISN'T is a documentary account of the life, career and death of Mr. Jackson, inevitably colored by the personal viewpoints and biases of its maker.  In fact, but for the cruel hand of Fate, \\"This is It\\" shouldn't even exist as a movie at all.  The behind-the-scenes footage of Jackson and his crew mounting their elaborate, effects-laden worldwide tour scheduled for summer 2009 - his first in over ten years - was initially intended only for Jackson`s own personal library.  Instead, that footage has become a moving elegy for the self-proclaimed King of Pop, who died tragically on June 25, 2009, at the unripe young age of 50.  Wisely, there are no post-mortem interviews or commentary included in the film.  The performers all speak of him in the present tense, excited at the prospect of being a part of what is clearly an experience of a lifetime for any musician, dancer or singer fortunate enough to be a part of the show.  That their dreams never really came to fruition is what gives the film a depth and poignancy that goes beyond simply the loss of Jackson.  Indeed, watching this film is a bit like experiencing how the gods must feel, looking down upon us mere mortals as we go about our daily lives secure in the naïve belief that we will live forever, blithely unaware of what the future actually has in store for us.<br /><br />As to Jackson himself, he emerges as energetic and deeply engaged in the creative process, no more petulant or demanding than your average legendary superstar - one who actually had talent, by the way, celebrated for his songwriting and choreography as well as for his singing and dancing.  And, of course, the music itself is irresistible and timeless.<br /><br />It's a bittersweet experience watching this film, not only because of what happened to Michael but because of all the time and energy displayed by these hardworking individuals that would eventually come to naught.  The small compensation is the existence of this film that captures not just for us but for generations yet unborn the creative and performing genius of Michael that will endure through time.<br /><br />Who knows, but someday someone will make a warts-and-all biography of Michael Jackson that will attempt to knock the king off his throne.  But \\"This is It\\" ain't that movie.would eventually come to naught.

B0052UZIFA|1.0|Very good game but does not run correctly on the Samsung Galaxy Nexus. It loads sometimes and when it does it eventually locks up.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|A quick paced science fiction action film taking place in World War II. A runt who was bullied all his life but refused to give up is transformed through a secret Army program into a physically superior human being. He retains his spirit of protecting the little guy and never giving up a fight to forge like a ram-rod into battle with the Nazis. I liked the movie and the blu-ray transfer to DVD was excellent.
B004D2GMR6|5.0|Nice video, the wife thought it was very entertaining.  Lots of songs plus bonus videos.    I got it for a good price thanks to Amazon!
B0063IH60K|1.0|WAY too many ads and impossible to win!! Too bad...nice graphics and movement just too annoying to play! Only gave 1 star and it doesn't even deserve that!
B006BDHAX0|2.0|Two Stars, because, while it's got nice graphics, the animations and the effects are very basic and nothing special. The sound effects are unattractive. If it wasn't the Free App of the Day, I might have been mislead to try it, based on the screenshots. Would have been a mistake.  If you're looking for  aMahjong Solitaire app, I would recommend Random Mahjong over this any day. In fact, I have yet to see another Mahjong app on Android that comes close to Random Mahjong.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|controls are difficult for some games. although having to earn games is tedious the variety with in this app is great
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Awesome Bible App with tons of great features, never had any problems with it on my Droid 2, Droid X or Samsung Galaxy Tablet.

B004XGN8W4|5.0|This system works so well I love it, great lcd screen and brightness, great speakers with 2 headphone jacks, I mean this beast does it all! Best investment ever made!
B005H0IW6W|5.0|really great cd. michael buble has an amazing voice and adds something special to these christmas songs. the music/instruments are wonderful. overall: 4 stars!
1441892168|5.0|Dickens wrote a classic, and Colonial Radio has created a masterful audio dramatization.  Powerful, well acted, and they get bonus points for not messing with Dickens epic story.  I highly recommend adding this to your holiday traditions list.  Wouldn't we all be a little better off to remember the lessons learned by Scrooge through out the year and not just in late December?
B004HW7JMY|5.0|Great features on this blue-ray series, I recommend for all Spartacus fans. I will be looking forward for new Spartacus Season 2012 on blue-ray.  Finally, Ganicus is great more than Spartacus :D
1583334386|5.0|I was so glad to get this book just before starting the new year -- but it is so full of incredibly useful and empowering writing about the science of developing your capacity for willpower that it's going to be my companion throughout the year. Highly recommended.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this version. simple fast easy. responsive. no technical issues. clean graphics. just touch and it goes. not much mores I can say.
B0064T6LV8|4.0|This game is cool!But... They have 3 settings for the game and it still have the games you cant play u cant unlock them but you can buy them.Its very cool for all ages.Its a very cool game that you should download.Works great on Kindlle Fire! :)
B00000ITOY|5.0|Like others have said, don't worry about the age limit. I got this for my son's 1st birthday. There are no small parts that truly pose a choking hazard. This board is full of wonderful attributes for children to learn with time... Shapes, Colors, Numbers, and fine motor skills/orientation. I also received the Plan wooden block Baby Walker as a gift - both products have such excellent quality, I feel lucky to know about this brand. By comparison, Melissa & Doug, while popular, can't hold a candle to Plan in terms of paint quality and overall durability. Way to go, Plan!
B004ECDNJU|1.0|I say fire and said cool! A new kindle fire exclusive! But it is not.  I am dissapoint. So this is my manifesto.
B005HSL626|5.0|I bought this fruit vocabulary game for my son so he could explore the many tasty fruits our world has.Cooper (the pooper) or my son ate an apple 2days after thank u ninjas.
B0058VW36U|5.0|One of the most fun time killing games out. Good graphics and entertaining. Come on do it, get the game now.
B003ASLJRW|5.0|What makes a great movie? The greatest story; a hero saving the down trodden.  A story that flows flawlessly with no time wasting fillers.  And the most beautiful scenery presented with the best picture quality I've ever seen in a Western.  Wonderfully acted, casted and directed.  I wish all tranfers to Blu Ray where this excellent!  I saw only one review of this product indicating the transfer was terrible, but it seems perfect to me.
B00479SVBU|2.0|The features are good as is the idea.  I'm on my second unit now as the first one fell apart. It literally comes apart at the seams.  Customer service was great and sent me a new unit which worked longer but also separated at the seam.  I was able to snap it back together and it sort of powers up but it is stuck on the first screen: it no longer plays music.  The remote on the replacement unit did not work - probably the battery was dead - did not have time to find out.
B003L77G8I|4.0|I love Bones. I've loved it from the beginning, when Brennan was closer to a robot than a human being and Booth was appalled by almost everything she said. I loved watching their feelings develop. Booth & Brennan are masters of those long, intense stares. The ones that have the audience holding their collective breath, wondering when and how they're finally going to get together.  That's my one problem with Season 6. After SIX ENTIRE SEASONS of building up to Booth and Brennan finally overcoming their fear and trusting each other enough to be together, all we see is some hand-holding and tears. Brennan sits on Booth's bed to be comforted, he holds her, END SCENE. Not even so much as a single passionate kiss after all of the anticipation and WILL THEY WON'T THEY drama.I would have liked a little more confirmation that they did in fact have sex. Instead, we're left with Brennan smiling mysteriously at Angela, which is just annoying. She doesn't even SAY, \\"Yes, we did, it was awesome thanks.\\" She just smiles.  And, in the final episode of the season, I admit I expected some obvious affection/sign that they were actually together. We didn't get that, either. At the very end we get confirmation that they had sex by way of Brennan telling Booth that she's pregnant with his child. Which is great, BUT STILL. Not even so much as a peck on the lips!  I guess I feel a little cheated after so much chemistry and the long process of watching them fall in love; it would have been nice to see some smooches.
B000I0QL82|5.0|We just watched it last night.  Wonderful movie.  You can see a lot of similarities that were later used in White Christmas.  Loved this movie, will watch it often.  The clarity is great, however for your own test, glance at the \\"trailer\\" on the DVD which was not remastered and see the major improvement in the visual since the original.
B004ECDNJU|4.0|This is a clever idea, and a very challenging game. It's difficult to keep focused, it would be a great brain-training game for ADHD kids. The look and  graphics could be a bit better but I am more interested in the game itself. Give it a facelift and I would give it five stars.
B0063GORYU|5.0|i love this app!!!! it is amazing and i like to play it all the time!!! i recommend this app
B005ELZKWS|2.0|I'm a long time Van Halen and Satriani fan but I have to say that Chickenfoot III just seriously lacks orginality.  I was most disappointed when I heard Satriani's hard rock distorted menacing intro to \\"Big Foot\\".  Unfortunately, he never expands on this idea and the entire tune consists of one basic guitar riff.  The lyrics sound like compiled, washed up rehashes of classic rock, and do nothing to appeal on any level.  This basic pattern of limp wristed guitar and watered down lyrics is the main theme for this album, and the band.  I am extremely disappointed because Satriani and Hagar have incredible amounts of talent and have each made world class rock albums in years past.    Overall, it sounds like this band was the idea of big recording executives.  It sounds like they kept a tight leash on Satriani's playing, and produced generic lyrics to appeal to non-critical pop listeners.
B0063GORYU|4.0|great game to play when u have time to kill. it is easy and you can win too! it also makes you think and it is addictive.  just want to keep playing
B0063IH60K|4.0|Not a bad app, works like it should...but the cards are a bit hard to read. I do like that there are many options for customizing things.
B001E45XT4|4.0|The GameCom 367 Headset is comfortable to wear for a few hours, but can become a little uncomfortable. Besides this, the sound is great and it has good bass.
0938045768|5.0|First, I want to say that this is a fantastic book.  Other reviewers have given good outlines of what is in the book, so I want to address the most common criticisms I have read.  Criticism 1:. Paul Wade is not a real person.  This started mainly because Paul Wade has shunned publicity, and because the book contains words and phrases more common to a native Brit than an American ex-con.  In fact, the book was edited with the assistance of Brits--including Wade's brother-in-law--which explains the words and phrases.  And several people who are personally acquainted with Wade have spoken out to confirm that he is, in fact, a real person (his friend Drew Reissman among them.)   Criticism 2: The book is overpriced. This is a common complaint of Dragon Door books, but \\"overpriced\\" is in the eye of the beholder.  Any book that you find disappointing will be \\"overpriced,\\" but will be completely worth it if you find the information of value.  Look at it this way: Instead of joining a gym, try CC to all final steps.  If you don't have the strength and development you want, then you can join the gym and be far ahead of the curve. In this case, the book would be a bargain since you will have saved months or years of gym fees.  Criticism 3: The book is too long.  I can understand that some people are only interested in the exercises themselves, and don't need to have justifications for why the author advocates the exercises. Not everyone will enjoy reading anecdotes about prison training but, personally, I found the anecdotes and stories very compelling.  The bottom line is that maybe the book is not as short as you like, but there is nothing included that is superfluous to the book's purpose.  You'll either like it or you won't.  Criticism 4: The title romanticizes prison.  The title might be sensational, but there is no glorification of prison life in the book itself.    Criticism 5: The book disses free weight and machine training.  This is true, but Wade gives meticulous justifications for why he thinks calisthenics are better for you.  I doubt his comments will put a stop to free weight training, but people should be aware of the consequences.  Look at it this way: taking ballet will likely mangle your toes and give you bad knees and ankles, but this hasn't stopped ballet dancing, nor is it likely to.  Just make informed choices.  Criticism 6: You can find the same information for free on the internet. Actually, you can find the exercises themselves, but not the progressive steps, which is the heart of the book and what makes it different from other material. I find myself constantly referring back to the the book for hints on form and ideas for getting the most out of each step.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I am really enjoying all the different plans.  I love reading them on my kindle fire. It makes my life easier.
B003UESJHO|3.0|It's a movie that could have a bit more action and a better story line however it keeps you watching
1451648537|5.0|I think I have to echo what another reviewer said. Although the book is 600 pages long, it's easy to blaze though it because it reads very well. I would have liked to learn more about Jobs but who wouldn't? If the author would have written everything we could have had several volumes (which would be fine with me). Also, for the 10 yr anniversary edition or v2.0 the author has to save some material, right?
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a great way to waste time-in fact I do too much of that. It works smoothly-better than a lot.
B0036IGJ1C|5.0|As is the description of the book as described by the seller...light'n quick ship, packaged appropriately, smooth transaction from beginning to end! Thank you!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Excellent ap. I use to download videos for my son and songs (built in mp3 converter) for me. Songs go directly to my music library.
0446402389|2.0|Perhaps it is because I am not impressed with fictional accounts of Soviet wicked games (you can't trust anyone) and torture practices (I've read about the real stuff in Natan Sharansky's and Solzhintzen's books), or perhaps it is because I didn't know about the 'real' case on which this book was based (ought I be impressed just because someone made it into a novel?)but I found nothing intriguing nor interesting about this book at all. I thought it was terribly written, totally predictable, and, other than Leo, whose character arc is theoretically intensely interesting, yet sadly not developed or shown in the book, the characters ranged from a little interesting with little to no depth, to ridiculous, superficial,  almost cartoonish caricatures with no depth at all.<br /><br /> The storyline itself (SPOILER ALERT!!!!!! DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU DO NOT WANT WHAT MIGHT BE A HINT)  reminded me of the first season of TV show Dexter (I haven't read the books--perhaps they were as terrible as CHILD 44 but the TV screenwriter made them into something brilliant?)  except Dexter's characters were brilliantly developed and portrayed and the plot version of separated brothers and how they developed was so much more novel and interesting.<br /><br />I love to read, and I read a lot, and I am reasonably intelligent and usually understand pretty well on many levels and layers, but since people I respect recommended this book and its sequels, I will consider the possibility that I am missing something, and that this book was actually worth reading. Until I can be shown or understand why, though, I will think of it as just a terribly written book, and will not read the sequels.
B004ECDNJU|5.0|simple graphics good sounds fun all around and free who could ask for more good job dev but I agree a color blind mode would help
B006BDHAX0|3.0|Like many others the game played great for a short time. It would then just shut itself down, no freezing, just back to the home screen.  The short time I was able to play the game was enjoyable. I have been looking for a Mahjong game for  some time  now , free or paid &amp; this game appears to have everything I have been looking for so I am hopeful they can fix this problem soon. However, because so many users are having the same problem I would not recommend taking the time to download and install this game until it has been updated.<br /><br />Played on a Coby Kyros MD1125 Tablet
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I would like to read the Youversion Bible on my Kindle but it's not available??? I have it on my iPhone and it's available for Android, why not Kindle?? Joe
B003ZHQVJO|5.0|The CD was in great condition, I was very pleased. There was no scratches, even the case was in great shape.
B000TGJ8AS|4.0|The Season 4 that I ordered was in great shape and arrived within a couple of days. I haven't had any problems with any of the dvd's from the season and the package they came in was still in good condition as well.
B004RJMUJO|2.0|Don't buy this because the free version has more blades and options then the paid-- I learner that the hard way &times;P
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app works great, with cool customizing features. Perfect cure for killing time at the airport or while waiting for an appointment.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its ok it has a lot of games but some are really stupid but its ok so u should buy it
B001UV4XIS|5.0|They saved the best for last.  Everything about this was Super, the acting, the production technics, directing set decoration, etc. etc.  I just loved it.  I really loved the ending.
B004ECDNJU|5.0|This is a nice little game - and excellent value for free paid app of the day. Works very well on the Kindle Free.  You need to operate switches to get blobs of differently-colored fire to a color-matched home. The speed control is a very nice feature. You can take it on the slow side and it can be quite relaxing. I can only guess at how hectic it would be a full speed! You can adjust the volume for the music and the sound effects. Incidentally, the music and sound effects are fine and not annoying.  This is a very solid 4-star plus game; however, I went up to 5 stars to counter some of the earlier negative reviews, which I felt were not justified.
B004FOA84A|5.0|need more games like this, very old school in style and play. just needs to be longer to be perfect.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love all the games they are really addicting. The only thing that I do not like is that some of the games need a lot of points for you to unlock and it takes a whole to get those points just by playing the games. There are awards where they give you a bunch of points which is helpful.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I really get a lot of enjoyment from playing quell. The graphics are beautiful and the game is challenging. I would highly reccomend it.
B001E45XT4|2.0|This headset squished my ears in the weirdest way; not only is it too tight, but the way it fit caused me instant headaches and nausea. Adjusting it didn't help and I think the problem is more in the angle of the ear pieces. I have a pretty average sized head and I've never had a problem with any other headsets, but because I've only been able to try them for short periods of time before feeling sick, I am only able to comment on the fit and not performance. I would recommend trying these on somewhere if possible before purchasing.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This video is amazing! I have tried lots of workout DVDs : Tae Bo, hip hop abs, Insanity and nothing has worked like this video. I have only been using the video for a couple weeks every other day and I am already seeing more results than I saw with a month of 1.5 hr workouts with Insanity. The science is behind her with this video with the way she structures her interval training and it really works. I am not overweight but I am getting married this summer and wanted to slim down my tummy and it has already worked! I have done the video about 8 times (mostly level 1 and 3 times level 2). So this does work! They are difficult but they give you the burn that you need to lose weight in such a short time. You do not necessarily need to work out longer in order to see results. I am pretty athletic but nothing has worked like this DVD, and it is so easy to do first thing in the morning. I thought it would take months to lose the few pounds I wanted to lose for my wedding but I have already dropped 3.5 lbs in a couple weeks. Definitely try this! Save $100 and get this video instead, at only $7 it's worth a try.
B006C45CFG|1.0|Everyone in this movie must have owed someone a huge favor. The movie was horrible, and the acting was not good either. I am sure they all made this movie for the studio to make some other movie!?
0634049011|2.0|I find his books to be 'comprehensive' yet uninspiring.  Way too much ground vs. practically covering the ground well and making practice still at least a little bit fun.    I also find his guitar playing extremely boring from listening to his clips online.  Had he been a killer player that had emotion and didn't sound like music school noise, I would have been much more motivated to see it past the first half of the book (at which point, I dropped it).  Ditto for his other books.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|nice time waster works great on my DROIDX sometimes when I go to stretch to shoot it acts up but other than a fun game to pass the time.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|easy to use on the go with or without wi fi  love the plans keep me grounded. I tell all my friend about it and encourage them to download this app on their phones.
B004OZOTSQ|3.0|Very helpful when my computer can find it. That's one star off for reliability. Also one more star off because it likes to mutilate pictures when I download them.
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|A great series! Not quite as good as band of brothers, but still intriguing and educational. Definitely for adults only.
B003E74B24|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It is by no means a cookbook, but rather it takes you inside Gordon Ramsay's personal life. By the end of the book, I was left really inspired and have such a different view on the man now.
B006C1DH92|1.0|I downloaded this app on my kindle fire. Worked great until I downloaded the update. Then every time I finished playing the game and would go on the web the movie website popped up. I uninstalled the app, cleared all cookies, data, history and removed it from my cloud and the movie website still pops up when I use the Internet. I just want it to stop.
B006BDHAX0|1.0|Mahjong is an awesome game! BUT this version shuts off ALL the time for no apparent reason. Right in the middle of a game, it shuts down.
B003BWERF8|5.0|I bought these along with a pair of Sennheiser MM 400 bluetooth headphones. They work great as a pair.   I was honestly surprised at how small it is, it doesn't take up much room at all, though it is easy to lose. I use it with my 5th gen iPod Nano, and all of the remote controls from the headset work perfectly. Play/pause and skipping.   Pairing was easy, and now they take about 5-7 seconds to automatically pair when i turn them both on. The range is also very good.  the one thing i will say is, my iPod battery drains MUCH faster, and i end up having to recharge it every night after using it during the day.  I'd recommend them for the price, a better alternative to Sennheiser's $75 version.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome! I got this game not thinking it would be fun but I was wrong.  i was way way way way way way wrong
B005HSL626|5.0|This is addictive and fun. You'll get passed the ads, they're not a big deal after a while. Works great on the Fire. I recommend it.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|It's ok.  Lots of games that have impossible controls.  It takes forever to accumulate enough points to earn to 3rd tier and higher games.
B004VMUS9G|1.0|I got this app and i had to delete right away because it was slowing down my fire and wasting my battery when i wasn't even using it!
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I use as a reminder/todo calendar app. Very easy to use after 15 minutes of experimenting. Developer needs to make size of note Icon in calendar User settable. Default is too small and can be missed by quick eye scan.
B0069UP2PI|1.0|The climax wasn't delivered. There was NO build up to a climatic moment. It was very slow paced & there was nothing that had us on the edge of our seats in anticipation of something big happening. From the previews we saw, it looked to be an \\"edge of your seat\\" type of movie, but when we watched it we couldn't wait to get out of our seats. We almost walked out, but we stayed hoping that something good would happen, but nothing ever did. If you want to watch a good movie about a viral break out then watch \\"Outbreak\\" or \\"Resident Evil\\". This movie had a lot of good actors that performed well, but the story was not captivating to us. What a waste of money spent to make this. Maybe the book is fantastic & captivating but the movie didn't show it.
B004ECDNJU|4.0|I got this app for free, It is SO fun. Addicting too. You can change how hard you want the level to be to.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I find this a great game and I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to pass time. I played it and I got quite into it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it the games aren't to hard or to easy but I'm stuck on one game that I cant get.
B0067D7Y3U|5.0|I'm not a American Idol fan at all, I just remember flicking by one night and seeing Chris Daughtry belting out a song and instantly falling in love. After the first album, Daughtry became an instant purchase for me -- no need to listen, just click the \\"buy now\\" button and keep moving. Break the Spell doesn't disappoint -- I highly recommend it.
B005DOKM9M|4.0|I like this product. It protects my Kindle Fire and looks good. It is easy to put my tablet into and get out of the sleeve. The only thing that might make it better was if when you zip up the sleeve, it turns off the Kindle Fire (like the magnetic cover on the ipad).
B002ZG99IG|5.0|Great movie. It came on time and in perfect condition i would definitively use this seller again. I love it.
0385341008|5.0|Some books that are bestsellers are such for less than stellar reasons and some are best-sellers and beloved because they have universal appeal. The guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is such a book. Tragedy, fortitude, romance, friendship and the love of books are mixed in an epistolary format that should appeal to just about anyone.<br /><br />WWII has ended and England is victorious yet has paid a high price for her victory. Juliet is a writer looking for her next book subject and the rest of her life. She receives a chance letter from a resident of Guernsey who has bought a book that Juliet sent to the used bookseller. A correspondece begins, first with the book buyer and then with all of his friends, the Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society of the title.<br /><br />The reader is introduced to several classic works of literature through the reading tastes of the correspondents and the horrors of the German occupation of Guernsey. Along the way there is an orphan, brave women, brave men, judgemental harpies, normal people doing the best they can in terrible circumstances, an appearance by Oscar Wilde and the things, material and spiritual that sustain us during hard times.<br /><br />A heartwarming read and recommended.
B0042MEQVG|5.0|Made this purchase for a friend and she called and told me it came at the time i told her it should and in perfect condition.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|I love the convenience of shopping from my phone.  Unfortunately, I use multiple wishlists on my account, and this application only allows the user to add items to the default wishlist.  To get around this, I have to add items as I find them, and then go in on my computer later and move them to the proper wishlist.<br /><br />Aside from that small frustration, it definitely makes shopping a little too convenient (if you know what I mean).
B002VKE1K2|5.0|First of all, Happy New Year everybody!  I got Paranormal Activity for Christmas and watched it shortly after the new year began, late at night.  I see this film is one of those \\"love it or hate it\\" type horror flicks.  Actually according to the majority of reviews here on amazon, most believe it's a terrible attempt at the horror genre.  I couldn't disagree more.  Alright, for the first 20 minutes, I was definitely leaning towards \\"This is a stinky, overrated hunk of disappointment\\" just like the Blair Witch Project.  This is because we see nothing but a man and his girlfriend/wife walking around through their home doing ordinary things that all couples do.  However as the storyline got underway, I began to see what makes Paranormal Activity such a rewarding experience.  Let me state exactly what I think this movie does brilliantly- I've watched countless ghost documentaries in my time (just like I'm sure many of you have) and I believe Paranormal Activity is one of the very few that accurately illustrates exactly what the claims describe in those documentaries.  In other words, this is EXACTLY what a horror movie should be like- it captures the atmosphere and suspense of a real story.  Not that THIS particular story is based on true events mind you- but it sure reminds me of several stories I've heard from those documentaries.  Now, we can argue that many of those ghost documentaries could very well we totally fictitious or far-fetched, however let's say most of them are true, and that most ghost stories we watch on television ARE based on factual evidence.  With THAT in mind -and the frightening thoughts that run through my mind while watching any given ghost documentary- Paranormal Activity delivers exactly how I'd want it to.    A HUGE difference between the Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity is that nothing EVER happens in the Blair Witch Project.  It's just a bunch of young kids walking through the woods with a home video camera recording a dreary and typical walk through such areas.    With Paranormal Activity, there's REAL suspense that actually leads to something meaningful.  You'll know when such suspense arrives whenever the characters (a man and his girlfriend or wife) go to sleep and have a video camera set up in the corner of their bedroom to record the entire nights worth of events.  The next day the man reviews the footage.    Gradually, with each night that passes, the activity gets stronger and stronger, until... you'll be gasping in anticipation wondering what's going to happen next because it just gets REALLY crazy.  I'm not scared easily, but when a film sets out to replicate the kind of stories we've been hearing for years from all those ghost documentaries, yeah, this is pretty original stuff as far as horror storytelling is concerned, so I thoroughly enjoy Paranormal Activity.    The only thing that bugged me is that the film took place in San Diego.  I love San Diego, I have family there, the people I've communicated with have been super polite out there but... I just think a setting on the east coast given the high amounts of ghost activity reported over the years would have been a better location.    I highly recommend it.  Just don't judge the movie by the first 20 minutes which is a pretty boring amount of nothingness.  Keep watching and you'll see what makes the film so frightening.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is a wonderful app.  I love that the Bible can be read to you.  It is not always convenient to read but you can listen.  Lots of great uses for this app.
B006RED4GA|1.0|This film is paced like a Catholic wedding, which is to say that it's slow and plodding.  Aside from Kelly McGillis, who at least makes the effort, the acting is bad to begin with and gets worse as time (oh so painfully) goes by.  For a movie that eschews most of the trappings of the last decade's ghost stories (The Ring, etc) in favor of realism, it's plot devices have the characters acting and reacting in ways that are beyond implausible.    Hotel clerk acts crazy in the hallway?  Why not invite her in your room!    Just had your wits scared out of you and saw a dead body?  Hey, let's go back to the cellar 'cause we heard a noise!    In other words, all the dumb behavior that makes one laugh at \\"Friday the 13th\\" type teens is on full display here despite the film masquerading as more refined horror offering.  When you find yourself rooting against the protagonists out of boredom and a clear lack of common sense on their part, you're probably watching a bad movie.    But lest you think the acting and pacing are the only negatives, it gets worse.  The score is terrible.  Whether you like a horror movie like \\"jeepers Creepers\\" or not, it definitely matched the music with the era it was trying to convey in relation to the demon's 1920's auto and abandoned old church on the prairie burial ground.  This movie, despite purportedly involving a crime or tragedy which occurred long ago (which it annoyingly never explains in full) is set to a cheap Psycho-esque score of violins and mood music.  If you turn your head away from the picture, it's like listening to a tire commercial where the rain might cause some slippage around the next bend but...nope...that set of Goodyear \\"Rainmaster 5000\\" tires you invested in saved the day!  Cue car pulling safely into family garage and cut.    In short, this is amateur hour with a good camera.  Not good camera work, mind you, just a good camera.  Don't waste your money. I want my $9.99 back and an apology.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Fantastic! This app is great. It is beautiful and functional. I was looking for a flipboard type app and this is it. Tootle reader integration is flawless.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Cinematic in scope, The Walking Dead Season One is nothing short of a masterpiece.  Yes, some episodes are better than others, but all are riveting and well crafted.  Because this is a TV show with no requirement for wrapping up a story in 90 minutes (as opposed to a film), we're treated to satisfying character development, intertwining stories that entertain and sets that were obviously designed with care.    If you're not a fan of zombie flicks, don't worry...you don't have to be.  They may provide the thrills and chills, but this series is really about people and how they react and interact in the face of an impossible crisis.  Watch Episode One and I can all but guarantee you'll be wanting more.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|My children love Harry Potter, and all the movies.   I ordered the blue ray movies for another child who is old enough to enjoy all of them now.
B006JTS5OO|4.0|I've always been a huge Jim Henson fan and I was lucky enough to be the right age to grow up in a world filled with his shows and movies. Now the original Muppet show was on before I was even born but I somehow managed to see a lot of them and of course the movies. They were fun then and they are still fun today.<br /><br />The Muppets 2011 movie I felt was a really good homage to the franchise and added a little something of it's own to the mix. It was a little cutesy sometimes but overall it made me smile and it was nice to see so many of the old, old characters from the original show that kids and maybe even some adults won't remember but if you're a real Muppets afficianado you will.<br /><br />There was a lot of cameos, mostly modern actors and it might have been nicer to see some older ones.<br /><br />Overall I have to say that this is a good step in the Muppet franchise because it brings Kermit, Fozziem Gonzo, et al to a whole new generation and it would be good to see it started up again.<br /><br />It's worth seeing if you're a fan and entertaining enough if you're not or if you have kids.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I am very pleased with the Microshell Folio Cover. It arrived on time and fits the Kindle Fire perfectly.  I would highly recomend this product to anyone looking for a stylish cover to protect their Kindle Fire.
B005I6EU7U|4.0|I found this cover to be just what I wanted.  I knew the Kindle would no longer fit in my back pocket, but a small price to pay.  I like the fact that it looks like a book and I have a place to store the stylus.  The way it folds over completely is nice and its makes the Kindle Fire easier to hold and not hit the sleep button, which I did a lot.  I like the look of the cover and the texture is close enough to leather to look classy.  The only reason not to give it five stars is the size, but that is more because of the size of the Kindle.  Nice accessory.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It doesn't have the greatest search features, but it has several other features that make it awesome -- reading plans &amp; events are just a few.  It offers several versions of the Bible for offline use and is great for having different versions at your disposal -- ALL FOR FREE!<br /><br />There are an enormous amount of reading plans and Bible studies to choose from and its great for connecting with others to study and share.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Thought the movie was better than the book (that was not the case for the other movies in my opinion). It showed a better resolution to the Snape good or evil question as well as a mature handling of the final scene on platform 9 3/4. This DVD arrived in good condition and I would purchase from this vender again.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great game for just passing time. The only issue is the bottom bar wont hide itself and gets un the way of the bottom cards.
0062119044|1.0|I read approximately the first third of the book. Today I watched the first 30 minutes of the subsequent movie release. This is time I will never get back, I should have learnt my lesson from the book and not wasted my time on the movie. I totally think this author was cashing in on the 'high school massacre' theme that authors seem to be running with lately.  If you want to read this topic, read 'Nineteen Minutes' by Jodie Picoult, skip this one.
B00006LJ6X|5.0|It has been many years since high school and my Chicago listening days. The sound after all these years is still as fresh as it was back then. The first few Chicago albums were treats. The band was always experimenting with their sound and their was always something new to experience. Once they went full-blown into making chart topping songs however this changed and their albums went from doubles to singles. This album was one with much experimentation. It actually seemed like their was more dealing with the music than cuts with actual singing. For those looking for hits there are a few here for you to enjoy. For those wanting to experience Chicago's musical side of latin, jazz, rock and even some soul; this album will open your eyes to another side of Chicago not seen before, but hinted at in previous albums.

B000OYC7A8|2.0|First of all I am huge Pink Floyd fan and saw Pink without Roger twice and they were great shows.  This DVD, part one, is flawed in recording or playback. Can easily be heard in the first song. The volume goes down! Horrible! Then other songs do the same. Ruins the  song, of course. Disc two sounds much better.

1451627289|5.0|Stephen King may be known as a writer of terror tales, and he is certainly that. He also is however, a wonderful storyteller. He spins a yarn like no one else, and it is that ability which has enabled him to be on top for so many decades. No matter what the subject, the story holds you and makes you want to take that ride along with King . It doesn't matter if it is past, present or future, the story is key, and King is a master storyteller.<br /><br />11/22/63 is a tale of a man who travels back in time to stop the Kennedy assassination, believing that this will make the world of \\"now\\" a better place. Knowing King, you know that is cannot be that simple, nor turn out so well, and you would be right.To tell more of the tale would be to do a great disservice to those who want to read about the travel back in time before Kennedy was killed. I read the 800 plus page book in less than a week. I couldn't put it down, but then that is how most King books and I get along.<br /><br />King has written another wonderful book, and even though there are no werewolves or vampires, a clown familiar to faithful King readers does make a cameo.<br /><br />This is a wonderful read, so step back in time and enjoy!

B003NFM3JK|4.0|I love this story and I think this version is really well-done.  I didn't pay close enough attention to the rating and allowed my five year old to watch part of it, which was a mistake.  It's really intended for an older audience.  Overall, this is a fun version of the classic story.

It's a game where you dodge incoming missles and fire at attackers at the same time. I could probably handle one or the other. I'm not challenged by something like that. You may be one of the many that are.

A prediction for Kelly's 2012 is that a bunch of Fed up people are going to move her to #1 before it is all over, and she can ride the storm all the way to the bank. Good for her.
B000FVNX2Q|2.0|I have had both the hp c platinum and hp c financial calculator only to say that the hp c platinum calculator has more problems. So do not get fooled when you hear that the hp c platinum financial calculator has a longer battery life because it doesn't. My hp financial calculator was stolen after using it for a minimal of four years with out having any problems or battery replacements. After I lost my hp c financial calculator, I decided to buy the hp c platinum calculator because it was marketed to have a better battery life. However, the battery life was much worse and the calculator died within three years. Not only did the battery die, but the calculator does not work properly after replacing the battery, so be careful and buy the cheaper better running hp c financial calculator.

B001GZ6QC4|3.0|This movie is a hit in our house.  The acting is just superb.  Rarely do I watch a movie and forget I'm watching a movie, but that happens here. Gary Oldman is fantastic as Commissioner Gordon, Christian Bale is the best Batman ever, and Maggie Gyllenhall is such an improvement over Katie Holmes there are no words.  My only beef with this movie is the sound editing.  If you have the volume at a normal level to hear the conversations between the characters, when the action starts you're pretty much blasted by the explosions; I find myself constantly having to adjust the sound while I watch, and keep the subtitles on so that if the sound is okay for the action, we can still understand what people are saying.  Hopefully when the next one comes to DVD, the sound editing will be better.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|so much fun but time consuming! cant wait to show the kids in the morning! they will love it. some of the games are annoying though

You must get this CD/MP3 or regret it

B005VPSEK2|5.0|Firstly, I bought this album because after all, it's the music. Kelly sings what she wants and doesn't allow others to tell her what songs should be on an album to make it a \\"commercial\\" success. I admire that. I also appreciate the duets she does, such as Because Of You with Reba. The duet with Jason Aldean on this album simply gets inside you. Secondly, I appreciate her view of Ron Paul, and being a person with limited dollars to spend on music, this week is Kelly week.

B0056BMK6K|5.0|I'd been putting off reading anything by John Locke, thinking he couldn't possibly write anything I'd be interested in. Having just received my kindle for Christmas though, I thought I'd see what all the fuss was about, and downloaded a few of his 99c e-books. And wow! Fast-paced reads, and so  much fun. Something so seriously lacking in my library until now.   So, being a writer myself and hoping to start self-publishing this year, I bought this book out of curiosity (How did he do it?) and in the hopes that something might click. I never for a second thought he'd give me an easy way out - and I wasn't disappointed.  I come from an accounting background, so it makes total sense to me to treat my writing as another business. My biggest problem is marketing, and being new to the game of Indie publishing and social networking, I've found it both tedious and hard to find my \\"audience\\". Thanks to reading John's book, I realised I didn't really know who my audience was. My scope was too broad.   He makes no bones about the fact that he had to work hard to find his readers. It's also refreshing to hear an author say he thinks of what he can give his readers first, rather than just writing a book and hoping \\"people\\" will like it. Whether you think it's crass or not, we all want to make money from our writing, otherwise we wouldn't keep doing it in the hope of quitting our day jobs.  No, this is not a sure-fire way to make your book a kindle best-seller, but it's a sure-fire way to shake up your marketing and get you heading in the right direction to find your readers.  Thanks John for a refreshingly honest read.

Worth saving to your Cloud, for later accessibility for friends or family. Definitely worth it as a FAotD download. An aside, do not let the name of the app fool you; has little to do with fantasy/RPG genre, nor is it a dungeon crawler.  It is a puzzle type game which is reminiscent of Pipedream on the NES. Enjoy the distractions!

1241681244|5.0|New York City in the Big '80s is the backdrop, lead actor, and punchline of this fantastic, sprawling, richly detailed and realized debut novel by famous New Journalist Tom Wolfe.<br /><br />\\"Punchline,\\" you might ask? Well, consider that the book was published just before a bond seller named Michael Milken galvanized the city with his sordid and high-profile arrest and just before a New York State schoolgirl named Tawana Brawley dropped a racially-explosive bombshell regarding her apparent victimhood at the hands of whites. In the book the bond salesman is named Sherman McCoy; the \\"victimized\\" student is named Henry Lamb. You kind of get the feeling Wolfe here was trying out something called \\"New New Journalism\\", i. e. reporting on the story before it even happens.<br /><br />Beyond its headline-stealing, the book is a rich stew of dramatic juxtaposition, political and social commentary, characterization and caricature, all boiled in the broth of a New York Wolfe toiled in for years and had researched at length for this novel. At times it reminds you of that famous New York-based TV series that came after, \\"Law & Order,\\" with its in-depth examination of what goes on in a Bronx courthouse as a DA and his minions examine the Lamb case and what to do with it. At other times it reminds you of that other '90s TV series set in the city, \\"Seinfeld,\\" with its amusement at people's baser selves and its development of an insular lingo. As he strides among Manhattan's upper-crust set, McCoy sees women as either older \\"social x-rays\\" or younger \\"lemon tarts;\\" partiers ask for sparkling water, not Perrier; and interior designers shudder at the memory of mirror overuse, a. k. a. \\"Mirror Indigestion.\\"<br /><br />Most famously, Sherman styles himself a \\"Master of the Universe,\\" the phrase that stuck with people most here. Sherman's hubris is the source of much of \\"Bonfire's\\" first-half satire; his downfall and discovery of a certain dignity provides \\"Bonfire's\\" second-half uplift.<br /><br />\\"Bonfire\\" doesn't focus solely on McCoy. There's a prosecutor named Kramer who shares his boss's longing for finding someone known as the \\"Great White Defendant,\\" a big-name criminal suspect who isn't black and poor. There's also Peter Fallow, an alcoholic reporter who finds his feet covering the Lamb case for the sensationalist New York Post, em, I mean City Light.<br /><br />Floating around the edges of the story are other characters whose minds we never get to enter. One, Reverend Bacon, is a black minister and pressure-group leader who steals money from a white upper-crust church and waves off their complaints, telling them he's their \\"prudent broker...who can control the steam\\" of the inner city. He's the one who works up the people when McCoy's case comes to trial. Bacon's resemblance to one Al Sharpton may or may not be incidental: Sharpton was another real-life character who didn't raise his profile to a national level until after \\"Bonfire's\\" publication. Wolfe isn't afraid to push racial buttons, or skewer targets of varied ethnicities, to make his points about the baseline dysfunction dogging NYC.<br /><br />The book doesn't always work at the same high level. Kramer starts out a pretty interesting character before devolves into a one-dimensional horndog, while Fallow's comic inability to grasp basic American culture seems strained. There's a speech in the middle of the book by a novelist dying of AIDS who references Edgar Allen Poe's \\"Masque Of The Red Death\\" (Poe Towers is also the name of the housing project where Lamb is from) in a way that feels like Wolfe straining for the kind of literary affect he captures elsewhere in stride.<br /><br />The book scores so often you ignore the off-notes like you would a weak pun in Shakespeare. In McCoy, Wolfe creates a wonderfully perverse yet strangely sympathetic figure. You will hate him in the beginning, yet as he is pulled and twisted by the system that fed him for so long, you begin to care, andrecognize in him something of a common humanity. I think it's this element that gives the book a hidden depth that stays with you after the laughs fade.<br /><br />For me, \\"Bonfire\\" is a richly rewarding reading experience, married to its time in a wonderfully redolent way yet not limited by it in terms of message. It's not like the kind of greed McCoy embodied went away with Ronald Reagan, Culture Club, and big hair, or that color-blindness now reigns supreme. I think mirrors may even be making a comeback. \\"Bonfire\\" is not only a laugh-getter and a reader roller-coaster; its social commentary remains sharp as ever.recognize in him something of a common humanity.

B006RED4GA|3.0|I have been a fan of horror movies my entire life and they almost never disappoint me. And I can't really say that this one disappointed me either. However, what you see in the preview is really not at all what you get. The mystery of the ghosts is never really solved, the pace doesn't pick up until the last 20 minutes and instead of intentional artistic omission being the reason behind the unanswered questions once the credits started rolling, it seemed more like poor execution of an otherwise good idea. I have never been one to comment on movies rented here but I felt compelled to give the warning that this movie, in my opinion, is in the same vein as some of Sam Raimi films. If you go into it wanting lots of scares and gore then you will be disappointed to find that there is more comedy than anything else. Definitely not a bad thing (I love Sam Raimi) but I probably would have liked this movie more had I known what I was buying. And that's that. : )

B005OZ4E3A|4.0|I've loved Laura since we traveled to Italy when she released her first album and saw her on the TV shows. We didn't speak much Italian back then but we loved her sound. Since then we've returned several times and our Italian is better but so is our love for Laura's music! Still, I just couldn't pull the trigger and give Inedito a full 5-stars because she's grown up now and the music and singing gives the feel of an older, mature Laura. Obviously she IS older and more mature but I wish she could have kept up her tempo and music pacing, especially of her first 2 albums.

B0000029LG|5.0|I have finally finished buying all mj's solo albums (except his j5  & jacksons era). after more than 2 years of listening to all mj's albums. IMHO all his albums are equally amazing. each of them have their own special thing. But my out of mj's albums this my most listened album. I found gems like tabloid junkie, money,simile, this time around. but i have to say this is not your feel good, pop sweet album. It's mj's response to all media craziness that surround it him. to me is his most personal, with this album i get a glimpse of the real michael jackson. my favorite tracks are earth song, they don't care about us, stranger in moscow, scream, tabloid junkie,money and smile. you are not alone is also good and sweet,his voice is amazing, but i don't listen as much as the mention above. I recommend this to every music lover, who wants a glimpse what happens when a musical genius gets angry. well i recommend all his albums, including blood on the dance floor and invincible, for the latest one i have to add he could have done so much better (by hearing some outtake and rare songs from that  era such as xcape,shout,slave to the rhythm). i think he pushed himself so much that didn't cut the right tracks, even though i like most of them, i'm sure he could have done it so much better i also recommend destiny and triumph, i feel they deserve some recognition. they are solid amazing albums and almost as amazing as mj solo albums.
0393338827|5.0|I read this in one evening.  A very insightful look at the systemic problems plaguing the \\"financial services industry' in America and abroad.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Fun puzzle game, I like that there is no timer pressure, you can take your time and think moves through.  Challenging &amp; fun!
0817439390|3.0|I wish I knew this book had no table of contents before I bought it. Without a TOC, you either read it page-to-page, not knowing what's next, or do keyword searches if you already know what you're looking for. Or I guess could look up the table of contents from the paperback version, write the chapter titles on a sticky note and paste it onto my Kindle. What a waste.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It doesn't have different levels to choose from but mixes it up often. It's easy and a lot of fun to play. Love it!
B00009RAJI|5.0|Everybody knows 'Rumours,' even the most casual Mac fan has heard every song a million times.  However, initial CD releases for this treasure were rife with muddied sound.  I remember buying a CD and thinking the audio was crap; I much preferred my step dad's vinyl.  However, I purchased all three of the Fleetwood Mac remasters in 2004 when they were released.  The audio is amazing.  You can hear so much more instrumentation with the sound cleaned up and the vocals/harmonies sound spectacular.  My only gripe with Disc 1 is the obvious \\"remix\\" of the original version of \\"Silver Springs.\\"  I own the 4-CD Boxed Set, 'The Chain,' from 1992 which includes the original mix of the song, which was left off the album in 1977 and relegated to b-side status of the album's first single, \\"Go Your Own Way.\\"  I would have included the original mix of the song on Disc 1, and placed this \\"remix\\" on the second disc.  Speaking of the second disc ... I love it ... some of the \\"demos\\" are not all that different, but you can hear vast differences on \\"Go Your Own Way,\\" \\"Gold Dust Woman,\\" and \\"You Make Lovin' Fun.\\"  One of the real treats of the second disc is the original demo for Stevie Nicks' \\"Planets of the Universe,\\" a song she wrote in 1976 and demoed for 'Rumours,' but no one could ever figure out how to produce it.  A finished version of the song, along with additional lyrics, shows up on Stevie's 2001 album 'Trouble in Shangri-La,' and the song was a modest hit for her that year.  There was even a #1 dance remix to it.  The packaging to the album is great and includes some awesome photos that I think were included on the original vinyl.  The liner notes are insightful.  The casual Mac fans will not think the product is worth the price, but a true Mac fan will want this.
0060873027|5.0|I ordered the book as a Christmas gift for my son. I looked inside and everything looked good. My son was happy with it and has read most of it already before he starts the next quarter of college.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Good game to play against the computer or to use with a human opponent.  I have been having fun playing my 13 teat old grandson.
B001QITO52|5.0|Packaging was great, got here in a timely manner, all around I'm happy with this purchase. Seventeen Eighteen Nineteen Twenty
0307949486|5.0|Saw the movie last night and sincerely enjoyed it.  Lost of action, twists and turns.  Looking forward to the next in the series.
B004QX07G4|1.0|This book was awful. I purchased it, like everybody else, because I love Ellen and think she is hilarious. This book is exactly the opposite. The entire book is written about how she doesn't have anything to write about. She even put a section in for children to color in pictures because she had nothing else to write. I would definitely NOT recommend this book to ANYONE!
B0058VW36U|5.0|this app... oh this app is soooooo cool I love it it is a cute little app that is addictive
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|This is a completely ridiculous retelling of the classic story. Stick with the BBC version; you'll be much happier. Knightly's Elizabeth Bennett is totally unbelievable, and the Darcy is even less so. The shortened version of the story is totally unacceptable!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game its the best. I play this game a lot and it never gets old I love it
0375842209|5.0|I finished this book yesterday afternoon while on a vacation; even gave up time walking on the beach to read this wonderful story!  There is no need to review ths story line, as it has been done sufficiently by previous commentary.  Although I probably wouldn't have picked up this book myself, it was a book club selection, and quite frankly, I was hooked after the first few pages.  The writing is beautiful, almost poetic, and the characters are well defined.  Who would think that a story narrated by Death, told in the time of Nazi Germany, would hold so much hope, bravery, and courage?  Yes, there is plenty of sadness, loss, grief, and destruction, but through it all, a tale of the beauty of the human spirit, goodness, and love.  I will recommend this book to everyone, and it is one of the few books I will reread.  It will haunt me for a long time....
1451627289|5.0|Yes, this is a sci-fi fictional novel involving time travel with the goal to prevent the Kennedy assassination, thereby changing history for the better (supposedly then no Vietnam, no 58,000+ killed, no Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy assassinations, etc.).  And yes, Stephen King's writing is as usual superb and riveting.  And yes, the book is about 900 pages long, but with each page being absolutely wonderful story-telling, one gets lost in the pages, and actually leaves one wanting, even crying for more.  But most of all, \\"11-22-63\\" title aside, this is a wonderful, tender, heart-felt, love story, and it is by far my favorite S. King novel.  I may even read it again, as I enjoyed the process so very much.  Read it for the sci-fi time travel story-line, or read it for the Oswald-Kennedy assassination line, or read it just to excape the present and experience a more innocent, kinder America of 1958-1963, but if you do not have tears in your eyes as you read the last page, you missed the point of the book.  And I am not a man who easily tears up.<br /><br />I loved this book, and once I got hooked (about page 5) I read it in two days.  I literally could not put it down until I reached the last page.  I think you will experience the same.<br /><br />Don't buy this book if you are looking for a treatise on the Kennedy assassination.  It is not that at all.  Buy it to experience the special, tender love shared between a man and a woman. This is the heart and soul of the book.<br /><br />kone
B002RL7VKC|4.0|My three-year-old tractor obsessed son got this for Christmas, and while he likes playing with it, you really can't take the tractor apart at all. It makes a fine addition to our Duplo collection, don't expect to be able to do much building with it.
B005STGIYA|5.0|So many of these reviews are OLD!!  Hey, don't get me wrong, the copyright protected CD is a pain.  All you have to do is buy the download or the vinyl and you no longer have to gripe about not easily getting it to your iTunes account, no need to put up one star on an excellent 2 record set because you made an uneducated decision.  Download and enjoy, from the HEAVY first half, to the beautiful acoustic second set.  After this album the Foo Fighters figured out how to fuse their two halves, heavy and acoustic, together into single songs.  Songs like 'The Pretender' or 'These Days'.  Listen to this and have each style seperated, it's great, plus a way to be a part of The Foo Fighters progression to their Grammy Nominated future.  Long Live Rock, which has ALWAYS included the Foo Fighters.
B0055SWM08|5.0|this game has absolutely gorgeous graphics and music, it is a delight only to look at it and is even better playing it. It looks awesome in the Kindle Fire as well as the game offers a relaxing and sometimes challenging gameplay
B005ZUR724|1.0|The quality of the game doesn't matter much if it is literally unplayable for a week at a time for a lot of players, with no word about when service will return for us.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I really like it but how do you get to keep the current time? I would have given it five stars if I could figure that out.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|As a fan of Apple products I eagerly awaited this book and reading it took on a new significance following the death of Steve Jobs. I took my time reading it and tried to understand the person whose vision has impacted the lives of so many. He was a marketing genius, and understood how to make great simple products that appealed to everyone. He did lack social graces by a long shot and his attitude towards his children, co-workers, girlfriends, colleagues was something I did not appreciate. Actually those revelations made me lose a little bit of respect for the guy. They were no secret to those familiar with Apple but I think I expected Steve to be better than most just like he wanted his products to be better than the rest. I felt sorry for him and his family towards the end of the book.  A well researched, documented book that is a must read in order to understand this complex man and Apple.
B0063IH60K|5.0|love playing this and the touch is great. great game. I will be recommending this to my friends. love this game.
B004ECDNJU|1.0|so so lame don't waste your time hate it the worse game on android.  s u u c k s
0446573019|5.0|I started this book and had to Remington myself that this was a BaLdacci book and not a Child novel.<br /><br />There are various similarities between John Puller, Baldacci's hero , and Jack Reacher. I have not missed a Reacher novel since I discovered him and now I am also hooked on John Puller as we'll.<br /><br />Puller has his differences from Reacher and the author has done a masterful job of creating a great character who has his own background and operation. They are both CID agents and lone wolf types, but there the similarity ends.<br /><br />This is a great book similar to but very different from the Reacher novels.<br /><br />I am looking forward to the next John Puller adventure.
B0011UBDTK|1.0|This was a Christmas gift and I felt terrible having to have the buyer return not one but two sets. Both of the sets had visible defects on some of the discs. The discs that appeared to be ok skipped. The plastic on the first set was horribly scratched and cracked. The quality is awful. I would never recommend this to anyone. Pure junk.
0553386794|5.0|While there are some elements of fantasy in this book, it reads like a novel of medieval action with battles between knights and Kings. The author has done a remarkable job of presenting the story through the perspective of each of the. Major characters and weaving them into a cohesive narrative.<br /><br />King Robert , King of the  Seven Kingdoms, presses his firend,Ned Stark, a lord of the North,, into service as the Hand of theLong. The Hand is the person closest to the King who wields the power of the King in the day to day administration of the kingdom.<br /><br />There is the Wall which separates the Kingdom from the North where evil lurks and unworldly things happen. The reader learns that the world in at the end of a 'summer' which has lasted for years and a  long siege of winter is coming.<br /><br />In addition, there is another land of warrior nomads Where two surviving members of the. Previous ruling family are trying to convince the. Nomads to attack the Seven Kingdams and to restore the throne to their family.<br /><br />It be ones apparent that the previous Hand has been murdered and the Ned must face the intrigue and<br />Olivia's of the court where he learns that no one can be trusted.<br /><br />A complicated plot but worth it. I already have the sequel and am ready to read it.<br /><br />I highly recommend this  book.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|If you like a challenge, killing things,and frustration this is the game for you.the small glitches in my opinion are made to frustrate you and keep you playing.keep this game from children because playing will result in broken androids, out of anger. Enjoy.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is one of the very best games I have ever played in my life. I hope this was useful.
B002SR2PKG|1.0|First book I have read by Stephen King and I am not sure whether I will read another one by him. The story is long winded with pages and pages of boring detour which are absolutely useless. The story itself, even without all the junks, is simply not interesting. Maybe the first 20 or so pages appeared to be good and that's about it. Hugely disappointed with such a famous author.
1419702238|5.0|My son has collected all these books and he enjoys them all. These books are a fun read. They keep your child actively involved in reading and having lots of fun.
B005TZFZJC|5.0|This album,[in my opinion]is way better than Loud & I have that album too. Loud had some pretty decent tracks as well, like \\"What's My Name\\" (feat. Drake), \\"Man Down\\", \\"California King Bed\\", \\"Cheers (Drink to That\\" and \\"Skin\\". Rihanna really went in on this album, she did a fantastic job, yes it is raunchier, but for some reason it seems like the more raunchier her music gets, it best it sounds. Honestly, I personally prefer this Rihanna over the Rihanna when she first hit the music scene. This album is great to dance to! I list Talk That Talk, Rated R & Good Girl Gone Bad my top 3 fav albums by Rihanna. My favorite tracks on Talk That Talk are \\"You Da One\\", \\"Talk That Talk\\", 'We All Want Love\\", \\"Drunk on Love\\", \\"Roc Me Out\\", \\"Do Ya Thang\\" & \\"Fool in Love\\". Overall, this is a pretty solid album and one of the best she's put out in recent years. I'd recommend this album to all Rihanna fans who loved GGG, Rated R & Loud.
B005W8SNNG|1.0|I never walk out on a movie but I should have on this one. I was waiting for one..just one... redeeming action from a charactor...I never got it. Very sad. Too bad as it had good actors involved. I guess they needed some money but they should not have stooped this low.
B000GGOCIE|5.0|This is one of the finest fantasy novels ever written, and it is a must read for every woman and every man with the courage to do so.  It takes us back to the truth of the beginning of religion, when woman was treasured as the goddess, and before the men of the Roman and English sects lowered woman to the evil being we have become.  And it tells of this downfall, as Avalon fades into the mist and we lose forever the reverence we had for the goddess.  I still hold her in esteem, as do many others, and even if you are \\"Christian\\", the meaning of her contribution is not lost.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|101 games rules it has an amassing combination of games that are fun for everyone. so in conclusion. play this game.
B004ECDNJU|1.0|I will pay you to take this crappy game off my phone. Thanks for wasting my time with a poorly planned data skimmer.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is one of the most addicting game I have ever played in my life I hope that everyone would like it as much as me
B006BDHAX0|4.0|Galaxy SII, only force close was due to multiple ops at same time. Any programmer might not think of all scenarios for running multiple apps and changing between. Good play, many many options levels. keeper
B003L77G2Y|5.0|Great purchase. The movie was shipped very fast. Arrived in plenty of time before Christmas. Would gladly buy from this seller again.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great game. The game has some challenges but good help is available if. and when you get stuck.
0385534639|4.0|I was immediately drawn into this book and couldn't put it down.  I really liked the structure and the variety of characters.  I was engaged by all their stories and never resented shifts between narrative perspective.  I also found the time changes were well used to build suspense and made the later interaction of characters brought together from different strands of the narrative much richer.  The circus itself was even better than I could have imagined.  So complex, so very interesting and beautiful.  I did find the overall story arc about the unspecified competition between the illusionists lacked a convincing motivation and I was surprised that these characters didn't rebel more, even though they were bound to their situation.  I liked the style of this book, which reminded me a bit of Angela Carter, but perhaps more direct.  I did find the occasional grammatical errors unfortunate and unnecessary - such a gifted writer should have a proper editor.  Whilst there is a dark undercurrent to this book, I actually found most of the characters surprisingly benign and cooperative, which balanced the mood well.  This book is crying out for an imaginative screen adaptation, although imagining its world was perhaps even more satisfying than seeing it would be.  I was sorry to finish this book!
B006BDHAX0|2.0|As others have said... it is unstable on Kindle fire. The game just shuts down and you loose your current game.  This typically happens about every 3-4 games.  I'm glad it was a free app of the day but I don't think I'll be keeping it.
B005ELZNH0|5.0|This is a condensed version of the \\"Complete Columbia Album Collection\\". The mini-LP sleeves are the same design as in that set (albeit renumbered for this set), and the CD masterings appear to be the same. (For instance, the version of \\"We Want Miles\\" is the same as in the \\"Complete\\" boxed set with the extra tracks from the Tokyo show). As such, this is ideal for someone who wants a nice collection of key highlights from all phases of Davis' Columbia career, but finds the \\"Complete\\" collection overkill or prohibitively expensive.
1442419814|4.0|Uglies starts off a bit slow, but when it starts getting into the meat of the story it becomes hard to put down. I thought that Tally was a good character, although she starts off in the book as someone who was obsessed with becoming pretty no matter the cost. I can't wait to see what happens in the next book of the series.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Not the best thing I've ever played, but it's not the worst either. I find it pretty annoying that you have to earn points to unlock games.
B004UUKDNA|5.0|I bought this CD a few weeks ago and I've listened to it almost every day since. Some of the lyrics are a bit lacking such as those in the song Don't Stop (Color On the Walls), but that doesn't take away from the fact that these songs are incredibly catchy and contain some good dance beats that will get stuck in your head. I look forward to hearing more great things from Foster the People in the future.
B004FOA84A|3.0|loved this game, it was fun and very easy to play. My only complaint is it only took an.hour or so to get thru the entire thing. I think it should be.a.tad more challenging. That being said I still liked it and I am glad I played. I do recommend.
B005TZFZJC|4.0|Some of the beats on Talk That Talk are a bit odd, but for the most part it's a pretty good CD. Unlike her past albums, this one is unedited so it's not meant for a young audience. My main complaint about the album is regarding the length of the song Birthday Cake which is only about 1:18 long. It's too bad that the song is so short because the beats were good and the way it cuts off to go into the next track happens in such an abrupt way.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game is just like playing with actual deck of cards. I really enjoy it. I wish there was a way to change the deck of cards like other solitaire games offer. The speed of the game is pretty neat too!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game. My husband would have lots to say about, except, I won't let him have a turn.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|So this game worked perfectly on my old droid x but on my galaxy nexus all I get is force closes
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the app is ok. I wish it were easier to get points to open more games  without signing up for other apps.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|very good app,had the free one then bought the ad-free one good deal for .99,very addicting game going to also try rio and seasons
B005HI4LMS|4.0|Several young college students plan to spend a weekend camping near a lake in the woods.  On their way they pass a couple of scary looking guys in an old pickup truck, setting the stage for the kind of classic horror film in which you know exactly what to expect: crazy hillbillies wielding chainsaws and axes, picking off the college kids one by one leaving only a beautiful and determined young woman to escape and tell the tale (and pave the way for a sequel if the first ends up making money).  Except in this case, nothing turns out like you'd expect, because those scary hillbillies turn out to be none other than Tucker and Dale, decent and hapless hicks out on vacation in an old cabin, who just can't understand why the college kids are so afraid of them.  It's slapstick horror done right, and the less said about the hijinks that ensue the better, since it takes some pretty awful and hilarious turns.  I kept finding myself thinking, every time, just before each new disaster: \\"no, they're not going to go there...\\" and then, of course they did, and it was even worse than I expected and funnier than it had a right to be.  Tyler Labine and Alan Tudyk make a perfect clueless comic duo - something like a \\"redneck\\" version of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost in [[ASIN:B0006A9FKA Shaun of the Dead]].  Lots of fun (but not for the squeamish).
B0061S073A|5.0|when my 2 year old wants to play games or listen to books i just click on this app &amp; i have all the kid friendly apps saved. i don't have to worry about her getting into any of my stuff or purchasing other things. using from kindle fire.
B0042J6VUS|5.0|I was skeptical how $7.99 could buy anything that worked but this is really great.  Works really well and is heavier duty than I expected.  Good job manufacturers! I really like it and it works perfectly for the interviews I do.
B006BDHAX0|1.0|I like the game, but seldom have time to play to the end at one time. No way to save a game in progress so any time I leave the game, I have to start over. It also ends on its one. I have yet to finish a game. 5 stars if save is added and the bugs fixed.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I don't much care for the unlocking part of the game... but the games I have unlocked are a lot of fun.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its fun and addicting. some games are hard but it keeps you coming back for more. and since its free its worth the download.
B0063IH60K|5.0|What an awesome free app...this game is so addicting...love my Fire and Amazon! Hours of fun playing this game! Thank you!
030788743X|5.0|As Wade/Parzifal becomes immersed in the cyber world of OASIS, I became immersed in this book - being torn away only after strong protests and heavy grumbling.  I will leave it to the other reviewers to explain the world of the book, but suffice it to say that I started rereading it before the little Kindle electrons had faded from the final sentence.  The author has created not one but four believable characters that the reader will care about and if you have ever had a single moment of wonder when playing or even just observing a videogame then this book is for you.    This book brings to mind Daniel Suarez' Daemon and sequel Freedom trading off the socially inept Halladay for the insane megalomaniac game maker in Suarez' story.  Much more humanity in this book.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Originally a little apprehensive about this case after reading so many negative reviews in late November and early December.  Decided to listen to my gut and try it out anyway.  This cover is just as described. It is extremely low profile and light weight which I really like since the kindle fire it much heavier than planned.  I did not want something that added weight and bulk as I planned on carrying my kindle with my in my purse regularly.    When I read about the stand not working properly, I tried to \\"break in\\" the mechanism prior to needing the stand.  While reading, I would hold the cover open in the folded position flat against the back to re-inforce the crease that creates the stand.  I just returned from a 10 day trip that included multiple plane rides and down time.  The stand worked GREAT!  Held strong on every place ride, even with some pretty bad turbulance.  Also had it standing on the arm or an overstuffed leather sofa to watch ESPN gametracker during a movie with the family.  No problems with it coming undone or falling.   Overall, this cover is exactly what I was looking for.  I wanted something that added protection (it has passed the test of being dropped a few times already) while not adding bulk.  I also wanted something that would work well for travel.  My advice if you're unsure, go with your gut feeling about the product. I don't try to use my kindle like an ipad...just for media as it's made and this case is wondferul!
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|If you want a quick guide on the artistic sensibility of someone, ask their opinion of The Tree of Life. Those who hate this film -- and they are virulent in their hatred -- are generally incapable of appreciating something unusual. They demand a simple plot, dialogue, A STORY!  Pay attention and you'll notice a very deep and profound story in this film, one about loss and how even the most carefully chosen beliefs and philosophies fail to prepare people for tragedy.   These scenes where \\"nothing happens\\" are some of the most astoundingly beautiful frames of film ever captured. So much story is condensed into these moments that you can understand the personality of the characters without the creation of cliched drama.  Proust once wrote that art creates its own audience. In a way, I'm glad that this movie has created so many angry detractors -- it's proof that Malick is up to something big and important. It reminds me of how 2001: A Space Odyssey and Raging Bull were treated by average viewers when they first played in theaters.  Fifteen years from now, The Tree of Life will be the only film of 2011 that anyone remembers. And those who so public, angrily denounced it will slowly delete their screeds against it in silence.
B004ECDNJU|5.0|Fun game,  think fast, works great on my Fire!!! Like the music and sound. Good game to. kick off the New Year.
B006PAZMMK|5.0|So unique, nothing else out there sounding like this.  Great beats and stops.  Can't wait for a full release this year.
B006BDHAX0|1.0|until every time without fail, it just exits the game.  After looking at the reviews, I see im not the only one.  Does Amazon do any kind of evaluation of their daily app?  This is not the first bunk app they've offered.  Im starting to wonder about the rest of the products across amazon.
B004GGM444|5.0|Really good album, impulse purchase and checking out the samples and found it to be very unique and enjoyable.  Looking forward to more.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Game plays great hours of entertainment. Easy download in just seconds. Would recommend to anyone who plays the game. Challenging, but not frustrating. Just fun.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|This is a wonderful movie: charming, funny, pretty to look at and entertaining.  It does make a few demands on its audience, however, as do many of Allen's films. It helps to have some familiarity with the major cultural icons of the 19th and 20th centuries  -  all of them pretty familiar names, nothing really very obscure. Any kind of basic art history course and one in American literature would be plenty.  In fact, just knowing these artists and writers existed would probably be enough. It helps also if one can recognize obnoxious in-laws-to-be and not be offended by an accurate portrayal of them. A sense of humor helps as does an ability to sit back and enjoy oneself. With those minimal qualifications one would have to work pretty hard at it not to enjoy \\"Midnight in Paris\\". Allen deserves credit also for casting Owen Wilson in the lead; an unlikely choice, perhaps, but he does an excellent job. But Allen has always picked great casts; so it's not so surprising. [There are a couple of errors in the English subtitles: In Cole Porter's song, \\"Let's Do It\\", the O and the B in Oyster Bay should be upper case, and people from Latvia are called Letts, not Latts - that's part of the wordplay in the lyric.]
B005OCFHHK|5.0|This movie set was exactly as ordered from Amazon. Excellent gift selection. This selection included all Harry Potter movies in Blue-Ray format.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Fun and easy to play  Kids and adults would both enjoy this game  Nice relaxing game, also good for stress buster.   Play a game or two after work to unwind.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I expected a decent version of this game to waste time with once in a while, and this is it. No frills but it is just plain decent and exactly as expected, so it gets five stars
B005HSL626|2.0|the game itself was very enjoyable and I ignored the ads because after all, the app is free but a screen popped up telling me the game contained a virus and that my kindle fire had to be SCANNED! I tried ignoring it but it would keep popping up out of nowhere! so I uninstalled the app ASAP. this kindle cost 200 bucks and Im not taking any risks. I only slightly recommend this app. :(
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I really like this app for it's versatility on the go. Very helpful when you're looking up a certain verse, and the plans really help you get the most of it.
B005M2A4D4|3.0|I had such high hopes for this season.  Nixon! Hitler! Cybermen! Alas, it was just a poorly contructed mess that was one missed opportunity after another.  Take the first two parter:  a great premise involving Nixon and the moon landing.  Unfortunately, it was a poorly constructed story which jerked the viewer around in a non-linear fashion.  Is it asking too much to have a cliffhanger resolved in beginning of the second part?  Apparently.   The pirate episode was a complete waste as was the two parter with the dooplegangers.  Why did those stories need to be told?  They were just obvious filler to pad out the season until we got back to the real business of the Silence and River Song - which ultimately proved very underwhelming once they were revealed at the end of the season.    The second half was much, much better - but still nettlesome issues remained.  Let's Kill Hitler?  How about Let's have a Plot for a Change!  Moffat is becoming the Tim Burton of Dr. Who - great ideas, great set pieces - but no narrative to hang it all on.  Apparently Moffat amused himself with relegating the Fuhrer to a cameo in the episode that bore his name. Instead it was a rather annoying wasted opportunity.  The actor playing Rory is better in this season in that his lines are better delivered and he's not stepping on pauses quite as much - but the character is still somewhat annoying.  Amy Pond?  Sure she's attractive in the physical sense - but as a person?  Not so much.  Those two should have been left behind last season when they got married. Their appeal and dynamic has played out.  Verdict:  Rental.
B002MU4NL8|5.0|What an extremely solid and fun movie. The cast was perfectly chosen and the fun and parody factors in Galaxy Quest are second to none. Think this will always be one of my feel-good movies to go back to. You cannot go wrong watching this movie.
B002UXRGM0|4.0|I bought this because I was interested in something that would show off my Blu-ray capabilities, but also be educational for my kids as they got older.  What has surprised me is that they love it NOW.  My three- and five-year old keep asking to watch it over and over again.  I am somewhat selective with a few of the segments as I'm not sure how appropriate life and death battles are for kids this young, but most of the segments are fine for their age group.  The cinematography is outstanding and the Blu-Ray quality is top-notch.  The only thing keeping me from giving this 5 stars is that it doesn't keep my attention as much as I had expected.  My kids are constantly asking to watch it and I had a hard enough time staying motivated to watch the whole thing through for the first time.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|By far the best study program I have come across. Excellent flexability and super resources. Only wished more of the bibles were free.
B004ECDNJU|5.0|Game is good... Probably would give it a 4 based on an honest assessment.  It's well done, but not awesome.    I could care less about colorblind mode and certainly wouldn't rate the game down for not having it.  If I was colorblind, I'd just email the dev and see if he might include it with an update.    And Superman75 is humorous, but inconsistant.  Last month he was a disgruntled Jew, and this month he's in a cult on a mountain.  Whatever -
B004ECDNJU|1.0|probably the worst game I have ever downloaded I don't even know who would pay $.99 for this abortion of an app. don't even bother
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Giving it 5 stars, regardless. Would have added an extra star, just for the Kindle Fire crowd. Newsflash: you all, are NOT the center of the Android world. In fact, you're a very tiny percentage. Android developers probably hate you all by now. The whiny-est group, I think I've encountered.  As for the game. Runs well on Samsung GSII.
1400097029|5.0|Banville's \\"The Sea\\" is the best book I've read ... and I read for a living.<br /><br />His prose is a siren song, luring you ever closer to the edge of the cliff ... and you go willingly, ready to fall into its abyss of perfectly crafted sentences .... Banville's brillance blinds you to all other fiction and lingers long after the last word.<br /><br />I've read the book 3 times and am about 3/4 of the way through the audio and, still, its perfection takes my breath away. Bravo!
B004GYY714|5.0|Fantastic app allowing radio access on the fly.  Works very well.  Was dissappointed that my favorite station was not available.  That's where I had my aha moment and discovered I can listen to other stations in other locations that cover the same topic.  Great stuff!

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|My wife wanted this for Christmas.  I preordered it and waited.  It was sent before it was released, and I expected it as soon as it was released.  I probably would have gotten it, but it was delivered up the street and not to me.  Those people were away.  As soon as they got back they brought it to my house.  The movie is fantastic.  I liked it as much as my wife.  Good present.

B003L20IFQ|5.0|Probably one of the most brilliant movies I've seen in a while. The whole concept and filming technique makes it worth the watch alone. Just the fact that they made a movie about a guy in a box last for 90 minutes is genius, plot was good too.
B004QSQM72|5.0|The word that keeps popping up in every other review about Wild Beasts' \\"Smother\\" is majestic and indeed this album is exactly that : a rich , lush collection of eerie melodies from a band that is clearly on top form .   What i found most compelling is how combative the group's view about desire ( carnal and sentimental ) is . \\" I dare we put our tongues to the flames \\" goes husky baritone Tom Flemming on \\" Deeper \\" . \\" I have to know how it feels and im not afraid \\" he continues .  The band has a special gift for creating a music atmosphere of dark romantism : small piano touches , strings , a lustful moan or a ghostly howl ...The two singers' voices are phenomenal with Hayden Thorp's falsetto being fearlessly sensual .   Although this is a group which is initially hard to get into , their work gets more and more revelatory and rewarding with repeated listenings . \\" Loop The Loop \\" is magic melancholy , \\" End Come To Soon \\" an intense pop gem with a wonderful climax , \\" Burning \\" and \\" Invisible \\" at first make you wonder then slowly englulf you .  This is surely the best piece of music i heard during 2011 and one of the most interesting ones i ever had the chance to experience .

B001L63JC8|5.0|This was the mother of all concept albums. The most original and unfortunately the last effort issued by this particular 5 piece.  I particularly am fond of Nursery Cryme but i must admit...this is the most progressive album from at this particular point in time :THE happening band of the moment ! It all ended swiftly and painfully . Red was it for fripp and then just like that ...over!  new stereo mix great also the 5.1 mix ...not to be missed...

0765322889|3.0|This is the first book in a fantasy series that has garnered some very high praise. It is probably most comparable to the Black Company series by Glen Cook, although not quite as well done. The characters are well developed, the history presented has some depth and unique complexity, the plot is not simple and it is not crudely derivative of Tolkien as so many lesser works are. It is not, however, in the same league of literature as Tolkien or a modern classic such as R. Scott Bakker's Second Apocalypse series (The Prince of Nothing, etc). I would guess that anyone who likes serious fantasy literature would certainly enjoy this book and the rest of the series, and perhaps even love them.
B005JLN9Z8|1.0|Give me a break. What a joke and insult to fans of the era this band makes fun of. It's a shame a novelty/joke act such as this actually got signed to a major label while real, serious bands of this genre have struggled to make a living since 1991.  These guys should literally be strung up by their toenails.
0894803123|5.0|After using the manufacturer's book I tried these recipes.  Usually I modify them by what I have on hand.  What fun this was.  We have enjoyed every flavor we made and the recipes come out great!  The book is fun to read, even the history of Ben and Jerry's.  I read some reviews about raw eggs.  Well, I'm a senior citizen and I'm still here!  Let's not get paranoid.  There are tips about using fruit which I found very helpful.  Those mushy brown peaches work out great.  Highly recommend.
1451648537|5.0|Admittedly, I read a few of the reviews before sitting to write this one.  The beginning of the book left the impression that Steve Jobs was a stubborn (to a fault), spoiled rotten brat who had to have it his way or no way...  I didn't particularly want to read any further...  But, my interest and participation in the history of technology and its advancement kept me reading to see the \\"story\\" and compare it to how I have remembered it or it was sold in the media over the years.  It's interesting that the secrecy of Apple and Steve Jobs, as well as his \\"reality distortion field\\" have probably made it impossible to completely know the full and \\"real\\" truth of how technology went from rotary dials and POTS to digital content, smaller and smaller mobile devices and \\"Cloud\\" services.    The one common thread throughout history and the book is that Steve Jobs played a forward and largely dominant role in the devices and technology we all enjoy today.  When he died, I thought \\"Wow!, the innovation will die with him...\\"  I'm encouraged through Isaacson's accounting that such will not be the case.  As he surrounded himself with outstanding creative minds, these people could continue on without his leadership...  The question is will another leader be able to push innovation to the brink with the same success?  This was an intriguing page-turner -- but I do agree with another review that it leaves a lot of questions open regarding many things...  I tend to think that to write about all the \\"details\\" could create a tome too large to produce and would need to be a play-by-play of everything that happened, not just the big things.  I was impressed by the candidness of the interviews.  Perhaps pieces were missing or left out to make the book \\"readable\\" -- but the essence and feel were there.  I've never been an \\"Apple\\" fan and only bought 1 Apple iPod Nano for my child.  I have held various opinions as to why I didn't like Apple products over the years and the main was that I work in an industry that uses Windows based computers and the Apple products don't integrate well or at all.  So, we were not able to be a 2-system household (Apple and Windows) -- so by necessity, Windows won.  This book affirmed my reasoning for not purchasing Apple products and opened my mind as to why I might consider a change in the future.  After reading this book and getting a better understanding of Apple products from the people who created them (not just Steve Jobs' perspective), I can see where the benefits lie and if my family had started out as an \\"Apple\\" family, we would be set with all the products to integrate all of the ease and wonder put into them...  Will I buy \\"Apple\\" products in the future?  Hard to say.  Did this book convince me that they are worth it?  I'm waffling.  What this book did do is take me on a trip down memory lane of how Apple technology moved through the 80's, 90's and 2000's -- a trip worth revisiting.  The most exciting take from the book is the move toward a more \\"digital\\" education where kids aren't packing around 100 pounds in text books...  the future of learning... and the comment from Steve Jobs to \\"keep moving\\" and from Bob Dylan \\"if you're not busy being born, you're busy dying.\\"    I recommend this book to anyone curious about Steve Jobs and everyone who wants to read a bit of history on the growth of technology (Apple, Pixar, Disney, etc.)  It left me wanting to read a similar book (if someone will write it) about Microsoft and the \\"real\\" Bill Gates..., Intel, Oracle, and other founders of lasting technology giants of industry that drive our personal and professional worlds.
B0015DROBO|4.0|Knew it was made into a movie, but had not seen any trailers for it. I'd also read some of the reviews here before purchasing.<br /><br />I really liked the book. I thought it was intriguing, and I couldn't wait to finish it. Now I can't wait to go see the movie!<br /><br />I enjoyed the setting being in Sweden, it was fun reading about a different country and culture. As Salander is introduced, it's hard to like her. But by the end of the book it's hard NOT to like her, and I will most likely be purchasing the next book in this trilogy.<br /><br />Lots of twists and turns... humor, mystery, romance, murder... it's all there. A very enjoyable read, and I would recommend it!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game. Plays in portrait mode.  This is by far the best. version of this game that I have come across.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I am new to the entire apps process and decided to use it based on the recommmendation of some friends. It is easy to navigate and the reading plans are great. One thing that would be nice to have is a secton where you can put in portions of scripture and determine where it is. Other than that,it's great.
B0000041LO|5.0|The Beaux Arts Trio achieved a special distinction with these admirable recordings, featured by the perfect balance between radiant musicality and sheer commitment. Listen for instance the First movement of the Trio No. 21 in C Adagio Pastorale and you will realize how sublime was the approach. They never appear to be hyper romantic, but classical.<br /><br />The rest of the album is first rate. And believe me: Once you had bought it, you will be shielded for ever about any other version available in the market. Memorable and distinguished performances. Don't miss it.<br /><br />This is my last review of 2011. I wish to my all my readers as well as the Amazon family, a very and productive happy New Year.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like it because it moves automaticly and it is one of the better solitaire games I have played  Cool.
B005TPCQ5I|2.0|Not sure it was worth $2 and 90 minutes of my time. The character development was minimal and while I expected a jumpy plot because of the \\"time travel\\" aspect, it just didn't \\"gel\\" for me and despite the time travel really dragged in spots.

B005HSG3TC|3.0|This was a pleasant surprise after my contrary experience with Marware's screen protector.  It's a pretty decent and basic cover for a Kindle...but, it's overpriced.  PROS:   *  It's quite simple in its design, which I like.   *  It makes handling the Kindle a bit easier, as you have less of a tendency to accidently hit the side buttons on the Kindle.   *  It does offer basic protection for exterior surfaces of the Kindle.  CONS:  * Overpriced.  I think a better price point would be $14.99, based on its design and quality of materials.    * It would be nice to see a screen protector added to the MicroShell cover.  Food for thought for a future design.
B000066C6F|1.0|As a female who was 18 when this movie was released, I recently watched it for the good time I usually have with a 1980's movie that features lots of young women and trendy clothing. For the first 45 minutes I was enraptured by the synthesized soundtrack, the hair styles and the high waistlines. I loved reliving the fashion that formed my first standard of beauty. Oh, when hair had to have height..<br /><br />Then I noticed the acting. Then I noticed the plotline. And then I noticed the tedious amount of long shots that add nothing to the story. And this movie is two hours long! Do I need several minutes of glistening aerobics every time they show Curtis' character teaching her class? Do I need to watch entire photo shoots take place or stare at a static long shot of Travolta and Curtis unromantically grappling with each other? I just don't understand a lot of the editing that drags the pace down. Clarifying the loneliness of Linda (Neuman) or the ridiculousness of Sally (Henner) could have been done much more efficiently. It's fun to laugh at the blonde puffy hair of the guy who's dating twins, but I really didn't need to look/listen to him for THAT long.<br /><br />I just couldn't sit through it. I really wanted to because the 80s L.A. culture is so overdone that the film really appeals to me as a Northern Californian. But the film is actually too awful even to laugh at. (More comical is that someone thought this soundtrack would do well, but not one of these songs sounded familiar to this 1980s California girl.)
B002G1YPH0|4.0|With the stock cooler provided with my Core i7, any kind of high load drove CPU temperatures quickly to an unpleasant 100°C.  Now that I use this cooler, even applications like Prime95 can't get my CPU past 50°C.  Installation was relatively painless.  The instructions were quite vague in some places, but Cooler Master has a YouTube video with a more thorough demonstration for installation.  I also had to mount the fan a little higher up on the cooler to make room for the RAM underneath.  I don't think this has any negative effect on cooling.  Included in the box is some thermal paste; that is a nice touch.  The fan is very quiet, but vibration at times creates a faint whining noise at about 800Hz that comes and goes.  I'm actually subtracting one star for this, as it has become extremely annoying.  This could likely be remedied by using a different fan.  Overall, I am very pleased with the cooler.  It is a good price and works well.
1594744769|2.0|This book started with 5 stars. The Florida section is well written and sucked me in nicely. We dropped a star when the action shifted to Wales and the Florida bit was revealed to be nothing more than a clumsy set up. But worse than that as soon as the action his the UK, out came the cliches. Every local seemed to have stepped out of either a Hammer or an Ealing film, lazy, lazy writing. We then meet the kids in the books title, this works well with the photos starting off well but soon becoming plot drivers. Loose another star for the lack of anything happening. This book is way too long, everything is stretched to breaking point. However the real killer is the authors inability to breath life into his characters. Each is simply a plot device and a clumsy one too. Since we don't care for anyone by the time the 'baddies' turn up (three quarter of the way in) I was wondering if the main characters peculiar skill was his inability to work out what is going on around him. Anyway all kinds of stuff happens at the end, but I was so bored at that stage that I didn't bother finishing the book. That says a lot.  Also this is NOT a children's book. There are far too many adult references in it and despite the main character being a teen, this is not YA either (not enough angst) - it's far too dull for adults so just who it's aimed at is a mystery.

B004LROUNG|3.0|I like Grisham novels because it's a kind of read you can't put down. This one didn't disappoint in this regard, but was to bland and black-and-white'ish.

B005URRCUY|4.0|I recently purchased El Camino with Magic Potion expectations.  Although not quite as good as Magic Potion, it is still worth the purchase.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|The third season of Veronica Mars blew my mind. There is this whole other world of crime fighter for Veronica in college. Everything is so much more intense, it's not just high school and your local community anymore. Veronica has so much growing up to do, we forget that she's just a regular teenager like everyone else. (Even if she won't want to admit it to herself) And on the other hand there's her work, and her future she's aiming for. Although this is the last season of the great show, it's a 5-star for me. There's just so much flavor in this show. I personally don't like shows like; CSI or any of those other p.i shows it's annoying, but not Veronica Mars. It snared me and I wish that is did do a long run. It had great potential.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like that there are many games and you have to work on getting more. If you do not want the adds you can buy it, but the adds do not bother me.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I was a little worried when I ordered this because a lot of reviews said that they received counterfeit controllers that didn't function properly. So I took a chance and ordered one because they were only $43 compared to $60 at every major retailer. So, I got it foe my brother for Christmas bit tested it out as soon as it came and sire enough it was the real deal. The packaging was legitimate, so were all of the markings, most importantly it holds a charge and thus it is not a knock-off. With that bring said, I give it 5 stars for being a real Sony made controller and for the price being much cheaper than a retail store.
1451627289|5.0|One reviewer stated that this book is his best since Hearts In Atlantis. I have to agree. Hearts In Atlantis has been my favorite book of his and this one is certainly on a par. One of the things I enjoy doing after reading a book I enjoyed reading is to go back and read some of the reviews that weren't very kind to the book to contrast what they didn't like to what I did like. I read the few 1 star reviews and most of them were upset with with King for not making this a pure action book surrounding the plot of time travel to prevent the Kennedy assassination. That book would have ended up being just a pure Sci Fi book. A good one, and interesting, but not remarkable. Instead King has us travel back to the way things were in small town America for which he has an ongoing love affair. So do I... The love story between Jake and Sadie as well as the heroic characters of the townspeople from Jodie are beautiful and they give the story the depth of feeling and emotion I expect when I read the last sentence of a book. I want to feel something at the end and King has accomplished that here. It is a beautiful love story meshed with a Science Fiction premise but make no mistake, this IS a love story and a very good one at that!
B0051MKNV8|4.0|I enjoyed this much more than I expected I would. Moves at a quick pace and definitely held my interest.
B006FE3FFC|3.0|I found this season to be a frustrating watch. In most instances, the characters were not making sane decisions (the well incident in \\"Cherokee Rose\\" is a big blunder - as another reviewer once noted, why not go back to the highway and and bring back water from the truck they found in \\"What Lies Ahead\\").<br /><br />The writing also seemed less smart, more melodramatic and as the episodes progressed I felt like I was watching a bad version of Survivor that just happened to feature zombies (actually... \\"a bad version of Survivor\\"...I'm giving the reality show too much credit...nonetheless...back to my point).<br /><br />I would say this was my favourite episode. Shane is my least favourite character but I would back him in a fight. A bit of a sociopath, he is closer to the voice of reason than Rick by the season's end. The finale outside of the barn was a kind of refreshing reality check for all the characters, even Rick. Though there was a layer of melodrama. Rick taking the scene closing shot, in a sense, ending what he started was a nice touch. Though I have to admit, I had a feeling it was going to end that way.<br /><br />Overall, this episode did save the season but not by much. If Season 3 is anything like Season 2 and less like Season 1, I'm going to stop watching. I noticed a drop in film quality as well. Hopefully we'll get some more creativity from the producers and writers and less soap opera-like material. There is so much potential here.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|very fun game but it keeps deleting my progress, frustrating glitch many other people have this problem on lots of phones droid2
1421539691|5.0|Reason for Reading: Next and last in the series.<br /><br />Amazing!  Absolutely amazing!  A fantastic ending to the best manga series I have read to date.  Volume 11 was intense with the death of two more major characters, one I saw coming, the other totally threw me for a loop.  Everything builds up for the final showdown in Volume 12, which does not disappoint.  I'm not going to say anything about what happens, but reading the entire series is well worth the journey to the final volume.  A stunning, satisfying ending.<br /><br />This whole series has been a complete joy to read.  Each book is intense and it has been 5 stars all the way for me.  The duel of wits and logic between Kira and L is pure pleasure for any pundit of crime deduction.  Mr. Holmes would have been kept on his toes by these two and Sir Conan Doyle would have appreciated the paranormal aspect of the story as well!  This series would make a good start for someone's first manga, especially if they are a crime fan, or if they are not too heavily into fantasy.  However, if you already are a manga fan then this is an absolute must read series.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I use the Live contents to connect with the pastors notes each service. occassionally the offer downloads of bible contents rather than forcing streaming. good for my wifi tablet.
B000LPS4BG|5.0|The Dvd was a great buy for the pice. It is an all-time classic. The seller was great and the shipping was really fast.
0385534639|3.0|Sadly, I was disappointed. It's a nice story, but I don't think it lived up to all the hype. I can see the movie being fantastic, but the book? Sigh. First, it is very slow. There is a lot of beautiful imagery, but in order to hold my interest there needs to be more than atmosphere. Roughly the first half of the book was a slog to get through. The middle quarter was well-paced and very interesting. By the last quarter, I was bored but wanted to see how it ended.  A previous reviewer mentioned that she read this book thinking it was a love story, but found that the book is about the circus, not the love story. I'd have to say that the circus *IS* the love story.   Warning: potential spoilers ahead, read at your own risk! Two rival magicians from different schools of thought periodically set up challenges between students of their choosing. The students are bound together for the duration of the challenge, unable to walk away or escape. The venue chosen for this particular challenge is a circus. The two contestants, Marco and Celia (both bound to the contest as young children), eventually meet and fall in love. Because of this, each \\"move\\" they make as contestants is as a gift or a response to the other. Therefore, the bulk of the exhibits in the circus are essentially \\"love notes\\" from one to the other. An odd way to tell a tale of love, but it works to a degree.   I didn't love this book, but I did think it was interesting and I'm glad I read it. If you go into it expecting a nice, unique little story that will entertain you, you won't be disappointed. If you start the book thinking it's going to blow you away and be \\"the next big thing,\\" you might feel a bit deflated when all is said and done.

B000001FKY|5.0|Five stars for the album as its easily on the best albums of the 1980s but no stars for the lack of being able to download it online! I can't believe in 2012 that there are still huge bands that are still refusing to go to the Mp3 format. I don't know if its the band or the record company that has their head in the sand but they are missing out on sales because all this does is make people illegally download or just buy a cheap used copy of the cd. I'm not a business man but it seems like poor business to me.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love app is so much fun something to do while u wait on a friend or just for whatever its never boring playing solitaire
B006PKQQJS|4.0|I would recommend this game to anybody. (kindle fire) its fun and a cute game. I rate it a 4, due to it not being challenging.
B004EPYZXU|1.0|I have seen better movies as a kid, and to see this at 73 just makes me sad. There is no attention getters or new effects that one would expect with a title like this. All I can say is it is no \\"Destination Moon\\" where you at least had some exciting things to it.  RIP George Pal!!!
B006C1DH92|4.0|It is a good game. Do not get me wrong. But there aren't enough options and you can't view achievements. I would give it four and a half if possible
B004ECDNJU|4.0|Thanks for the fun faotd, fun for me and the family. good challenge, easy to learn, good theme and music.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is one of the best bags i've had. although it looks small, it can really hold many stuff. i highly recommend it

B0060MYNBY|5.0|Merlin Season 4 is the darkest one yet, & some of the characters we know will not live to see Season 5!<br /><br />In the first 2 episodes of the season Morgana takes revenge on Merlin, Arthur & Camelot for killing Morgause by summoning the Callieach to tear open the veil between the worlds, the Dorocha, hellish creatures pour forth killing anyone whom they touch. With Uther a shadow of his former self, it falls to Arthur & his Knights to protect the Kingdom. It will take more than swords to vanquish their enemy this time & when Merlin finds out that it will entail someone making the Ultimate Sacrifice he is determined that this will be him fulfilling his destiny, but who will actually make the Ultimate Sacrifice? Arthur celebrates his birthday with Uther who is now in stronger spirits & they have a travelling circus that visits the castle but someone has come with them who wishes to do harm to Arthur, Uther comes to his son's rescue when tragedy strikes, can Merlin save Uther in time? Julius Borden arrives in Camelot looking for the 3rd part of the Triskellion key which lays in the vault under the castle which will lead him to the tomb of Ashkanar & the last Dragon's egg, will Merlin be able to use his powers as the Last Dragon Lord to protect Aithusa from harm. Arthur kills a rival King, Caerleon, in cold blood after the battle they have just fought but was it Arthur who wanted to do it or was it the pressure exerted on him by his uncle Lord Agravaine & what will Caerleon's widow Queen Annis do now.<br /><br />Merlin is wounded in an ambush while travelling with Arthur to a secret meeting, Lord Agravaine takes him to Morgana who decides to implant a Formorroh serpent in his neck, which makes the victim have only one thing on their mind which is all consuming & in Merlin's case that thing is to kill Arthur at any cost, with some hilarious results, Merlin's alter ego Emrys has to come to the rescue. Following her defeat by Emrys, Morgana joins forces with the wizard Alator & kidnaps Gaius in an effort to find out more about her arch enemy Emrys. Merlin is sent to an outlying village to treat 3 men who are just shells of themselves after meeting someone or something that's lurking around their village, Lamia has a strange effect on Sir Leon, Sir Gwaine, Sir Percival & Sir Elyan, but what does she really want with them? Sir Lancelot suddenly reappears in the life of Guinevere on the day of a tournament to celebrate her betrothal to Arthur, but why has he returned now & what part does Morgana play in it? Will it cost Guinevere her marriage to Arthur or much more. (Be prepared with tissues for this episode). Arthur & his Knights are out on patrol when they find a shrine but don't know why it's been left there, Merlin has the distinct impression that something terrible happened & wants everyone to leave immediately, but Elyan is thirsty & takes a drink from the well, as a result he sees a spectral boy who demands that he kill Arthur in revenge for Uther ordering the murder of the Druids living there. When Arthur & Merlin pursue Elyan back to the shrine Arthur makes a shocking admission to Merlin. Arthur gets engaged to a neighbouring Princess as part of a treaty to unite their two Kingdoms, Princess Mithian is beautiful & Arthur finds himself falling in love with her, much to Merlin's annoyance. While out hunting Merlin is shocked at a reflection he sees running in a pool of water & is even more concerned when Mithian shoots a deer, but why & who did Merlin see in the water. Everything changes for Arthur when he finds a ring discarded on the forest floor & he calls off his engagement to Princess Mithian.<br /><br />The season finale is great. Arthur finds out that Agravaine has been in league with Morgana & has given her the plans to get into Camelot with Helios & his Southron army. Arthur won't leave Camelot, so Merlin has to put a spell on him to make him leave, Arthur then follows every command Merlin gives with some comical results. Gaius, Gwaine & Elyan are left to try & hold back the invading army for as long as possible. Elyan is tortured with a Nathair serpent which will cause \\"pain beyond all imagining\\" & Gwaine has to fight for Morgana's pleasure to provide food for himself, Elyan & Gaius. Merlin & Arthur run into smugglers Tristan & Isolde, when the spell on Arthur wears off he & Merlin tell them who they really are & why they are on the run, Isolde is hurt in a fight & Merlin decides that the safest place for them to hide is Ealdor his home village where Arthur meets an old friend. When Agravaine finds them Merlin has to call Kilgharrah the Great Dragon to protect them while they flee for their lives. Agravaine chases them into the tunnels & Merlin tells Arthur to carry on without him while he creates a diversion, when Agravaine catches up with Merlin he finds out that he has the power of magic & that he is Emrys, but what price will he pay for his knowledge? Arthur has lost all his self confidence & is doubting his ability to be a great King for Camelot & indeed being able to bring peace to the five Kingdoms, Merlin has to persuade him that he is a great King & he will bring peace to all five Kingdoms, Merlin summons the Great Dragon Kilgharrah to ask his advise & afterwards he sees that the only way is for Arthur to remove the Sword from the Stone hidden deep in the forest of Ascetir, when Sir Leon, Sir Percival, other Knights & members of Camelot appear from their hiding places in the forest Arthur finds the strength of character to remove the Sword in the Stone to prove his destiny that he will a great King. Sir Leon & Sir Percival pledge that they would \\"Ride into the Mouth of Hell\\" for Arthur to retake Camelot. Arthur & his Knights with the help of Tristan & Isolde take back Camelot. What of Morgana? well we can only wait & see, finally what part will the Little White Dragon Aithusa play in the life of Morgana......<br />[[ASIN:B009RXOKVG Merlin: Series Four (Original Television Soundtrack)]]<br /><br />Merlin Season 4 Episode List.<br /><br />1.

0671646788|5.0|This book should be on everyone's read list. It should be required reading in school. If everyone told his advice and started thinking big they would be happier and accomplish more.
B002BU0DPE|1.0|Bought these as a gift for my husband after our toddler broke his previous pair. He opened these on Christmas only to find that sound only comes through one side.
B005F3XV62|1.0|We still have yet to watch this movie, had it ready to go to watch with our kids over New Year's Eve.  At 11:00 p.m. and us all set to go we put Zookeeper into our Sony BDP-S550 Blu-Ray player.  The disc could not be read.  We put it into one of our other DVD players (without a big screen which is where we wanted to watch the movie) and it worked just fine.  This morning did some research on this same issue and found others on the internet had issues with their firmware.  We updated our Firmware and the Sony Disc will still not play in our Sony Blu-Ray player.  VERY VERY FRUSTRATING!  Please check it out before you cue it up to watch with the kids, it was a very irritating end to our day!
B002ELM5HY|5.0|Love, love, love this CD!  Better than expected.  Highly recommend it to others that want a great musical experience. Great lyrics that draw you into the songwriters life experiences.  Can't say enough good things about this CD.
B005DR64SC|5.0|For not being advertised very much, that was a terrific movie. A very suspenseful thriller. The price was very good, got a digital copy with the Blu Ray. By the way, the UltraViolet Digital Copy sucks. I want my movies all in one place but the UltraViolet goes to Flixter.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it's fun, but making you download other apps to get points to keep playing is a bit underhanded and annoying
B002UXRGM0|5.0|I purchased this bluray set nearly 10 months ago.  My family and I watched it completely through in the first 3 days and absolutely loved it.  I have since watched it again and BBC does a fantastic job of capturing some of the most beautiful and amazing sights in our world.  It is very educational and absolutely amazing.  I enjoy the bonus footage that describes how the film crews actually were able to capture the amazing shots.  If you are considering buying something else...don't!  David Attenborough is the best narrator in the world and it really makes the series complete.    I am glad that I spent the extra money and got the blu-ray over the normal DVD as the High Def is amazing.  I highly recommend these blu-rays and this series.  Only one regret after purchasing...I discovered the BBC set with Life, Earth and another set (the name escapes me now) and it was a better deal altogether.    Buy with confidence and enjoy!  Happy watching!
B000W91RUG|5.0|This show is so hilarious. Penny is funny, sarcastic, beautiful, and I love how her apartment is decorated! She is very colorful also. Sheldon is so weird and intolerable that it is a wonder he has friends, but they all tolerate him very well and are very patient. He is one of my favorite characters. Leonard is a sexy geek who always tries to keep the peace. Howard is perverted and overall creepy but seems lonely, so its sad also. Raj can't speak to women, which i find funny, but not so surprising considering they are all, and I say this with the utmost love, geeks. Overall, this show rocks! It is definitely worth the buy. Heck, I spent 50 dollars on seasons two and three justso I wouldn't have to wait to get them in the mail. :p
B0063GORYU|4.0|Keeps you playing for hours. Because it is a free app you will see advertising every now and then. You just have to skip through it. Does not interfere with the game.
B005HI4LMS|5.0|I cannot believe how funny this movie turned out to be.  It had 4 and 1/2 stars on NetFlix, so I took a chance.  Now I'm ready to watch it again.  The plot was clever and well done.  These guys are hilarious.  Do yourself a favor and watch this movie.
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|I bought severall of these chips for my camera.  Price was the factor at Amazon versus any of the local stores.  I use a different chip for each subject and I can save or delete without getting rid of things I want to save.  Just like a filing cabinet.  The price at Amazon made the multiple purchase affordable.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|This is a very nice watch, a typical Seiko. The price for the watch was incredible. The watch is attractive and keeps excellent time. I really like the autowind feature and the watch has not stopped since I received it.
B004EPYZQ2|3.0|Cut to the chase, this movie doesn't know whether it wants to be 'Stand By Me', ET, or Aliens. Rented the blu ray last night.  Bottom line for me, it that it lacks the soul of Stand by Me or the sheer terror of Aliens.  No real explanation for the magnetic powers of the alien stuck on this planet.  The ending is brought to its denouement in the final 2 minutes, the first of which is that all humans, the kids, are not bad,  the second is the military gives up and bye bye alien.  I give it a 5 out of 10.<br />However, both the video and audio were excellent with critical detail found in the black and shadows and reasonable use of surrounds.  The well trailered train wreck was just great.  While it is the quality of the disc I am most interested in before purchasing, I buy only decent storylines and what I consider good movies and I was terribly disappointed in this one as were the 3 others watching with me.<br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanks
B005FVA63A|4.0|poor quality paper, material that can be found in other editions, complementary useless gifts... but it's part of U2's history and it is worth
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|I hate that this is the ending of such an amazing TV show with such a short life, but that's all I dislike about this, the film is a nice closure to the short lived but amazing TV show Firefly.  All the wonderful cast of the TV show is back in this final adventure, if you're a fan of the TV show then this is a must watch.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this app!  Simple, easy to see, fun graphics.  Great way to play solitaire on the go.  There are little pop up ads at the beginning of each new game, but nothing annoying.  Best solitaire app there is.
B004LROUNG|5.0|My husband and I both read this as well as all the other John Grisham novels.  This is I've one of Mr. Grisham's best.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I love Tina Fey, I love SNL, I love 30 Rock.  This book made me appreciate each of those things that much more.  This book made me laugh out loud every few minutes - That is a great accomplishment.
0452289963|1.0|Another reviewer said she got as far as page 72 before giving up, which is about where I stopped, too.  Hooray for Mr. Tolle and his enlightenment, and hooray for all the rest who \\"get it,\\" and are thus also enlightened, but it seems to me that the whole of this book is a simple idea that is restated and rephrased ad nauseum.  He made the point well enough about five pages in.  The rest is just filler.  Save your money.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this game~ Works wonderfully and is a great time consumer on long trips and during slow times at work.
B000VBJEEG|3.0|I was greatly looking forward to see this movie again - one of the best animations I have seen in years.  Unfortunately, the DVD was flawed and - in the middle - it jammed/tiled, to my embarrassment as I had invited many of my friends to see it.  What can be done to have it replaced?
0307594777|5.0|That's it, I have no complaints, the order arrived quickly, in perfect condition and the books are phenomenal. I don't know what else to say.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I had never read(or even heard of) the A Song of Ice and Fire novel series until this mini-series came out and by the first episode, I was hooked. There are not enough words to describe it. This is such a lush, vivid, dramatic piece of work, with no expense spared. From the writing, to the acting, to the glorious set pieces, costumes and locations, Game of Thrones is one of the best series in years. And being an HBO picture, you know the quality is there already. This is a fantasy series without it ever feeling out of place or too fantastical. The tone is just right.  I don't wish to spoil anything regarding this series, but there are HUGE surprises, even from the very first episode. Most of the actors are new-comers, but do such a fantastic job and fit so well with the setting that their inexperience never shows. Sean Bean, the always mysteriously dashing, brooding actor is the main star of this first series. Again, not wanting to spoil anything, I'm just going to say that he will surprise you. Also a refreshing surprise came from the actor Peter Dinklage who plays the dwarf brother and son to a rich, spoiled family, and I would have to say he was my favorite part of the whole series. His quips are spot on and and each scene with him is even better than the last.   Basically, if you love drama, intrigue, mystery, suspense, costumes, and great writing; you will love this show. Throw in some incest, sex, deception, murder and outrage and you have a whole new level of magnificence. The synopsis you can read right on the amazon dvd page so there's no point in repeating it, the less you know about it, the better it really is.   I started actually reading the first book after the first season ended, and I must say; the writers and directors did a superb job with keeping up with the material. It is not an easy book to adapt. There are tons of different characters, locations and plot twists and even though I saw the show before reading the book, I had no trouble followingalong, and was quite impressed with how much was actually kept for the show.   Easily a five star rated mini-series. Cannot wait for the 2nd season!
B006BDHAX0|1.0|Didn't even make it through the first game!!! removing from my fire now!!!! Froze in the middle of game, would not allow me to select any tiles.
B004ECDNJU|5.0|Even though people want to complain I have found this game to be very fun. Challenging because you have to think FAST. But not unbeatable. Turn up the speed and I'll have hours of trying to beat the levels over and over.
B005ZUR724|1.0|Inexcusable, embarrassing and criminal. I thought this was a game, turns out its just a broken product that is somehow still available for purchase. Fellow consumers, join me in 1 starring all gameloft products till something is done.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|Like game, good graphics, but game stops responding about half way through the first level. UNINSTALLING from my samsung admire.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Fun game. Good animation. Great on kindle fire. really enjoy playing. it is addictive and a lot of fun. glad I downloaded.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Should auto fill to more logical locations and maybe allow ability to change suits to shake things up. Free, very enjoyable classic game. Thank you. What's next?
B0063IH60K|2.0|I'm glad its free because if I had to pay for it I would be extremely mad :) its a good game to play when your bored st work :)
B004SBQGHS|5.0|how do get the mighty eagle for the kindle fire.other than that it rocks.Im glad I got it.Please reply to my?.Thanks.
B0053JJLLC|3.0|I really enjoy Michael Crichton books but the current price for this ebook and others for the Kindle have become unreasonable.  $9.99 was okay for a Kindle version of a hard-bound book but the prices have increased about 30%.  We got sucked into purchasing Kindles, then, the book prices went up. How was this justified for delivering something electronically? Even paperbacks that sell for $5 or $6 are more expensive for the Kindle. I for one, have been purchasing more printed books again. Too bad, as the Kindle has such potential.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is awesome you sould get this game! and its FREE! Its lots of fun and hard at the same ti<br />e!
B002KSPKRS|5.0|These may not be Turtle Beach's top of the line gaming headphones but they are everything Turtle Beach promotes them to be, easy to hookup and great 7.1 sound.
B001HBYHFA|4.0|This movie is most definitely made for the fans of the TV series.  It's entertaining, action packed, retains the charm of the TV series and gives decent closure for fans.  There were a few things I'm kind of pissed off about plot wise but I can get over it.  There is not much else to say.  If you liked the TV series, you'll most likely enjoy this.  If you did not watch the TV series, I suggest you acquaint yourself with that first, otherwise your experience won't be as rich.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|My youngest son is obsessed with the show \\"How I Met Your Mother\\" and they are always talking about Star Wars.  He started asking me about it so I got him this trilogy for Christmas after we got our new Blu ray player.  I think I created a new Star Wars fan, the visuals were great and the surround sound made it feel like we were in the theater.  Plus I thought the price for the three was really good!

B0041KKYEM|5.0|Natalie Portman is compelling as a ballerina who finally comes into her own in winning the principal role in her company's production of the famous ballet \\"Swan Lake.\\"  Even so, the director has his doubts regarding her suitability for this role, as the virginal and narrowly-focused perfectionist played by Portman (who even lives with her controlling mother) seems unable to \\"loose herself in the role.\\"  Although she seems perfect for the \\"White Swan\\" half of the role, she lacks the sensuality and seductive powers of the \\"Dark Swan\\" that she must also play.  Enter Mila Kunis, who plays the spontaneous and worldly understudy who befriends Portman's sheltered character and eventually acts as kind of muse for the freshly-minted prima ballerina.<br /><br />As Portman's troubled ballerina struggles to find the artistic voice she needs in order to succeed in this challenging role, she is driven to the brink of insanity.  It is through this painful journey, however, that she is able to open herself to a series of creative epiphanies.  The viewer who has had to stretch and reach in a creative endeavor can identify with her plight--and with the self-doubts and distorted view of reality that come with such anxious quests for perfection, achievement, and enlightenment!  This sort of maddening creative challenge while under the control of an exacting taskmaster should be familiar to anybody who has had to write a graduate thesis!
B002ZG980U|5.0|Glad I bought this movie.  Going to have to watch it at least 20 times before we can figure out what is going on.  Wish it came with some Cliff Notes.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Excellent product if you like Susan Boyle of course. Her song selections along with her magical voice are captivating. Delivery was prompt and item arrived in perfect condition.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Haven't had a chance to watch this yet, but looking forward to it.  Packaged in quality way, quick shipping, and great price.
B004OZOTSQ|4.0|Really no need to have a USB cable if you have this app. I find it a snap to place my Tivo recordings (after conversion to mp4) on the Fire quickly. Very easy to use bot from the Kindle Fire and my PC
B002ZHKZEM|5.0|I ordered this to add to my current Dr Who collection.  It is a good starting place for someone who is \\"new\\" to the Dr Who series and wants to start watching the series as it transitions from the last doctor to the current one.
B003FSTN52|5.0|I've watched this show since the beginning episode and love it. It's really a joy to watch commercial free on a lazy afternoon. It brings home how great this show really is! Will purchase the rest of the seasons too.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|This movie reminded me of the movie \\"Fried Green Tomatoes\\". I recommend it highly, especially if you saw and liked Fried Green Tomatoes.
0307891372|5.0|Like many others I've put in over 100 hours into Skyrim and I've had this guide by my side the entire time. If I ever get stuck in a quest I refer to this book and can solve the problem quickly. Excellent guide!
0321344758|5.0|I had heard about this book for a long time and finally got around to reading it. I was not disappointed. It gave me a simple and clear vision of what a web site or User Interface Design should be. Thank you! Connie Neal
B003L77G8I|5.0|Love this season! It's got great moments for all the characters and the addition of Angela's pregnancy provides even more humor and drama. Not to mention that the finale was, in my opinion, one among the best episodes of the show as a whole. Highly recommend that fans purchase the season if they haven't seen much or any of it.
B005LZW8FO|5.0|This is a wonderful film.  It was subtle and pulled you into the story and the tension was twisted up like a spring.  The scenes were minimalist and moving.  The fine details really sold the movie for me.  I would highly recommend this film for viewing and purchase.  I think William Mapother deserves an Academy Award for his perfomance.
B0064Y5U24|5.0|This cd was right on time for me. I listened to the entire list of songs and i didn't get bored at all. The song \\"lullaby\\" was a song that was really helpful. I even gave it as a tribute to some people I knew that were going through some things as well as myself. I would highly recommend this cd. The writing is good as well as the sound.  Nickelback, keep up the good work. Here's hoping in 2012, that you will be heard even more. I haven't gone to many concerts in awhile but after listening to this cd, I decided to purchase tickets for the show. As I stated before, the song lullaby helped me get through a painful lost last year and it's even my ringtone for my phone. For me, if i can play songs from a cd on a monthly basis (ex., Michael Jackson), then to me, it has some sustaining power to keep my attention. It actually helped me to rediscover this groups other songs. Keep up the good work Nickelback. I thought that no one could replace the group Creed but hey, you have a believer here. Once again, thanks again for a song like \\"lullaby\\" which still helps me when thoughts of losing my mother starts playing in my mind. Oh yeah, Chad did a great job on the song \\"hero\\" in the former spider man movie also. Thank you Nickelback, I really appreciate you. I, along with my nephew and one of my good friends just saw Bush (who weren't bad and they did a great cover of \\"come together\\") with the main attraction of Nickelback last night and it was awesome. This was my first Nickelback concert and actually my first rock concert and I got my monies worth. They sound just like their album but better live. Chad and his band are alright in my book and after a long blistering week, that was what I needed. The drum bit was unbelievable especially since it was during my favorite \\"burn it to the ground\\"  and when he played my all time favorite \\"LULLABY\\", it made my day. I was singing along with everyone else. Once again, thank you Nickelback, because you definitely didn't let me down. I definitely would encourage others to listen to Nickelback past and present albums and also download or buy the cd's. Thanks Nickelback.
1451627289|2.0|I have liked most of King's books but this one bored me to tears.  I made it through about 120 pages and as another reviewer stated, I decided I had other books to read.  I so much wanted to like the book but just didn't.<br /><br />I also got rather tired of the little political swipes and innuendos.  Real life is bad enough with politics right now to have to read a book with the sly political comments included.
1451627289|2.0|I have been a Stephen King fan for decades having read (and reread) the Stand, Salem's Lot and many other King books. I have also enjoyed his book on writing. As a fan of the time travel genre specifically I was really looking forward to this book. Without giving anything away let me say I was disappointed by this story. Good characters but unlike some of King's earlier longer efforts this book suffers from too much detail and goes on (and on, and on...) and would have benefited from some decrease in length.<br /><br />***SPOILER ALERT***<br /><br />Stop reading if you don't want some information that will spoil the ending of the book for you. The ending left me feeling cheated and quite disappointed. At the end of the book the 'hero' successfully accomplishes the task set before him only to return to the present to discover that his \\"success\\" has put in motion physical events that will destroy earth through the 'hero's' actions in the past. Essentially the space-time continuum is so disrupted by the changes the  'hero' made in the past that the earth is being torn apart. This felt like a cheap writers device and a cheat in order to end the book with the 'hero' unable to actually change the future. After investing the time and energy to read 800+ pages this felt like a cheap trick by Mr. King to get to his point (one can't change the past without catastrophic unintended consequences).<br /><br />This is likely the last Book by Mr. King I will read as I am not a fan of authors who cheat the reader at the conclusion. Shame on you Mr. King.

B004P98QZ8|4.0|So I normally don't take the time to write reviews but thought this might be helpful. We bought this set for my son's 6th birthday he built it 99% by himself over the course of a few days. However, once it was built it falls apart easily which is extremely frustrating since the whole point of getting the set was so he could play with it. The fire dragon isn't much better, the head is hinged onto the body and not well balanced so it will fall off at the slightest touch. Like another review stated we used hot glued at a few points to hold it together, worked well and can now be played with. Also not impressed with the feet of the dragon, it can't be balanced on its feet alone, you have to lets it wings or chin touch the ground too, just kind of weird.   As for the price we found it cheaper at our local Fred Meyer, under $100 with a coupon. Not sure I would have spent over $100 for it.
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie, so bought it. Item was at a good price and being a Special Edition made it that much better. Thanks.

0062101897|5.0|Having watched all of the movies after reading all of the books, it's a daunting task to be able to compare what's on the big screen to what was originally written. Obviously only so much detail can be covered in the movies, and they do the best that they can. This book takes you behind the scenes to see exactly how everything falls into place in front of the camera.  What we see while watching the movies pales in comparison to everything that takes place to simply capture that short scene. It's pretty amazing what the actors go through. This book is no substitute for the movies, or the books themselves. But it is a great supplement to fill in the small pieces for any Harry Potter fan.  Beware, this book is huge. You can spend hours reading and barely skim the surface. For the price it is a great value considering the sheer amount of information contained within. This book is a must for any Harry Potter fan.
B005HPY8LU|5.0|Perhaps you should consider refunding people their money back for the insult of denying them the right to their vote here, and Kellys rank on sales when in fact people paid you money to show their support for Kelly.  I am sorry you are so Un American as to have given into the demands by the obvious memos you have gotten to censor Kelly, Ron Paul and the AMERICAN PEOPLE, thus destroying or Democratic process of the Peoples choice ... Oh right, every time I call I am sent overseas.
B0044KU7EQ|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas present for my son, but wound up keeping it for myself. This is a great collection, nicely packaged and included both a booklet describing the artists as well as a small harmonica for wannabees. You can't beat the price or find a more through collection. This is a package that will not disappoint. Note: I also own the Goin' Mad Blues set referenced in the booklet. It too is a great value, but is much less comprehensive.
0525423281|5.0|Oh, this is one of my favorite books ever written. Seriously. Lola and the Boy Next Door is a contemporary YA book that had me doubling over laughing, squeeing on the edge of my chair, and most of all...wanting things to be alright for Cricket and Lola. If any two people deserve happiness, it is them.<br /><br />Lola has been through hell and back. Her mother got pregnant young and decided to let her brother adopt Lola, knowing that he could provide a more stable home life than she ever could. However, Lola's mom still shows up at some of the most inopportune times, bringing sorrow and disarray into Lola's otherwise perfect life. Lola dresses in costume. That is who she is. When her boyfriend tells her that she is a liar, changing her appearance everyday, never letting anyone see the \\"real\\" Lola, she knows that relationship is headed downhill. And...to add insult to injury, the Bell twins have moved back in next door.<br /><br />Calliope is a figure skater, headed for the Olympics. Cricket's life has always been overshadowed by his sister's life as a star. Moving each time she decides to drop one coach for another, being home-schooled, never having friends. He left his life in San Fransisco years ago. Now he's home and hoping to reclaim that life. If only things were ever that easy. Cricket is going to have to work for Lola's trust, much less her love. Between him and Calliope, Lola had her heart ripped out and shredded into pieces.  Cricket might have a chance if he was only making up for his mistakes, but he also has to make amends for what damage his sister caused all those years ago.<br /><br />Cricket meets a little known character, St. Clair, at Berkley. They become quick friends...as everyone does with St. Clair. This works to Cricket's advantage since Anna is Lola's manager at the movie theater. I love that Stephanie included St. Clair and Anna in Lola and the Boy Next Door. They made a perfect avenue for Cricket to get closer to Lola. And who can resist St. Clair.<br /><br />Honestly, Cricket is one of my favorite characters ever. He is full of energy and shines like the sun. You just can't help but love him. Again, he is one of Stephanie's perfectly flawed characters. Cricket is weird in his own right, the crazy inventor type. Wild hair, a flair for the flamboyant, and good at everything he does - even though he can't see it. He's a bit insecure about himself...both because of past mistakes and a questionable heritage. He puts himself out there in ways that will cause him pain but he knows what he wants and if he is patient, perhaps he will get it.<br /><br />Stephanie Perkins is a master at creating beautifully weaved love stories. Love stories that make your heart ache with desire. You cannot not pull for these characters. Nothing about them is perfect and nothing comes easy. That's life, right? But Stephanie's stories flow at a perfect pace, never giving you that break you need to put the book down. I read bot Anna and the French Kiss and Lola and the Boy Next Door in one sitting. Well, one sitting each. Each time I thought about putting one down...I felt my heart break, needing to know how things would end. Because Stephanie makes her characters work for their happy endings, the chemistry and tension are always palpable on the pages.<br /><br />It wasn't until these books were recommended to me by some fellow bloggers that I started reading an YA Contemporary...now I seek these books out.<br /><br />One last thing, I want to say thank you to Stephanie for including a bit about alternative lifestyles in this book. I have family who belong to the LGBT community and it is important to me that their lives are acknowledged in a positive and loving way. I'm not sure it could have been done any better than Stephanie did it.one of my favorite characters ever. He is full of energy and shines like the sun. You just can't help but love him.

0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games is the true definition of a page turner. It is full of action, suspense, friendship, and romance. It is an entertaining, as well as disturbing book with a plot set in the not so distant future where the US as we know it has collapsed and a new country, \\"Panem\\" has taken it's place. The \\"Hunger Games\\" is an arena style event where 24 kids aged 12 to 18 literally fight to the death on a televised event that the government of Panem requires citizens to watch. Katniss Everdeen, the main protagonist, faces lethal challenges, as well as heart breaking experiences. As soon as I picked this book up I could not put it down. The interaction I had with this book, constantly hoping Katniss, as well as her friends, would survive to the end, made it all the more enjoyable. I strongly recommend it to all audiences that appreciate a good  action-packed thriller mixed with some romance.

B006JTS5WQ|5.0|This was not an easy task to accomplish. The Muppets have been out of the limelight for many years, only appearing in  scattered television specials and even a direct-to-video release or two. Many people knew this was wrong, and Jason Segel was the person out of the lot of Muppet fans to do something about it. He knew he had the ability to do something about it. It was a huge responsibility. Not only did he have to keep the personalities of the Muppets for the older fans, but he needed to draw in a new generation of kids who grew up without a green frog and a lady pig together putting on vaudeville.   Not only did Segel succeed, but he passed with flying colors. The Muppets is a grand phenomenon.   I am a die-hard Muppet fanatic. Seeing The Muppets in the theater reminded me why. When I heard that one of the stars from my favorite sitcom was making a Muppet-comeback movie, I was ecstatic, then skeptical. The Muppets are a huge name, and 12 years had gone by since people had really seen them in their glory. Don't get me wrong, I watch the recent Christmas specials every year, and the bits on the Disney Channel are always entertaining, but the fuzzy phenomenon has not been seen by an entire generation of children. Making a comeback would be a huge task.   Before and after the movie was just as entertaining as watching the movie itself. Hearing bits and pieces of conversations of people from ages 5 to 55 was very uplifting. Such conversations I heard were the tales of Yale University having a special room dedicated to airing The Muppet Show every week, and how everyone would crowd in to watch, to little kids asking for the other Kermit movies and toys from Santa Claus. The Muppets are as alive and thriving as ever. Sitting in the theater, I could not wipe the dopey grin off my face from enjoyment. And my friends who I attended the movie with, none of whom are as die-hard as I am, thought the movie was fantastic as well.   I understand the Muppeteers are the new generation of Muppet performers who bring these characters to life, yet they are the same as they have always been. Nobody would have guessed that The Muppets had taken a more-than-a-decade hiatus from the big screen, featuring many new performers as the characters we know and love, and new characters joining them, but they all were like greeting an old friend who looks better with age, each of them individually. Seeing classic characters like big blue Thog, Wayne and Wanda, and the Mutations in the same shot as new characters like Pepe and Bobo the Bear was like viewing a great family reunion, with cousins as distant as can be, yet altogether as a family nonetheless. This movie is fantastic. It is the perfect blend of old and new characters as well as the same feel of the classic Muppets so many have grown up with. I, being a teenager, haven't \\"grown up\\" with the Muppets of the Jim Henson, Frank Oz, and Richard Hunt-era, but I have seen their work from early on. All the movies, DVD-released television shows, and holiday specials are up on my shelf. These are the Muppets that so many know, yet this movie is the start of the new generation of Muppets and the new generation of Muppet viewers. And this movie ranks high on mine and many others' lists.   This movie allows me, and so many others to continue with our obsession, and it does it in such a fantastic way. I will be back in the theater with more friends, to show them how the Muppets are alive and well.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|You'll spend half your time trying not to cry and the other half trying not to fall out of your seat laughing.  One of the best movies I've ever experienced.  A real eye opener for anyone younger than the baby boomers. We originally saw it in a theatre but couldn't wait to get our own copy.  Amazon got it to us two days after it came out on DVD.
B0055SWM08|5.0|gets your.mind stimulated and is great for only a dollar, worth every penny and goes on for awhile. definitely recommended for people who like to use their head and figure out the best way to solve a puzzle
B004A8ZWVU|5.0|My wife MADE me watch this movie with her when it came out on DVD...., I'm soooooo glad she did.  I absolutely loved it.  It was one of the best movies I've seen all year.  I recommend it to any and everyone.

B0066W1AZK|5.0|A classic game for free, what more could you ask for.  Smooth graphics, ads that aren't obtrusive and a few options make this a nice way to while away the time.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|No complaints with the game.  It works well in both one and two player modes.  I really like the automatic clocks for two player mode.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Although missing a few of the beloved iPhone features, this is still the best solitaire app I've tried. Previous to its Android release, I had tried upwards of 10 solitaire apps on my HTC EVO. Until now I was sorely disappointed. I enjoy playing solitaire again! Thanks MobilityWare.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|Great album as always starting from american idol yours songs voice has been original. Keep free and make great music
B005DMNS4A|1.0|Bought this for my husband for Christmas because he loves 'Who Are You' and other Who songs. He said it is the worst cd. So it was kind of a waste for us.
B005UKJX4E|1.0|With great actors I expected something extraordinary. It was extraordinary-- actually, extraordinarily bad.<br />I waited for something to develop in the movie so I would care. It didn't.<br />The long stretches of nature footage with music background were disconnected and boring. Ok, beautiful, but I wanted context and connection.<br /><br />This movie reminded me of 2001 a space oddyssey, but that was done 40 plus years ago. I was waiting for some kid to throw a bone up in the air, and damned if, shortly after, the kid finds a big bone. Lame!!!<br /><br />Maybe if I'd persevered through more than half the movie it might have hooked me. But that's too long to make me wait.<br /><br />I'm sure this movie works for some people, but it sure didn't for me.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have this same app for both my phone and my kindle, its great. It's easy to use and works even when you do not have an Internet signal.
B005GTLPPY|5.0|Word of warning - I may gush! I'm no biologist, but Nessa Carey manages to make epigenetics clear and incredibly interesting to me. This is not an easy read, in that it requires one to think and occasionally to do a little mental gymnastics to get one's head around the concepts she introduces, but nevertheless it's the kind of book that can be gulped down in large servings because Carey is skilled at explaining these high-falutin' concepts so well.   The topics range from inherited traits to cloning and back again, and I found even the descriptions of how certain experiments were undertaken were such that they read incredibly well. This is a book that could havebeen dry as dust, but it's not.  I think probably one where the time taken to read the sample is well spent - I'm sure some people just won't find this that interesting - but if you are at all interested in science, biology, DNA, and the mystery of how things are and aren't passed on, then this is a must read. Absorbing, educational, and downright fascinating. Brilliant.
B00009YOQW|5.0|I got this as a gift for my one year old.  She really likes it.  She's not quite the target age range, but she still enjoys beating on it.  I was nervous because one reviewer mentioned it breaking soon buying it, but it seems quite durable to me.
B001SWQYGI|5.0|I use this amp to increase the volume of my computer speakers when watching movies... It works great!... I'd recommend it.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|i don't know.... the games aren't really that fun and the music is annoying. also, you only get one life in each game, and the games are hard to complete.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Just downloaded to my new Kindle Fire. Was easy to load and fun to play. Love the decks. Will be playing often.
B004ECDNJU|1.0|Omg...... This game is really bad..... Started playing it and it was a frigging great..... It got progressively hard but they made it easy to learn.... But the reason why it is bad is because that you can get stuck in loops by the time you feel like a pro already.... Sorry but please fix lvl 10 I think lol it is where you introduce the block that switches direction everytime something passes through it!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its fun to play when having nothing to do but controls are kind of hard to move needs some work.
1416562605|5.0|A blistering story bound to cause some self-examination - not a better understanding of poverty, but of desperation and ethics. Found myself laughing out loud and a few moments later horrified. Read this a few months after reading \\"The World is Flat\\" by Thomas Friedman and found myself thinking about both for a long time afterwards. Blunt commentary about modern life, global business, and the human condition. Very highly recommended.
B0063IH60K|5.0|it's a good app, has nice features and card designs.  you can not go wrong with it since it's free too.
B0046ECFRM|5.0|Loved this book, I even read it twice. A very quick read and such a great rom com storyline. I highly recommend!
B00005ASOC|5.0|This is one of those unusual movies that is worth watching more than once.  It is about a disadvantaged young man that encounters a mysterious \\"cranky old man\\" and eventually how the encounter effects each other.  It is a very positive movie without being gushy (not necessarily a chick flick) but encourages you about life's possibilities.  Sean Connery is outstanding and this movie shows how talented he is in a variety of genres. You won't be sorry if you purchase it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evermore is a great place to keep all your notes stored in the cloud and available on all your devices.

0316067598|5.0|I picked this book up on a recommendation from a friend. As a military member (though not this kind of military member) I found the book very easy to relate to. The author does a great job of portraying the mindset of military people, with all the smart remarks filled with the best intentions, the way complaining about how much something sucks turns in to an inside joke, and how you feel when you come out the other side of serious training programs with a sense of pride not only in yourself but your companions and the institution to which you belong.   The account of the actual battle and subsequent events was much more detailed than I ever expected, given the nature of the SEAL's involvement. Normally a story like this doesn't get told for 25-35 years based on classification. The only problems I saw were a few little grammatical quirks and repeats of the same phrase in the same sentence. Basically little editing errors, so unless you're a grammar nazi they shouldn't detract from the story at all.

You can also download some versions so you won't need an internet connection. Also has verse of the day and bible reading plan widgets, both let you change which version you prefer. You get so much for free! I  can't say enough good things about it. I highly reccomend this to anyone who is a dedicated bible reader/studier.

B000AP04L0|5.0|Peter is sick of his 9-5.  All he does is sit in his cubicle all day listening to people talk down to him. So after a therapy session where his therapist drops dead, he decides that he's going to live his life to the fullest.  And that means staying home, doing nothing.  Peter has high aspirations, but he just so happens to have a plan to make this work.  Or not work, as the case may be.    This is one of the funniest comedies ever about a guy with a \\"case of the Mondays\\", the Tuesdays, the Wednesdays, the Thursdays and the Fridays.  Occasionally his boss has him work extra hours, so there are times when he has a case of the weekends as well.    Buy this movie today, but make sure to pass it around so that everyone can see it.
B003Y5H5AG|5.0|Very nice for kids my kids like it, they can play this movie over and over and they not get tired
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Shaun of the Dead is somewhat of an unconventional zombie movie.  It takes place in England.  Simon Pegg plays Shaun, a lazy drunkard surrounded by other lazy drunkards.  When the city becomes infested with zombies, it is hard to tell the difference between the undead and the inebriated.    This is the best kind of zombie movie of all.  It's a zombie movie that makes you think about life and the ways in which we all have a little bit of zombie within us.  We learn that there isn't an &#34; 'I' in team&#34; as Shaun and his friends band together to outsmart evil.    Oh yeah, and it's funny as hell.    Five stars.
B004LROUNG|3.0|Based on some of the reviews, I was looking forward to this book.  It is good but I definitely wasn't wowed. I read it quickly but it wasn't a, \\"My life stopped for a couple days because I couldn't put it down.\\" book.  I'd love to read a book by John Grisham again with the caliber of one of his books like The Firm.  This one just wasn't up there but it was still good.
B0031YJFCQ|2.0|I have read all three books in the series and you can skip the last installment. Watch the Swedish movie with sub titles if you are dying to know how the trilogy ends.
B000I2JKC4|1.0|This DVD was marked HD.  Since we have new tv's that are HD, I thought it would be good to get it in HD.  Found out that HD DVD's will only play on \\"HD\\" video players.  HD and Blueray were in competition several years ago and Blue ray won out (like Beta & VHS many years ago--VHS won).  You can only play an \\"HD\\" dvd on an HD player and I'm sure there are not many of those around.  The HD dvd would not play at all.  The only regular DVD the company offered was a higher price than other sellers, and they would not give me a refund, so I'm just out the money I spent.
B000A5044C|1.0|I paid full price for NOBODY KNOWS when it came out and two of my best movie-going friends shared a \\"preview\\" before my large HDTV as we wanted to check it out before I showed it in class.  Most of what we see are indies and foreign films and the packaging on this made it look ideal for my work.<br /><br />However compelling the \\"true\\" story, this film felt like torture.  Do not expect anything but the sensation of sitting on an ant mound as you await for some pacing to evolve or hair to grow.  If you let your own imagination draft the script, it will surpass this agony.  Draggy and inept, this film forced us to succumb to the fast-forward button for the final hour.  I'm such a purist that I had only done this once before in my entire life!<br /><br />The best three Asian films to catch: SHANGHAI TRIAD, TO LIVE, and TEMPTRESS MOON.  Gong Li stars in all.  Sorry if that makes me mainstream, but I like to see some energy on the screen, but not just the pretty CGI of Yimou's past decade.  The three titles above captivate with every screening.  NOBODY KNOWS could have aged the characters with nuance or built suspense in a multitude of ways, but without a character-driven plot, very little arose in style or shaping to compensate for manner over matter.  And I usually love films that feature a child's POV.
B004ECDNJU|2.0|I agree with another reviewer here, who pointed out that this Dragon Fire lacks an option to change the settings of the game, in the event the player is colorblind.  As a colorblind American, who has extreme difficulty telling the difference between reds, yellows, and greens in software, I encourage game developers to include options to turn on a &quot;colorblind&quot; mode.  Many game developers, such as PopCap, already routinely feature this in their games.  This game, Dragon Fire, would be greatly improved if such a feature was added in a future update.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|works great on my kindle and phone. I would definitely recommend this product to all who need a place to keep their passwords.
B006IVBSBU|1.0|soderbergh seems to wander aimlessly here without an explicit path to propagandize for communism and matt damon appears similarly afflicted. i think soderbergh needs to direct damon in a mao biopic so they can just get it out of their system. there's also this gem from one of the characters, likely in response to the overwhelming efficiency with which the blogosphere is exposing the radical left that is intentionally destroying our country:<br /><br />\\"blogging isn't journalism - it's graffiti with punctuation\\"

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I would actually rate Hunger Games (the first book of the trilogy) at closer to 5-starts, but the 2nd book as 4-stars and the final 3rd book below that.  In the first book the protagonist is the quintessential troubled teen in many respects who we love despite, and in some cases because of her shortcomings. Her lack of development in the subsequent books is disappointing.  It becomes harder to like or admire her, and there isn't anyone else to care about either.  After the last book I wan't hungry for anymore.<br /><br />If you've made it this far, please check the box that this review was helpful. Thanks!
B005Y423ZC|5.0|This is a must-have DVD/CD from Adele.  I can only hope she will get her US tour dates rescheduled as she is in a league all her own and just blows you away with her raw, honest and soulful lyrics.  You won't be disappointed.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really like the variety.  It is very different from other games, nice to pass the time. I also like the old school feel to it.
B005XRU62C|5.0|I was itching to get some new stuff for my iPod to get the through the upcoming semester of school.  I've been rotating my Elbow and Alison Moyet for quite some time now but wanted to add something in to mix things up.  New year...New Music...right?  I stumbled upon this and BA-DA-BOOM!!!  Wow... it is rockin' my world now.  I go to sleep with my headphones on and now my nighttime lullaby mix is Elbow's \\"Seldom Seen Kid\\" shuffled with \\"Ceremonials\\".  FABULOUS!!!   I remember Alison Moyet back in the 80's...I went through a few cassettes when I was in high school of hers...I mean I wore them out!  I adored her...still do.... but Florence + the Machine is a great stand-in when I'm wanting a change from Ms. Moyet.  Thankfully cassette days are over and I can play my music over and over and over.....
B002WIDRM6|4.0|For fans who liked Lady Antebellum's first CD, you'll also like this one.  The songs are not quite as memorable as the first CD, but still good.
B002TVQ4GW|5.0|An excellent movie for the thinking person who also happens to love horror/creepy/sci-fi/suspenseful type movies. Well directed, conceived, and executed.
B003EYVY04|5.0|Our first thought was that WB had done a classic Bait and Switch with these \\"Ultimate Editions\\".  Our wonderful friend in Colorado is giving us two HP Ultimate Editions per Christmas and we are currently watching Years 3 and 4.    First of all there is NOT an extended version of the movies which we were expecting,  Second:  the DVD's do not return to the resume mode as do other discs which is a pain to start all over if we are interrupted,  Third:  the sound quality doesn't seem as good as we have to crank it up during the movie for volume to pick up voices  BUT THAT SAID - the Special Features are EXCELLENT!  This makes the Ultimate Edition worth it.  Year 3 was Creatures and how they are made for the movie and Year 4 is Sounds and Music - how that makes the whole Harry Potter world come to life and affects our emotions.    Buy it!
B0032O6S4I|5.0|This zoo does take some time to assembly maybe 2 hours.  Mostly because the parts are not sorted by each habitat.  But it is good quality and has lots of detail in each animal habitat.  My daughter is 4 and just loves that all the animals have moving legs, heads, feet, etc.  When it is set up it is quite large so we put it on a large sheet of foam board to keep up with it all. the zoo is worth the money.

B004EPZ08Y|5.0|Final Destination5 3D for time being is Best buy exclusive.I didn`t watch it in theater as i don`t like blood splattering shots but after investing in 3D equipment at home.I got tired of CG cartoons/IMAX as only option in 3D as so i took leap and bought both Final destination movies in 3D .<br />Final Destination 5 is Pre-equal to Final destination and give some twists and adds bit story into series.Though still some questions left unanswered.They may be addressed in next installment.Opening and closing Credit both are great in 3D.If you use subtitles They look awesome as pop up.Director who is also Assisstant director of AVATAR tried to impress all kinds of audience with depth,pop out and mild blood splatter.If you looking for some great 3D movie as there aren`t many out for time being.Don`t miss it.<br /><br />For 3D its 5/5<br /><br />(If you need to chose one Final Destination movie. I prefer this over Final destination3D)
B005JZBPHS|5.0|Saw this in the theaters and am usually grossly disappointed in movies with a lesbian plot but this one got it right.  It was enjoyable and light, had some laughs while touching at the same time.  I think if it was American it wouldn't have worked as well.  Of course with all rom-coms, there are the inevitable cliches but show me one that doesn't.  What was nice was the fact that this could have been interchangeable with a straight couple, it wasn't an in your face gay movie so I always recommend it to my straight friends and fellow gays.  Also makes a good in-house date movie ladies (free helpful tip).  Check it out, cute movie, but don't get too attached to Luce, she's mine!! ;p
B004YJMQCS|4.0|There aren`t many 3D movies out there and just like Piranha.There is quite a blood fest in this one .They took surprise element of death away by showing vision even before the creative way death takes place to claim a body .If director had avoided that it could be great suspense.May be they don`t want to categorize themselves as horror genera.So visions were there.<br />Story wise actually there is none what so ever,Bunch of people saved in accident and now death following them but 3D wise especially \\"LAST 20 MINUTES \\" don`t miss them.Its where movies really takes off in 3D .There are many Out of screen and blood gushing effects throughout the movie.<br /><br />if you want to chose one out of two final destination movies in 3D .i prefer Final destination5 3D over this one.<br /><br />Story 2/5<br />3D  4.5/5
B004EPYZUS|5.0|MOVIE NOTE #19 MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: GHOST PROTOCOL<br /><br />Well it seems Brad Bird (`The Incredibles', `Ratatouie', `Toy Story 3', ) can not only direct action animated films, but also has a talent for live action. His live action directorial feature debut Is amazing. This movie has everything a good film should have. A great story you can't predict, characters you care about, action that doesn't leave you saying.....'these people are not human'....and the panorama of what a big screen film should have. Definitely a must see for good entertainment.<br /><br />Headed by the Tom Cruise Productions and J.J., Abrams' Bad Robot Productions this film is exciting, funny and has a really complicated story that you follow until every twist is untwined. For as much flack as he receives, Tom Cruise does a damn good job in this film. Supported by some great team members including Simon Pegg (`Star Trek' 2009, `Paul', `Hot Fuzz') who provides incredible comic relieve with his techno-genius devices and an unsuspecting female who makes her first official IMF covert mission played by Paula Patton(`Deja Vu, `Precious').<br /><br />Quite by chance the team turns from the usual three person to a four-person team with a not so honest performance by Jeremy Renner (`Hurt Locker', `The Town') as a desk-driven agent who has a deeper secret and more skills than Ethan Hunt (Cruise) was aware of.<br /><br />It also has some great performance by an international cast of people we don't know- but the rest of the world does - including Swedish film star Michael Nyqvist, Russin born film star Vladimir Mashkov, Finnish film star Samuli Edelmann and Russian film star Ivan Shvedoff. I applaud Tom Cruise and J.J. Abrams for bringing some really great talent to the film - giving the Mission Impossible franchise a REAL international flavor. There's even a cameo (returning as his previous character from the last two films) of Academy Award winner Tom Wilkinson.<br /><br />Great action sequences, lots of great cinematography and some breathtaking stunts that would be impossible without special effects and great stuntmen. They shoot an entire amazing sequence one of the largest free-standing buildings on the Asian continent. Burj Dubai, which was started in 2004, overtook Taiwan's Taipei 101 tower as the world's tallest building when it reached 512 metres (1,533 feet) in April 2007. It is amazing.<br /><br />This is a great film with a great story and definitely something to see over the Holidays. I think the best of the FOUR MI films and I certainly hope Tom and J.J. make more MI Films!ts that would be impossible without special effects and great stuntmen.

0330458507|5.0|Great book on the forgotten war. An other lesson on how we find ways to enter wars that end with us losing young men and accomplish nothing. We seem to be making a habit of that and we wonder why the world does not love us.
B005FITIK0|3.0|I've long suspected that most Hollywood scriptwriters and directors weren't particularly popular in high school because while there's a ton of movies about outcasts, there are few from the perspective of a Queen Bee or star quarterback.  \\"Young Adult,\\" while it has flaws, offers a side of the story that rarely gets told in movies.  Charlize Theron plays Mavis, a thirty-something whose glory days were in high school, but who managed to escape her boring small town and move to the Big City, where she's a ghost-writer for a young adult novel series.  She's also the envy of a few of her former classmates who believe that she's living a glamorous lifestyle.  This is proven to be inaccurate within the first ten minutes of \\"Young Adult,\\" in which Theron wakes up from a drunken stupor and shuffles around her apartment groggily feeding her dog and other chores before logging onto her computer.  There she finds that someone's sent her a photo of a newborn whose dad is former flame Buddy (Patrick Wilson).  Because her life is going nowhere, she decides to return home and re-ignite her relationship with Wilson.  After a glimpse into his life of domestic bliss, anyone else would scrap this idea, but Mavis is either a sociopath, mentally ill or pathetically clueless, and besides which, if she didn't, there wouldn't be much of a movie.  Mavis' insensitivity can be summed up in her reaction to encountering an old classmate, Patton Oswalt; after hearing the details of a hate crime, which left him permanently disabled in high school, she gets a little green-eyed.  \\"You must have missed so much school!\\" While the movie has some very funny moments, somehow they don't add up.  This is one of those movies, where you realize that all the witticisms that work were used in the trailer.  Still, I appreciated the fact that the rivalry between Mavis and Wilson's wife, didn't disintegrate into a full-fledged cat fight involving mud wrestling and hair pulling, which is what happened in Kristen Bell's \\"You Again.\\" Most of the characters are allowed to keep their dignity, despite the \\"dullness\\" of their adult lives. Oswalt's sister, however, is still sort of locked in her high school role of wannabe and pleads with Theron to take her to the city, too. \\"No, you're good here,\\" Theron replies, proving that she's at least learned a few things from her ordeal.

B004SBQGHS|5.0|It is fun awesome game were you may go to any limit to get revenge on the evil green swine! It doesn't get old and there are tons of levels. It is sooo worth the money and it will keep you busy for a long time after. You just have to ask yourself one question, how far are you willing to go to get the evil green swine?
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|such an awesome game! ;) I play it all the time! it is so addictive I could play it all the time!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Very cool game! My eight year old daughter loves it too!  Fantastic music is very calming to me!  Wish my sister-in-law had a phone she would love this game!

B003G4W49C|5.0|If you haven't read this yet, you need to.  I read this first 20 some years ago.  When I loaned it to a friend back from the Air Force on leave, he couldn't put it down and finished it in one night.  I have since read it aloud to my children.<br /><br />You will be transported inside the mind of a brilliant young boy named Ender.  You'll face bullies and struggles small and large.  You'll be with him as he is put to every test that a desperate humanity can put him through.  Orson Scott Card has captured the spirit of comrades in arms and manages to do it in an original and deeply satisfying way.<br /><br />I can't tell you how many copies of this book I've bought over the years and lent out or given as a gift.<br /><br />If you haven't read this yet, do so.  You've stumbled across a rare gem.
0307959856|1.0|Poorly written, poorly conceived, poorly plotted -- a waste of time, and a disappointment both to fans of Jane Austen and fans of P.D. James.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|As far as the service to receive this item, it was great.  As for another remake of Jane Eyre it was satisfactory.  I think I wanted more to the ending.  Of course, I just think Timothy Dalton was such a fantastic Mr Rodchester so that makes it hard to enjoy another version as much as I enjoyed that version.  However, I love the story and it is still great to view other versions, just not as enjoyable.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the best app period for the Droid, iphone, Kindle etc.  I love the notes feature and to have so many translations is great!

B005DKLPQ0|4.0|This really pains me to write a 3 star review when this really should be a 5 star review.  All remasters sound GREAT, all albums are here, and all songs are here, except a few singles that you can find on the singles box, but the strange thing is that one of my favorite albums is missing one of the best songs that actually makes the album...\\"Meat Is Murder\\", YES!?...i don't see any other reviews here mentioning this so i had to write one.  I couldn't wait to get this box set in the mail to update my old songs and when I received this box set I first grabbed the album \\"Meat Is Murder\\" from the box and noticed while i was listening to it in my car that something didn't sound right...yep, the song \\"How Soon Is Now?\\" is missing from the original \\"Meat Is Murder\\" album!!??  At 3rd glance I noticed this, and once I got back home i triple checked the order of the orignal album from my originals.<br /><br />I HATE WHEN Reissued Remastered sets do this!!?? NOW WTF was Marr thinking with this?  Since the album made #1 on the UK charts over all the other albums, and the video aired on MTV every hour on the hour \\"back in the day\\" for it seemed like eternity...WHY WHY would he forget to include this song with the original Meat Is Murder album!?  Silly if you ask me? Well, thankfully nowadays, I recorded the albums as mp3's, rearranged the songs, added \\"How Soon Is Now\\" and then plopped them on my iPod, etc.  So luckily this box set included 3 best of albums, and the song was on one of those, and remastered the same...so i had to rearrange the songs as they \\"should have been\\" on the original album!?  All is well now I guess, but if you want to listen to the CD your out of luck, but if you record it and rearrange onto your ipod with the correct order all is good.  All other albums seem to be intact and on score. Gee, why would Marr do this on remarkably one of their BEST albums!?  Shame on you Marr, what should be 5 stars, I regretfully give this box set 3 stars.  I really want to give it 1 star, but the remastering is so excellent and you hear much more than the original albums!  It's not overblown either like some remasters nowadays.<br /><br />Be happy you have the 3 complilation albums, because Meat Is Murder is missing one important song, \\"How Soon Is Now?\\"...why you ask? Have NO IDEA? But you can find it on the compilation albums. So, why did Marr do this? A mistake? Don't know really, but SILLY since Meat Is Murder was #1 on UK charts and THAT video \\"How Soon Is Now\\" played endlessly on MTV back in the day and \\"no doubt\\" helped The Smiths receieve the status they got, from that song, and that album, so why did they mess with the orignal integrity of that particular album? Who knows? All in all, you decide.<br /><br />UPDATE 01/07/2012: I switched my rating from 3 stars to 4 stars due to the fact that this box set is packaged beautifully, remasterd perfectly, and is \\"almost\\" complete despite the fact that I would have liked \\"How Soon Is Now\\" on the \\"Meat Is Murder\\" album, and other extras like \\"Jeane\\", \\"Work Is a Four Letter Word\\" and others.1 star, but the remastering is so excellent and you hear much more than the original albums!

B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a really fun game that you will find yourself coming back to over and over!  Great game that you will love playing.
B003K1EYM6|3.0|I hate to review things when I haven't had a chance to find out if it's okay. But Amazon or the sellers, whichever, will email until I die if I don't finally say something. Here goes: ordered this as a gift. It arrived in good time and in new condition. Do not know whether it's a good product -- that's a tough question to ask a gift giver.  I have to update this review -- I just found out this doesn't work for the recipient. His camera uses RAW and he says that's not compatible with Apple products. It has to go back.
B002M2T1UO|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect with this series but I was hooked immediately. The storyline stays focused and is very well written. I watched the entire series in 2 weeks time and it only gets better and better as it gets deeper and deeper into a world that will only keep shocking you. The ending will leave you speechless.
B0012GMYTG|4.0|Very happy with the quick delivery.  Was worried about the CD because the case came cracked down the middle but the CD was not damaged.  It played fine.  Always happy to order from Amazon.

B004ECDNJU|5.0|Very good game, runs flawlessly on my Acer Liquid Metal. You have to be fast and concentrate, because sometimes you have to cope with more that one colour at the same time. Challenging but fun.

B004ECDNJU|5.0|A good game for the whole family because the speed is adjustable to very slow for the little ones.  A good buy if you've got several tablets in the family.
B004EPYZZI|1.0|It's a shame that a movie about such an inspiring young woman is flat and boring with little insight into any of the characters. The other one-star reviews have described it perfectly, and I can only reiterate that it is a waste of time.
0385512058|5.0|For most of the people have known this secrets, but the author really makes easy to applied them in live.  It also create a strong sense of helping others before you need to request for it.  Probably for Latin american culture with help more to create relationship for a life time.  For my personnel point of view it is a great book.
B00536OCZA|1.0|Got it for Xmas! I wouldn't have purchased myself since the reviews here at Amazon seemed really bad. But, it's all true! The sound on this record is very poor and full of noises. I have an old copy that has been trough a lot and the sound is clearly superior. There're a few extras and mp3 downloads but the vinyl itself is crap. Don't waste your money on this one, invest in an old used copy and you'll probably have more fun.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|This is an amazing show! It is very interesting and addictive. Worth every penny! After watching the first episode I ordered all the other seasons. I have never been addicted to a tv show like this before!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I throughly enjoyed reading this book. At first I thought the beginning was slow but I think that was because I wasn't sure what the book would really be about. Let me tell you I quickly got engaged and could not put it down. The author did a very good job with details and I could just imagine the scenery and outplay of events. I actually just finished reading it today and cannot wait to read Book II. I will be buying it today. I'm so mad I didn't buy the trilogy at once but I just wasn't sure if I'd like the first book. I am very excited to see the movie which comes out this year. I can't wait to see how they bring the book to life even though I know the movie won't be as good as the book but I just hope they do a good job capturing everything. With that being said you won't be sorry you read this book!
B003MC5N28|1.0|I was intrigued by the description of this story, and when I started reading it, I got caught up in it fairly quickly.  But then I started feeling like some of it wasn't explained very well.  A story like this, which is obviously far-fetched, should have everything explained...but instead, much of it went without ever being clarified.  For example, how can a community stop people from seeing color? How could they control the climate without some sort of border? How could they prevent other people from coming in? None of it was given any thought or explanation and it drove me crazy!   I also HATED the ending.  I got close and even commented to my husband that it was getting really good.  And then bam, it was over.  I agree with another post that said it seemed like the author got bored with writing the story and just decided to end it.  I thought the idea behind the story was excellent and it would have made a really interesting read, but it simply wasn't developed enough.  Disappointing.
B003L77GG0|5.0|This show really held my interest as a fan of Superman, and, this final season really did a fantastic job of bringing the legend to life!

1594744769|3.0|This is the most visually appealing book that I've seen in a very long time. I really, really, really wanted to love this book. I loved the beginning, but the farther I got in the book, the less attached I became. It's not bad, just not the best seller I'd hoped to read.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I usually don't play games, but I'm spending a lot of time here. Lots of fun. Great diversion while watching TV on New Years Day
B0057R5XRG|4.0|Bought this for my son who is dinosaur crazy. Great Blu-ray set but as some of the reviewers mentioned the picture quality isn't something to die for. The shipping from the Amazon marketplace through the NBC store was pretty pathetic and slow (guess that the price you pay when you get this for under $25). They also have a game download along with this product for a free download of the Jurassic Park from Telltale games. Using the code I was able to download the game but when I tried playing it despite creating a username on the Telltale site the game would not open and it insisted that there was no username. Trying to get to the Telltale support was useless as it is non-existent. The Blu-ray discs are however a must for your dino enthusiast.
B002BU0DPE|2.0|I bought this headset about 3 months and at first I loved it. it had pretty good sound and seemed strong enough. I was wrong. Over time the sound seemed to worsen and I would have loud feedback coming even though i was wearing it normally. And then about a month ago one of the ear pieces broke off and was hanging from a wire. I assumed one of my family members had stepped on it but then a few days ago as I was wearing it the attached earpiece broke off when i tilted my head slightly, and when I looked at the piece that held the earpiece on and let it swivel it was a small piece of cheap plastic. The sound quality was not the best from the first place but then it grew worse and worse. The audio expander was not worth using. For example if something was slightly to the left it would sound it as if it was all the way to the left of the screen. Overall the mic was not the best with shoddy quality  and bad design.
0451208706|5.0|Beautifully written in the true Ken Follett form. Never disappointing.And Amazon continues their excellent service throught thoughtful and responsible vendors.  Thank you
B002OSY2T6|3.0|I found the description of this toy misleading. It only rolls forward if pushed, not on it's own.  It is also geared toward babies who use their right hand rather than left.

B001R4MEYI|5.0|This album rules. I love Mastodon, and this is, in my opinion, their best album. From an musicianship standpoint, it's flawless. In the version I got, a \\"making of\\" DVD was included, and all the band members emphasized that they basically caged themselves up in the studio for hours and hours on end every day. They really held their own feet to the fire because they wanted to \\"be tough on themselves\\" and see how technical an album they were capable of creating. I just can't say enough about the result.   To give some context, \\"Crack the Skye\\" is very different from \\"Leviathan.\\" \\"Leviathan\\" was not a true death metal album, but it definitely showed death metal influences. \\"Skye\\" is dark, weird, and moody, but it abandons death metal for prog. The songs are less \\"gritty\\" and the grooves aren't as heavy. The lyrics are not mainly screamed, and the song structures are... all over the place (the average song is in the 6-7 minute range). The guitars are recorded in layers and layers. The songs are gorgeous from beginning to end. If someone held a gun to my head and made me pick a favorite track, I'd probably pick the opener, \\"Oblivion,\\" which is amazingly catchy for a progressive tune.  A word of friendly advice: Make your first couple of listens on a pair of high quality head phones. There's just so much going on to listen to.
B005ELQVGW|5.0|Seriously?? What is wrong with people these days!? This album is pure stroke of genius. It was critically acclaimed for a reason, and that reason is that BIOPHILIA is an absolute musical masterpiece. In my opinion it's Björk's most beautiful album to date. Lyrically it's phenomenal. musically, it transports you to another world you've never been before. One of peace and one of strife.  The album starts out strong and only gets stronger and better. The last 4 songs are possibly some of the best songs Björk has ever made. \\"Virus\\" sends chills down my spine. I love the subject matter of \\"Sacrifice\\" and how great the song is written and \\"Mutual Core\\" is AMAZING! \\"Solstice\\" is a gorgeous way to end the album. Phenomenal song.  & you have to hear \\"Thunderbolt\\" to believe it!  All in all BIOPHILIA will leave you breathless. It's music + combined together in order to make a phenomenal listening experiance.
1904994679|5.0|First saw this book at Barnes and Noble for nearly thirty dollars. I knew my son would love it, but didn't want to pay the cover price. I was thrilled to find it here at such a bargain!   It is a beautiful book! ... Colorful photos and fun facts  galore ... from cover to cover!  My 9 year old son is enjoying it and so is the rest of the family!
B004WGGQPQ|2.0|This app is definitely one for the kids.  I couldn't properly sketch or paint anything , not that I was expecting to create a masterpiece. But my nieces love use the stickers and markers. I would recommend this for children 11 years and younger
B005OCFHHK|4.0|He disfrutado mucho la colección. Lo único que debo comentar es que el disco N° 6 no tiene subtitulada al español la película en modo máximo.
B005SJIP2S|1.0|The 5 star Ratings for this CD are a joke.  5 Stars?  If this yawner gets 5 Stars, \\"Going for the One\\" must get 60 stars on that scale. These are low energy versions of the songs we all know. As a huge Jon Anderson fan, I admit my bias. In my view, Benoit David gives this whole project a \\"tribute band\\" sound and feel.<br /><br />With Chris Squire as the only original band member, it's tough to really call this band YES. Squire owns the Yes name, and he could team up in a duet with Cher and legally call it Yes.<br /><br />I want to like this, I really do. I was hoping Trevor Horn may join the band at some point. I watched the included DVD and made the following observations.<br /><br />1) Steve Howe is still the master. He hits every note every time and even improvs a bit.<br /><br />2) Oliver Wakeman looked a bit bored. I agree with his decision to leave, as Geoff Downes is a better fit. Oliver has some talent but he appears very mechanical in his approach and kinda slow.<br /><br />3) As always Chris Squire is singing well on this DVD and his bass is, (as always) perfect.<br /><br />4) Alan White sounds great but he does not look like he is having any fun at all. The sound is great and that is what counts.<br /><br />5) Benoit David sounds OK. He may need to get involved in writing some new songs. Jon Anderson simply cannot be replaced. It was not just Anderson's sound that made Yes great, it was Jon's energy, his skill as a song writer, his ability to communicate with the crowd, and his stage presence. When comparing these two, Jon has a huge advantage because he was never burdened with having to try and sound like someone else. His voice always genuine and unrestraineed. Benoit has to always keep his true voice in check and try to sound like Jon or Trevor. It's a tough task. He is to be admired for trying.<br /><br />I find it refreshing that Yes is putting out new music, I just wish I liked it. The versions of our favorites on this CD are mechanically sound, but seem like Muzak versions.  The approach seems so measured and carefull. Maybe it's Oliver, but probably Benoit, but the lack of energy is quite evident.<br /><br />I saw this version of Yes touring with Asia. Somehow Yes got top billing and Asia opened the show. John Wetton opening for Benoit David? Carl Palmer opening for anyone? Geoff Downes opening for Oliver Wakeman? Laughable. Without Jon Anderson they are pretenders at best, and cash strapped at worst.arefull. Maybe it's Oliver, but probably Benoit, but the lack of energy is quite evident.

B00164GDD2|1.0|Anyone who says movies \\"filmed\\" 20+ years ago are grainy therefore this should be expected of this release need to get their eyes checked!  I saw Ghostbusters in the theaters, I have an old LaserVision disc version, and I've seen it recently in HD via Comcast. This BluRay release sucks. Even the sound sucks. The picture looks like I'm watching it on VHS tape, no, on a copy of a VHS tape! Grainy, grainy, poor color. And GRAINY.  We had some company over last night, some of whom are not quite up to the latest video standards with their own home setups. Initially we were watching the Bulls game in HD and I guess everyone really liked the picture quality. Comments like \\"I can can actually see the individual boards in the floor and the sweat on it when someone falls. The subject of BluRay came up so after the game I grabbed the new BluRay Ghostbusters release I had just received as a Christmas present. Having watched this movie recently via Comcast's High Definition On Demand, I must tell you I was both shocked and embarrassed at what appeared on the screen. As my better half put it, \\"The Previews of other movies looked better\\". I could see I had some explaining to do so I put on Planet Earth and everyone was satisfyingly impressed with both the picture and sound.  SKIP THIS BLURAY VERSION. And if you see it and think it looks fine do yourself a favor and get your eyes checked!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I used to play on my iPhone and I still carried it around after I switched to Android just to play this solitare game! I love that its available on the Android platform!! I use a Motorola Atrix 2 phone and a Toshiba Thrive tablet.
B004QK5N5W|5.0|I got this so I could view movies I rented on iTunes on my big screen TV.  I also own a component video adapter that does an OK job but introduces lines of digital noise in the picture.  This has no such limitations or flaws.  Works perfectly and the video looks great on my big screen TV.

B003K1EYM6|4.0|This does a good job taking pictures from your sd card and getting them onto your iPad without having to go through iTunes.  This is a convenient way to view pictures you've taken while away on a trip for example.  What I wish it did was allow you to view the pictures without importing them but that's not the case.  Regardless, it's still useful, well built and functions flawlessly.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Hayao Miyazaki never fails to please and it is no different with Spirited Away. It is no doubt that Miyazaki is an anime genius who knows how to keep the viewer interested in both story and the characters. I can say with no doubt in my mind that Spirited Away is a must have for any movie fan and no collection can be complete without it. It has been many years since I have seen this movie and now even in my twenties I still enjoy it and wonder how I have lived so many years without remembering this movie. It is a must get along with many more of Miyazaki's movies.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Great way to obtain up to date weather when traveling or planning a trip without having to resort to newspaper or other web searches.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Great if you always have wifi.  Not so great to use at church with no wifi.  Wish it downloaded at church.  Love the voice speaking when you have it on audio.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this App, use it every day. It has multiple translations that makes Bible study a breeze and it's FREE. Also need to mention, it can be used offline. Best App ever!
B005DOKL3E|5.0|Great  buy, but wish it had elastic straps to hold Kindle Fire in case when it is opened and that the zipper was on three sides-more security for Kindle Fire would be better.
B004FRX0MY|2.0|If I connect directly to my FiOS Wireless router, I seem to have no problems.  Virtually everything else (including 2 hotspots) are forced to go through my firewall.  If I connect to the Cell network, I have no problems.  I can't seem to find any indication that I should open any ports in my firewall to allow the MP3 app to work.  Very frustrating because I definitely like the app (when it used to work with no problems).  When I go into the App and say, try to load the most popular songs -- it just hangs with a circule spinning indicating it's waiting for the list to be delivered.    Anyone have any thoughts?
B000H30B2C|5.0|I love reading all the reviews.  It's amazing how everyone seems to be put out about the computer-generated effects, complaining that they don't look \\"real.\\"  Well what, if anything at all, could possibly be \\"real\\" about a movie set in the 1930's, showing cars and buildings and clothes from that era, and featuring a pre-historic island, and a 50-foot tall ape, as well as dinosaurs and other pre-historic reptiles?  I mean, it's all made up, and it's all fake, and it all sprang from some writer's imagination, and it is all very entertaining, and even enthralling.  The skill and the genius that goes into an enterprise of this sort, to produce a two or three hour DVD that you can buy for a few bucks, to look at over and over, and see all of the millions of dollars worth of special effects - how wonderful is that?  I thrilled at the original King Kong, and agree that it is truly the Granddaddy of all science-fiction movies.  You talk about ground-breaking:  How original and mind-boggling was stop-motion animation in the 1930's?  This movie is no doubt the epitome of the most effective use of computer-generated effects that I've seen, but, of course, I haven't seen everything.  The fact is that much of the stuff we see on the screen today is computer-generated, but since they are contemporary scenes, we just assume they are real.  But I do have one question that intrigues me, and frankly puzzles me:  Why all of the carping about the lack of \\"extras\\" that people seem to be so genuinely upset about?  When you buy a movie and it comes with an extra disc, or even two, of \\"extras,\\" who really watches that stuff?  I have looked at it, but I must say it doesn't enhance, for me, the value of the movie, at all.  Maybe I'm missing the point, but I guess I have to ask, \\"What's the point?\\"
B0060D10I2|5.0|Great movie I had alot of fun watching this and I can easily watch it over and over I hightly regimens.it
B0055DKSQ8|3.0|I read this because Lisa Bloom recommended it in her book 'Think', and most of the other books on her recommended reading list were excellent. This was a book about haw there are few absolutes in life, marriage, etc. The characters were vivis, but the story meandered a lot and was kind of unsatisfying in a way that's difficult to describe.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|this is a fun and addicting game....if you have a kindle fire, you will get some pop-up ads...but its kinda worth it to play.  If you liked this game, I also reccomend fruit ninja
B002ZB26AO|4.0|I didn't know much about the situation in North Korea until I read this, and I was shocked, appalled and educated by the stories. The timing was interesting, because Kim Jong Il died about a month after I finished this book, and because of having read it, I was able to follow the news stories with some insight into the situation. I had hoped that things might change for the better. Sadly, it does not appear that that will happen.
B005HSL626|5.0|This is the most addicting game ever next to angry birds.  Totally worth getting!!!! So much fun slicing fruit and trying to unlock new blades and backgrounds!!!
0439023521|5.0|I received this book as a gift, and I am so glad I did!  I couldn't put it down and ran out to buy the second book right away.
0545265355|5.0|I finished all three in a matter of three days.  Completely neglecting everything because they were that good. Will read them over and over! Buy them, you won't be disappointed!!
B00000IZOR|3.0|wish it was cordless. Its too hard to talk on the receiver coz the cord is so short. I just cut it off on my toy and my daughter now tries to play with it.
B004LROUNG|5.0|This was slower paced, and I was totally surprised by how it ended.  I was expecting something totally different to happen.  I will not go into details because it will ruin your read.  You will not regret your purchase, and you will thoroughly enjoy getting lost in David's world.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|The cover seems to be an ideal match for the Amazon Kindle. The cover looks cool and practical. Although I do not my Kindle horizontally, the cover makes a stand to view it horizontally. The material seems to be durable and it will protect the Kindle from pokes and scratches. Although the cover does not look too shock absorbent, the cover will absorb some of the shock in case you dropped your Kindle.
B004ECDNJU|3.0|It's a challenging game but I just couldn't get into it. I get headaches from concentrating to much. So I couldn't play it for that long. It's nice to know they do a varsity of apps. :)
B0063GORYU|5.0|As a huge Spider Solitaire user this app is fabulous. Easy to use and has all the options of the normal game. Awesome
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|A box set of Blu-Ray discs of one of the best movie franchises in history, in my opinion.  The Animatrix, which features some supplemental animated shorts to further aid your understanding of the Matrix universe, is great.  The bonus features provide behind the scenes access to the staff and cast of these great productions.  A must have for anyone who enjoys the thought-provoking nature of these movies.
B003AO1SVS|4.0|for Christmas, to my son-in-law.  I had never heard of The Black Keys, but previewed their music during shopping with Amazon.  I'd call it alternative and interesting music.  The son-in-law said he enjoys the group, and was pleased to receive the CD as a gift.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great function...love the different translations.  Sync bookmarks, notes, highlights with online account.  Able to get great teachings from other churches in my area using the Live function.  Use frequently.
0345495004|4.0|I can see why some reviewers here gave much lower marks to this book, but the acid test for me is whether or not I can put the work down.  Flawed it may be, characters not as developed as one could wish, but bottom line:  I was riveted.  It was like watching a train wreck in slow motion.  When the end comes, as swiftly and inevitably as a tsunami, the pity and horror are fully realized.  I think Horan did a masterful job of weaving fact with fancy, overall.
B000683VI4|2.0|This could have been a very good movie but for those of you out there reading reviews be very careful before purchasing this movie to watch with the family.  It really ought to have an \\"R\\" rating for sexual content and profanity.  I have seen PG-13 movies and this one was racy.  Ally as a teenager is allowed to run wild and free over the summer and gives up her virginity in graphic detail.  She hates her mother and the only relationship with her father is being able to get anything she wants.  Spoiled, rich, and w/o any apparent moral compass. Noah isn't much better as a young man. The story itself as told by James Garner in the latter years is pretty good as he deals with \\"his sweetheart\\" with dementia.  I can relate to this aspect of the movie because my mother went through the same sort of thing. But Hollywood as usual has to ruin a good movie with sex scenes and profanity.  I would not recommend this movie.
0439023521|5.0|For winter break I decided to get \\"The Hunger Games\\" finally read after many urgings from my friends who were raving about this book. For the most part I was satisfied and my expectations were met; this is a really engaging, cool story with a neat concept about kids having to kill each other tournament style. I liked how quick of a read it was even though it's really long. I also got invested in the characters and what would happen to them, which means a lot in a book where a lot of them have to die!  The first person narrative was fun because it'd been a while since I read something that wasn't third person, and it got me to relate more with Katniss. It was difficult rooting for both her and the other characters in The Games.<br /><br />The only thing I wish could have been featured more were more details on the other characters in The Games. I felt that sometimes they were killed off too quickly just to get them out of the way and focus more on the central characters in the competition. I'd have liked if there were more fights and kills that were explained, described or shown. I also felt like the ending was a little bit too much of a cliffhanger, but I guess that just makes me more motivated to pick up the second one in the series.<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend this book to my friends looking for a fun, easy read. It's not terribly difficult to get through and the story and characters keep you interested to keep going. The writing is also nice because it's not as elementary as \\"Twilight\\" but equal/a little more elevated than \\"Harry Potter.\\" For me, the most interesting part of this book was the romance arch with Katniss, Peeta and Gale. But there's also action, suspense and emotion, so I can see it being accessible to all types of readers. Have fun with it!
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Great game so far. Hoping that it helps increase my brain powers, making me smarter. My husband liked it and he loves to play this game.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|app is ok, the one for my iphone has a nice map setting with some type of dopplar thing, where's the map?
B005KELQEU|4.0|Two things that must be mentioned - it fits the kindle great while leaving the keys accessible and makes it easy yet comfortable to carry it around. Fits in my purse without adding bulk or weight.  Would buy it again.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is so addictive, Great visual strategic game, very simple and short. What the doctor ordered for when you have 5 minutes to waist, or longer if you go through all the levels.  I love that now you can quickly slide to the other worlds, and it marks was worlds you have completed with all stars.
B005HSG3U6|3.0|The cover that folds to form the stand slips out of the groove provided. When anyone wants or needs the help of a stylus, there is no secure place to keep the tool for future usage. The shell does provide ample protection for the screen. Screen protection was my main reason for purchasing the cover which it does very well.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game is awesome! strategic, while entertainment, and doesn't frustrate.  A must have.  I liked it so much, I had to buy it for the PS3 and gameboy as well.  I just wish they make a part 2 already. :)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is really really great! I love how you have like 30 Bibles at your finger tips. I would recommend to anyone.
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|Over the years I have trod to implement Windows media server with at best mediocre success.  Plexus installed and impressively. ran with little effort on my part.
B005LF9IO8|1.0|Did not see the girl train at all. She was expert the moment the movie started. The father stripped and swam an ocean in freezing waters. There was no backround on the girls father at all. It seemed to be a very poor effort to patch together a movie that could have been excelent if produced correctley.
B005UDD1R6|4.0|I haven't used this for anything other than video (wanted something better than the gallery app). But it works very well especially since it's FREE! Your videos will actually show up with the name of the video instead of a generic &quot;video 1&quot;, &quot;video 2&quot; title. The app is good for the price though I would like to see something a little more like the video app for iPhone, iPad, etc. It'd be cool to be able to catagorize your videos and create album artwork.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to play and enjoy. Having the option to play &quot;winning&quot; deals is great. This is a great app, and free!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its pretty cool and the games are easy, though its kinda hard to get points to unlock games and you have to replay old ones so you can get points for new games
B004MC8CA2|5.0|absolutely love this app.  Lots of versions and studies to go along.  This is the app I recommend to all my friends looking for a great Bible app program.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Using this on my Kindle Fire without issue. Will be trying it on my Nexus as well. Will update after the phone arrived.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|Great product that works like it should, but I wish it was a little more sturdier almost a hard case. But still a great product.
B0063IH60K|5.0|You get  what you pay for isn't true with this game. just as good as any paid game. Works great, no glitches.
