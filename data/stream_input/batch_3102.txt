B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very good graphics. The puzzles are very<br /> fun and challenging. I can't wait for the next levels to come out.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|I am a huge fan of the Pendergast series and I liked this book fairly well. I understand that the authors wanted to show a change in Pendergast based upon the events he has undergone, but in parts of the book, Pendergast was so different than his normal character that it did not ring true for me. Nevertheless, the story moves rapidly and is enjoyable. The subplots with Corrie and Constance detracted from the main story, although the authors may be using them to set up future novels. We will have to wait and see. In my opinion, &#34;Two Graves&#34; is worth reading, but it is not the best in the series.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I really enjoy playing the game.  It is entertaining and challenging.  However I sure wish it worked the way it is supposed to.  I can never access any extra moves that are sent to me.  Also, not every one I send requests to receive them.  Frustrating.
0545615402|5.0|love the collection...<br />My daughter is a J.K Rowling fan and it was a gift to her. She was thrilled!
B009CVRQLY|2.0|Seriously concerned about Celine's vocal health on this recording... I have only listened to the album once, but was struck by how much processing seems to be layered onto the vocal tracks. Additionally, the style of singing lacks clarity, the breath seems shaky and weak, and the tone is often QUITE far back. I've been a huge Celine fan for as long as I can remember, including the French albums, but this recording is painful to listen to.  Way too much &#34;creaky&#34; vocal production and intentional grinding on the vocal folds.  This is what happened to Mariah Carey as she chased music that was ill suited to her voice.  I only hope that Celine sees a competent speech pathologist and vocal coach and abandons this &#34;fad&#34; style of singing when her true voice has worked so beautifully for so long.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Has nice features including multiple alarms and sleep timer. Would have been nice to have a timer function such as you might use when cooking food or timing a nap. It would also have been nice if it worked when my Kindle Fire HD is asleep but perhaps that's too much to ask of an Android app.
031624662X|5.0|This book was a complete joy to read.  It has an interesting plot, complex and wonderfully done characters, and a thoughtfully created setting.  I love the use of language, and found Breq/Justice to be an exceeding compelling protagonist.  It's rare to find space opera where the characters are as compelling as the setting and plot, but this is such a book, and I'm especially impressed that this was the author's first novel.
B003FAJTOA|3.0|It was entertaining, but because of the sub-titles it took some of the concentration on the plot away.  Overall it was a moralistic story about family and the cost of achievement.
B00FRMCYQ4|5.0|Great kids movie. Good learning experience. If you love racing movies take some time to watch this movie. Dreams are for everyone
B003MC5N28|5.0|I retread this book for a book club and I was reminded why I read and loved it as a youth. I will definitely read this again with my kids.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I have one that is 5 and one that is 8 . This is a wonderful learning game that is fun.  Love it
B006RJTEIC|5.0|Awesome movie .Wish they would do a prequel or a follow up book. Love the 70's style of filming and suspension.
B004U8VWLE|5.0|Beautiful. So beautiful. Loved it form the beginning to the end. Well, scratch that. I don't really like the ending. I would have personally done it different. Buy this movie and you'll see what i'm taling about. ;)
B004VMUS9G|4.0|...You leave your Kindle Fire HD on. If your Kindle is OFF, the alarm will not ring.<br />Except for that wee issue, the graphics, simplicity etc. are great!
006202406X|1.0|Disappointed and depressed doesn't even cover my reaction to this book.  Having read Veronica Roth's defense of the ending, but it seemed to key off a book that I wasn't reading.  What was on paper was a different story than the one she described, and it needed a different ending than the one she gave it.<br /><br />The ending is similar to Sauron catching Frodo at the end of The Lord of the Rings and winning, like the Dark Lord ruling at the end of the Wheel of Time series, like Wesley dying and Buttercup staying with Humperdink for good.<br />Perhaps Ms. Roth could call a &#34;do over&#34; and try writing another ending.
141694737X|5.0|This book is for my 3 yr. old Granddaughter. I hope to instill the joy of reading in her at this young age. Reading is fun and can be educational, as well.
020530902X|5.0|I have been taking an online writing course and this book makes the course almost unnecessary.  It should be required in the classroom of every middle-high school.  Every part of speech and type of sentence is clarified.  It is definitely a &#34;go to&#34; book.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|I found some flaws in the concepts.also due to storyline some parts of the book were redundant. Easy to read
B004WR125O|1.0|After taking delivery yesterday of a new Onkyo networking receiver (TX 8050) and this UWF-1 wireless LAN adapter, I have spent roughly six hours trying to get this thing to work consistently. It is COMPLETELY INFURIATING!!! I'll spend an hour resetting the wireless connection, troubleshooting, trying this, trying that, and then BING! it connects! Yay! No idea why, there's no consistency to its behavior. Then I fight to get a DLNA source to connect. Same kind of song and dance. The software sucks. (Yes I updated the receiver's firmware, and I'm using an updated PC system, thanks for asking. Oh, and I installed the Onkyo Remote 2 app on my iPhone and that sort of worked for a while, and then it went into a fetal ball and does nothing. Nice software Onkyo.) Finally I get music streaming to my receiver via the UWF-1. Great, it finally works. Time passes, I leave the room (leaving the receiver powered up, mind you), and when I return ... nope. Back to square 1.<br /><br />This thing is not worth the plastic and silicon it's made of. In fact it's not worth the cardboard packaging.<br /><br />Moreover, when you go to Onkyo's website to search for questions and answers on the topic of wi-fi operation with the UWF-1 and the TX 8050, what you find is that dozens of other people are having the same exact kinds of problems -- frustrating intermittent refusals to connect, or perhaps it connects but then you can't actually get the receiver to work with the DLNA source -- and Onkyo's standard response is to ask the customer to provide a bunch of information that's already contained in the original post with a promise to address it \\"promptly.\\" This same non-response comes over and over again, for weeks, without the basic question ever being resolved. In one case the Onkyo Forum Moderator posted an instruction video that pertained to a completely different receiver from the one in the original post, and so not only was the answer meaningless, it also missed the point entirely. The poster knows how to go through the basic steps. What he wants to know is WHY DOESN'T THE STUPID THING WORK AS ADVERTISED??!<br /><br />Onkyo should be ashamed for selling this piece of sh--. I wish I could give it negative stars. It's that useless and frustrating. Not only do I want my money back, I want Onkyo to compensate me for several completely wasted hours.
1608871827|5.0|It took a while to ship, and is a bit expensive, but it came with a lot of stuff, and was a great read.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|it was funny, but not groundbreaking funny by any means. I really did like her perspective (spoiler alert) about women need to remain in the workforce for women to continue doing well in the workforce. That may be the most memorable point she made for me. I wished I had listened to her read it on audio book instead of reading it myself. I'm sure I would have enjoyed it much more
1401323820|4.0|Probably the best of these books.  If you've seen Castle, you can tell about where this is going in the end, but it's a good book.
B00CRPZXFI|5.0|Such an amazing track list that compliments a marvelous movie. The vinyl makes you feel as if you are part of the film, and gives it that vintage style while listening to the exceptional cast of artists.
1595828753|5.0|As with the entire series, this was a great addition to the Avatar world.  The plot could have done a bit more (as originally promised), but oh well.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|In my humble opinion, Ms. Roth needs to think about what she may have caused and perhaps take responsibility and provide care for the overwhelming amount of seemingly deeply depressed readers in her fan base who appear, from their comments, to have been utterly devastated by her written word. As such, I suggest she should consider setting up a Trust Fund to pay for Mental Health Therapy for her seriously distressed readers. Regardless of whether she helps offset costs, I hope any reader who feels depression, deep sadness, and/or anxiety will consider going to see their Doctor to discuss these feelings. I hope these comments help!
1401324029|4.0|As with Castle, these books are rather hit or miss.  It's not a terrible book, but it's not brilliant or anything.  It's a good read.
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|Absolutely the worst of all the Star Trek films, and that includes William Shatner's Star Trek V: The Final Frontier.
B00BGI08GG|5.0|Amazing series, the DVDs are great for the price, and comes with three copies because of Blu-Ray, DVD and digital download.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Implausible plot - don't want to give away the ending, but if you read it, think about who would have remembered or heard about what happened.
B000VWE5OY|5.0|Torchwood's first two seasons are just fantastic, and although there are some weak episodes in here (Random Shoes), Torchwood is fantastic.
B008673ZAQ|1.0|This book series is terrible. I did not even bother with the last book to the series. The first two were enough
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I LOVE this app so much!! It is a challenge to beat all the levels but is a plethora of fun! Must purchase this app.
B000GCFG7E|3.0|The writing was on this medium level. Both my husband and I read it and enjoyed it but it is not on a par with Grishom or a Baldacci or others on that level. I would recommend reading it just for fun.
B00FLNQBTK|5.0|One of the best movies I have got to watch in a long time!  Tooooooo funny! Five stars for me.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|It came very quickly and it's brand-new.  It's a great CD with very relaxing Hawaiian music.  Made me want to see the movie again.
B001676320|5.0|the energy of the music is great.the horns, chicago is great but earth wind and fire can really get you moving
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Hard to put it down. It's great working out how to infect the population, when to make fatalities and try to keep a cure from beginning by invented. Lots of fun!
B0007Y89ZM|5.0|they are great.their music is soothing, voices are smooth just a pleasure to watch and listen.the guitar playing is so good
B00G2SIW7M|5.0|Not only does Reflektor consist of a new sonic direction for Montreal-based Arcade Fire, it demonstrates a confidence and emotional resonance that make listening to this album a very fulfilling experience. Not a second is wasted on this album, with each song demonstrating some new thematic material and fun in its own right to listen to. This is a worthy follow-up to The Suburbs, and despite its sprawling length, feels even more complete somehow. While The Suburbs had a few songs that were great in context of the album but perhaps less interesting on their own, every song on Reflektor (perhaps with the exception of Here Comes The Night Time II) is intriguing in its own right.<br /><br />I'm super excited to see what these guys do in the future. They're cementing their legacy as an amazing and unique band.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|What a vivid imagination this author has!  Grisham can spin a tail that does not disappoint a reader in search of excitement, and has certainly done so here.  Gold bullion, and looking at injustice through a very astute black man's eyes will open your own eyes, be you black or white.  I'm happy to say that Mr. Grishom never lets me down!
B007SNMYNS|3.0|wheat Belly.<br /><br />I bought this book on the strength of the dust jacket advertising:<br /><br /> Front cover very top:\\"Lose the wheat, lose the weight and find your path back to health.\\"<br /><br />Back cover:<br /><br />\\"Eliminating wheat, even so-called healthy whole grain wheat -from our diets is they key to permanent weight loss and can offer relief from a broad spectrum of health and digestive problems.\\"<br /><br />\\"A wheat free diet has been associated with significant benefits, including<br /><br />- weight loss of 20, 30 or even 50 pounds in the first few months<br />-alleviation of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes<br />-recovery from intestinal woes like ulcerative colitis and celiac disease<br />-marked improvement in overall cholesterol counts<br />-improvement in bone density and reversal of osteopenia<br />-cessation of skim conditions from psoriasis to oral ulcers to hair loss<br />-reduction of inflammation and rheumatoid arthritis pain.\\"<br /><br />That's the back cover.  His claim on the cover of his book mentions NOTHING about going on a low carb Atkins-like diet to accomplish all these goals.  Just wheat.  Eliminate that ONE thing and ye shall be healed.<br /><br />OK.  I'm diabetic, steroid-induced.  I have osteoporosis from said steroids.  Definitely have intestinal woes. Cholesterol count is splendid though despite having diabetes, which is unusual - who knows why, and I do have a bit of joint pain.  So I bought it on the strength of the cover claims, only to find a history of how wheat has changed over the years (the only valuable information in the book - but is is true?  Maybe, and maybe not - you decide\\") and an Atkins or Dr. Bernstein low carb type diet clone as the only way to achieve these goals.<br /><br />Not just wheat elimination. Nope.  Despite the promises on the book cover that suck in the desperate, his 'diet' consists of: Vegetables, meats, cheese, oils and condiments.  These can be consumed in \\"unlimited quantities.\\" (pg 210 of the softcover') Can you say 'cholesterol?\\"  Ok, I think maybe cholesterol has less to do with what we eat than genetics and the liver, but still..all that meat...and if meat's not your thing, then you're stuck with nuts seeds and cheese.  He allows limited dairy and fruit, as did Atkins.  Not so awfully bad; Atkins worked for some, but realistically, what percentage of the population can stand it for long?  So he is really advocating a low or fairly low carb and NOT just the elimination of wheat as the way to dumping the diseases.<br /><br />Pg. 204.  Although wheat is the worst offender,\\"..in addition to wheat elimination, an overall reduction of carbohydrates' is recommended, i.e., \\" in addition to wheat the following foods should also be reduced or eliminated\\":<br /><br />-cornstarch and cornmeal<br />-snack foods<br />-desserts<br />-Rice  (there go half or more of my gluten-free recipes)<br />-potatoes<br />-legumes (you cave the pork and pork fat, but not the beans)<br />-gluten-free foods (knew that was coming)<br />-fruit juices and soft drinks even fresh squeezed and sugar free<br />-dried fruit<br />-other grains: quinoa, sorghum, buckwheat, millet and possibly oats (at least my morning oatmeal isn't under the knife, \\"possibly\\", and I can have milk with it if I want, or better yet, cream.<br /><br />I don't want or use many of these foods and of course his 'diet' makes sense - possibly with limited rather than unlimited meat (can you say \\"gout?\\"), but THAT'S NOT WHAT HE CLAIMS on the dust jacket of his book and it is false advertising, preying on the desperation of people, especially diabetics. I do agree that grains are addictive, for me, mostly wheat products (which are, after all, the most common), but again, that is not what the book covers say.<br /><br />We know we should eat less and exercise more.  Many of us are in this situation which is why this simple 'solution' claim of his is selling books.  Many books.  His diet makes sense somewhat but don't believe for one minute that eliminating wheat alone will produce ANY of the results claimed on the cover of his book, which is what most of us see before buying it and what determines whether we will or not.  I tried it for a couple of months.  Did absolutely nothing at all.<br /><br />He's got low-carbing 'true believers' going around on blogs and Amazon telling their 'success stories' and  countering comments like this, and they are entitled to their opinion in support of his diet, and maybe I even support it in theory,  but do not think for a minute that eliminating wheat, as he claims, is going to do a thing for his laundry list of ailments.<br /><br />If you are interested in the history of wheat hybridization and how GMO grains are affecting our health, it's a nice quick summary (but is is true?  Maybe, maybe not).<br /><br />There is no easy solution to health and weight loss.  You are going to have to exercise, limit amounts of grains, eat more vegetables etc,etc. etc.  Don't mistake this misleading claim of his as the easy way out.  There isn't one. Except for the extreme bariatric surgery that seems to cure diabetes fairly instantly.  What doctors need to focus on instead of writing pop diet books which are little to no help and often harmful, is to figure out why that is and make it accessible to everyone in a non surgical way.<br /><br />---------------------<br /><br />Update:  When I wrote this, I had eliminated wheat for about seven weeks; not only wheat, but gluten. I'm not losing weight - that was never my motive anyway - but over the last four or five days I am having hypos every day.  I've had to cut my long-acting insulin back by three units, but that's not enough - it has to be cut back more before I do myself some damage.  Hypos were something I had never really experienced before eliminating gluten, and now I have to be very careful with the rapid insulin because I don't seem to need it very much.<br /><br />Is this the result of eliminating wheat, or gluten? or is it because the GF bread and pasta is so tasteless that I'm eating less of it?  Well, no.  I am eating the same amount of bread as always - one or perhaps two slices a day. The gluten free bread isn't so awful and the GF pasta ok too.  However, the surge of satisfaction - a sort of a 'high' I used to get when eating wheat products is gone.  The addiction is broken. Wheat, for me, was a drug.  I've known that for years. Now, I don't seem to have to grapple with it.<br /><br />Also, the endless intermittent diarrhea and constipation is settling down, reduced by about 70%. The arthritic stiffness in my hands is also lessening.  I can open jars more easily.<br /><br />Is this due to the elimination of wheat alone, or gluten, or is it coincidence - I don't know yet, but if this continues, then I'll alter my review above to reflect that.  There seems to be no other explanation for the reduced need for insulin. We'll see.<br /><br />------------------------------------<br />Update: Gastro symptoms are back.  What was helping was a high quality full spectrum probiotic.  When I ran out the symptoms returned.  I was losing a bit of weight because I am not eating anything with wheat in it and that was a significant part of my daily calories. That loss has stopped. I will say one thing though, my craving for chocolate, ice cream and treats like cookies has completely vanished. I eat maybe 1 or 2 slices of gluten free a week and really don't even want that.  I never thought I could give up bread and chocolate.  I have eliminated 'all' gluten though and not just wheat.<br /><br />If you have a carb addiction you may want to buy the book and see if it helps.  It took me about a week to notice the difference - what a load off my back (literally).  Because this helped I am giving the book another star.what but don't believe for one minute that eliminating wheat alone will produce ANY of the results claimed on the cover of his book, which is what most of us see before buying it and what determines whether we will or not.

B0094K1PW4|4.0|I liked it. Basically a kid's movie. However, it did bring back fond memories of my own Super 8 days. Well done.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I would give it a 5, but I keep running out of lives and that's real irritating. Otherwise a really fun game
B000AMWIVM|5.0|Greatest thriller movie ever made. The movie made you think after which is always good. I would see this if you have not already
B002QRWJA4|5.0|I love everything about it, its excellent.  The story is good & i really liked the music.  A job well done.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME, GREAT, FULL OF SURPRISES, GOOD COLORS, GREAT SOUNDS, I LOVE THIS GAME, yes yes yes , ............
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|The ending was evident from the time the trail began. There was little surprise. Grisham's plot is threadbare. A pleasent , but hardly exciting read.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I realize this trilogy is dystopian literature, however, I did not expect the last book to crush my heart a thousand times worse than Mockingjay did. I devoured Divergent, re-read it twice, then moved on to Insurgent which I also read twice before picking up Allegiant. Wish I hadn't picked up the third book at all; it was dull, I constantly had to flip back to the beginning of the chapter to see who was narrating. I loved Four in Divergent and Insurgent. I was excited to see how he thinks, but alas, he was better off as a mystery: the man who strives to be brave, selfless, smart, kind, and honest although as he admits, kindness is a struggle. He regressed to being the beaten boy in his dad's house which, for me, destroyed the strength-in-spite-of-abuse character I fell in love with.<br />**Spoilers** Then there's Tris, the reckless, selfless heroine, who doesn't allow others to condition her response to the situations she finds herself in-does something selfless, unarmed (yet again, *insert groan here*) and just dies from bullet wounds? Cheap. Where was the redemption for Caleb? Or the redemption for David, who loved Natalie then shot her daughter? Evelyn sets aside her powerful position when she has numbers on her side and the disgrace of years of being an outcast? Marcus disappears? Johanna is carrying a gun? Peter gets a do-over? Why even introduce us to Zoe? And what about Susan and Robert? They were in the beginning of the trilogy, where is the resolution? Disappointing, in so many ways. Sadly, Allegiant ruined the trilogy for me.<br /><br />Edit: I have spent some time mulling over why, exactly, this book ruined the trilogy. More **spoilers**<br />1) At the end of Insurgent, all of the factions have a specific serum weapon at their disposal. Except Abnegation, which I was fine with. After all, that is the selfless faction, surely they wouldn't feel the need to manipulate their members with anything. Definitely not fear, nor \\"feel good\\" mixers like Amity, nor truth serum. But I was mistaken. In the third book you discover Abnegation, in my opinion, has the worst serum of all. They have the ability to steal your memory. Tell me, how is that selfless? I work with dementia patients. Members of my family have succumbed to dementia. It is...awful. Sometimes it seems a fate worse than death, to not recognize the ones you love and not be recognized by the ones you love. Yes, your loved one is still physically present but he/she becomes a shade of his/her former self. Yes, we all have things we would like to forget. Trauma, abuse, regrets, mistakes we made, words we cannot take back...but to have all of your memories wiped out without your input...seems heartless.<br />2) If Natalie knew that the cliffhanger ending of Insurgent, Edith Prior's video, was a farce, why was she willing to die in the main Abnegation building for it? Couldn't her old pal David dispatch a new one? And Edith's video, what a letdown. I was stoked to see what was outside the fence! But, no, it was a lie, mere government propaganda.<br />3) If resetting was possible, why didn't they reset Jeanine and her minions? If someone had to be reset...why not the one bent on killing an entire faction off? Take in a SWAT team, grab the disc, give her some memory serum and be back on the outside of the fence. Or, since I hate memory serum, Jeanine can be brought outside the fence.<br />4) If the author decided Divergent truly doesn't mean anything special, why were they killed off? And that's a neat gimmick, build a world based off of divergence then decide its meaningless. Surprise surprise, the divergent trilogy has become meaningless to me. What a waste of my time.<br /><br />For me, book three fell flat. It was painstaking to even finish--I had to set it aside for hours because I was too angry with the direction the book was taking. I wish I could return all three books...but I will no longer be recommending them to anyone. I have even rescinded the recommendationsto friends that I already gave--if you haven't read book three, STAY AWAY!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Addictive for sure. Some levels are really frustrating, but eventually you pass them. I love this game. Thank you king
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I plugged the Chromecast in to my TV, got it set up without problems, it worked.  What more need I say?
B00EK0UBPU|5.0|'The Liminaries' is a wonderfully novel with a well crafted plot. It was a pleasure to read from start to finish.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The author gives great insight to the life and times and the horrific way some people were treated. Very eye opening.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|Loved it probably more than the kids, I would recommend it to anyone who likes comedy. Will be a classic
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Pretty amazing game for being free :) the graphics are good and there is plenty do so you won't get bored anytime soon.
0780626966|5.0|Freddy Krueger is my all time favorite villain!!!! Im very excited that I have my own collection!!!! Excellent!!!!! Five stars!!!!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I am surprised at all of the terrible reviews.  I couldn't put the book down, I lost sleep.  It wasn't a fairy tale ending with rainbows and sunshine but it was a well written ending.  Please don't be influenced by all of the negative reviews, be your own judge.
B0065CCM76|4.0|Real songwriting. Real talent. No filler. Just great songs. Younger generations should embrace this 2 disc treasure chest. Thank God for Bob Seger.
B009EQG80W|5.0|This book helps provide vision into your inner being. The only dissapointment is that his follow on books are not as good.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is great and just challenging enough for me and the kids. The graphics are nice and the in-game challenges are good. Only complaint is the upgrades are a little pricey.
1476712042|5.0|Loved it.  I wish we would have more of a look into their future from Abby's point of view but it was good.
B00DOPEGAS|5.0|Clear instructions and easy directions are provided for the kit. My girls really enjoyed making the bracelets in a variety of styles and colors!
1451666179|5.0|I hate this book.  This is a terrible, awful book, possibly the worst book I've ever owned.  I bought it anticipating hours of pleasure and enjoyment, but boy, was I wrong!  Mainly, I've experienced intense, shocking pain as a result of Hyperbole and a Half.<br /><br />When it fell on my foot it hurt like the devil.<br /><br />Oh, the writing and drawings are hilarious.  I'm laughing through my tears.<br /><br />But I think my foot is broken.
B00EVW0SA0|3.0|The action is one of the only good things about this movie. Once you move beyond the action everything just falls apart.<br /><br />Obviously the story is Hollywood and unrealistic, which is expected, but I felt that way with Olympus Has Fallen and this movie makes that one look completely possible. The difference is White House Down wants to have comedic elements, that don't always fit, and this movies story is even more unbelievable. The biggest irritation for me was watching bad guys first come in and take out every guard without even trying, but the second Channing Tatum is involved the bad guys cant hit the broad side of a barn.<br /><br />I like Jamie Foxx, but he just didn't fit as president. James Woods and Maggie Gyllenhaal had the best performances in the movie.<br /><br />When watching this type of movie you do have to suspend your disbelief, but the US has the best military and ability out there, and is portrayed as incompetent and unable to do anything in a movie like this which doesn't work for me.<br /><br />White House Down is decent if you just want to rent a action movie, but really starts to fall apart once you move beyond that. The story becomes so implausible its hard to just accept the fact you are watching a fictional movie.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Quite frankly, this book is a masterpiece: a beautifully rendered story, that is honest and lyrical.  It is Tartt's finest piece to date, and that is certainly saying something.
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|This is the first time Ive written a review for a movie knowing I watched something completely off the wall, expecting it to be strange and therefore probably not very good, but somehow that weirdness turns out to actually be a pretty good movie. Pacific Rim is full of action and is just really fun to watch.
B0044DEAUA|4.0|I'm really pleased with this unit.  I gave up on unreliable Bluetooth head sets a while ago, and the phone always manages to ring in the car when I DON'T have the wired earphones attached.  I wanted something I don't have to think about too much, that will be there and be able to pick up or make phone calls without planning it out before I start driving.<br /><br />This just works.  You get near the car and hear a beep as Bluetooth connects.  If a call comes in and you want to make a call, it requires only to press a single button.  Easy and reliable.<br /><br />What others say about the signal which is very strong and sometimes fails to disconnect from your phone is correct.  I found if I go into the Bluetooth settings on my phone to turn it off momentarily and then back on, it will disconnect.  But I can't count on always remembering to do so.  This was one reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.<br /><br />The other reason is that I find it hard to adjust the volume or tell if it needs recharging at a quick glance.  Minor issues, but all of these things together cause me to deduct 1 star.  Doesn't mean I don't like the unit immensely, and I still highly recommend it.<br /><br />If you have an iPhone with Siri, you can activate Siri with this unit, to do things other than just placing a call like telling you the time, temperature, reading your text messages aloud, or sending texts.  The only problem is (and this is an Apple issue, not a SuperTooth Buddy issue) that you can ask Siri for directions and it will find them for you, but you can't get the navigation started by voice--you have to press &#34;start&#34; on the screen.  That doesn't make a lot of sense!  Oh well, a first world problem, for sure!<br /><br />I charged it up on receipt and have been using it heavily this week.  I'm not sure how long the battery will last, but so far, so good.
B00FPGV3RS|3.0|I read some of the reviews for this movie and watched it expecting to dislike R.I.P.D., but I don't think its as bad as some people have made it out to be. It's an average action movie that heavily takes from Men In Black, and is worth watching if you are looking for something to rent, but I would agree with the critics that the movie missed its mark. Ryan Reynolds, Jeff Bridges, and Kevin Bacon are all good actors, but the pieces didn't quite fit together. The best part of the story comes near the end, but overall this is a movie you will watch once and probably not think about again.
0761163808|5.0|This bookw as in great condition. It is a great book forr childrens for all children no matter the age.

0865479186|5.0|Ben Goldacre is brilliant.  Easy to understand for anyone unfamiliar with science experiments.  This book will leave you shaking your head in disbelief as Ben debunks case studies of popular pseudoscience and big pharma.  I enjoyed this book and highly recommend it as an eye opening experience to marketing gimmicks.
B002VHI8FE|4.0|This book was quite good, although it didn't live up to the hype the fantasy book website had made it out to be. Enough magic and humor to gloss over boring parts, and enough of the unknown to keep you reading. Very clearly more of a set up book, as there was hardly anything to look forward to in the book, just the seeming random movement of characters in a large world. Still, worth the read.
0307271757|5.0|A Christmas carol is one of my favorite book. and so is sleepy hollow. will pass these down to my 12 yr old son.I used to read my grandmothers and always wanted my own.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Cool and fun to watch movie.  I will watch it again soon but what I need to do is buy it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was soooo happy to find this game is finally here!!! I love my kindle even more now. So worth the wait.
B00EI4V3X2|4.0|I bought with the mindset of getting a decent pair of wireless headsets with surround sound...and I got it. Though for the price I would think to get better headphones overall but I don't mind. The instructions for pairing are kind of vague and the pairing for the wireless should've been included but I set it up in less than 10 mins so it's not a problem at all. I like these so far but I don't have a real input in them because these are my first headsets. I would recommend this there are no interference, delay, or feedback whatsoever.
B009HXG9UQ|5.0|I love this movie - creative, crafty, well rendered characters and the quirkiness of youth and love without all of the sap. Intelligent when choosing the darker characteristics of the story as well as campy fun!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|If you buy this app you will get amazing quality. It has all the concepts fro square roots and powers. I can't even believe it is free!!!!!! If you don't have this I can't believe you.
B00B7FOQCK|4.0|Works very well. The only thing I could mention: is kind of bulky (big) but it's fine. Another thing: the USB plug is too large.<br />The construction quality is very good.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a really good game I think everyone should try it and it's worth buying but it's free so if you don't like it you can just delete it but you shouldn't because it's really addicting and really fun . You will have a great time playing this game . Hope you enjoy I did .! :)
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It is good, it is just in its baby stage though. I believe, as of now, the only apps that work with it are..<br />1. Google play store/YouTube<br />2. Google music<br />3. Netflix<br />4. Pandora<br /><br />Once Hulu is added, would be nice. Ideally I would like to be able to stream from my computer as well.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It was ok game some levels you have to buy ..or you can do certain task for a limited time on this game. It wad challenging to try and beat some of the levels.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Am a big fan of You tube and love to watch it on my large screen TV. Had to use blue ray player before  with moving cursors that was  not user friendly. This product works great with you tube and using your cell phone to search things of interest. Fits my needs perfectly.<br /><br />I really don't care much about other features like netflix. And for $35.. what a great deal!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an amazing game! When I start playing it I can't get off it! I recommend this to everyone!
006202406X|4.0|The stylistic change interrupted the flow the other books had but still a stellar story. I look forward to more books.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I've read Rick Riordan's books since 3rd grade. I started with The Lightning Theif, and went from there. I've read all of the books of The Kane Chronicles, the Percy Jackson series, and the Heros of Olympus series multiple times because they are so well thought out. I have no complaints about this or any of his books
B003G4W49C|5.0|I enjoyed this book, which initially intrigued me by seeing the movie preview. So glad I chose to read it. Loved it's subject and lesson!
B00B5C0YOO|5.0|Titanium let's you export and \\"share\\" backups, yes, but in their format. This app will let you easily share off the original INSTALL FILE. That alone is invaluable to me and is something I have wished that TB had. So while this app is no Titanium Backip, it is still well worth having (especially as a FAOTD) in its own right.<br /><br />YES this app needs root access. Personally I won't even have a device in this house of any kind that I cannot root and control myself. It is MY device. I own it. I should be able to do what I like with it, including rip out or change any system application that I like. Nobody gets to tell me what I can and cannot do with any conputer or device that contains my personal data!<br /><br />I also should not be forced to keep third party garbage that I do not want. ROOTING solves all of these issues and more. Better performance is mine due to getting rid of bloat I didn't want in the first place. Rooting means that I get to control my own device. I can remove analytics software and tweak settings.to turn off built-in loggers, etc. This app is a convenient way to help keep the system free of garbage I do not want. It also allows me to easily make a backup of the original install APK for my own personal use later. That is a<br />NICE feature!<br /><br />As a FAOTD, this app is five stars. As a paid app on other days, I'd say maybe four due to limited features. Since I got it free today, however, it is a five star app to me. I also expect this app to grow in features in time. Thus, I am giving it the benefit of the doubt for now.<br /><br />And finally, to those of you rating this down because you do not understand the point of root access, I have to ask you to please reconsider. Instead, learn what root IS and do it to your device. You will be GLAD that you did! But this app does not deserve your scorn just because you have not taken the time to learn about the benefits of rooting.
B0094K1IPI|5.0|One of the best movie you will ever see. It also has two of the best acting performance s all time.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Great story, great cast. Denzel Washington's performance is moving and heartbreaking. John Goodman's cameo is awesome. This needs to be on your 'must see' list.
B00DAPOHU6|5.0|Jack  Johnson delivers again with a Hawaiian beach vibe that clearly depicts a lifestyle and family friendly vibe.  He is like fresh air and ocean breezes.
B00DSTBMMU|4.0|No question about it....Sheryl Crow is at her best when she's just trying to be....well, Sheryl Crow. Her style and sound has always benefited from a blending and melding of genres...a little pop here, a little rock there. Toss in some country for flavor, some R&B for spice. That's just who she is, and it's usually worked out well for her.<br />  However, starting with 2010's 100 MILES TO MEMPHIS, Crow seems set on concentrating on specific genres. The hollow soul of MEMPHIS fit her like her daddy's overcoat, coming across as forced and ill-advised.<br />  With FEELS LIKE HOME, her eighth studio album, she's now shifting to Country. (If one's to believe the press release, it was the only way she could get a new record deal after parting ways with A&M after almost 20 years. Really? REALLY???).<br />  Country has always played a big part in Crow's overall sound, so this should have been a natural segue. Sadly, that's just not the case. At it's worse, HOME sounds transparent and contrived, like it's pandering to the lowest common denominator (Sort of like a Carl's Jr. commercial!).<br />  At it's best, though, the album proves that this just isn't needed...tuneful, honest and organic, Crow's roots spring forth throughout all of those stronger moments. Sometimes subtlety and simplicity really are the best route to take!<br />  Case in point....the disc's opening cut, \\"Shotgun.\\" Rather than being honest and real with us, Crow seems to be dishing out something she thinks others might expect from her, something that's \\"now\\" and \\"hip\\" on the Country charts. Wrong move. Cotton candy is light and fluffy and fun, but you can't make a steady diet out of it. The same can be said about \\"Shotgun.\\"<br />  Far better is \\"Easy\\", the album's first single. With it's relaxed arrangement, lazy, loose vocal and sweet lyrics (I LOVE \\"Forget the beach, I'd rather be here with you/Playin' croquet/Okay/Maybe that's not true!\\"), the song just kind of tumbles out of the speakers, warming you like the sun on a late Summer day. Very nice!<br />  \\"Give It To Me\\" starts off O.K., but by the time Crow gets to the chorus her vocal comes across as strained and over the top. By the bridge? Just waaaay too much. Nice backing vocal from Ashley Monroe, though. Gotta call this one a miss.<br />  Even worse is \\"We Oughta Be Drinkin'\\". I know what Crow is trying to do here, but it just doesn't work....dull arrangements, mannered vocals and moronic lyrics don't become anyone. Crow is better ~ and smarter! ~ than this drivel. DEFINITELY a career low.<br />  On the flipside, we have the album's best cut up next. \\"Callin' Me When I'm Lonely\\" is sheer pop perfection...you have an insanely tuneful arrangement, crisp instrumentation, a lovely lead vocal and thoughtful lyrics (\\"And that's just enough time for me/To figure out if I should stay or leave/But if I think it through/I ain't got nothing better to do\\"). Classic Crow!<br />  I love the \\"single mother\\" story behind \\"Waterproof Mascara\\", but I wish Crow had kept it real and true to her own life, vs. dressing it up with the whole \\"abandoned by a no-good cowpoke\\" theme, something that's totally unnecessary. A good song that could have been even better.<br />  I also wish she'd taken things even further with \\"Crazy Ain't Original\\" ~ there are some wonderful observations here (my favorite being \\"What everybody used to call a freak show/Well now we call it reality T.V.\\"), but I would have loved to have seen a bit more bite and attitude in both the vocal and arrangement. Still, one of my favorites!<br />  There's nothing deep or profound about \\"Nobody's Business\\", but who cares? In the old days, this would have been called a great \\"album track\\", and that's exactly what it is...catchy and fun, with a killer lead vocal, this is just a good time that adds to the overall vibe of the disc. Sweet!<br />  \\"Honesick\\" is another winner. A delicate arrangement and gorgeous lyrics meld perfectly. But the true star here is Crow's stunninglead vocal, aided and abetted by Zac Brown's pitch-perfect harmony vocal. I swear, this is a master class in harmonizing! Breath-taking...simply breath-taking.<br />  \\"Homecoming Queen\\" is another example of Crow at her best....you have a thoughtful, bittersweet story/song, understated instrumentation, an introspective lead vocal and killer lyrics (\\"Too bad life ain't a local parade/In your uncle's Corvette on a Saturday/With all the little girls waitin' on you to wave\\"). THIS is what we've come to expect from Sheryl Crow over the last two decades....honesty, with no extra trappings needed. Nuff said.<br />  \\"Best Of Times\\" is fun enough, but after the one/two powerhouse punch of \\"Homesick\\" and \\"Homecoming Queen\\", it seems, well, a tad bit...amateurish. Nice harmonica riffs from Jim Hoke, though.<br />  The standard disc closes with the lovely \\"Stay At Home Mother.\\" Unlike \\"Waterproof Mascara\\", there's not a single false note here....your heart just aches by song's end. And Crow's lead vocal?!? WOW!!! Once again, this proves that Sheryl Crow doesn't need to dress things up, that she's at her best when she's just being herself. Stunning.<br />  I don't know why they left \\"This Is You (That Was Then)\\" and \\"You're Asking The Wrong Person\\" off the standard disc ~ maybe they thought they were both \\"too Sheryl Crow-ish\\" ~ but whatever the case, it's a shame....both tracks easily sail into her Top 25 all-time best! \\"This Is You...\\" has a slinky, sexy, soulful groove to it, with Crow almost purring the lyrics, while \\"You're Asking...\\" is cute, clever and catchy. (I particularly love the lines \\"But you've got a girlfriend/Who doesn't like you having girls for friends/So you don't always tell her where you've been/Even though you've just been with me again\\"). Die-hard fans should DEFINITELY try to track down the deluxe version of the disc!<br />  So where does Sheryl Crow go from here? Hopefully, her new label will realize she's a POP star, in the best sense of the word, and in all it's co-mingling, genre-bending, cross-over glory. FEELS LIKE HOME's best moments prove this, beyond a shadow of a doubt.

B00124PXW8|1.0|I read the book when I was a kid. It was well written and entertaining, though I questioned the subject.<br />When they released the movie there was so much hype - I didn't want to miss it, only to walk out on it.<br />( I was 13)!.<br />This movie is so entwined in religion that the deeply religious folks will be scared by this thing.<br />The rest of us will just laugh at it.<br />I tried watching it again after all this time and it just got more boring (like it needed that) and more ludicrous.<br />Want to a good scare? Watch the evening news - I guarantee you it will be scarier and more entertaining!
B0031RS44S|5.0|Typical Jack Reacher style with the added bonus of his old crew. I found this book hard to put down. Recommended and very entertaining reading.
B009O07NBQ|5.0|Awesome Soundtrack! Nothing better than listening to this soundtrack. The music is enough to move men's souls and relax even the angriest person.
B00FANXZL8|2.0|First, let me say I am a huge David Bowie Fan. But this box set looks like a knock off. The discs look like someone pasted their own label on it. The lyrics are not even printed are on the page entirely.  Words are cut in half.  It honestly looks like someone photo copied it and half the page was cut off.  I can't even make out what it says because the margins are all out of sorts.  What a shame.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|Exceptional music, lyrics, guitars, drums, bass, bkg vocal harmonies. This album will raise the hair on your neck. Buy 2 and give one away. This can change lives
B009XIXVU6|4.0|A tale of a family that mirrors a fable.  Very readable with some unpredictable events. Not as touching as Kite Runner, but still worth reading.
B002CMQS1O|1.0|Strange little flick, a friend recommended this as being very funny, watched the first 30 minutes or so, never finished it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's about time candy crush came to the kindle fire! This game is super fun, plus if was free. There is no substitute.
B00004WG2F|5.0|A wonderful move about love,loyalty, \\"justice\\" and family.  Brad Pitt and Aidan Quinn have made many movies, but I think this movie is the best for both actors. The occasional American Indian narration adds so much to the film.  I have seen this movie five times and I cry at the end every time.
B00CNQ7CRI|3.0|Some parts are fun and funny but the forced references to the earlier books and antics is trite and contrived. Nothing spectacular but a decent way to spend an afternoon.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|The story took a long time to get started. There were some good parts but definitely nothing like the first book of this trilogy. Worth reading though if you've read the other ones to see how it all comes together.
0307888681|5.0|I'm a huge fan of all things Zombie but what makes this book so great is the realistic attention to detail.  I was pleasantly surprised by all the political intrigue and scenarios that might actually happen in a global pandemic.  The short story format helps if you want to read a little bit and put the book down.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Amazing read, one that needs to be read multiple times to grasp all that is written! I'm excited to read what else Card has to offer!
B003954I9C|5.0|Love This Album, it just goes to show the excellent range he has going on! I would recommend this to anyone who loves the Backstreet boys, and those who like soulful music.
B00GBQI0M2|4.0|The Making of Marea is a good short story that hints at so much more. I was happy to see that this was part of what will be a series, because there's much more to this story than the reader gets in this one.<br /><br />Overall I liked this one. I really liked Marea's character. I can tell she's complex and not to be taken lightly. I wasn't as keen on Delano, but he wasn't all bad. I feel that there was some story missing from this one. As I said, it's part of the series, but I think there's not enough revealed for this one to fully pull me in. The reader's thrown into the scene blindly, while it unfolds, but I didn't think it unfolded fully enough in a few areas. That'll probably be fixed in later installments.<br /><br />Another small issue I had while reading was the point of view. It's third person, but the issue was that it jumped from being inside Marea's head to Delano's too often for such a short story. There was at least one time when this change occurred in mid-paragraph. It's only slightly jarring, but worth mentioning. There was also a small section when Marea's name changed to \\"Maria.\\" Small hiccup, but something another proofread could clear up.<br /><br />But in the end, it's a good story. I liked the twist and how that'll lead to something bigger. The mild-erotic scene that is incorporated into the story was a nice touch as well. It added to the story without taking center-stage. I'll have to come back for more of this Vampire Historia series when more comes out.
B0012DT9VK|5.0|after that poor attempt to make a good movie out of one of my fave books , Tim Burton takes a shot and succeeds with Charlie and The Chocolate Factory like he would always do with any idea that is super imaginative . The world inside the factory is just beautiful and makes a new name for colorful , The Story and message are told very well and do not fail by shoving it in your face like the 1971 version did. overall i give this movie a perfect rating of 100.
B001XV3LSS|4.0|Good plot, good people, a lot of suspense and action.  I only gave it 4 stars because the 5 have to be reserved for the really great movies like Avatar.
B000M9BPEY|3.0|Even though this film excels in visual terms , Big Fish has a terrible script that does not pull any of the flashbacks of Edward Bloom together which is disappointing the we're very enjoyable and interesting, and that Tim Burton is that directed the flick.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Amazing story of life in North Korea.  I learned so much about the culture and life there.  Attitude towards value of life is so different there.  Excellent novel!
B008JFUNWS|3.0|Even thought this movie does not have anything from the book and has only 5 percent from the book , it followed the book so bad that i wanted to judge it as a movie by itself because i didn't want my hope for this franchise wither like a lot of my friends because i loved the trailers for this this film . As a movie , Percy Jackson Sea of Monsters brings some of the best visuals of the year , a rich plot that is just normal fun like the first film , fantastic acting , superb characters and the 3rd best action scenes in one movie of this year . if this film wasn't based of the book i would of given it a 90 something but as it is , i give it a 72.
B00DOPEGAS|1.0|Directions very confusing for my 8 year old granddaughter...the box says for ages 6+  however as an adult I was struggling.  We couldn't make any bracelets at all. Very disappointed in the instruction guide.  Would not recommend this at all.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|Best eminem yet... headlights made me cry... love game go hard... jamie n commons...marshal mathers lp number 2 going to go emerald
B004UJAOLM|4.0|The story is timeless and keeps your interest throughout. I think it's a page-turner, and I'd read it before. The reason I gave it only four stars, is that there were several spelling errors and parts of sentences missed as you click to the next page. These occur mostly in the early chapters. I was told that these errors might be due to computer scanning of printed pages to make e-books, and little or no proofreading afterward.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's a nice diversion without<br />Tons of pressure or mind numbing difficulty. Would recommend without hesitation enjoy yourself with this calm escape
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book has been one of the best books ever it's just plain awesome and no-one will ever outdo this book
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I loved this book!  The explanation behind the society and characters readers grew to love was fascinating to read.  I really enjoyed how the three books truly fit together to tell a whole story.<br /><br />However, the reason I love this book and want to read it again and again is with how Roth wrote about grief, forgiveness, and moving on.  I could really connect with how the characters were feeling and understand their actions.  Having lost my best friend several years ago, I was able to directly connect how we grieved, forgave and moved on after that tremendous loss to Allegiant.<br /><br />Do I still have unanswered questions?  Yes.  Did I want to say goodbye to the characters from this trilogy? No way.  However, would I like to see more from Roth?  YES!  I am sad that Divergent has come to an end, but look forward to future work from Roth.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|these books kept you guessing and wanting to read more. I cant wait to order more books<br />from you all. if it is good I don't want to put it down.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is an amazing book. It is sometimes hard to read because of the way it is written, but you get so invested in &#34;Charlie&#34; that you overlook it.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Great movie I enjoyed it with my son keep up the good work hope to see another very soon thanks
B003V9OCIS|4.0|German movies are very realistic. There isn't really a happy ending but its true and raw. Youll find yourself holding your breathe at times. Worth it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game!!! My grandkids love this game! Anyone at any age can play it! My grands would get ipset when they had no more lives. This games teaches patience too!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Most used device in my home.  This is awesome because its all over wi-fi and uses really the only 2 major programs I watch Netflix and youtube.  I heard they should be getting more apps for this soon.
B00632HWOG|1.0|I like how you can make your own folders with the names you choose! Easy to navigate and easy to figure it out!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|This book starting off okay.  I think Veronica Roth started to forget and drift off of the story line.  This trilogy should be Trisha's point of view.  Leave the short stories for Four.  HATED THE ENDING!!!  I feel like Divergent drew me in and I loved it.  Insurgent had me wanting more, trying to get my questions answered.  And ALLEGIANT left me with a deep hole. Sad face.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is very addicting. Love the game. Glad they is an app for the kindle now! Would recommend this for anyone.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Very addictive. Many of my friends and family play. It is a challenge to teach yourself how to clear levels. Occasional hints would be a cool added feature.
B00G25VQFA|4.0|I love all but one song on this entire album, that is a hard thing to accomplish these days  - Love it!
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|If you like arcade racing then just buy this. It plays and handles smoothness. The graphics are nice and the tracks look very good too.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book was interesting in concept but a bit dry in delivery. This makes it all the more believable. Worth a read especially if you've recently lost a loved one as I have. It brings great comfort.
B00EMGUR60|5.0|Listen to Aftershock and you'll hear Motorhead's signature sound! Songs 1 through 7 are good strong rockers. Songs 8 through 14 are even better stronger rockers!!!! My favorites are:<br />Death Machine<br />Going to Mexico<br />Knife<br />If you like Motorhead's music or good Heavy Metal music,<br />Motorhead Aftershock is money well spent!!!
0071373586|4.0|Just an absolute classic book that has created one of the most important words in marketing today.<br /><br />Ries and Trout were revolutionary in their thinking when the book was published and many of the frameworks described in this book are still extremely relevant today.<br /><br />Again a must-read for anyone working in a product-driven industry.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|Great book, would recommend to friends and family even students in High school would learn a lot from this book.
B000K8EQ5W|5.0|Unique story; cleverly done.Good cast of characters.  I'm a sucker for a good  love story. Christopher Plummer displays his character well; almost as good as Sound of Music.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I hate to sound like a broken record, but this was not a good ending to this series.  First, if you've read James Dashner (Maze Runner Series), there were a lot of similarities in plot. I actually would have liked this book slightly better if I hadn't already read that series.  Second, there were several holes in the plot.  I won't repeat what others have already written, but I totally agree that the things just didn't add up.  Also, the ending was disappointing, and it seemed like there were several conflicts that just suddenly resolved.  (Did anyone else feel like some characters were killed off just to add needless short term drama?)<br />Having said that, I did think the book was worth reading.  I was engaged enough to finish the book and did feel connected to the characters.  There were several spots in the beginning where I laughed out loud. (Uriah claiming to be much needed eye candy for the expedition)  So, I'm going with three stars.
B00GHIX46G|5.0|It's hard for a TV series to establish itself when it is trying to pack everything in less than an hour plus is trying to shine when it is in the shadow of movies like Ironman, Avengers, and the others.  But Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is doing it.<br /><br />We all expected the same levels that the movies delivered, but TV is different.  And they had to establish a new cast but stay within the boundaries of Marvel, the movies, and plans for future movies.  Not an easy task.<br /><br />But the characters are growing.  The plots are drawing us in.  We are finding out things that were only hinted at, but those lead to other hints, other mysteries.<br /><br />Of all the shows this season, new and old, this is the one I anxiously wait for the next episode.  This is the one I will make sure I see.  And this is the one I watch multiple times.  Thank goodness for Amazon Instant Video because if I had to wait until it was released on DVD to own I don't know if my nerves could handle it.
B004JMSIRC|5.0|Love the Iron Man series. I have seen the first and second and am waiting for the third to arrive.
B006FO3ERQ|1.0|This book was extremely boring and failed on many levels.  I thought this book had the potential to be very good - Pulitzer prize winner writing about a 15 year old boy whose parents rob a bank, he escapes to frontier Canada, pulled into the world of a dark, enigmatic, charismatic ex-pat American stranger...  I was looking for a mystery, thriller, danger, good characters, good writing, interesting insights into the human condition...all FAILED.<br /><br />As for mystery or thriller....fail.  the writer forshadows everything way in advance. Constantly takes the air out of the balloon. Absolultely zero buildup or suspense is sustained regarding anything in the plot.<br /><br />Character development...fail.  The 15 year old protagonist has no character.  He doesn't take any action at all, he is just carried on by the people and events around him, like a leaf floating on a breeze.  The constant introspective naval gazing from a character that DOES NOTHING.  You cannot get behind the protagonist because YOU JUST DON'T CARE.  The rest of the characters are not 3 dimensional in any way.  The kid's parents & sister - maybe about 1.3 dimensional.  The rest - 1 dimensional.<br /><br />The writing...fail.  This book was about 412 pages, of which about 300 were not needed, based upon what happens in the story.  So much useless bloat.  The prose...nothing special at all.  Any interesting insights into the human condition....nope.<br /><br />So this book was a big, big disappointment and was a failure in many ways.  Do not waste your time.
1476727651|5.0|Another great novel by Stephen King. My husband loves his work and is never let down. Stephen King is amazing.
1250030951|5.0|Fangirl is a delight of a book filled with characters so lively and three-dimensional that I'm moping around because the book is over and I won't get to spend anymore time with them. Also, I don't typically fall deeply in love with literary characters but Fangirl got me. *swoon*<br /><br />Many reviews focus on the fan fiction component of the story and I fear that other readers see that and go, &#34;But I'm not into that fringe fanfiction stuff.&#34; But honestly you don't need to be. Please don't let this issue dissuade you from picking up this delightful book. Or view it as an added bonus - both the &#34;original&#34; Simon Snow stories as well as Cath's fanfiction take on them are interspersed throughout the book.<br /><br />And I promise you that Simon Snow will be the first fictional book series you will wish you could actually purchase!<br /><br />This book is a gem. I've read some really amazing books this year (Where'd You Go Bernadette, The Dream Thieves, etc.) and yet unquestionably this is a top 3 for the year and a book I'll definitely be revisiting in the future.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|Great movies series. Never thought I was a Superhero watching person, but I find myself loving these type of movies.
B009NFHF0Q|1.0|This was the strangest book I have ever read.  Several  of my book club ladies didn't finish it.  What  was the point?  We didn't get it.
B00D8HNR2K|4.0|Probably Nine Inch Nails best album since the Downward Spiral.  Austere and aesthetic, but not at all a disappointment.  Love it!
B003B02O0A|4.0|suspenseful and thought provoking.  a good read through and through.  I enjoyed it very much.  a prequel to sycamore road.<br />,
B00E0G5U4G|3.0|Great to hear again from an old Death Metal favorite.  Not nearly as good at Heart Work, or Insalubrious, but certainly not bad considering the long hiatus.  Hopefully they'll keep churning out more deadly grinds.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I have never. played this type of game before and it was great! There were a couple of times I got totally stuck and couldn't find my way out. A little trick I found out that might help some that are ready to give up. Check out Youtube. That's all I 'll say. Oh, and one change I would make. Have the last elevator door open to a roof top or outdoors or something. Not just end. every anti climatic. Where did we escape TO? See what I mean? Enjoy!
B00EVCD9HY|5.0|Janelle Monae has such a fantastic voice and such creativity; both really come through on this album. Definitely recommend purchasing it.
B00G6YH6G0|5.0|I generally prefer to read &#34;substantive&#34; books that leave me with some new insight or knowledge I didn't have before. I picked up The Luminaries because it won the Booker, and oh boy, did I enjoy reading this book. No insights, no profundities. But clever and fun and involving. The 800+ pages flew and I was sorely upset to be finished (but very satisfied by the ending). <br /><br />On the surface, the New Zealand mid 19th C gold rush did nothing for me as a setting for the novel. But the author spins her tale well, and within the first few pages, I was hooked. I loved her characters, and even more, I loved her unusual method of weaving together the story. <br /><br />Truly a fun read. 
B0053TMP24|5.0|Like the book. I am so excited. I don't like the cliff hanger,but I am excited to read the rest of this series
0696204800|4.0|For someone who just wants to see the geometry of the block so I can produce one myself, this book is great.  Yes, there are tips at the back, but I was more interested in the dozens of traditional blocks, the dozens of flower blocks, the dozens of applique blocks, the bird blocks, the log cabin varieties...  Very good resource.  I could only wish more color photos had been used.
0736092269|3.0|Decent book. Pictures could have been better and it could explain things better. It's a nice book to learn what exercises work out what.
B001EC2IT4|4.0|We were excited to show our kids this classic. Great family fun! Coincidentally there are rumors if a sequel now?
B0042T8ERQ|4.0|Good movie. I just feel like with having those powers that they have that it would be easier to kill off the ppl that are trying to kill the jumpers. A lot easier.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved this sequel to 'The Hunger Games'.  If you haven't read the first in the series you must!  You should read all three of the series of books.  Great read!
B006AX6ONI|5.0|I am an aspiring entrepreneur in the sales field. I am in the process of reading as many books as I can on the subject of sales, marketing, and business in general. Some of the most recent ones are: \\"how to win friends and influence people\\", \\"rich dad, poor dad\\", & \\"think, and grow rich\\". This fit the theme perfectly, one of my goals in reading these books is doing exactly what Mr. Cuban talks about in this book, and that's learning something from every book you read so it pays for itself that way. I definitely found some key takeaways in this book and will be recommending it to my friends through social networks.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love the game.  sometimes it takes forever to get to the next level. they dhould give example of how to get through the levels
B002SSUQFG|5.0|This is a great unisex watch.  For those--men or women--who can't wear battery-driven watches, you can't beat the value on this attractive watch.  Automatic watches can be quite expensive; my previous watch, a Mido, was about ten-times the cost of this one.  Sure, this has a canvas band--albeit a nice one.  I particularly like the two thin metal clip tabs that keep the extra band in place.  Naturally, as this is sold as a men's timepiece, the band is longer, but the more-durable--but not balky--clips hold that extra band down nicely on a woman's wrist.  The watch itself has kept excellent time.  I've worn it for about a month now, and it has been on the minute every day.  If you're familiar with automatic watches, you'll know this isn't always the case.  They rely on one's motion to keep them ticking, so they can get a little behind if they are left off for more than 24-hours.  But so far, this one has handled the days I've forgotten it.  The face is attractive and easy to read.  It's an excellent field watch, but because it's black, not bulky (quite thin), it's a great wear-to-work watch.  For ladies, it might be a bit big for those high-fashion nights, but for most occasions this watch does not look too masculine.  I bought this to tide me over until I could find someone to fix my Mido, but I like this one so well, it's become my daily watch.  I love it.
B00B0LPYXG|1.0|So boring we couldn't make it to the end.  I hope it ended better than it was going.<br />The flight scene was GREAT!<br />What happened?  Very depressing.
B000I186FW|5.0|An amazingly told story and oneof my favorites of all time, the story is amazingly told, the pacing a bit muddled sometimes but it doesn't take away from what is otherwise an amazing performance by Natalie Portman
B005K0HDGE|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read. Don't bother reading any more reviews, just read the book, you won't be sorry.
B005VSRFEA|5.0|An important book and ideas if you want to truly understand the problems we face and how we need to begin to approach them.  Nothing stands alone.
B006S08RLU|5.0|Amazing storytelling through use of cinema. Well worth watching again and again! Also many great scenes of Paris and Montmartre.
0385743564|3.0|this felt like sanderson just needed some funds while he continues his real works<br /><br />very simplistic YA book though the plot was interesting - reminded me of The Matrix and a lot of Japanese sci-fi<br /><br />270 pgs in, i kept hoping it would get better, but remained disappointed. i almost thought i was reading DC comics, or what i imagine they're like. steelheart = evil superman<br /><br />the megan-david development was unrealistic: cheesy dialogue, super-hot gunslinging babe out of a teenage fantasy falls for a nerd? the entire story was basically 1P narrative by david so i guess it would have to sound kiddy. diary of another wimpy kid?<br /><br />is this really a work from brandon sanderson? it reads like it was written by a middle schooler.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|I love this series and have read it many times even thought the last book was a bit boring it did have a great ending leading up to this great book.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|Provided reasonably clear explanations of a complex phenomena using mini biographies of three very different sets of characters that you wanted to route for. First book in a while that I finished in two days.<br /><br />Some of the language may offend some but I thought  or at least assumed it characterized the finance scene.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Very convenient to use works with any phone. Android, fruit phone, windows; compatible with every electronic item in my house including my laptop. Convenient and very easy to use. :)
B0035HKWLW|4.0|Funny and a Jim Carrey classic. Very goofy but has good punch lines ! I could watch it every few years and still enjoy it.
067144901X|5.0|My son loves this book. He has most of it memorized as the words are easy and they have his favorite animals.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This app works wonderfully, has a great layout and is simple to use. Great for kindle users, I highly recommend it.
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|Love that the action starts right away.  Although I figured out the suspect's occupation early on, the reasoning behind his rampage was interesting. Counting the days for book two of the Max series.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game has lots of different tracks and cars.. the things may look expensive to buy at first but once you start playing, coins add up quick.. little skill required, yet challenging and fun.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|My son and I discovered Jeeves and Wooster a while ago when we borrowed these from the library and watched them and laughed together countless times.  We have read many of the Wodehouse books together.  Buying him this collection made gift giving as much fun as gift-getting.... actually .... more fun.
B000TEUSJK|3.0|Movie was ok glad I didn't pay to see it at theater. It did have an amazing amount of big name stars in it as young actors.
0618154248|5.0|The fabulous George in a set of board books - how fun is that?  These are my grandson's favorites - I have checked them out countless times from our library, read them to him over and over,  and am now giving these to him for Christmas.  We will graduate to paper books soon enough but for now - yay.
B0018LX9T4|3.0|Weird movie, Lady friend liked it I found it weird but couldn't stop watching sort of liek watching a train wreck
B009C7JS14|5.0|I have downloaded a number of apps and I found this to be the best for me. It has been easy and clear directions, and give close to accurate time/weather.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Honestly, I do not understand why most of these reviews gave Allegiant 1 star. The book was written beautifully and amazingly. I loved Veronica Roth from Divergent and I still love her now. I loved the two points of views and the Fourtris moments-who doesn't?-but I will definitely agree that the ending was very surprising. All the people who gave bad reviews need to realize they are actually giving good ones. My point being that this book affected them so much that they bawled their eyes out and that the surprise ending affected them greatly. I definitely recommend this book to those YA readers out there that CAN TAKE A DEATH AND NOT GIVE THE AUTHOR DEATH THREATS. I love Veronica Roth, and I loved this book. So, my review. Hope you enjoyed.
B00E7SFAAG|4.0|Fun and pretty challenging for this grandma.  I use it while watching TV with my husband - his programs are not very interesting :).
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|It's a good size and it fits great. The ability to switch sensitivity profiles on the fly is really really really nice. (Ex. Fast for FPS games then put it to slow when you bring up the sniper scope) with just the click of a button. The side buttons are a bit uncomfortably placed for constant use, but I can't really think of a better place to put them. Overall I think it's a great product, It's not god's holy mouse of awesome but it's pretty great.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series is an upgraded version of Upstairs, Downstairs.  Very good group of actors and cohesive story-tellking.  Maggie Smith simply tears up the scenery whenever she is part of the action!  It would be wise to start at the very first season and be sure to watch every Christmas show as well.  The third season keeps up with the quality and drama of seasons one and two...no shark jumping here!  Seems as if the quality control is on top of things as the vehicles and clothes seem pretty correct for the time depicted.  But the stories are the meat of the series and the stories are, like real life, full of ups and downs and surprises.  Just a gem of a show!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so much fun. You just can't wait to get to the next level. Thank you Amazon for adding this game.
B004UFEJVW|4.0|I wasn't sure I was going to like this movie when I first saw it, and that's saying something, 'cause I'm a huge Pixar fan.  But Ed Asner?  And balloons?!?  What was this insanity?<br /><br />Then I saw the opening montage, and my heart melted.  If only the rest of the movie could continue along those amazing tracks!  It's not the greatest of the Pixar films, but it's pretty darned good.  Doug the Dog certainly ups the entertainment value.  The story is a bit nonsensical (I mean, even moreso than most Pixar films), but it's an entertaining romp.
5028836043|1.0|Having never seen Scanners, despite many movie magazines hyping it during my youth, and several home video incarnations coming and going over years, I naively assumed that it would be as good as hype led me to believe. It's not. It's a ramshackle, barely coherent bore populated by the most unattractive cast of characters, gruesome early 80s fashions, a dull, depressing production design, sound effects that are about 1 second out of sync, laughable technology, a musical score that sounds like a cat fitting on a broken synthesizer and some of the worst acting I have ever seen.<br /><br />The confusing story has a drifter played by Stephen Lack (who's surname surely refers to his acting ability) taken in by Doctor Ruth (no, not that one - an old man played by Longshanks himself) of the ConSec company and informed that he is in fact a scanner - a person capable of ESP and telepathic abilities (or \\"Tellow-pathic\\" as one of the company elders proclaims). Apparently there is another scanner out there (played by low-rent Jack Nicholson Michael Ironside) who is recruiting like-minded people (pun intended) to his evil scheme. Anyone who resists gets their head blown up with his powers.<br /><br />The potential in Scanners is immense. This is a universe that could go literally anywhere and do anything with it. But I am led to believe that the sequels are very poor (even worse than this?) and the two spin-offs beyond that are apparently even worse. I never thought I say this, but a remake of this movie would be welcome. A 2-hour remake or even a Scanners TV show would make magic of the premise, but it's squandered on a low-budget piece of crap movie like this. I do understand that Cronenberg was under pressure to get the film in the can very quickly, and some of signature style is barely detectable within, however no mitigating circumstances can make me see past the multiple problems.<br /><br />Scanners was shot on 35mm by cinematographer Mark Irwin who went on to shoot RoboCop 2, Passenger 57, and Scream, but the highly-polished shine of those movies is nowhere to be seen here. Scanners has a couple of nice, bright shots and locations though it's mainly a grubby, unpleasant sight. The 1.78:1 1080p transfer is about as good as the film will ever look. The grain structure is very good, with virtually no noise reduction. The sound is in DTS HD-MA 5.0, but there's very little in the amateur sound design to get excited about. About 90% of the dialogue is poorly ADR-ed too. There are a nice amount of extras but I am not interested. The steelbook quality is exceptionally poor with no inside artwork, and the disc itself reads as BDMV when loaded into your player instead of having a label and thumbnail avatar.p 2, Passenger 57, and Scream, but the highly-polished shine of those movies is nowhere to be seen here.

B0013ND36G|4.0|I might be the only sci-fi geek who actually found this story pretty good.  I like the idea of showing Judgment Day, and how John Connor ended up surviving it.  Maybe that's just me, though, as I know tons of folks pan this flick as the worst in the series.  Granted, it wasn't quite as good as Part 1 or Part 2, but I thought it worked pretty well.  Yes, it kind of makes a mockery of the central tenet of the second film, but I think that fits with the course of history - humans can do there best to overcome forces larger than them, but in the end, there is only so much one person can do.  I think it also does a better job reflecting the idea that in human development, parallel ideas and discoveries seem to crop up with pretty scary regularity.  So I think this piece does fit within a larger tapestry.
B007USWCXS|3.0|In the 2011 production LE HAVRE, the Finnish auteur Aki Kaurism&auml;ki steps away from his usual Helsinki setting for the first in what will be a trilogy of films in Western European port cities. Always rooting for the underdogs, Kaurism&auml;ki this time concentrates not just on the disenfranchised urban lower class, but on a socioeconomic strata arguably lower than them: illegal immigrants. Middle-aged shoeshiner Marcel (Andr&eacute; Wilms), who lives in a run-down neighbourhood with loving wife Arletty (Kati Outinen) meets Idrissa (Blondin Miguel), a child who has found his way from Gabon to France inside a shipping container. Marcel decides to shelter the boy and see him on to England, his intended destination, but detective Monet (Jean-Pierre Darroussin) is on their heels.<br /><br />In spite of the French setting, this remains a very Finnish film in its sparse dialogue and deadpan humour. Kaurism&auml;ki yet again uses a very drab colour scheme and sets the film ostensibly in the present, but with cars, radios and rock music dating from the 1950s. Like nearly every film he has made, there is a musical performance by an oldies rock 'n' roll band, complete with pompadours and leather jackets. This is getting appallingly repetitive. Basically, if you've seen any two previous Kaurism&auml;ki films, then you'll find almost nothing new in the aesthetic and even the plot.<br /><br />That said, this is a more life-affirming film than his last, the absolutely bleak L&Auml;HIKAUPINGIN VALOT of 2006. Kaurism&auml;ki is clearly concerned with the plight of those who would escape sub-Saharan Africa by any means necessary, and this leads the viewer to reflection, but his expos&eacute; of detention centres and police harrassment becomes heavy-handed at times.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|I don't know if this is the BEST of the Terminator movies, but it's pretty darned good!  I like the expansion of the cast (and the expansion of the budget!) from the first movie, and the idea that we are in control of our fate is a nice message.  Plus, robots! And guns!  And, c'mon, you know you dug seeing Linda Hamilton all buff and kicking ass... =) Plus, you get Ah-nuld's &#34;Hasta la vista. Baby.&#34; I don't know why Arnold ever made any movie where he played something other than a robot - he's so perfect! No acting needed!  (I kid, I kid...)
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|The sound in game with dolby is great (I play with with Kindle Fire HD) but should improve graphic more.
B004UFEJXK|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie, what is wrong with you?  If you haven't rated it highly, do you have no heart?  Yes, there are flaws in this film, but Wall-E ain't one of 'em.  That lil' robot is so cute!  Sure, robots don't have hearts, souls, or feelings, but if they could, I would hope they'd be like this little dude.
B006PGL7OQ|4.0|This is actually a really good movie. Some would say that it's a bit slow moving, but that's because it's extremely psychological and has a very in depth main character. It can get a bit freaky at times, but this movie is well worth watching. There's a huge twist that takes you for a loop, so make sure to really pay attention when you're watching this. I highly recommend.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|I'm not at all a gamer, but this was available for free, so I grabbed it.  I ended up goofing around with it for an hour or so.  It's cute, and it requires some cleverness to figure out how to stack the goo-balls to accomplish tasks.
B00BXDOSXS|4.0|great app at a great price.  works as described.  will not need another app to play movies.  recommend to all.
B00138KEH2|4.0|I'm a huge '90's grunge-rock fan, so I bought this as a way to recapture some Soundgarden-y goodness.  And it's not bad.  It's not great, either, but it's certainly listen-able, and something I'll throw in the rotation while I'm doing yardwork or other music-in-the-background tasks.
B00992CF6W|5.0|you should be able to spawn chicken nuggets Bc they arr really yummy and fun to eat and I like them a lot
B001FB55I0|4.0|This was not the best of the Terminator movies, but I thought it had a few interesting moments.  It's mostly guns and explosions, with a few intriguing concepts scattered (lightly) throughout.  Don't think about it too much - just enjoy the &#34;Go boom!&#34; moments.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I like how easy it is to use, recommend for quick brain tests of memory. Easy down load, great challenge to different levels.
B0040JCJOC|4.0|Yes, I bought some DMB.  You can take away my &#34;Cool Kid&#34; club card.  But there's some pretty good music on here!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Maddeningly addictive, one must reach the next level no matter how long it takes. Great for all ages. Great expressive players.
B00275EHJQ|4.0|I liked this movie better than Part 2, but not as much as Part 1.  Then again, it's hard to live up to the original in any series.  Definitely has some rather scary/dark moments (the climactic moments at the junkyard are a bit intense for little kids), but so did the other entries in the series, so I suppose that's par for the course.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great brain food to make you think. Great time passer. Great way to keep your mind challenged. It is solitaire.
B004SKHJF2|3.0|Bought this when it was on sale since I already had the regular Shazam.  Figured &#34;Why not?&#34; Haven't gotten a ton of use out of it, but it does what it's supposed to do.
B003IDMUVI|4.0|This is the first complete novel I read on an iPhone and i must say it was a good choice, the plot was predictable and downright amazing, definitely recommended as a one off light read.
B00153ZC8Q|4.0|This is the CLASSIC movie.  The effects are definitely dated, but the concept is still solid.  I had a college class in which one of my professors made us watch this flick so he could explain that it's actually an allegory for the abortion debate.  I don't know if I'm willing to credit James Cameron with such a sophisticated agenda, but it does make one view the film in a new and interesting way.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|All of the cds have different art work than the originals.  I also bought this for a Christmas gift, but thinking I want one for myself.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Decent sequel to The Shining. Read it quickly, definitely kept my attention. Like many of his books, the ending seemed a bit rushed, but I'm not complaining.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I enjoyed Ender's Game not only for the underlying message being told through Ender, but for the hope detailed in the last pages. I'm very curious to see how the next book continues the tale!
B002ZDOXLW|5.0|There are so many inspiring and inspired tracks on this CD. I love all her music but this might be by far my favorite!
1401322425|5.0|Jamie is a delight.  He not only offers cooking for flavor and appeal, he tells you how to grow it as well.  Try the Cabbage Soup!  It will make a memory on your tongue!
0142501123|5.0|Great fun story for October.  My 3 year old loved it, we also got the movie and went through both quite a bit.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|This is not the only developer that has crap updates on Amazon. It's just sad that they lie to you when you ask why it takes a month past an update released on the play store to get it on Amazon for a paid application. I won't buy another app from than if that's how they treat paying customers
0988262592|5.0|The reason I loved this book so much is that it left the idealised world of a non-fiction book and tackled the application side.<br /><br />I'm not even in IT but decided to read this book and it was highly rewarding. There's lots of nuggets I can apply to my own business anyway. The book often feels like a thriller and at so many instances my heart was actually starting to beat harder... For an IT book that's beyond belief.
B007N9FKCY|5.0|I owe it the makers of Bean Quest to give a five-star review.  Unique, cute, retro theme with excellent scoring and just the right amount of clever challenge.  Perfect.
B004GYY714|4.0|GREAT app to search the worlds radio stations....  It's great to hear what other countries are listening to and talking about.  If there is one critique I would like to be able to sort by bandwidth.  Some of these stations have a horribly slow connection rate making for poor audio quality.
B00G4PX1MO|4.0|The original Kingdom Rush is what all tower defense games should aspire to be. Kingdom Rush Frontiers is the sequel all developers should strive for. Better than the original in every conceivable way.<br /><br />Stage design is magnificent. Enemies are varied and wonderfully illustrated. There is no one tactic that can be used to win every stage. You must adapt to each stage and change your upgrades as needed. Once each level is beaten, two optional battles are unlocked for a greater challenge.<br /><br />I've sunk about 6 or 7 hours into the game already and loved every minute of it. However, I am disappointed to see the actually money that needs to be spent to unlock all the heroes. Make no mistake, you can play through the game without needing to spend a penny. The in-game items are easily purchased with in-game currency, even though you may buy in game currency with real dollars, there is no real need. The heroes however are not cheap. You have three heroes that unlock through the course of the game, the rest vary in cost. Even with the \\"sale\\" currently running, you would spend $50.89 to unlock all characters after purchasing the game. I find this sum to be rather high for a tablet game but I do appreciate the fact that no money is needed, aside from the cost of the game, to complete the game in its entirety.<br /><br />Tips:<br />-Spend your hero and upgrade points as you receive them. You may reallocate them as you see fit later on.<br />-Once you have acquired a large number of upgrade points, use your newly upgraded abilities to replay previous stages you did not achieve 3 stars on.<br />-Some of the tower \\"abilities\\" of fully upgraded towers will be necessary later on in game. So be sure to check the in game guide as to their functions and how they may apply to the special abilities of certain enemies.
B00B52F278|5.0|Jeeeeeeeeeees do i lovveeeeeeee this show, too bad this season was the last, i will miss you guys, we need more stories like these...instead of the Kardashians or something, lol
B00DW36G32|5.0|A lot better than I thought it would be.  You see a lot of stuff in this movie that you have not seen in other movies.  Not going to give you any spoilers though.  This is a must watch.
B008JFUO36|5.0|I really loved this movie it is a must have for any tom cruise fan out there. All the action and the way they made the movie with nobody hardly out there but few people.
B004EPZ08E|5.0|One of the funnier movies I have seen.  Jason Sudekis is an up and coming star.  His films are getting better and better.  Bateman is good as always and Aniston is unlike I have ever seen her.
B0018QPPXW|5.0|I loved this movie it is a great classic movie back in the 80s specially for its time. You will love this tom cruise movie its a must see movie.
B00ECLTYOG|4.0|Worst film by far of the 3, but still worth watching.....once.  Wish I had rented it at redbox instead of purchasing it.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Well written book with a disturbing if not controversial topic!  Great choice for book club discussions. A good read, but not necessarily enjoyable.
B00D6BQG1W|1.0|Watched this with my 16 yrs old .....  I hated it.  Enough said! Just was not enjoyable to me. Rent 1st
B005IQZB14|5.0|This book came to me in a very good time, it inspired me and helped me go through a rough time.
B00FLNQBTK|5.0|E.X.C.E.L.L.E.N.T.  Funny, funny, funny!!!!  Jason Sudekis gets better and better with every film he is in.  Aniston is hot hot hot!  Dont miss this one!
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|This book was not what I expected but I didn't know what I was expecting.  I mainly felt I could completely relate with this famous but real person and that is very cool.  Liked that there were points I laughed out loud then looked up to see who caught me.
B00FPGV3RS|4.0|A lot better than I thought it would be.  Dont care for Kevin Bacon and Jeff Bridges plays the EXACT same character as he did in True Grit.  Otherwise a pretty decent little film, kinda like a poor mans Men in Black except with dead people!
B002KJX4IE|4.0|really really good movie, a classic, very entertaining special effects are really, back in the day I'm pretty sure those special effects were awesome.
0316204366|5.0|Genius.<br /><br />This book shows you why the things we all THINK are advantages - often aren't. Goliath never had a chance against David. The result should have been known by everyone long before the &#34;battle&#34; took place. But everyone was looking at what they THOUGHT was an advantage - size.<br /><br />Put a big slow soldier in full armor against a slinger - and who do you think is going to win? The guy who can only stab someone within 6 feet, or the guy who has been killing wolves at 100 paces his whole life and has a completely empty field to fight one guy.<br /><br />The slinger is going to win every time. If they were in the middle of a battle field, people all around, no room to run or move - then Goliath would have a huge advantage. But the circumstances of the battle dictated the result. They put them one-on-one in an empty field. It is an underdog story - but Goliath was the underdog.<br /><br />Is going to Harvard better than going to a state school?<br /><br />Maybe not. Yet no one accepted to Harvard is going to say &#34;no thanks&#34; and go to a state school instead - because they THINK Harvard gives them an advantage. Gladwell provides studies, stats, and real stories that would make everyone reconsider.<br /><br />You want your kid to succeed in school, so you look for a school with smaller class sizes. Are smaller class sizes always better??? Think again.<br /><br />Gladwell makes you rethink what you've always assumed, and sheds REAL light on our shadowlands.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I have a Kindle Fire and it worked fine until the most recent update. It will shut out of the app and it won't let me scroll down very far. Please fix the glitches and bugs!
B00AAQRNQ8|3.0|I bought this based on good reviews and the price point. It was a good mouse for about 3 months then it started to scroll extra and dbl click. I tried to contact to company to replace it but to no avail.( I have been contacted by the company again to get a replacement.I will be trying the new one and will be giving an updated review based on that one)
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|a bit challenging at times, but fun strategic enough to be interesting but enough of a &quot;button masher&quot; to not be frustrating. controls work great on kindle fire. energy load times are way better than most games. the energy load time for one is like 10-15 mins not the hours it takes other games. would be nice if you could store more than 5 energy though. maybe 10 energy. (each fight costs one energy)<br /><br />just so you know: app &quot;pays&quot; you to rate it regardless of rating so none of the five star ratings were &quot;bought&quot;
0804137501|3.0|Echoing some of the other reviews here, I felt this book was better suited for companies/mangers that are on the fence about remote work vs. companies like mine that have already embraced it.  As the owner of a company with a remote workforce, I don't need to be convinced about it's benefits, I need more help with the everyday challenges that come a remote workforce. For instance, it's great that 37signals can send their employees on customized travel experiences, I don't have that budget, but I still want to do special things for my employees throughout the year.  It would have been great to have more case studies and more real world examples from a variety of managers/owners/industries.<br /><br />Also, this may just be me, but I felt like there was too much hawking of the 37signal products.
B00B5C0YOO|2.0|on Kindle Fire you can uninstall and backup apps at any time... I think these guys chose the wrong audience. buttons are confusing and not labeled. there is no tutorial and no welcome message. the buttons are not obvious in meaning even after you've pushed them.<br />uninstalling. Maybe it's less confusing for others. I recommend more people test it out and see whether they find it not user friendly and unnecessary.<br /> FAOTD (Free Apps Of The Day) suck.
B00F2P8ZDC|5.0|This classic Disney movie is a great family film. It entertains the kids, and yes, me too, over and over.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|sometimes frustrating but that what makes it challenging. It gets you hooked and you just want to get more lives to keep going!
0451197879|5.0|Every Stephen King book makes it's way into our house - love everything he writes.  I had read this book a long time ago and it was fun to find it again.  of course, highly recommended!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Addicting game.  It gets you hooked to do more and more puzzles. You think at first, this is no challenge this is easy and then the puzzles just get harder and more connections.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|What's not to like in this Disney movie?  We are BIG Ralph and Vanellope fans - and my kids couldn't wait to meet them in Disney World to recite some of our favorite lines.  Adorable movie with a happy ending (of course!)  HIGHLY recommended!!!!
1594202273|4.0|As a retired member of the Air Force awarded the Master Missile Badge, I compliment the author for his research and diligence.  I can attest that the safety engineering experts at Sandia National Laboratories are tremendous contributors to our nation's long record of no unintentional nuclear detonations. I have two concerns with the book.  First, the author misidentifies the Peacekeeper ICBM intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on pages 441 and 444.  He committed the common error of using the name of the acquisition program that developed the Peacekeeper ICBM (MX) for the name of the missile and he created a missile name of Peacemaker which is completely incorrect. Second he gives a very truncated discussion of the issues related to the full yield testing of nuclear weapons on pages 469-471.  I would have enjoyed a fuller discussions of the views of the former Sandia engineers as to their views on the need for full yield nuclear testing.
B002NF1ZI6|5.0|My son is a LEGO fan - loves the sets, but also loves the freedom of creating on his own.  These loose bricks give him the tools to make some awesome creations.  Highly recommended.
0399230343|3.0|The book was as described.  It's fine. There was a little wear, but it meets my expectations for a used book.  Price was good.
B00G32VYDG|3.0|One way to describe this movie is MIB for dead people.  It has entertainment value but there are too many similarities. To Men in Black.
0690043961|1.0|The book is of terrible quality.  Several pages are ripped from the edge of the book to the center.  The binding is sprung open on the inside.  The cover is dirty.  It came from a library, stamped in several places on the cover.  Library bar codes are blacked out with a marker.  This is totally unacceptable.  I will call my credit card company and register a complaint so it will be taken off my bill. Please advise how this problem can be settled.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read.  It is so well written and I would totally recommend to anyone
B002BSHXJA|5.0|Without going into detail, to put this work into stereo is like colorizing Citizen Kane - bordering on sacrilege.  The Beatles' canvas was mono.  They painted masterpieces within that medium. To force the music into stereo in order to add a gimmick second dimension castrates the impact they worked hard to achieve and removes an artistic dimension/dimensions in favor of a technological one.  The technological is cool; the artistic, profound.  Nuance vanishes.  Within each cut, elements meant to be unified are displaced. The impact of the whole suffers dramatically.  At the same time, there is space in the original.  Songs tastefully fade slowly into the distance, people talk, sounds emerge - the album breathes.  After a long fade into silence, one is left hanging - the next song either pops out of the void with added force or glistens softly in full sonic bloom and engulfs us.<br />In stereo, we look into the studio from the control room with the sound engineers and mix the pieces that have been presented them.  We hear a dissected product reassembled to the highest technical standards.  Dissection punctures the body of work and leaves us a beautiful cadaver regally clad, but a relic one generation removed from its element - if you will, a clever forgery.  In mono, the music lives.  The band opens the door to the studio and welcomes us into the room.  They make us part of the whole. In stereo, we know they're sweating.  In mono, we feel the sweat.  Ringo doesn't have to tell us he has blisters on his fingers.<br />The band's statements expanded to the entire lp.  In stereo, Sgt Pepper is a chopped up collection of great songs.  In the mono version, the Beatles autographed final draft - each side is virtually a single unbroken stream of sound from start to finish.  The experience is more like a live performance as songs morph into each other as movements of an extended piece.  To end it, `A Day in the Life' fades organically, as if scored to do so.  The final chord rings unbroken - sound waves expand outward in every direction.  Finally, audience chatter snaps us out of it and returns us to the real world, perhaps a little higher.<br />The Beatles carried an attitude I didn't fully understand.  There was an inside joke I wasn't getting and an irritating cuteness getting in the way of things - a pea under the mattress.  Now I get it.  Reserve judgment on this band until you hear their true work.  To compare audio fidelity song by song and find subtle differences in content is an interesting technical exercise that reveals fascinating detail.  To hear the work as an unbroken whole - not for the sound quality but for the musical statement is where the difference lies.  To allow the bass to reach the left ear must complete some cerebral or neurological circuit.  Lights go on that no one knew were out.  With this electricity unleashed, raw living power explodes through the cute package.  Visceral music reaches us with unyielding intensity and takes us as far as we are willing to go.  These men attain an unabashed oneness with the utmost sincerity and take it to heights that challenge those of any medium.  At the same time, it's only rock and roll, much harder than you can imagine without hearing these discs, perfectly at home in a raunchy bar.  Turn it up, kick back and let it go.<br />To hear this music the way it was meant to be heard is hearing it for the first time.  If it's background music, don't waste your money.  There is nothing wrong with the stereo version.  If you are going to listen, hearing this is mandatory.  Music, as an art form, is the presentation of sound.  This is the way this sound was meant to be presented.  This is the thing itself.ngs unbroken - sound waves expand outward in every direction.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|What a surprise ending.  Loved it and would recommend to everyone.  You think you know what's going to happen<br />but you don't.  Couldn't put this one down.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I play it on my phone and computer and I am happy to see it on the Kindle Fire now.  It works great and it is the genuine version.
B002BWQ6H6|4.0|A look at life in Dublin, the Bronx and Manhattan from the points of view of two brothers - on very different tracks. Very well written. It would actually make an extremely good movie if cast properly and not &#34;hollywooded up&#34;.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|Unbelievable album...  Have been listening to this album non-stopped.  So many great beats, and love all the melodies that he's incorporated in his songs.  Have to say I'm liking this album better than some of his last couple of albums.  Great collection of songs
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in years. I could not put it down. The issue of what makes a meaningful life is fully explored in the relationship between the two main characters. This would be an excellent book club choice.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|works great!  Much better than the puck that came with MS streets and trips.  Acquires signal right away, even in the trees...
B00F1W1SS0|4.0|As far as the music it is true Dream Theater and the sound was pretty amazing. I do think their latest CD album had much better and more balances sound. On the album the drum sound really stands out. I would have liked to have heard the drums and keyboard more in some songs. As far as the video I was disappointed somewhat. Producers seem to feel that to do a music video you need to jump all over the place from shot to shot. And they like to shoot from all over the auditorium. The reason I buy a DVD is to have the best seat in the house, the stage.<br />Who wants to watch from far away. Zooming and moving is frustrating. With Dream Theater you want to see the Musicians, and at times the guitar should have been highlighted and we see mostly the drummer or keyboard. If you would like to see the bass player, good luck because he is hardly ever shown. I would have liked to see more and longer shots of guitar and bass. This DVD really needed the &#34;angle&#34; feature. The DVD did get better nearer the end of the concert. I recommend the concert for the great music.
0316247545|5.0|This book delivered on what I needed to know about the show and its characters.  There'd better be another book for the next two seasons as well as the move.
B00F8LPH90|5.0|this game is just plain ol good.  Get to kill zombies with one of the baddest planes in the sky....
B002KJX4IE|5.0|I love this movie but it's more enjoyable on the big screen.  Too many details are lost on TV.  See it if you can in a movie theater.  It loses some of its punch on a smaller screen.
B0071XO8RA|2.0|I gave this two stars simply because if the main character wasn't the central part of the chapter the story lagged.  I wanted to like the book more than I did.  The story was great but character development needed more work.
B00B5C0YOO|3.0|This app is an app manager tool that allows you to backup & restore apps. As described, the app does not require root access to function. The majority of the features (backup/restore) work regardless; you just get some extra features if you are rooted for batch restore/uninstall and ability to backup protected apps. It's similar to the well known Titanium Backup but with one glaring limitation - currently it only backs up your app program apk file and not your app data. For example, it won't allow you to do a complete backup of your Angry Birds with all your completed level stars and scores. This in my opinion is a pretty big drawback as it seriously defeats the purpose of doing backups in a lot of cases. Since Google Play and Amazon already serves as a very basic cloud backup for your apps, this app's main advantage is for when you want to hold on to a certain version of an app. For example, if you're unsure if an app update is good or bad, you can back up your app first then apply the update. The developer promises the ability to back up app data is coming soon for root users. If and when that happens, I will update my review accordingly.<br /><br />Pro:<br />-doesn't require root for apk backup/restore<br />-clean and fairly user-friendly interface<br />-ability to backup/restore protected apps (requires root)<br />-ability to restore multiple versions of the same program<br />-no excessive permissions and no analytic add-ons<br /><br />Con:<br />-currently only backs up app apk and not app data (developer promises app data backup for root users \\"soon\\")<br /><br />Summary:<br />It's a decent app manager/backup tool, but its glaring inability to backup app data at the moment really limits its usefulness. Other apps such as Titanium backup (requires root) and Helium (doesn't require root) allow you to back up app data and are better choices. As a free app of the day, it's a nice app to have in your app toolbox - especially if the developers follows through on their promise.promise.

B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book was impressively inspiring and entertaining. I loved how it was written from  Charlie's point of view, but in the form of letters. The only thing I didn't like is that it is extremely descriptive at some parts.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I like the way it connects  two different times-one past and one present-by following the paths of two women who share a similar life situation in that they are both orphans. I also enjoyed how their friendship evolved and was so positive for both of them-one in her teens and one in her nineties.
B005V5WBFG|1.0|I was unable to get this to work with my Kindle Fire HD.  I contacted McAfee to resolve the problem and to their credit, they spent an hour with me trying to get the application working.  Unfortunately, McAfee Customer Services was unable to find a solution.  I use McAfee for my computers at home and have no issues.  It appears McAfee needs to work the bugs out of their Android version so it can work with the Kindle Fire.
B002SAUCBC|5.0|This is such an unusual story..  I know, who would expect Stephen King to write an unusual story :-)  But as all of his novels have done for me, it keeps me totally riveted.  Some might say it's a depressing tale but I thought it was great.
B004BRQYJ4|5.0|Fantastic musical and loved the score!!! Play it all the time!!!! Cher and Christina have such clear and powerful voices!!!
B00CLT31D6|3.0|I gave it 3 stars because I thought it was an okay read.  I was hoping for tips on investing or tips from millionaires on how to live frugally.  I was hoping for more details on how these millionaires became wealthy.  I also thought it spent too long in discussing how the affluent support their kids into adulthood.  There is some good insight but I was just hoping for more.
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|Great! This one still had a lot of the humor and fun from season 1. Interesting for sure! Good character development

B000GYI32M|4.0|It was ok...we got hooked in seasons 1-2, but 3 is pretty dark and has some annoying things like Marissa's terrible choices and Seth's constant lying. We're too hooked not to see season 4 though! haha
B00CD4RPWM|1.0|I am sorry, I am not happy with this book.  I was not aware that it was like a comic book.<br />I was looking forward to a nice read not a comic book.
0060765488|5.0|\\"Magical\\" is really the only word for this book. Lewis did an amazing job creating this fun world, and his children are very believable characters. Themes of forgiveness, redemption, bravery, and good vs. evil are woven deftly throughout. This book gets my absolute highest recommendation.<br /><br />The rest of the series is still very good with one exception. The Magician's Nephew was written several years after The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe. I didn't like it. At all. If you read all the other books and like it, by all means go back and read it, but don't say I didn't warn you. The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe is my favorite, followed by The Horse and His Boy, then The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. The Silver Chair and The Last Battle are both quite a bit darker than the other books. If you enjoy The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe, I'd recommend next reading Prince Caspian and then The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, as these continue on with the Pevensie children. The Silver Chair has Eustace, who is introduced in Dawn Treader, and introduces Jill, but I'd recommend reading The Horse and His Boy first instead. Its characters are mostly outside the Pevensie story arc, so it can really be read at any time.  So, in short (too late), my recommendations would be to read the books in this order: 2, 4, 5, 3, 6, 7, and 1 (if you must).<br /><br />Here is the whole series in order:<br /><br />1. The Magician's Nephew<br />2. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe<br />3. The Horse and His Boy<br />4. Prince Caspian<br />5. The Voyage of the Dawn Treader<br />6. The Silver Chair<br />7.

B000002GXJ|5.0|So great to hear the EAGLES live so many years ago-this is a piece of musical history. The harmonies alone are inspiring!
B0030MTQNW|4.0|This film covers one particular battle during the last year of WWII and covers it thoroughly.  My only gripe is that it's slightly star heavy and ego heavy.  Redford and O'Neal were clawing and scratching to make their roles more prominent.  Olivier is bland.  Hackman isn't allowed to do much.  The British and German soldiers felt the most believable to me personally and the cinematography has moments of greatness.  You will have a better understanding of the first costly push into Germany after watching this film.
B000KIRT6A|5.0|1) Great price for the product<br />2) Works great<br />3) I'm using two of these pedals as a two channel (stereo)  equalizer for a Rode videomic. It provides just the needed boost.<br />4) Equalizing before recording saves me the chore of equalizing on my PC post recording.<br />5) Using an 8 AA battery holder and 8AA 1.2 V batteries as a long lasting source of DC power for these two pedals.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So SO glad its finally for Kindle Fire! ive been searching the app store for it like every day...  :D

B002ZIAC26|5.0|&#34;Blue is The Warmest Color&#34; brought me to this album and now I wish I knew this band sooner! All songs are just unique.
B007COMT1A|3.0|The Digital copies was expired a real disapointment. I can't complian on the price for a 3D Blue Ray though.
1573229725|5.0|I thought the movie series was amazing but no no no there was even better! This book is stunning!!! Go get it.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This story was so griping I literally couldn't put it down. It was beautiful and sad all at once. Loved the details and special touches including the German words. Reminded me of when I lived in Germany. The descriptions were perfect with just the right amount of detail. And I really liked the point of view it was written from.
B002JIOOB2|5.0|Well, this complete set of the L Word series has been as much important as my complete Shakespeare collection. I love my classics! I recommend it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really enjoy this game. Great way to pass the time. I just wish there was a way to get hints.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|The entire series is great but I'm dreading finishing the 5th book and the next book not being published yet :(
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Been waiting a long time for Kindle to get this game. Now I have the two things I love: my Kindle & Candy Crush
B0074VA2T2|5.0|My neice loves this game she is almost 2 years old. She even clicks the foods in order from left to right. The misuc in the backround makes her sleepy lol so its great right before nap time to make her happy and sleepy.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|One of the best, if not the best, shows around!!  This is a thriller beyond compare!!  If you liked 24 you will love this!
B003G4W49C|4.0|Everything was great and some surprising twists, I just wasnt personally satisfied with the ending. It was a good ending, my dad loved it. Just not the kind that made me happy. Over all totally worth getting.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|not authors best work but a very easy fast read<br />I would not recommend this book there are other books by this author that were much better written. w I th better plots.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This account of a true Warrior's life leaves no doubt that nearly anything can be accomplished if we just commit...  Thank you Adam and your Brothers in Arms!
1616550414|3.0|I preordered this book as soon as I saw it listed (probably a year prior) and was REALLY looking forward to it!  However, it just didn't have any of the stuff that I thought it was going to have.  I was assuming it would be mostly about the creation of the characters and games, but it's simply explaining each and every character.  Not for me personally.  There are some good things in there though.
B006ZNRD06|5.0|Wonderful video app this comes in handy when I want to watch videos on my kindle.like looney tunes cartoons fun

B00BXKKNFS|2.0|every day i get an update notification.  when it attempts to install  i get a msg telling me (paraphrasing here) it has encountered an application with an identical name and the update installation stops.  so i delete the application from me device (kindle fire) and start over with a new download.  (looking for a new ap)
B009XIXVU6|4.0|A wonderful blend of stories of the love siblings share. Very subtle in its message this book reminds you of the importance family plays in people's lives.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I love this movie as I do most of Hayao Miyazakis movies , and for the price its a must , this is one of my all time favorite right up there with Nausica . Great story , amazing animation , just what Anime movies should be .
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Good graphics, nice quick tutorials, the level of difficulty progress at a fair rate. Not pushy with the advertisements either.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I just got this because it was free with purchase and I needed something to store all my equipment in.  It's spacious and allows for you to rearrange the layout via velcro barriers that come in and out easily.  There's room for my camera plus my extra telephoto zoom lens.  Around those items is plenty of space for my other accessories including my camcorder, extra batteries, lens caps, chargers, etc.  There's several zippered pouches throughout the bag that are perfect for memory cards and such.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Well, it's this way.... The game was fun  until it shut me off wanting me to buy something more from Amazon to be able to keep on playing. No thanks.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|Shipped very quickly. Now I can feed me new SOA addiction! LOL DVD's were exactly as promised, new and unopened. Very happy with this purchase!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for it to be available on my hd fire tablet.  Love it, play it every day
B005PK553C|5.0|Great  fun! Well acted by all without going over the top. If you like a good horror story this series has it all.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is not a look at the horrors off the holocaust but rather a deep introspective of the human soul.  I never imagined how this would impact me.  The language is poetry, prose and gut wrenching base all at once.  I will read this at least once more.
B00FOU1O3S|4.0|It is fun but all of a sudden it will not play anymore I miss it!!!!  I do not know how to get it to work so I have taken it out of my favorites, will try again to get it to open.
B00000K2W1|5.0|This CD definitely met my expectations, and then some.  I had just discovered her and was just getting to hear her music when she so sadly passed away.  Janis had sooooooo much to offer in the music world.  Listen to this CD and you will see (and hear) her.  Smart and honest.  Heart-wrenching at times; tells it like it is (still!).  Janis left nothing on the table.  God bless her.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Great for your eyes keep you looking and trying hard to beat your friends, great game and exciting I really like it
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Rap does not get any better than this. Eminem never fails to amaze me.<br /><br />I bought this album because it's clear that he spilled his heart into this, and worked his ass.
B00846F1YW|4.0|Keeps you on your toes there are a couple of items cannot get by because it is under the heading and I have not been able to go any further got to figure that one out.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book is a good, quick read. If you like sci-fi, you will like this book. It is full of emotion and action.
B00FFHG6KQ|2.0|I could actually beat the worst rated team with the best rated team on the road on rookie difficulty in less than 50 tries.
B008602KQI|5.0|The movie streamed without one glitch. I enjoyed the movie and the ease of use of Prime. Thanks Amazon Prime!
B002VUFKG6|4.0|Interesting read, thought provoking and a good history lesson on marriage.  I would recommend to anyone, whether &#34;committed&#34; or single.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Typical John Grisham. Somewhat predictable, but thoroughly enjoyable. I will read again to get the storyline. There were some parts that need re-reading to understand the characters.
B00B5C0YOO|5.0|I've used this app for a gew years now and it workss great, it saves your butt when you het a bad update on a app ciz you can reinstall the old apk from your sd card, just remember to change the file location to extSdCard if you have a Samsung or LG Device
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|This is well written and fascinating. It also challenges the reader to look at how challenges in life sometimes build strength and resiliency. It touches on dyslexia, education, Civil Rights, World Wars, cancer treatment and more. It also examines different responses to tragedy (activism and forgiveness) in a neutral and thought provoking way.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I'm still trying to figure some things out!  I need to get better at strategy.  I don't like to have to wait all the time when I fail!!!
030758836X|4.0|I had heard a lot about this book and was really looking forward to it.  The first half is captivating, the second half left me a little skeptical.  Still glad I read it.
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|I suppose the app could be fun but every single time  I TRY to open it it barely even opens up without saying &quot;Hair salon has Stopped&quot;<br />It's very glitchy
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|Great game my 4 year old love it he can't get enough of playing this game thank for the free version
B0011XBLUS|5.0|This is and awesome classical Hollywood movie. Love it! I would also recommend this for suspense movie fanatics! Rent it!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I am obsessed!!! Love every part of this show!!! They have it all balanced out! Enough action and drama and some comedy to make it the perfect combination!
B0038P59A0|4.0|This is not necessarily correct as far as the book goes, so there are those who were disappointed.  For myself, however, it was quite fun and certainly does the legend justice.  I've long felt that sherlock holmes was not done justice in the conservative old versions, where he's all proper and stuft.  I found it quite refreshing that someone saw fit to bring this colossal figure to life with the humor and the raw power that he possesses in the books.
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|I love the Mistborn series! I've been writing and reading fantasy novels for years and this is one of my all time favorites. Great story telling and wonderful characters. It's one of those series that is so good that you are sad when you come to the end of the final book. I look forward to reading other books by Brandon - he's a very talented writer with a great imagination.
B003XS00II|5.0|This is such an excellent collection of the finest of Tex Avery, that it is more than a pity it is not available for US DVD players.  Please, someone, wake up and transfer it for us - all of Avery's best work is included here.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|Not as good as his early books.  Not a page turner for me.  Many positive reviews and I just don't get it. I don't get what others thought was so good about the book.  Way too slow and not scary or even thrilling.  The shining was fantastic as were all his earlier works.  I keep trying his new books but the only one I have loved lately is the one about Kennedy.  That was a masterpiece.  I would not recommend Doctor Sleep.
B00ESJICMC|5.0|As much as I enjoyed the last album, this one blows it out of the water.  I just bought &#34;Moon Landing&#34; this evening, and already I've listened to it all the way through four times.  A nice variety of emotional levels are represented, and the poetry of the words is quite evocative.
B002KJX4IE|1.0|Lame ass movie! It sucked in the 80s and it still sucks today. One of those &#34; I'll never get that time back&#34; movies.
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|If you haven't played the first Kingdom Rush I'd definitely suggest playing through that one first.  KR Frontiers ramps up the difficulty quickly.  Frontiers features the same four basic tower types as the original.  The level four upgrade options are the only real difference.  Almost all of the enemies are new though-and in more than just a &quot;New skin&quot; kind of way.<br /><br />One of the things I like best is the lack of forced purchases.  The game does have in app purchases but it's more than generous enough with gems so there's never a need to spend money to pass a level.  The only thing you do have to buy are the extra heroes.  You can unlock three and can quite happily finish the game with just those.  There are a lot of other heroes available though for prices ranging from about 2 to 6 dollars.  The other heroes have interesting special abilities but I'm not sure they're worth the asking price.  I'll probably pick one up just to support the dev but, as I said earlier, you can finish the game without purchases or grinding.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|I've got 3 copies, 2 from amazon,  1 from a local record shop!!! Not a bad song on the disc, no fillers here, just great music!!!
B009CVRQLY|4.0|I have been a long-time fan of Celine Dion, since she entered the music scene with her debut album, Unison (1990). I was nine years old when Unison was released. I fell in love with Celine's voice when I bought her Let's Talk About Love in 1997, featuring Celine's magnum opus \\"My Heart Will Go On.\\" After a month of listening to Let's Talk About Love, I ended up with Celine's back-discography. Since I purchased the deluxe version at Target, my copy of the CD contained two additional tracks to total 15. \\"How Do You Keep the Music Playing\\" and \\"Lullabye (Goodnight, My Angel)\\" are worth the purchase of the deluxe version--12.93 (11.99 + CA State Sales Tax).<br /><br />Loved Me Back to Life (LMBTL) isn't Let's Talk About Love or A New Day Has Come.<br /><br />With exception to the title track--\\"Loved Me Back to Life\\"--the rest of the songs and the quality of the sound isn't as high from her past records. I can't pinpoint exactly; however when listening to \\"Incredible\\" (track 3) the opening piano interludes sounded \\"cracky\\" or \\"muffled\\" and not clear. I have a few piano concertos on CD and the quality of the solo piano doesn't sound like the opening piano in \\"Incredible.\\" I am listening and judging from multiple audio systems I own. When I rip the CD into my computer, I use lossless setting at the highest quality. As an audiophile, I cannot stand compressed lossy formats like MP3s or the lossy M4A format (popularized when iTunes debuted).<br /><br />LMBTL is an evolution to Celine's repertoire as a vocalist and a virtuoso artist. As a musical spectator, I felt the record fell short. I fell in love with Celine, because of her opulent and grandiose vocals. Think \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" or \\"I Surrender\\" or \\"It's All Coming Back to Me Now.\\" I experienced Celine pouring her heart out in her powerful vocals in the aforementioned songs! The current selection on LMBTL  isn't up to vocal standards. In summary, it is a matter of like versus love. Good versus great. LMBTL is a good album and I like it. If you're new to Celine Dion or would like to add her CD to your CD library, I recommend Let's Talk About Love. Don't take my word for it. Listen to trial samples and you could even listen to selective full tracks on Celine's official YouTube Channel.bum and I like it.

B00ELOOYZI|5.0|I really do love the games from this developer -- Simple Physics, Dummy Defense, and now this one.  They have gotten very good at creating realistic physics-based games which are very playable, loads of fun, and progressively more challenging as levels go on.  These games aren't just follow-the-formula -- they really require some creativity, and quite a bit of trial and error to see what does and doesn't work.  It is a learning experience.  In this particular game, you're given a substantial assortment of rocket parts (various engines, connectors for multiple stages, fuel tanks, etc) and you're tasked with putting something together that will accomplish the given task.  An example of a task is to get the rocket to a certain speed in a very limited time and also keep it within a specific flight path along the way.  Putting the wrong combination of parts will result in an unbalanced rocket or one that is too heavy to accelerate well or too light to have fuel to make the goal.  You also have to consider whether to add stages to it, which you click a control to drop off when the fuel runs out as with a real rocket.  If you enjoy physics-based creative thinking games, you won't go wrong with this game.  The price is very good for the work that has apparently gone into this.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this app, makes me want to keep my kindle now. The colors and graphics are nice but sometimes there's a void of snow in some spots. For the most part, it's fun though!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Just need more levels now. Some are pretty tricky but fun to figure out. Great graphics. Finished in about an hour.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|It's a complete fine tuned keyboard. At the moment it's at the top of its game, but the standard Android keyboard is coming up quick. I would like to see added support for Galaxy Note S Pen. Extra themes would be nice, and built-in translator. Something that could quickly convert text while you type. T9 layout would be nice. I don't see that a lot, but it would be handy for one handed typing. I think that's the future of typing, as these devices get more fined tuned the way we type will progress or evolve into a more one handed style since we always have our hands full.<br /><br />Back to the point. Great Job!!!
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|Great album from what i have absorbed so far. Usually have to hear Eminem songs a dozen times before I can wrap my head around what he is saying, and this is no different. Insane flows, sick/fun melodies. A MUST HAVE!!! 
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|I have read many of Lee Childs Jack Reacher books. Yes Tom Cruise is much shorter than the character in the book. But the movie is much better than the book One Shot it is based on. There is much  more action and suspense. Tom  Cruise is a vulnerable Reacher. The acting is superb all around. There is a great chase scene that s not in the book
1451695195|5.0|I liked this book so much that I bought four more and gave them to my friends. Blaw, blaw, blaw.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|My first book on my new Kindle Paperwhite and I enjoyed both the device and the book immensely. I am also glad that I never saw Tom Cruise playing Jack Reacher and that my image of Jack is from the book and not the Silver Screen. Interesting and likable character/ I look forward to #2 and beyond in the series.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I would deffinitely reccomend this. Great story, interesting characters. This is about as good as it gets for me as far as &#34;lawyer shows&#34;
B00AQ71FLK|1.0|wouldn't start on kindle.  Tried turning off kindle and other trouble shooting steps but still would not work.  Would like to try it still.
B001NKI60W|5.0|I can't get enough of this movie, or is it that Meryl Streep does a fabulous job in the starring role.  The music, by ABBA, is as always:  Brilliant.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The game is simple and fun, and is as advertised. The only thing about Temple Run was the in app purchases. Fortunately, the game can be played to the fullest without paying a single dime. I love it!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|this is a nice HO game with a few different twists. puzzles are challenging but fun<br />definitely a good game
B009EE6OGW|5.0|Ridley Scott at his finest.  Tension, fear, isolation.  Excellent film.  Showed this to my wife for the first time, and boy was it fun.  Next, Aliens.
B000FBJHT4|2.0|Apparently Corso wasn't aware of some of the stuff that his &#34;ghost&#34; writer was putting in his book and disagreed with it after the book was already published.  So, the material is questionable at best.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|LOVE this movie. Excellent direction, great story line, even though the songs are Beatles covers, the actors/singers do very well.
0762777931|5.0|This book is easy to read, and SO informative.  If you haven't picked up the idea in the past few years that healthy eating is a key to long healthy life, then you MUST read this.  Where have you been.??????
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|I have been an avid Stryper fan since I was a kid. I actually gave up on expecting a album as great as &#34;To hell with the devil&#34; or &#34;soldiers under command, because I thought those albums were just from a different era. I'm so glad stryper were able to prove me wrong with their greatest release to date. &#34;No more hell to pay&#34; is probably one of the greatest heavy rock albums of all time. I have been listening to &#34;Marching into battle&#34; steady for the past week, butI'm unable to put it on repeat because of all of the other great tracks.
0812973992|5.0|Irish, they have the gift: Beckett, Brehan Swift, Joyce, scores of scores more and now we are gifted Colum MaCann and his \\"Let the Great World Spin.\\"<br /><br />There aren't enough accolades. His writing is lyrical. It's rhythm and pace though 300 and more pages is flawless - a sonnet written in prose. The story defies imagination, is complex yet simple in understanding - a mirror in many respects, a view out in others. For a long book that goes into the soul of its characters, lays the detail of contents out like prunes in a drying shed, it is magnetic and impossible to put down.<br /><br />I do a lot of reading and this novel is high on my list - perhaps on the top. If you like life, its facets, its population and circumstances, suffering into joy and joy into death, you will enjoy this book -  maybe learn from it. Thank You Colum McCann
0062071017|5.0|This book guides senior executives to understand the key meaning and value of being a strategist in this highly turbulent and competitive business environment.<br /><br />The key meaning and value of being a strategist are significant. Without an effective strategist to fare robustly the formulation and implementation of strategic directions, the business could lose its key differentiation in which its diminishing impact on customers and markets as against other direct rivals further weaken its competitiveness.<br /><br />According to Professor Montgomery, a strategist have to possess certain unique criteria. He or she has to understand the industry as well as his or her company. The bold belief widely-adopted by aggressive business leaders that they can utilize best management practices to add value for an acquired company when headwinds are more than tailwinds in the industry might result to unexpected financial fiascos. Moreover, an effective strategist has to identify a purpose for his/her business to answer different thorny but realistic questions such as why it matters to customers in the marketplace. Without a detailed plan to mobilize resources in the value chain with strong leadership skills to generate full employee commitment, the strategist would encounter mounting execution challenges.<br /><br />This book encompasses nuts-and-bolts strategy tools (Five-Force Model, P.27; Strategy Wheel, P.91; SWOT Analysis, P.152) and a useful reference list  (Pp.159-163) highlighting all important books and articles on strategy. Professor Montgomery illustrates success and failure of different strategies through different business cases. For example, Masco and IKEA are both furniture players but the former underestimated the competitive forces in the industry and the latter invented a viable purpose to build its difference in capturing big share of the pie. Domenico De Sole (Former CEO) was more successful than Maurizio Gucci in adopting turnaround strategy for Gucci because he could fill the gap between lofty ideas and action to create a system of value with employee's full commitment. Jobs took nonstop responsibility to lead Apple to launch &#34;creative destruction&#34; products (iTunes, iPod, iPad, iPhone).<br /><br />Nowadays business leaders are expected to cope with the changing and turbulent business landscape. They have to penetrate the &#34;uncertainty of veiled situations to evaluate facts, to clarify the unknown, to make decision rapidly, and then to carry them out with strengths and constancy&#34; (P.139). These ongoing tasks become a prerequisite and foundation of all business leaders to get their businesses right. This book is highly recommended to readers who are interested in having a better understanding of how to be an effective strategist.because he could fill the gap between lofty ideas and action to create a system of value with employee's full commitment.

B00EEPFLHE|5.0|I've been waiting and hoping that these guys would release a full-length project for some time, so I was very pumped when I found out about No More Hell To Pay! This project features the full trademark Stryper sound, with elements of modern rock that make it appealing to rockets of all ages. The songs are crafted beautifully and masterfully and are very well written and catchy. As most of Stryper's music is written by Michael, the same holds true here, and Michael's songwriting skills are demonstrably matured and have reached a higher level of excellence than ever before. Amazingly, Michael's voice can still hit those high notes with ease. You'd never know this is a 50-year-old singing like a 20-something rocker! Can't say it enough, this project is Stryper's best yet!
B00DW1WR14|5.0|some of the best pearl jam has done.  very unique sound and you really get enjoy eddy's voice.  great mix up on songs and long songs. love it!!!
1451648537|5.0|I wanted to read this over and over.  The man is just as I suspected ; wretched, but I wish I had worked with him.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Such a great book.. from the  beginning to the end  th  author keeps you wanting more. You never know what exactly will happen to Victoria but you rooting for  her along the way! This book was a quick read and lib  that I myself can refer to the flower dictionary!
0060736267|4.0|A very moving book that holds up through the years.  I purchased this for my 7th grade twins, since it was on their reading list and I remembered liking it in middle school.  After a friend mentioned that there was inappropriate content, I decided to reread it myself first.  There is overt racism and antisemitism, as well as a sexual assault.  It's not anything I feel my kids could not handle.  But I am glad that I reread the book so that I can field any questions.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I don't give bad reviews like this one. Weather Channel worked great until you upgraded it. I don't like it anymore so will be deleting this app. Most of my family live out of town and I used to be able to read their weather at a glance...now I have to look all over the page to find any of the cities they live in. Am sad to see the older app disappear and replaced by a really bad app.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Another interesting tale of an interesting fictional character. DeMille uses great research to weave a tale of intrigue laced with humor.
1419701533|5.0|What an excellent series.  We bought this for our six-year old, and for a week she wanted to sleep with the books tucked under her arm.  And the funny thing is, when she wanted to read to us, we wanted to hear it!<br /><br />Jeff Kinney's sense of humor is exceptional, and accessible to a six-year-old and her parents at the same time time.  I strongly recommend these for anyone with children.  If you don't have children, your excuse can be that you bought the books for a niece or nephew, but never got around to giving it to them.
0345803507|3.0|Found this third book a letdown.  The first two had romance and mystery.  The third was a cheap, blah, predicatble ending..  I was disappointed.
B00821PCJS|4.0|Love the concept,story line, and the special effects. I'm glad Amazon prime members can watch the past episodes for free.

B005HJWWW8|4.0|Unit helps to boost volume from smartphone and tablet. Does not significantly raise volume but just enough to hear on airplane.
1423101472|5.0|I love this series.  I know its for kids but it is totally entertaining for adults too.  There is so much to learn about Greek history and this series makes learning enjoyable and captivating.  This book especially, even though its the last of this series, it spirals you right into the next series.

B00881VLCE|5.0|This is one of the better jigsaw puzzle apps I've downloaded and played. It has lots of beautiful and fun images to start, and then I find out that for the month of November there's a new free image daily. I really like that the pieces of the puzzle aren't scattered all over the board, that makes it so much better. I play this on my Kindle Fire HD and it plays great. Like I said this is one of the better ones and one of my favorites. I very highly recommend it.

142311339X|5.0|This first book in this series is great as all of the last series by this author.  If you enjoyed learning about Greek history then you will like you learning about Roman history.  It is really different at first when you start this first book but you quickly come to like the characters as well as see some old friends.

B008Z9L8QI|5.0|This is for the deluxe reissue/remaster and the album overall.  Keep in mind, the Pumpkins are one of my 2-3 favorite bands of all time, one I grew up with.<br /><br />The album?  It's still great after 18+ years (man, I feel old typing that).  No, not every track is a home run, but a ton of them are, and there are enough great songs that it's the rare double album that you can't just dump filler and fit all the great songs on one disc.  Billy's voice has been, is, and always will be one of those that you love or hate.  No one can deny his great writing and guitar work though (if you do, well, you're probably not looking at it from an unbiased POV).  Unless you absolutely can't stand Billy's voice, everyone should hear this at least once.  I still love Siamese Dream more, but that's just me; as it is, this is a fantastic album that sometimes doesn't get its due.<br /><br />Now, the remaster: like the others Corgan's done thus far (Gish, Siamese Dream), THIS is how remasters should be done.  No sign of loudness war BS (good lord just listen to Nevermind's \\"remaster\\" to hear how they should NOT be), just going back and carefully adjusting some levels here and there to really make the music sound like it was always intended to.  The bass sounds cleaner and not as distorted (a problem Siamese Dream had at louder volume - again, opinion), the guitars crisper, etc.  Most would have to hear the original immediately before the remaster to notice, but when you do, it's subtle but clear: this is the definitive version.  I must also mention the packaging is gorgeous.  A solid box that includes a booklet with Billy's thoughts on each song and the album in general, full lyrics for the main album, and some nice Mellon Collie art on sturdy (but not thick) cardboard.  While I wish some of the extra tracks weren't reused (ie the songs that appear later on on The Aeroplane Flies High), when taken with what else is included, it's hard to nitpick about.  A few of these even hardcore SP fans (the ones that have every version of the old demos back to 1988/etc, like me) never had clean copies of, and it's great to finally have them.  In summary: if you love this album and/or are a big SP fan, it's WELL worth buying this new version for the remastered core album alone.  The rest is added icing to a great cake.fans (the ones that have every version of the old demos back to 1988/etc, like me) never had clean copies of, and it's great to finally have them.

B008JFUR10|3.0|This movie was unfairly trashed by critics, but neither is it a great sci-fi flick.  The plot is relatively predictable, has a number of plot holes you could drive Godzilla through, but it's still entertains.  Don't regret buying the flick.

B0045HCJ9E|5.0|Cary Grant at his most debonair, Hitchcock at his best.  Two of Hollywood's best combine to bring us pure magic.  No matter how many times i have watched this film I still enjoy it.  Now I own it and can watch it at my leisure.
B00004S6GL|5.0|It perhaps came together the best musically for any of Elliott Smith's albums on Figure 8.<br /><br />I like this as Smith's best, slightly better than Basement, which is great, but involving more lysergic submersion compared Figure 8's more instrumental, in it's symphonic song tendencies. A fav. album of mine.<br /><br />This album has an lasting palpable excitment to it, of someone just hitting their full vista of musical potentials, & it has a slight edge in the discipline involved in the music to that - it's not neccesarily the sound of someone making the best thing they ever would or could, but more of someone finally getting to harness the peak of their full palette of great possibilities.<br /><br />Also this is the last 'whole' Elliott Smith album, Basement release is a good reflection of it's circumstances and Elliott music in different ways, but it doesn't have the cohesiveness of Figure 8 as a 'sound & vibe'; Figure 8 being a yin & yang whole to Basement's willfully drifting wonderment of extremes.<br /><br />I also really like the production on this album, it's very beatlesque with a modern sensibility, & i like the cleaner brighter sound combining with the more instrumental song approach. I previously had the Plain's re-issue, & while i still liked the brighter sound, it was a lot more brighter & 'Rock', than the original mix on the initial bong load release, which still has the brighter sound to it but it is a mellower & different mix of it it seems to me, not being so 'rock' or forward & just slightly better all round.<br /><br />This review is for a vinyl version.
B005ILWOZA|5.0|Quick delivery and I truly love this CD.  It is a combination of where he is heading and it is all good!  Very satisfied.

B0094BB4TW|2.0|The Facebook app on my phone will never give me the most recent (the time it was posted in order). I refresh constantly and nothing updates. I always get old posts, several hours to days ago on this app. I've even updated my phone to no avail.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is a good game. But it lags with Facebook sometimes. Other then that no complaints here, I can say I am addicted
B00ANA27IU|4.0|A classic, of course. Not much I can say. More of the plot is made clear in the book than what I remember in the movie. That much is usually true whenever a book is the source document. Enjoyed it.<br /><br />Enjoyed the prologue about writing the book and making the movie-- kind of behind the scenes look for a hollywood outsider. Interesting collaboration between the author and the director.
B00GDFVTZQ|5.0|Great game,  loved the first Rayman and have been waiting for this release.  Bought it here because the Play Store says its not compatible with my device.  It runs great on my Note 3 so it's a mistake on account of the Play Store so Amazon gets my money this round.
B00EEPFOH6|4.0|Place Vendome return with their third album of melodic hard rock featuring the distinct and powerful vocals of Michael Kiske. Produced by Dennis Ward who does lots of work for Frontiers Records, Thunder In The Distance is true to the established Place Vendome style and sound. The music is simply hook driven European style rock with lots of big guitar solos and soaring melodies. Songs were written by a number of notable melodic rock writers including Alessandro Del Vecchio (Lionville), Tommy Denander (Radioactive), and Magnus Karlsson (Primal Fear). The performances from all band members are strong and the sound of the album is massive. Highlights include the brilliant melodies of \\"Lost In Paradise\\", the memorable chorus and lyrical sentiment of \\"Hold Your Love\\", the epic hard rock sound of \\"My Heart Is Dying\\", and the melodic power ballad \\"Maybe Tomorrow\\". Despite the fact that Thunder In The Distance doesn't really offer up anything innovative, it is a very good melodic rock album that is easily recommended to fans of this style of music and represents a strong addition the discography of one of the best bands in this genre.
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|Good movie, move slow in some parts of the movie, but good movie. I enjoyed it and recommend it if you are a tom cruise fan.
B00BWQW73E|5.0|The Everything Store is great fun for those of us who send Amazon most of our disposable income. We get a look at the corporate offices, the warehouses, the business deals, and the other businesses also owned by Amazon -- but, for me, the real treat was getting a glimpse of the way Jeff Bezos approaches his challenges. I love his way of turning the conventional wisdom on its head, his willingness to let his creation be misunderstood, and his eternal patience. Stone did an admirable job of telling this tale at a rapid pace, while also providing lots of fascinating information. He made it look easy, but I doubt it was.
B000067IZ3|5.0|Cheap and it was great quality. i enjoyed the movie and it was a really good price when i bought it

B00CWY76CC|4.0|Much of the escape game landscape relies on arbitrary poorly thought out devices in place of actual challenge. It always burns me to discover that the solution in level 8 requires you break a window and cut a hole in the wallpaper when there have been three previous levels all with magically unbreakable windows. I found every level in can you escape solvable. The two times I had to look something up online I discovered it was legitimately something I had missed.<br /><br />it could use a bit more depth but I am looking forward to them releasing more content.<br /><br />Quite fun possibly the best escape game I have played since Riven.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|Ok so I understand why the readers are upset... I read the ending too, but instead of lashing out when the book is over take the time to really think about why Veronica Roth did that.<br />*****SPOILERS*****<br /><br />Tris died, no sacrificed herself for her brother and the greater good. Think about it, would Caleb actually save the day? No only Tris was capable of such bravery. For this character I think that her ending was beautiful and it made me proud. Roth did an excellent job of completing Tris's story. She finally understood what it means to truly sacrifice yourself, with only love in your heart and no guilt. If you think about it Tris almost dies in the first two on her own accords, but this time she did it right and for the right reasons.<br /><br />Now the book doesn't end there. Will still have Tobias's ending, which just left me heart broken especially during the memory serum scene at his house. This ending was realistic and well thought out. I admit how easily Evelyn choose Tobias was a little wishy washy. But that is only a little part of the story.<br /><br />The other characters grew as well. I'm glad Peter took the memory serum and left he was a Dick. Tobias and Christina learned that they can mend themselves and that in itself is bravery. Mathew, Cara, and Caleb took what they witnessed and evolved themselves into better people.<br /><br />The war is over. Now that is a happy ending, Chicago is just a city again and that is cool to know that Tris did die for her home and the people she loved. The epilogue was so bittersweet and I enjoyed every minute of it. Roth stuck true to her characters and herself. I believe that she ended this her way and not just for a plot twist.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book from beganning to end, it made me weep, laugh, and happy. Roth has truly taught us what each value is. I'm just sad that this is the end. The others reviewers are just in the shock state of no happy ending and I was there but you had to know it was coming while Tris was with Tobias for the last time. In a way I think that Tris's death helped Tobias grow and to see the world how she saw it, beautiful for all it's flaws.<br /><br />Such an epic ending for an epic book. These three books were my favorite and still are and will always be.

B000JLSM00|5.0|I won't comment on the greatness of the film, of Ford, or of Wayne's best performance ever.  My comment is on the idea of Blu-Ray use for classic films.  My first thought was, &#34;Why have a video medium that is higher resolution than the original material?&#34;  So I didn't understand the WHY of Casablanca in Blu-Ray.  To me it didn't look better than my DVD.  BUT the Searchers is a different matter.  The restoration of the VistaVision film is gorgeous and Blu-Ray is the right medium to show just how gorgeous it is.  I live in Utah; I've been to Monument Valley.  The pictures I took aren't as good as the pictures John Ford caused to be taken over 50 years ago.  I was 12 when this movie played in local theaters.  Memory fades, but I don't really remember ANY film looking as good in first-run as Blu-Ray looks on my projected 96&#34; screen.  The best picture in town is no longer &#34;out there&#34;  -- it's right here.  There is a reason to own Blu-Ray versions of those pre-1960's movies -- you get as close as can be gotten to the original source.

B00F8KIJ2I|2.0|First things first: I was a fan of Avril's when Complicated first came out on the radio, even before its music video debuted on MTV.  I enjoyed her first album, and when Under My Skin came out, I was impressed by how she had grown as a maturing songwriter, despite her young age.  Unfortunately, her sophomore album was her peak, and ever since then it's been a pretty steady descent into generic brat-pop, the type of music that would be acceptable if she were still a teenager, but she's not (Goodbye Lullaby caused a slight hiccup in the decline, and looked like she might have been heading in the right direction, which was why I was eager to hear what this newest album would bring about).<br />Unfortunately, not even the contributions from Chad Kroeger could help sell this album as a whole (although I will admit that his duet with her is one of the better tracks).<br />I will continue to be hopeful, and when Avril puts out a new album, I'll definitely sample it, but I've come to accept that I probably won't be seeing anything close to Under My Skin's work anytime soon.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun and entertaining. Easy to learn and lots of levels to try. This has been a lot of fun to have.

B00F6Y3FKW|5.0|This is a monumental collection of all Dylan's non-bootleg albums and \\"side-tracks\\" which don't appear on the albums, over 47 CDs.  It's all here, from 1962's Bob Dylan to 2012's The Tempest.  It's a mighty body of some of the finest songs of the last half-century which formed the soundtrack to the lives of millions of people and defined the adolescence of many of us.  I haven't always liked everything the man has done (it would be surprising if I did over this long and with this many albums to his credit) but the vast majority of his work is excellent and I think that there are works of genuine genius here - and I don't say that lightly.<br /><br />But then, Dylan's music needs no review from me.  What is worth saying is that this is an excellent collection, with each album presented as a mini-LP and, although it's a substantial investment, it works out at less than four dollars per disc.  It's a cracker of a box, and I thought a full list of contents might be helpful, so I've listed them below.<br /><br />Studio albums<br />Bob Dylan (1962)<br />The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan (1963)<br />The Times They Are a-Changin' (1964)<br />Another Side of Bob Dylan (1964)<br />Bringing It All Back Home (1965)<br />Highway 61 Revisited (1965)<br />Blonde on Blonde (1966)<br />John Wesley Harding (1967)<br />Nashville Skyline (1969)<br />Self Portrait (1970)<br />New Morning (1970)<br />Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid (1973)<br />Dylan (1973)<br />Planet Waves (1974)<br />Blood on the Tracks (1975)<br />The Basement Tapes (1975)<br />Desire (1976)<br />Street Legal (1978)<br />Slow Train Coming (1979)<br />Saved (1980)<br />Shot of Love (1981)<br />Infidels (1983)<br />Empire Burlesque (1985)<br />Knocked Out Loaded (1986)<br />Down in the Groove (1988)<br />Oh Mercy (1989)<br />Under the Red Sky (1990)<br />Good as I Been to You (1992)<br />World Gone Wrong (1993)<br />Time Out of Mind (1997)<br />Love and Theft (2001)<br />Modern Times (2006)<br />Together Through Life (2009)<br />Christmas in the Heart (2009)<br />Tempest (2012)<br /><br />Live albums:<br />Before the Flood (1972)<br />Hard Rain (1976)<br />Bob Dylan at Budokan (1979)<br />Real Live (1984)<br />Dylan & the Dead (1989)<br />MTV Unplugged (1995)<br /><br />Side Tracks:<br />1.

1616614609|5.0|ANR is best described as a mix of poker and trading card games. However because of the LCG model there is no rarity in cards, making the game much more approachable financially.<br /><br />ANR is an asymmetric game. There are two major flavors in the game, Corporations who bluff and play a information warfare game and the Runners who have to call the Corporations bluff and risk losing.<br /><br />The two sides are the Corporations and Runners. The major objectives of the game is to grab 7 points worth of Agendas (or Agenda points). Alternative ways to win are: Corporations can flatline runners by forcing the Runner to discard cards from their hand until they cannot, and Runners can 'mill' a Corporations deck until they cannot draw anymore cards.<br /><br />Each side gets a certain amount of action per turn, called clicks. These are used to perform all tasks in the game, thus making the game about being most efficient with clicks.<br /><br />The biggest thing to note about the Corporation is that all cards that they play are face down, and they can decide to rez (reveal and put into action) immediately or at an opportune time. Corporations develop servers, with upgrades and assets. These servers are protected with Ice which hurt the Runner and act as security measures to Runner intrusion. Corporations are also on a time crunch, because once they cannot draw anymore cards, they effectively lose the game.<br /><br />Runners as indicated by the name run against the Corporation servers. Runners have to do a Risk-Reward analysis upon the servers to run and quickly build up their programs, hardware, and resources to allow them to be as effective at running as possible. This is made easier by the fact that most player interactions are caused because of the Runner deciding to run.<br /><br />Other major elements within the game are: Credits, Tags (one of the only ways that Corporation can directly attack and opponent on their turn), Bad Publicity, and Brain Damage (reduces Runner handsize). These and a few more concepts are best learned in game.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I'm not a fantasy fan but I found this book to be interesting from beginning to end.  I'm glad I read it.  Well worth discovering a new genre for me to read.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This thing is great so far. I'm using a macbook and i-phone to stream things. Couple of draw-backs for apple users right now: You can't cast the hulu app currently from the i-phone. I have also had some connection issues when casting chrome from my mac-book. However, this is still a relatively new product and they're working out the kinks. I trust google to figure out some of the issues and grant wider access to other streaming app's down the line...for the price, it's been well worth it compared to the other options.

B005IZLPMY|4.0|Went to see it in the theater when it came out.  Really liked it and ended up buying it to add to my collection.  Great movie.
B00BATG18K|5.0|This book gave me a greater understanding of Chinese culture at the turn of the century and women's roles in the life of men.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|Just as good as I expected. Funny moments, hilarious drawings and an uncanny ability to tell a story.  The dogs make me giggle every time I read about them or see a drawing as I too have a &#34;special&#34; dog.
006202406X|1.0|What a disaster from start to finish. Allegiant was one of my most highly anticipated books of 2013 that ended up being the most disappointing. What was Roth thinking? The personalities of the main character were distractingly altered, the focus of the series was COMPLETELY different, random supporting characters were killed off, and that god AWFUL ending.<br /><br />First of all, I was interested to see exactly what was outside the fence. But once the revelation had arrived, I was completely dumbfounded. I felt like I was reading something out of a twilight zone episode. I mean come on -government conspiracies, a segregated society based on DNA, big brother societal experiments? WHAT was Veronica Roth smoking when she created this direction of story?<br /><br />About 80% of this book was playing catch-up to this newly found world that Tris and the others found themselves in. It was such a chore trying to clamor passed all of the details about what is actually going on that by the end I just didn't care anymore. I mean it completely negates everything that we read in the first two books. Hell, even Tobias mentioned how incredibly pointless all of it seems now that they know the \\"truth\\".<br /><br />Speaking of Tobias, when did he become a prissy little mamma's boy? What happened to the focused leader that we (the readers) grew to love? Instead, we get a guy who walks around lost in a fog, trusting random people who he has no affiliations with, and getting into fights with Tris over trivial high-school drama. Tris was even worst and I had ZERO respect for the character by the end. Even Evelyn who was the renounced enemy had some kind of epiphany about family, resulting in a hallmark moment worthy of a lifetime movie.<br /><br />As we have all seen from the previous books, Roth is not afraid of killing off characters. But in Allegiant, she offs so many of the few characters she has left that I begin to wonder if she just does it because she has no clue how to include them in this new story. Not that there is any room for more characters anyways since she keeps introducing new ones who I couldn't care less about. When I came to the end and found out she had killed yet ANOTHER character, in one of the most unnecessary deaths I have ever read in any book, I wanted to throw this across the room.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I bought it because the headphone port on my computer is awful, I have to turn the volume to 100% to get a hear-able sound. It was absolutely perfect for this, with it I have a regular volume adjustment range and much better quality. Great for online gaming where hearing other players/the game is important.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I don't get the love.  This game wants to control you and wants your money.  I am baffled that so many people play this game and post about it on Facebook and ask for &#34;lives&#34; or pay to continue.  Why does this game need you to tell others what you do in your spare time.  Ridiculous.<br /><br />Try Candy Deluxe Pro.  It is so much better and there are no stupid rules.
B005LAIGNC|4.0|Awesome movie.  Definitely a keeper!  Fell in love with it the first time I saw it.  Ended up watching it twice.
B00FG1Q5J8|5.0|I absolutely love this game. It's fun, it doesn't cheat me out of money and has a great sense of humor. However, my kindle fire crashes when I try to get my new ship. Please fix this problem as I would love to continue my game.

1401223176|2.0|This review is spoiler-free for anyone who has not read Hush.<br /><br />I understand that Jeph Loeb is widely lauded amongst Batman fans and is considered to have written many of the best Batman stories. However, having read a number of his works, the impression with which I come away is that they're actually not *good*. His style is consistent from story to story, which would be admirable in other circumstances, but the stories are convoluted without depth and at the same time predictable, which loses any luster after a first read.<br /><br />This is especially true of Hush. From the beginning you're sure you know Hush's identity but early on through some spoilery means your suspect is no longer a suspect which, admittedly, lends some interest to the story. Then, at the end, when you find out you were right all along, the reveal is nothing but inflammatory to realize you were fooled with a cheap cliche parlor trick and Loeb's attempt to pull the wool over your eyes is insulting. As a reader, especially with Loeb's perceived prestige, one gives the writer the benefit of a doubt and assumes early on that he would not resort to such tactics, and you're left feeling violated and that you've been taken advantage of when all is said and done. This is further compounded when Hush's ultimate motivation for stalking Batman is revealed, which is ludicrously juvenile and unbelievable and still yet diminishes the impact of the overall story.<br /><br />There's a fun moment at the end between Batman and the Riddler in which Batman proves his intellectual superiority but this is a small denouement that adds nothing to the story. This cements the point that Loeb's style seems to consist of throwing every possible member of Batman's rogues gallery in regardless of need, the inclusion of whom in tangential throwaway roles is nothing but unjustified fan service, with an internal bonus to provide the artist with a change of scenery so as to not get bored (see: The Long Halloween and Dark Victory). They are not necessary. They're filler for an otherwise bland and empty story.<br /><br />Read it if you must, but expect nothing exceptional. If you're not a die-hard Batman fan don't bother.Dark Victory). They are not necessary.

B009MYAQOA|4.0|I really enjoyed the annotated version for the Kindle.  I used the information given about the architectural designs but I also enjoyed being able to go to the internet to look at the different houses and buildings.  I did find it to be a sad story.
B000FC1IPO|1.0|As a mother of 3 little ones, I read to escape.  This was no escape.  It was an exhausting account of the minutiae of parenting.
B004VSTP4Y|5.0|Totally read this. Sam and Grace's relationship is a <3. Very romantic. Very poetic. I will FOREVER remember this wonderful book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fabulous!  Challenging game that is easy enough to play but not so easy to get to the next level once you get to the three digit levels.  However,  the easy levels are fun and quick, and the harder levels make you think ahead and plan a big more.  Watch out for the bombs!  So happy Candy Crush Saga is now available for my Kindle Fire.  Now I can play twice as much.
1451688091|5.0|Great research went into book and made Me feel at times I was &#34;walking in Lincolns shoes&#34;. It brought to Light the misunderstanding I had over the years, in realizing that the civil war wasn't just about Slavery. There were many more issues at hand. It enlightened Me and saddened Me to see our country so divided. Great book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very interesting game.  My son enjoys the differenct characters.  This is a challenging game with different levels.  A must for kids.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|I really liked this book! Although I do have one small critic. I was excited about the topic, specially since I thought it was very different from the other books this author has written, not that I didnt like those, but it was hoping for something new. It did accomplish this for the first half of the book, so I was not disappointed. The second half deviates a little bit from the main topic in my opinion, but the good thing is that it's also good.
B00CRGZMUI|3.0|Nice to have Bridget back, but one would think that in some aspects, she would be a bit more mature at the age of 51.
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|The movie was ok. It was a good love story. Its about the book with little twists and spins. I feel you would have to enjoy the book enough to watch the movie. It was good and I always enjoy Leonardo Dicaprio movies, but it wasn't amazing in my opinion.
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|Similar to the original, but that is not a bad thing.  New baddies and upgraded towers make this game fresh.  Highly recommend.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Great piece of &#34;Classic King style&#34; of fiction. I wouldn't recommend reading it when you go to bed,  because you must be very attentive or you'll lose track of the shift in events. I had to re-read portions of it to bring myself up to date with events that were current. Good book if your a &#34;KING&#34; fan or &#34;loyalist&#34;.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My son loves this game.  Eye and hand coordination a plus.  The graphics are superb.  A lesson learned.....don't do graffitti on the walls.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|If you're thinking about purchasing a Google Chromecast, make your purchase today as this is my 3rd Chromecast that I purchased - One for every TV as it is a must have product. You can't beat $35 and stream most of your favorite content. I have my power cable plugged into the outlet instead to the USB port on the TV as this allows me to turn my TV on once I hit the CAST button on my phone/laptop.<br /><br />I also had multiple people at my house all casting content from youtube to my TV to listen to favorite music videos and such. A must have.

B0053O89JM|3.0|As a hard-core House fans, I have no choice but to buy it. Do I like the ending? Hardly satisfied. Am I disappointed? You bet! However, I'm glad that it is finally ended. All in all it is a great show with great writing on humanity. Very first few seasons brought up a lot of great questions for me to think about life and human relationships. I would say it's an intriguing and yet entertaining drama.

He is always smelling her hair. The authors vocabulary use is limited, I got tired of the same words and saying over and over again. I just finished this book and all this went on within 1 - 2 months. I am too through.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|ALLEGIANT brings the Divergent Trilogy to completion with surprising conclusions for each beloved character.  The surprises continue to both delight and sadden the reader. The gambit of raw emotions is both exciting and frightening. The ending will catch you off guard, and will make you love or hate the author. Either way, Veronica Roth has captured my interest with her bravery and dauntlessness!
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|I was eagerly anticipating this new record and all I have to say is wow!  From the opening notes of Revelation through the entire record, these guys deliver the goods.  For those people who reject the Christianity behind this band you are entitled to your own opinion.  However, I asked that you listen to the music because if you like all things hard rock and heavy metal this album measures up!  It is heavy, melodic and it flat out rocks.  Don't take my word for it.  Go get it and I guarantee you it will be in your CD rotation for some time to come.

0316187208|5.0|Abercrombie is writing fantasy like almost no one else today, deservedly rubbing shoulders with the likes of GRRM.  In fact, given how Joe has honed his craft with each installment (not to mention his speed of publication), this may soon supplant ASOIAF as my favorite fantasy (quasi) series.<br /><br />The story is engaging, but it's almost beside the point.  Abercrombie does a wonderful job writing vibrant, colorful, and unique characters, and after 500 pages, I still didn't want to leave their sides.  He's also the best dialogue writer in the biz (an area where fantasy works traditionally struggle), and I'd highly recommend the audio editions of any of his books for this reason alone.<br /><br />What's not to like?  There's blood, there's grit, there's heroism, there's cowardice, there's double-crossing, there's lots of foul language, all set against a backdrop that Abercrombie set up in his previous novels, making the world feel deep, complex, and real.<br /><br />Loved it. Can't wait for the next one.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Good read and a nice change from his other books, but very thrilling and keeping my interest. A must read!
B00005UW2B|5.0|The individual reviews of symphonies 4, 5, 6, 9, 10 and 15 listed below, being the most familiar along with 1 and 8, are intended to give specific responses to those key works as a guide as to what to expect from the whole set.<br /><br />Readers will also note that there are several reviewers of the whole set that have awarded a full five stars but within more general terms of reference.<br /><br />By using both this and the other reviews, readers should be able to obtain a pretty clear idea of the whole set on offer.<br /><br />.........................................<br /><br />Symphony 4<br /><br />This disc, well recorded in 1996, was bought as a sampler of the complete set having so far not found a fully satisfying version of this symphony. Barshai comes as close as any of the others and closer than many others that I have tried.<br /><br />The performance could be described as being played 'straight' without any distortions of tempo. Points are not made aggressively and the music, which is certainly a powerful piece of writing, is allowed to communicate on its own terms. The playing of the orchestra is of a particularly high standard and is compelling as is Barshai's own vision of the work.<br /><br />In general terms the tempi are kept on the move and the symphony does not suffer from any lapses of tension. The tempi of the fugal section for the strings in the first movement for example can only be described as hair-raisingly fast and, given the virtuosity of the string section, the result is gripping to say the least! Barshai brings to this score a personal knowledge of the composer and that added understanding comes over with authority.<br /><br />This joins the Jarvi, Jansons (only when played at an increased playback level as it is cut very low) and a Gergiev BBC 'live proms' recording (not the Philips disc) as the most successful that I have heard so far.<br /><br />I would suggest that the box set is likely to be even more attractive than this single disc if this is typical of the whole set.<br /><br />.........................................<br /><br />Symphonies 5 and 6<br /><br />This pair of recordings, made in 1995 -1996, offer good honest sound consistent with their age and 'live' performances. The sixth is very good sound indeed, thoroughly involving with considerable 'presence.' The fifth is also good although although the rhythmical piano part in the first movement seems odd texturally. On the other hand, the plucked strings heard elsewhere are remarkably realistic. Overall the recorded sound is no good reason to reject these performances.<br /><br />The tendency for Barshai to press on with generally fast tempi is not the case in either of these symphonies. I would describe the tempi as being very main-stream. Barshai takes a severe line with the climatic points and is able to then release the tension resolving it to passages of considerable beauty.<br /><br />An example would be the first movement climax of the fifth symphony which reaches an almost crushing peak of tension to be followed by the extreme opposite with the pair of solo flutes. The second movement adopts a perfect tempo and the Mahler influence is easy to detect in the woodwind writing in this movement. The Largo is sublime but rises once more to a significant climax and the last movement, ending at a crushingly slow tempo as found in Sanderling for example, leaves one in no doubt that any triumph here is utterly shallow.<br /><br />The end of the fifth symphony was described by the composer as follows: 'I think it is clear to everyone what happens in the fifth .... It's as if someone were beating you with a stick and saying \\"Your business is rejoicing, your business is rejoicing\\" and you rise, shakily, and go off muttering \\"Our business is rejoicing, our business is rejoicing\\".'<br /><br />Barshai gets this across with crushing authority.<br /><br />The sixth symphony is arguably the best version I have heard. The first movement towersover the rest but, instead of being lightweight continuations, Barshai makes sure that the tension is maintained in the last two movements with a driven and desperate approach which makes the link with the fifth clear and aware that here too is a political message in code. This is an astonishing concept and delivery and makes other performances seem neat and trivial by contrast.<br /><br />This is a fine disc and well worth searching out for those who do not wish to buy the whole set.<br /><br />............................................<br /><br />Symphonies 9 and 10<br /><br />This pair of performances from 1995 and 1996 are seemingly typical of Barshai's approach to many of these symphonies in so far as he favours generally faster speeds than many coupled with tight articulation and combined with an urgency that marks his performances out from the rest.<br /><br />In this case the ninth symphony is taken at some very fast speeds indeed. The three faster movements, 1, 3 and 5, especially requiring some virtuosity from his stalwart orchestra. The third movement in particular practically flies. However, these are far from lightweight performances as the crisp articulation and tight rhythmical control lends a sense of urgency, even desperation, to this often performed as lightweight symphony. It is often forgotten that this symphony also got Shostakovich in trouble with the censors who totally disapproved of its content and mood.<br /><br />The sense of urgency continues with the tenth symphony, one of his greatest achievements in this field. In this case tempi are not far from the norm so the added sense of urgency comes as somewhat surprising as that effect is achieved through phrasing and articulation rather than through speed. The short second movement has the perfect pace and the second section featuring the 'dies irae' theme sustains the tension without any sense of lost impact or dramatic impact resulting from marginally too slow a tempo.<br /><br />Only the slow third movement could be thought of lacking in urgency, its emptiness instead rising to implied threat at the climax before subsiding. The fourth movement, by contrast, starts off in a very jaunty manner. However, this is transformed at the mid point after the slow central section. The return to the first subject's faster speed for the final section is taken more deliberately than when first heard and any sense of jauntiness is dispelled as the final bars are approached with the more normal sense of building excitement.<br /><br />These are impressive and compelling readings which throw a different light on the works and which presumably reflect Barshai's responses in having personal knowledge of the composer. His view should not be lightly dismissed by those not having lived at the same time and place as Shostakovich.<br /><br />...................................<br /><br />Symphony 15<br /><br />This is a well recorded performance made in 1998 and which differs markedly from many of the alternatives. At this point it should be mentioned that Barshai knew Shostakovich well and that knowledge and experience should not be discounted when considering this alternative view.<br /><br />Essentially Barshai takes a far fleeter view of the work than many of the other conductors and this has an effect on the character of the piece. The climaxes are arrived at speedily with insistence. There is an air of the sort of desperation felt by someone in a hurry and who has no time to waste. This is absolutely not the same as some of the slower and heavier approaches which suggest the weight of autocratic authority bearing down remorselessly.<br /><br />Thus the contrast between Barshai's driven, incisive but lighter weight climaxes towards the ends of the second and fourth movements are then followed by the ticking idea which has an emptiness resulting from the lack of drive. This is at least as effective as the emptiness felt after a weighty and overbearing climax as in other performances.<br /><br />Shostakovich made significant but largely unexplained references to Wagner (Siegfried's death) as well as to his own personal motif, DSCH, which regularly features in his other works. The Rossini quote in the first movement is also unexplained but the composer did comment that the movement should be played as in a toy shop. Maybe he had in mind a puppet's as in Coppelia or Petrushka where the puppets are manipulated by other unseen hands. It should be remembered that William Tell was also a successful revolutionary.<br /><br />I found this to be a thought provoking, perceptive and satisfying reading, both well played and recorded, which provides illumination on an otherwise unexplained enigma of a composition. It has an aura of authority about it which should not be ignored. It therefore deserves to be considered seriously and is well worth adding to collections on that basis. Much the same can be said of the incisively driven Barshai readings of symphonies 4, 5, 6, 9, 10 which I have bought separately from the boxed edition and which show another way to illustrate the composer's despair or desperation.ery jaunty manner.

B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game has got me hooked on to it. Love playing such a fun game. Can't put it down ever. Hate when I have to leave it all day. Love this game. It's very addicting
B005JABSB6|5.0|Good... works well as specified by the manufacturer. easy, light and no issues at all. I recommend this product to anyone with a Sharp 3D tv
1451627297|5.0|Just when I think King was washed up, he comes out with a masterpiece like this.  King knows how to bring out the humanity and realness in characters like few others.  He rarely paints characters in black and white and this is no different.  Although some horrible things occur, this isn't a horror novel, and though there is time travel, this isn't a science fiction story, it doesn't even revolve much around the JFK assassination for most of the story, that is mostly a side note.  More than anything else this is a love story and a very poignant and bitter-sweet one.  While many people won't care for the slow pace and sparse action, I enjoyed the story for it's beautiful character portrayals.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Excited to have this for the kindle fire. Its nice as there doesnt seem to be any lag yet. Great game.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I finished the book earlier today and have been thinking a lot about how I would rate it,  I made the mistake at glancing at the star ratings when I bought it so I was nervous the whole time.  I didn't read any spoilers but I found myself thinking of ways the story could turn to make me hate it and want to give it a terrible rating.<br /><br />In the end I was torn.  I was relieved because my mind kept wandering to a storyline where all of their memories are wiped and they don't know each other which was terrifying to me.  I was happy to have received a lot of answers to questions I had at the end of the second book.  I loved the first two and read them so fast!  In the end I think my main conclusion is that the book should have either been much longer, or it should have been made into two full novels with more character development and more thought.  I know some authors have a vision and they sometimes leave details out because they know them so why would it need to be explained.  But for readers we have to be given the full insight of the author.  There were so many parts that were never fully re-visited.  Like Tris' visit to the fringe, if you're going to make the main character emotional about that, then why not bring that into the story more?  If the Bureau was being kept in check by the government, how did nothing happen when their memories were erased.  I kind of understand but I felt like she left a lot out to condense it into a smaller book.  Overall I liked the story for the answers but I wanted more.<br /><br />I was happy that Tris and Tobias got over the issues and were happy together for at least a little while.  Really I just felt like it could have been so much more and that's why I feel let down.  I will read them again someday and I will go see the movie this spring mainly because the first book was so amazing.  I wouldn't tell anyone not to read this book because you need to finish the series, but be prepared.
B00D8CSVLW|5.0|Couldn't put this book down.  Begun to suspect the outcome towards the end of the book but well worth reading.  Glad Justice was served.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|This game was so relaxing and very enjoyable. Flower epesically put me at ease and made me feel like i was lost in another world. I would recommend for anyone of any age
0375869026|5.0|I think 5 stars are not enough for this masterpiece.<br />I am the parent of 3 children ranging from 11 to 4 year of age and I learn a lot from it.<br />My kids suggested that I read it because they loved it so much.<br />It is the story of August 5th grade year, a kids with disabilities and a great heart.<br />The story is told by August and the people around him, his sister and the kids at school.<br />I was amazed to discover how complex and deep is the world of our kids, and because they are small in size it does not mean they do not have a great heart. Nobody is only good or only bad, we all have mixed feelings. We all want to be loved and love but we are also afraid to love. You will learn so much about your kids world and emotions, or at least I did.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Great story. I really enjoyed the story line and the characters. I didn't like the curse words.  There were only a few so they weren't too distracting.<br />Looking forward to reading the next book in the series.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Awesome book! Written beautifully and unpredictable story.  You really get to know the characters and thoughts change from beginning to end.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|These Toy story blu-rays and cases are in very good quality. My son and I are enjoying them very much.
B00F8MI9NK|4.0|A wonderful sequel to a wonderful movie. A beautiful movie showcasing Pixar's at its best.  I loved every minute of it!
B000J5XS3C|5.0|Great Mixer with a ton of capability great if you are mobile dj or just running a simple audio setup.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is an easy app to use.  The buttons are large enough for middle-aged eyes to see.  I expect to use the Calculator on my kindle often.
B004IK8PLE|5.0|A thorough description of the history of ciphers and codes. Fascinating! And leads well into a book on the technology of WW II in Britain, by R. V. Jones, Most Secret War, and then on to the books about William Stephenson (especially The Read Intrepid) and about Camp X in Canada. Splendid read!
B00A7YZ1KI|3.0|It really does seem as though it was written by a ghost writer, however I'm just happy to have some closure on the series
B008P1EWIM|5.0|This is one of the better weather apps I've found. The view in landscape orientation could be improved but that is a small thing.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this is one of the most fun games I have ever played. it is mind numbing and time consuming, just what I need.
B007IK44CK|5.0|Action packed all the way through and great special effects. Right up there with one to have in CD library.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book was truly enjoyable. The first time in quite awhile that I did not want to put a book down and move on to something else.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The beginning of the book was really capturing, however the the second half of the book was quite disappointing - too many characters and I didn´t really understand why stories about some of the characters were included in the book. Also the end was very weak, I expected much more from such crafted stroyteller. All in all, this is his weakest book.
B00B5C0YOO|3.0|This seems like a good program for what it does as it does do the<br />job of backing up your apps, but for me being a kindle User I don't<br />really need it as all my programs apk files are already backed up<br />in the amazon clouds. What I really need is a way to back up  my<br />saved game data so I can restore it in case of loss.<br />I could use it as a backup of a backup just in case but then theirs<br />the problem of the extremely low amount of storage space avail<br />able on the kindle fire 2nd edition.  That being only 5.5 GB. Way<br />back when that may have seemed to be alot and you would think<br />since most apk files are fairly small you could get quite a bit squeezed into 5.5 GB, but once you include the data that comes<br />along with running them (especially large apps)  5.5 gb is nothing.<br />So what I REALLY WANT/NEED as a kindle user is MORE storage<br />space/memory so i can keep more apps/data on here at once.<br />Maybe add a memory card slot, so we can up the storage space<br />ourselves.<br /><br />zm....
B0064W65SO|4.0|Great story that adds to the Batman lore.  The artwork gives it a vintage feel without being overdone.  It is a bit short though.
B000X107GI|3.0|They are cheap, but the charge does not last too long. I don't know why, perhaps it was a bad batch.
B000ID37SQ|1.0|All sidekicks and sight gags, with little story cohesion or purpose. The concept is inane, and the execution is manic and unoriginal. Fancifully bloody yet flavorless, it provides perfunctory amusement for very young viewers.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This timely book told the story of a brilliant middle aged woman who develops early onset Alzheimer's Disease.  Her battle with the disease and it's effects on her family and career are well told.  We used this book for our Book Club and the discussion was very lively.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I is a really good game if you focus on one thing at a time. I also think that if you play this game you should connect to Facebook and then you friends can help with what ever. I think there should be more life's.
B00EKQ3YZI|3.0|As usual remixers have taken songs that were hits and turned them into generic thumping bores.  Having been a club d.j. during the Donna Summer years, it was not only her vocals but he tracks themselves which made them hits.  The people who remixed Donna's songs should have taken into account that the melody should have remained the same but enhanced by today's technology.  Instead they took Donna's lyrics and placed them acappella to mindless beat tracks which takes away the charm and fun these songs were to listen and dance to.  Today's dance music is more mindless than it was during Donna Summer's heyday, and if the remixers wanted to bring it up to date, they did so and made her precious songs into a mindless mess.<br />Remember Donna Summer from her music as it was, fun, full of her beautiful rich vocals which always told a story.
B00DYFCYSO|5.0|Amazing I loved this cd. Before this purchase I had listened to a few of John Legend's songs but I am a FAN now. Great sound.
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|It is a bit slow when ending an old game and starting a new one.  But the graphics are nice to watch once.  Otherwise the program is easy to use and fun.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|excellent price - happened to be by a radio shack and they wanted $7 for 1 of these batteries.  Granted it was a better brand but who cares, even if they only last 1 year it's still not a bad deal
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|i just cant stop! each level draws you in. I would give it 5 stars if it stops stealing my extra lives right when i need it.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The love story between Ana and Christian continues to unfold.  The transformation is wonderful.  With everything that is going on, it is difficult to believe we are looking at mere weeks.
B000RLH2VM|5.0|Directed by the late John Frankenheimer this is how a movie should be made. I can't get enough of Ronin it has everything. An intriguing plot, exellent cast, action scenes galore, including a mind blowing car chase, and political intrigue. Five Stars everytime.
B00CDTSQZW|2.0|Would not play on my supposedly open region Blu Ray player. This has not been a problem with other Blu Ray disks from Amazon.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I JUST started watching this show for the first time this month.  Gets five stars for a number of reasons.  First, great stories and great writing.  Also, great acting and production.  Everything about it is high quality, I guess you can say.  There's always a current plot line along with a recurring one.  And then there's, well, just something overwhelmingly compelling about the show.  If you haven't watched it yet, do it!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app is great. I love that you can set dual alarms. I also like that I can choice what days I have it set for.
B00A2H9PLG|1.0|Spoiler Alert..<br /><br />What a horrid movie. I do not mind the occasional plot hole but this movie was bad bad bad. I finally had enough when the national guard and all other security forces are just 20 yards away watching the President being chased around the WH lawn and a bad guy is hanging out the roof of a chasing vehicle blasting away with a massive machine gun. Finally word is given to move forward and 1 tank rolls, gets hit by a missile fired from the WH house and then the US forces run away.<br /><br />The attack by delta force was pathetic. They hover near the roof of the WH screaming shoot me shoot me.<br /><br />I need to check, but I am pretty sure you can not swear in a new president whilst the current one is still alive and you KNOW he is alive.<br /><br />There was really no reason for the security forces to sit idle through all of this movie. They knew the President was safe with our hero. They would not have hung back just because of a few hostages.<br /><br />Then we had the child at the end waving the flag on the lawn and still no security forces approach. The mother of course managed to get in before security.<br /><br />The pilot ignores direct orders just because of 1 child even though world destruction was just seconds away.<br /><br />Stupid movie..
B0015XASFS|5.0|Awesome. Felt like we were there. He is an amazing artist, and truly gets better every time you watch the dvd
B0002234LS|1.0|I am amazed that such a quality cast would touch this turkey. Depp's character from the outset is a total drip. His behaviour is irritating, lacks any credibility, and any audience empathy quickly evaporates as Depp sleepwalks through the role (perhaps from embarrassment) ... and this is before the really weird stuff starts. I certainly hope that the original book was better because the movie is a complete flop.
B0071NOU78|5.0|Gave it to my son for his 5th birthday.  He was over the moon when he unboxed the Amazon box and saw the lightsaber.  The light and the sounds made this an authentic experience for him.  He said now he's a real jedi!
1416987118|5.0|I remember singing this song in preschool, and my daughter loves the book.  I like that when you take off the dust jacket, the book cover is still glossy, and has the image.  Dust jackets don't last long with toddlers.
B00CKJ2KK2|1.0|This is a stupid game I deleted it and I still don't have any space<br />Don't get this stupid game I mean it<br />Tenderness
0385334206|4.0|one of my faves! the illustrations are really fun, and the lessons are really good. a quick and easy read but totally worthwhile because its kurt vonnegut, DUH.
B00942G4UA|5.0|every one should see this movie. I tell lots of facts about affordable processed foods.  This should be played on regular tv.
B00015YVD6|4.0|It's Splash! Yeah, i bought this DVD because i had a craving to watch it- no, it's not the best movie, but hey, it's not too bad for some 80s entertainment.
B002M85TH2|5.0|I love John Travolta as a villain and this is one of his best IMHO.  Great action and great story line. Keeps you guessing.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I like this game mostly because it has to do with candy but I cant get past level 14 other than that I like it.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I can't wait until the movie! Matthew McConneghy, Donald Sutherland, the guy that played Harry Rex then maybe Kerry Washington as Portia and Angela Bassett as Lettie...<br />Anyway, properly done, this will be a major motion picture!!<br />Well done John Grisham!!!! I can't wait until your next project!<br />G. Stevenson<br />Lex Park, MD
B00457X7XQ|5.0|Gripping tale, written by somebody who understands the technology and makes it accessible to others who don't work in the exact same part of the field of computing.
B0050PYNN0|5.0|This is an underrated movie that i happen to think is totally brilliant- ergo, i just had to buy it. And i was not disappointed at all.
1250038820|5.0|Beautiful images. Great idea. This is a must have book for anyone who enjoys the stories that others can tell.
B00ET0PZDO|4.0|The game was simple on some levels but challenging on others. I enjoyed figuring out the puzzles and clues that I were given in order to escape.
B008U7ZPHS|4.0|Please Mr Riordan, let our heroes take a break! The book is okay. Still, for me, they get from one misfortune to another a little too  often. That tires me a bit. It's  too long for the story, or the story is too thin for the length of the book. You choose.<br />Book 4 is better. I would have put book 3 and 4 together, making book 3 shorter.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Nathan Fillion, how can you not watch? Complications from being together, naturally, but there's still enough to enjoy just as we all did at the beginning.
B008L1DNGI|2.0|This game was free, thank goodness.  I wouldn't have wanted to pay for it.  A standard puzzle game, that's been done better hundreds of times.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It does work as expected. Can it be better? Yes. There is lag when streaming from a browser and sometimes the audio is a little off. Connection speed is key here, and also how busy your home network may be. Some case others may be downloading or streaming as well and this will affect the quality.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Use Facebook often and like it, easy to use and I am just mindful not to put anything private on a public site.
B00338QENI|5.0|Great read. Did not like the cover so avoided book. After seeing it had over 2000 reviews I bought it. Fantastic historical book. Insight into medicine in the 1950s!
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|This young girl is an inspiration to us all. Gandhi, Mandela, and King all wrapped up in one small child!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the mobile version of Minecraft, so there aren't quite as many items as the full PC version.  For the price though, this is a great mobile version.  There is no multiplayer at this time, but they plan on updating that soon I believe.  Controls are fairly simple, and the item interface is great.  I actually like the crafting better in the mobile version.
B004EWFUQY|1.0|this diet sucks.<br /><br />do paleo its much better for you and more of a lifestyle adjustment rather than a crash diet that is difficult to maintain
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|After waiting for a good while for this game to become available on Kindle Fire, I have not been disappointed. I love the smooth flow of the game and vivid colors, along s with the variety of puzzles to solve. Hooking up with my fb friends that also play Candy Crush Saga, makes playing more fun. Even if it's just sending or receiving a life. I love this game, so thank you for the free app!
B004J4WKTW|4.0|This book was an amazing read! Couldn't stop reading! I was on the edge of my seat the entire time!
B00F031WB8|5.0|WHAT A WONDERFUL TRIBUTE TO THE GREATEST GUITARIST EVER!!!  ENJOYED EVERY MOMENT OF THIS DVD.....THANK YOU:)  AND THE PRICE IS TERRIFIC!:)  I RECEIVED IT SO QUICK AND I WAS SO PLEASED.....THIS DVD IS A KEEPSAKE.  JIMI HENDRIX WAS ONE OF A KIND AND NO ONE HAS EVER COME CLOSE TO MATCHING HIS GENIUS ON THE GUITAR!
B0096DZKZC|4.0|Graphics and gameplay are great.  This plays a lot like the classic sonic games for the Genesis, but with better graphics and a a few extra moves.
0765350386|5.0|Happened upon this book browsing through amazon and decided to give it a shot. Loved the story and the &#34;magic system&#34; the author created.
B005LAIHR2|2.0|Let me just start out by saying that I like musicals!  This just was not one of them.  And PG-13?  I don't THINK so!  And I'm no prude...RHPS is probably my favorite movie of all time.<br />It was good to see Tom Cruise step outside his box.  He was very, very good.  Have to wonder if he was channeling Jim Morrison.  Boneta was a miscast.  He just didn't carry off the heavy metal look.  And Zeta-Jones?  Does she need money?  Is it that there just are no good parts being offered for her age group?<br />More importantly, I kept thinking there were so many ways they could go to give the movie some meaning.  For example, if Zeta-Jones had been the high-school sweetheart of the Stacie character and they interacted in some scene that would have shown how far apart they ended up.  Or if Stacie fell in love with Constance without the sex.  I could go on and on.  Suffice to say, I came away thinking that it was a waste of my time to watch this movie.  The 2 stars are just because Cruise was so good!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This games has the whole energy amount and if you wait you can get more energy but it is a great game so get it!!!!!
B00B0LPYXG|1.0|Too much unnecessary vulgarity in language and visual. I didn't even finish. After an hour I had enough and shut it down. Too bad, because I was really looking forward to seeing it based on the previews (ads.)
B008K9UZY4|5.0|A great remake of the classic.  Controls are responsive and intuitive.  Graphics are classic, which is what I expected and wanted.
0765356147|5.0|Happened upon this book browsing through amazon and decided to give it a shot. Loved the story and the &#34;magic system&#34; the author created.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a very good app.  It gets harder as the grid size increases.  It is wonderful exercise for the brain.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|The story plot and special effects along with a really hip cast makes this a series I don't want to miss.
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|I'm not far into it but it seems pretty good. Graphic especially. I'll change this if it gets lame.... I like the fact that the characters talk too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like this game very much because it show a lot of people that you can trade and broad you can trade
0765356139|5.0|Happened upon this book browsing through amazon and decided to give it a shot. Loved the story and the &#34;magic system&#34; the author created.
B008N9AASC|5.0|Everyone should own this film and watch it once a year.<br />Very interesting and calming.<br />Absolutely unique and colorful cinematography.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Lot of fun...never played before,just wish you didn't have to wait for lives to regenerate or give more than 5 to start!

B008I43DYU|5.0|It is exactly what I needed and it works great. I also love the way it looks on my Kindle Fire HD. I am currently taking Math for Behavorial Sciences in college and the formulas I have to use require special keys to solve each equation. In the scientific mode it provides more that enough decimal places that I need to get an accurate answer.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|This product exudes attention to detail and feels substantial in your hand - usually a good indicator of quality construction. More importantly, it works flawlessly with my iPhone 5S and iPad 2 - so long as I use Apple or Apple-certified cables! I can charge both my iPad and iPhone at the same time, using the higher amp USB port for the iPad and the other, lower amperage, USB port for the iPhone.
B00F91SCXC|1.0|Just what the world needs, viral-based zombie war movie. I spent either $4.99 or $5.99 [I forget] on this movie and I still feel like I was ripped off. Brad Pitt - you are capable of much more substantial roles than this. Lame-o storyline, stereotypical zombie noises, colossal waste of production money. Better to have given the millions $$ spent on this movie to the real residents of Jerusalem who have experienced such horrible warring and poverty. Everyone involved in this movie should have their heads examined.
1475143389|5.0|Great book! A nice change in workout routines from the normal that's in every other book. Results come quickly, highly recommend!
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|This series rocks. I wish they didn't cancel it. Camron is hot. If I were John... I'm pretty sure you know the rest lol
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|That's the one of my favourite games but I want to can buy table images or colour like on computer
B00EI6E17A|4.0|At first, I didn't know it was Lady Gaga. But once I heard the lyrics I found myself in love with her!
B007PFD90G|3.0|I love Salman Rushdie personally. However, I discovered that I just don't like this type of book. I hate reading about people suffering and being mistreated because of their religious beliefs - or opposition to certain religious stances. John Lennon said it best - imagine no religion. There would be peace everywhere, or at least, less suffering in the name of radicalized religion. Salman, you're the best, and I mean that. Have you written anything imaginative and light-hearted? If so, I want to read it.
B008OOYALE|2.0|Couldn't work out what I was supposed to do, so don't use it. Perhaps more serious users of these games would be OK
B00280LYHS|5.0|This was a great ending to the series and tied everything together, I thoroughly enjoyed it! I like how the prophecy leads into the next book!
B00EVCGUNY|5.0|This album is amazing!! Don't hesitate purchasing, the price is too low for what you receive.  Her voice is like liquid gold and the music is sublime...
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|Tedious and slow. Outrageously good costumes, set, special effects, and actors. But I just couldn't sit still through it. My grandkids liked it a lot, however.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a very addictive game.  I have had no issues on my Kindle Fire HD.  The only issue is not getting enough sleep became I can't put it down.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|Im not sure this even needs to be said but this is in fact the greatest movie ever made. Am I wrong? Am I wrong?
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|For all of those who grew up in the 80's this is a must read. Cline makes the reader nostalgic for a decade filled with video arcades, new wave music and feathered hair! Great book!
B00CHILW64|4.0|Well done movie, terrific special effects. Incredible story. And the actors were extremely well-suited for their roles. Very moving and amazing true story.
B00DSO9RMC|2.0|I'd been looking forward to this release, and I really wanted to like it. I just couldn't. It was... preachy. Lots of little moral lessons with no subtlety whatsoever. Lots of expositions on characters realising how wrong they'd been with their prejudices and preconceived notions. I could overlook the whole &#34;helpless, inept male just needs some earthy woman-wisdom&#34; schtick that Pratchett has been using for a while now - but here, the moralising is injected into the narrative so humourlessly and with such clumsiness, that the fun of a Discworld novel is almost completely absent. And that's what a Discworld novel is supposed to be - fun. Fun and absurd. It should make the drink you're sipping on come out of your nose when you least expect it. This one struggled to even raise a grin.<br /><br />I feel like a bit of a heel knowing that Pratchett may not be able to produce any further novels in the future, and I'd add that after 40 novels, he's entitled to one or two misses. If you've read the others, I'm sure you'll read this one. But Ankh-Morpork just doesn't feel like the wild west anymore. The trains always run on time now.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|This made a Great birthday gift! My sister has the other 5 volumes, so I had to complete her set. Love the Big Bang Theory!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|THE best puzzle/game I have played on my Kindle Fire. I have the new generation HD and it works wonderful. It would not work on my first Kindle Fire so if you have one a year or two old (mine was two) It won't work well so beware when buying. But this game is great. &amp;#34;Mist&amp;#34; like in quality with some head scratching riddles but not too hard to figure out after some thinking. The graphics are great and with each level there are even more surprises. I hope we see more of these. Well worth the two bucks. Enjoy!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My son loves this app. I tried and likes it too. It was easy to learn how to play this game.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|ADDICTING! My mother got me into this game. I find it SUPER ADDICTING! I haven't played this game in a while but I know that it can be  SUPER ADDICTING!

B0018OFN4U|5.0|Cult classic that fits perfectly in with the 2 other in the &#34;Cornetto trilogy.&#34; I'm not into zombie movies, so this was perfect. Just go ahead and watch it, unless you saw Hot Fuzz and hated it. It's the same treatment, just in the zombie genre.

I love the transformation as Andrea Sachs (Anne Hathaway) loses herself and even more when she finds herself again and break free from the leash at the end of the movie.<br /><br />I loved the way Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep) ruled this entire industry with an iron fist.<br /><br />Every character was lovable, even the &#34;evil&#34; one.<br /><br />I can watch this movie again and again without getting tired of it.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|I'm a big zombie fan and that's pretty much all I read. But my girlfriend wouldn't shut up until I read some stupid book she kept going on about. I, unfortunately read the negative reviews before reading this book. Needless to say, I assumed I would be reading a 'Marley and Me' \\"knock-off\\" with a pedophile hero. HOWEVER, after reading this book, and after shedding many tears; some happy, some sad (which, BTW, is nearly impossible for a guy like me to do, let alone admit...EVER)... I learned that some people just can't be pleased, no matter how great something is. The emotions this book evoked in me were some of the most powerful feelings I've ever experience. It's changed my life. I'm no longer some guy that owns a dog.. Now, I'm some guy that is blessed to have a dog as a family member, loyal companion, good listener and ever faithful friend. Read this book!!! Very well done....
B00FIUO8MI|3.0|Why only that rating? I am a fan! The writing remains fresh and real.the people are almost known by me. But I confess that the end was too brutal for me. I don't want to write a spoiler but I felt we has come too far, walked too long for that ending to be given us. I read to escape the pain of life.<br />I am sure many readers will consider it a fitting end in all ways. I only consider it so in many ways.<br />But thank you Ms Roth for this series which came from your heart.

B000GT6L9Y|4.0|this is basically a sci-fi version of the classic &#34;Jumanji&#34;... good movie to watch with your pre teen kids, but it won't hold the attention of the younger children.

0847842134|2.0|This great book has been done a disservice by a careless publisher (with an ugly logo) out to make a fast buck. The choice of paper is disastrous, the binding is cheap and too fragile for such a large book. The horrible label on the back took 10 minutes to remove and left some scars. Front cover also had some black glue on it. To cap it all it was delivered machine shrink-wrapped inside a large US post sack, which as we all know is an incitement to carriers to throw it around. Result: busted corners. I don't think this travesty will ever have collector value so don't buy it with that in mind. Apart from that, some nice things inside.

0307950654|3.0|All of Pemberley is getting ready for the annual Lady Anne Ball, and all seems to be going as planned. That is, until the carriage with Elizabeth's sister Lydia shows up. She's all in a tizzy, going on about gunshots in the woods and begging someone to find her husband, fearing for his life. When the search party finds Wickham, he is alive. However, he's covered in blood and standing above the body of his best friend, Captain Denny. So begins the mystery of the murder of Captain Denny, which will certainly bring scandal on Pemberley and the Darcys, and might end up with Wickham hanging from the gallows. This is &#34;Death Comes to Pemberley&#34; by P.D. James.<br /><br />There have been many attempted sequels and prequels to Jane Austen's novels, with varying degrees of success. One would think that the idea of a crime fiction novel based on the characters of Austen's best loved book, written by one of the world's best crime fiction writers would make a match made in heaven. In fact, it should have been just the thing to get all those macho men interested in Austen. But unfortunately, something went amiss between concept and execution.<br /><br />First of all, I want it to be completely clear that James' prose is totally spot-on. She captures the mood and style to perfection. Furthermore, there's not even an iota of action throughout the story that would seem in the least bit incongruous for even the minor characters. In this, James proved from the first paragraphs that she knows her Austen inside and out. She deftly mimics Austen beautifully, and never falls into any pitfalls that might have turned this tribute into a mockery.<br /><br />As for crime fiction, we all know there are few writers out there that can match James' acumen for the genre. Her Inspector Dalglish novels are a marvel of creativity and ingenuity, with just the right amounts of deception and foreshadowing. James is the envy of other authors who attempt to match her ability, and is well deserving of all the praise heaped upon her by her devoted fans.<br /><br />How then is it, that all of these exemplary attributes didn't combine into a hybrid masterpiece that we were all certain should have been the result? How is it possible that this book ended up plodding along, until it smacked us in the face with a comically timed solution that came to us almost of nowhere? Did I miss something along the way? That's not like me. So if I did, then either I skimmed through only those essential passages that might have hinted at the resolution or the clues were just too indistinct for me to realize their significance. For me, the best part of a crime fiction book is that &#34;ah-ha&#34; moment when all those seemingly random little bits and pieces fall gently into place when we find out &#34;whodoneit&#34; and why. I'm sorry to say that this magical moment was sorely missing from this book.<br /><br />My personal theory as to why this didn't work is very simple. Most good crime fiction has a main character (or group of people) whose sole purpose is to discover who really committed the crime, how they did it and what their motive was. They lead us through the investigation and happen upon all of those key pieces of information and bring forth all the suspects, which can lead us astray or guide us to the answer. We become intimately familiar with this person (or group), along with their idiosyncrasies or emotional baggage that both distracts and embellishes the story.  Here, there is no one doing this - at least not anyone that we hear about. This means, the focus of the book is totally on the periphery of the crime and its impact on the people of Pemberley, and not solving the murder itself.<br /><br />It is possible that James felt that we are already intimately familiar with all of Austen's characters. Because of this, giving one of them the task of solving the crime would seem out of character. Her only option would have been to introduce new character/s who could fulfill this role. Actually, she did give us some of these, and they were instrumental in uncovering the truth. However, it seems to me that what happened was she didn't want Austen's own creations taking a back seat to some upstart, and that is what let her down.<br /><br />James knew that this wasn't a successful attempt, and she says so herself in her introduction to the book, where she apologizes to both her readers and the late Miss Austen. In the end, we must forgive her for succumbing to this temptation, and remember that one bad apple cannot rot a whole bushel of good ones. I'll be generous and give three out of five stars to this book, but I cannot really recommend it as anything more than a curiosity piece.ll this role.

B00F91SCXC|1.0|No real story line.  Seems to me someone have a series of cool idea and string them up together and force a story line that is weak.  The action lack substance, lack of character development.  It makes a great trailer and that is about it.

0385523394|5.0|This isn't the kind of book I would have picked up - but since I got hooked by the sensational(istic) Netflix series, and we had quite a cliffhanger - I ordered a copy to find out &#34;what happens next!&#34;<br /><br />I have to say - I was in for quite a surprise. While the first part of the book reads like a big love letter to Larry -- the bulk of the book focuses on the friendships and relationships in prison, a big love letter to the ladies at Danbury, really. The inmates are described with warm compassion and sympathy -- even the author admits her own faults and is open to communicating and working with people she didn't like very well (but several of who &#34;grew&#34; on her).<br /><br />I found this version of Piper Kerman to be much more likeable than the one in the Netflix series. There's a lot less sex, aggression and hostility (and more home cooking!) in the book. I understand that the cable networks have to tart everything up - but I think I would have enjoyed a more mature, toned down version of the show that better reflected the author's experiences in the book.<br /><br />Definitely - read the book!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Hands down my favorite camp/survival knife. I've done everything with this from chop down small trees to making feather sticks and kindling shavings. I love the weight, which is pretty heavy, and the balance. I've heard and read a lot of reviews about not liking the sheath but honestly it isn't horrible. I never even gave much thought to the downfalls of the sheath until I read all the reviews. One thing that does stand out is that you must have the knife buttoned into the sheath or else it flops around and falls upside down. The knife will not fall out due to the knife snapping into the sheath, but its awkward. But besides that, I cannot say enough good things about this knife and many places make aftermarket sheaths and grips for this knife since it has become so popular.
B007N5YJYS|5.0|A quick film and it puts straight the distortions of many film industry portrayals,  Worth the price.  I have read the book as well and this version in film is near to the story itself but one better read the book to get a clearer picture.

B00E6X4GAW|5.0|A compelling story about a girl who persisted in fighting for her and her fellow girls rights for education and a chance for an independent future. She almost had to pay for this with her life. The fact that she survived and is able to tell the world about her and other girls' and women's journey tells us that we should have faith in a better world and that we can fight hate.
B00DYCHPMC|5.0|Excellent sound recording. Many tracks I've never heard before and I have virtually everything of T4F that I could have gotten my hands on! A must have for the T4F fan. Very cool, stone white packaging with two &#34;books&#34; inside. I haven't read it yet but there are some interviews inside. The DVD looks as good as it could be given its original date. So yes, it looks pretty bad. But the sound is very good.
B00AAI7B7W|5.0|Still an excellent movie that is based on a real possession. If people don't believe that there is something greater than man, they should. In a world that believes that everything is relative and nothing is absolute and killing the weak and defenseless is a relative thing. They should look and see how evil is overtaking our world in our time. If Nazi and Communist societies didn't wake them it should. If the creeping Culture of Death does not bother them it should. We are slowly moving toward what WWII and the Cold War tried to stop, &#34;EVIL&#34;.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|I love her courage. I heard today that the Taliban soldier who shot her was promoted. I pray with all my heart that she is protected from the unspeakable evil that would seek to murder a child. She has a life to live, more lives to touch, and a world to change. I eagerly look forward to watching her life, and the new stories she will have to write about. God bless you sweet Malala. Thank you for this first book. A must-read.

B00DW475CC|3.0|I love this movie.  I have owned it on VHS, laserdisc, an old HBO DVD, and just today I received the new Blu-ray.  Good looking copy.  Nice contrast and sharp picture.  There's just one problem - there's an authoring error that puts a few seconds of one scene in the middle of another.  At about 18 minutes in as Dudley is trying to decide what to do with all of the donation letters he has, the image suddenly switches to a previous scene where Dudley and the professor are looking at the bishop's old church.  The audio continues on as if the other scene isn't there, but the image is wrong.  This lasts for about three seconds, then it returns to the right visuals.  I was so disappointed that this wasn't caught.  I would give it a 5 if it hadn't been the case.  I'm just shocked that this kind of thing happens these days!  Hopefully WB will correct this and offer a trade-in.
B00F8MI9NK|4.0|pretty funny movie! i love Billy Crystal. He is a funny man. Sequels are never as good as the original but this was funny for a 1.5hr movie. It was a nice date night for me & my wife.

B0047T86G0|3.0|I find it difficult to find words on my Asus tablet Kindle app. You ask to search for a word and it always wants to search through the introductory text of the dictionary rather than just search the dictionary. And there is no way to back out of a search once it has begun. So it is not as easy to use as an app.

You'll never find a more honest or devastating look at a loving relationship that just somehow isn't anymore.<br />But put this CD away once you've gotten over it. It's so intense--it just might bring you back into your funk again.

1609611543|1.0|DO NOT BUY IT, read Bad Science and Bad Pharma by Ben Goldacre; get tooled up before you try to self-help...<br /><br />Review of this junk science book from the ex-gluten camp, referenced(ie no vested interest)  [...]<br />When Wheat Belly, by William Davis, M.D., came out in August 2011, it was an instant hit. It became a New York Times bestseller.  Praise far outweighed criticism. Especially in the gluten-free community, it enjoyed rave reviews. The book was received essentially as gospel. Why?<br /><br /> In my opinion, there are three main reasons:<br /><br />*It's written by an M.D., which adds a patina of credibility to the book's claims,<br />*It's filled with endnotes of citations that reference scientific peer-reviewed publications, and<br />*Its message--to \\"lose the wheat, lose the weight, and find your path back to health\\"--already agrees with the world view of many in the GF community (that wheat and gluten equals bad).<br /><br />But as you'll see, those three factors are dangerous. They build a facade of trust and credibility. They cause us to let down our guard; to cease being the critically-thinking readers that we ought to be. And sometimes, that means we fail to question information that is suspect; we unknowingly accept and perpetuate a myth; we fall victim to false information.<br /><br />I didn't set out to write a review of Wheat Belly. I had been heavily researching another unrelated project. Coincidental timing then played a key role. After reading a number of prominent medical studies involving wheat, gluten, weight loss, and celiac disease, I found myself reading Wheat Belly, in which Davis cites some of those exact same studies.<br /><br />Except that there was one major problem: Davis' claims--and his conclusions based on the research studies he cites--were exactly the opposite of what I'd been reading in those very studies. Here are several important examples:<br /><br />Consider Chapter 3, Wheat Deconstructed, page 36 of the hardcover edition. Davis writes \\"if we look only at overweight people who are not severely malnourished at the time of diagnosis who remove wheat from their diet, it becomes clear that this enables them to lose a substantial amount of weight.\\" He supposedly backs up this claim in the very next sentence by continuing, \\"A Mayo Clinic/University of Iowa study of 215 obese celiac patients showed 27.5 pounds of weight loss in the first six months of a wheat-free diet.\\" Sounds pretty impressive and compelling ... until you realize he's wrong.<br /><br />First of all, the study didn't examine 215 obese patients. Body Mass Index for study participants ranged from underweight to normal to overweight to obese. Secondly, only 25 of those 215 patients lost weight, and the weight loss was not restricted to the obese subset of participants. (Further, 91 of the 215 patients gained weight, but I'll return to the issue of weight gain among obese celiacs in a moment.) You can read the full text of the study as reported in the original American Journal of Clinical Nutrition article here.<br /><br />Next consider Chapter 5, The Wheat/Obesity Connection, page 66 of the hardcover edition. Here Davis invokes a study reported in the American Journal of Gastroenterology. He claims that of newly diagnosed celiac disease patients, 39 percent start overweight and 13 percent start obese. Next Davis writes that \\"by this estimate, more than half the people now diagnosed with celiac disease are therefore overweight or obese.\\"<br /><br />Not quite. Actually, the study noted that overweight and obese patients together accounted for 39 percent of diagnoses. The 13 percent obese patients were a subset of the overweight group. By Davis' questionable math, underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese celiac disease patients would account for 114% of diagnoses, which is impossible.<br /><br />At the start of the very next paragraph, he invokes a familiar line nearly identical to that from Chapter 3: \\"If we focus only on overweight people who are not severely malnourished at the time of diagnosis, celiac sufferers actually lose a substantial quantity of weight when they eliminate wheat gluten.\\"<br /><br />I call B.S. You know that study Davis just cited in the previous paragraph of his book to build his case? The same study from which he errantly claimed more than half of newly diagnosed celiacs are overweight? Here is what researchers actually found, and I quote directly: \\"Of patients compliant with a gluten-free diet, 81 percent had gained weight after 2 years, including 82% of initially overweight patients\\" (emphasis mine).<br /><br />This finding is not buried deep in the report somewhere. It's important enough that researchers also call it out directly in the top-level abstract. When Davis claims that initially overweight celiac disease patients lose a significant amount of weight on a gluten-free diet, how does he explain the fact that 82% of those patients gained weight ... in one of the very studies he uses to back up his questionable claim?<br /><br />To me this appears to be more than an innocent, but careless, oversight; it is more than a case of blissful ignorance. Those results are front and center in the study, and they directly contradict his claim. It would take an act of willful omission to leave it out; it's audacious that he cites the study to bolster his claim.<br /><br />For a third and final example, consider Chapter 4, The Addictive Properties of Wheat, page 50 of the hardcover edition. Here, Davis writes about gluten exorphins, opiate-like compounds created when stomach enzymes take a crack at partially digesting gluten. Researchers are continuing to study how they impact the human body in myriad ways. One branch of such studies uses the drug naloxone, an opiate blocker, to cancel the potential effect of gluten exorphins and other related compounds.<br /><br />Davis makes the claim that gluten exorphins are addictive like morphine (another opiate), and that those addictive properties cause you to eat more calories and gain weight. As the theory goes, block the gluten exorphins with naloxone, and you block the addictive properties of wheat-based foods. To back up his boast, he then cites a study, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, in which binge eaters were left in a room filled with a variety of foods for one hour. Davis writes \\"participants consumed 28 percent less wheat crackers, bread sticks, and pretzels with the administration of naloxone.\\" And there you have it! See? Naloxone blocked the evil action of gluten exorphins, and those binge eaters ate fewer calories as a result! Except that's not what happened.<br /><br />Here's the truth: While naloxone appeared to have an impact on the consumption of high fat and high sugar foods, it had no effect that correlated with gluten. In fact, while Davis claims that participants consumed 28 percent fewer wheat crackers, bread sticks, and pretzels, they actually consumed 40 percent more gluten-containing bread sticks.<br /><br />The three examples I've noted are hardly the sum total of the problems I found with the book. There are many others, though I've already made my point.<br /><br />Those of us in the gluten-free community want to agree with Wheat Belly because Davis' message resonates with us. But it's an overly simplified message, at times built on tenuous claims. And how would we ever know? He's an M.D. He's the expert, right? And he cites all those sexy research studies.<br /><br />If I had read this book at another time in my life, I likely would have been none the wiser. I would have read the book, peeked at the citations, and been satisfied. But perhaps serendipity of a certain sort is at work here ... that I read this book at precisely that moment in my life when I was best equipped with the knowledge I needed to critically evaluate it. I now pass that evaluation along to you.<br /><br />For certain, some of what Davis writes is valid. And I have some GF blogging colleagues/friends who know Davis personally. They say he's a very nice man, which may indeed be true.<br /><br /> But I'm more than disappointed with Davis and Wheat Belly; I'm downright angry. This book can and should be better. We, the gluten-free community, deserve as much. It does an injustice to the very legitimate case against wheat and gluten, and it is insulting to us, the readers. Sadly, Wheat Belly looks polished from a distance, but upon closer inspection it goes belly up. Sections of the book amount to propaganda, fallacies, and unsubstantiated claims. For me, Wheat Belly is a bust.<br /><br />Are wheat and gluten a health problem? For many of us, undoubtedly. But there's much more to the story than meets the eye, and you're not always getting the straight story in Wheat Belly.<br /><br />-Pete), and that those addictive properties cause you to eat more calories and gain weight. As the theory goes, block the gluten exorphins with naloxone, and you block the addictive properties of wheat-based foods. To back up his boast, he then cites a study, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, in which binge eaters were left in a room filled with a variety of foods for one hour. Davis writes \\"participants consumed 28 percent less wheat crackers, bread sticks, and pretzels with the administration of naloxone.\\" And there you have it! See? Naloxone blocked the evil action of gluten exorphins, and those binge eaters ate fewer calories as a result! Except that's not what happened.<br /><br />Here's the truth: While naloxone appeared to have an impact on the consumption of high fat and high sugar foods, it had no effect that correlated with gluten. In fact, while Davis claims that participants consumed 28 percent fewer wheat crackers, bread sticks, and pretzels, they actually consumed 40 percent more gluten-containing bread sticks.<br /><br />The three examples I've noted are hardly the sum total of the problems I found with the book. There are many others, though I've already made my point.<br /><br />Those of us in the gluten-free community want to agree with Wheat Belly because Davis' message resonates with us. But it's an overly simplified message, at times built on tenuous claims. And how would we ever know? He's an M.D. He's the expert, right? And he cites all those sexy research studies.<br /><br />If I had read this book at another time in my life, I likely would have been none the wiser. I would have read the book, peeked at the citations, and been satisfied. But perhaps serendipity of a certain sort is at work here ... that I read this book at precisely that moment in my life when I was best equipped with the knowledge I needed to critically evaluate it. I now pass that evaluation along to you.<br /><br />For certain, some of what Davis writes is valid. And I have some GF blogging colleagues/friends who know Davis personally. They say he's a very nice man, which may indeed be true.<br /><br /> But I'm more than disappointed with Davis and Wheat Belly; I'm downright angry. This book can and should be better. We, the gluten-free community, deserve as much. It does an injustice to the very legitimate case against wheat and gluten, and it is insulting to us, the readers. Sadly, Wheat Belly looks polished from a distance, but upon closer inspection it goes belly up. Sections of the book amount to propaganda, fallacies, and unsubstantiated claims. For me, Wheat Belly is a bust.<br /><br />Are wheat and gluten a health problem? For many of us, undoubtedly. But there's much more to the story than meets the eye, and you're not always getting the straight story in Wheat Belly.<br /><br />-Pete
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|I was looking for a quick read.  In that sense this book fit the bill, but I feel like I wasted my time. I kept hoping this book would evolve into something interesting. It didn't.  Finishing the book was a chore.  The characters were unlikable.
B00138D2XA|5.0|Jeff Buckley. What more can I say?<br />Amazing voice. Extreme talent. Great musician. Gone way to soon. I love this album.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|interesting fun game. puzzles and hidden objects are not so hard u have to cheat and look up the answer. my complaint is that the game constantly notifies you to play it so I always have to clear a bunch of reminders.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I will try this new game just so I can leave a reveiw for fans of me so bye guys and I this game is really great game  I have to say it looks really great so see all you good gamers later bye guys.
B00B5C0YOO|5.0|This program is a snap to use.  It easily uninstalled programs and has a backup function.  You can sort by name, size or date installed. I would have liked to have seen by date last used but that is a minor point.
B00GBCMW9S|1.0|Nothing compared to Eminems first 3 labels and all his underground stuff... this is just plain garbage! I didnt even buy this album, listen to it on youtube before you buy it... Eminem is going down hill.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Difficult and painful, hard to put down.  Not quite 'To Kill a Mockingbird, but a very good story, told well.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I've read most every book John Grisham has written. He never ceases to provide insight into his characters, but to be reconnected to Jake, Harry and Lucien and meet Lettie and Portia was a delight.<br /><br />\\"Sycamore Row\\" tells a story so filled with twists and turns full of our nation's horrific past and current greed. I heartily recommend it to all.

0765325950|4.0|I am very happy with this provider. We receive the package with the time that we needed it. And the item was not damaged and it looks fantastic.my husband will be so happy to get this for a Christmas gift.
0156012197|3.0|I bought this because it was a classic.  But, I didn't find it very interesting which is just my personal opinion.  Apparently, thousands if not millions love it.  It has a gentle philosophical bend to it, but I really didn't finish reading it.  It would probably be a great pick for a small book club, so people can discuss it as they go along.  I think that is what I needed to become more engaged.
0307730700|5.0|Without question the most riveting Navy SEAL story I have ever read. I felt such a connection to Adam and his family that I actually muss reading about them at night. I can - and certainly will - read this book multiple times.

B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Its not perfect, but It's Star Trek! What else can be said? Just keep it up please.<br />I do miss some of those geeky &#34;science&#34; filled moments Star Trek used to have, but I guess that would probably mean less money and less interest from the studios to keep this great franchise alive.<br /><br />Live long and prosper.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|Excellent sound & video, my favorite show of all time. This is the greatest musical there is and in this concert format, & with Alfie Boe, you can't beat it!!

B0037VNX44|5.0|This movie was amazing.  I was already the biggest Tom Hardy fan because of &#34;The Take&#34; but with Bronson, I was able to see his versatile acting ability.  I would recommend everyone see this movie.  He portrayed this guy perfectly.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Entertaining! Highly recommended and I read this to 4th graders at the RAP program in Hawaii. Buy it for a reader (or a child you wish to be inspired to read) for Christmas!
B003L77G2Y|5.0|For Fringe, 3rd season box set. I like Fringe, but I also like a good box set with good cases, inserts and information.  The disks are full color print labels and the booklets inside give a brief plot summary and are also in full color with pictures of the episodes too.
B0094MFITS|5.0|This is an engaging story with excellence actors.  The premise is an overqualified sheriff with personal issues working an eastern seaboard town.  There is more than one Jesse Stone movie and the layers develop with the relationships of the characters.  Tom Selleck is as always superb.  I highly recommend this and the other Jessie Stone movies as well.
B001QVFDA4|5.0|I laughed throughout the whole movie.  It was soooo funny.  Not to mention it starred my two favorite actors (Tom Hardy and Idris Elba).

B001C4CI8U|5.0|I like Fringe, but I also like a good box set with good cases, inserts and information.  The disks are full color print labels and the booklets inside give a brief plot summary and are also in full color with pictures of the episodes too.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|I grew up listening to Stryper and I have always been a fan but I was disappointed in their albums Reborn and Murder by Pride. To me, these albums just didn't represent the Stryper I have always known. I be truthful, I was kind of expecting to be disappointed again when No More Hell to Pay was released although I was hoping for the best. NMHTP was exactly the music I was hoping to hear from Stryper again. If you are thinking you might be disappointed, like i was, you will be in for a pleasant surprise.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Okay…I'm clearly biased as the author's wife!  But, in all honesty, love this book as much if not more than the one that connected with me most (A Thousand Splendid Suns).  I'll leave it at that to avoid the &#34;schmoopy&#34; factor.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|While I cannot say this is the best book ever written, I enjoyed it thoroughly from beginning to end. I am eagerly awaiting the sequel to see where this story goes. Sanderson's world-building and magic system is phenomenal. I'm just in awe of his talent. I highly recommend this novel for fantasy lovers.
0356502465|4.0|The book starts with grown and captured Vaelin Al Sorna who tells his story to a historian of the enemy, before he is to fight in a duel where he is sentenced to die.<br /><br />Abandoned as a child by his father at the gate of the Sixth Order of the Faith, which is sort of a military monastic order. The boys go through brutal training and not all of them survive it. Vaelin emerges as a leader of the group and becomes the most feared and greatest warrior known as the Hope Killer.<br /><br />The book starts where it ends which was nice touch and while you knew what would happen, you will still wonder how it became and how he turned out the way he did.<br /><br />There's lot of people in the book and at first I was really lost who was who (even if there's character list in the end) and trying to keep them sorted. The book starts little slow part when it picks up, it really picks up! Makes you glad you didn't give up in the beginning.<br />The time when the boys were training was interesting and it showed what molded them when they were growing but it felt at times like it went on forever.<br /><br />I wish it was better explained in what time we were. At times it suddenly jumped years ahead and you realize that Vaelin isn't 15-year old kid anymore. Made it confusing but that's my only major complain about the book.<br /><br />I liked Vaelin and it was interesting to see him growing up. He's not entirely good but he's not entirely bad either. I'm curious to see if he will meet his father in later books because there's some unfinished business there.<br /><br />The book ended too soon and I really wanna get my hands on the next one!

We only have 1 jumperoo and the other twin stares longingly when the other baby is in it.  Great exercise for them for strengthening their legs.  They get so excited.  Safe for baby.  A must have!  We've tried a couple other at friends' houses and this one if by far their favorite.

B00GBCMW9S|5.0|I was losing hope in rap, but this album made me realize rap isn't dead yet. at least as long as Eminem is still rapping. Only flack this album is getting is the gay people that are crying about his lyrics. Eminem is like south park, just get over what he says cause if you make a big deal of it he will just joke on you more. Show respect to a good rapper.
B003VANOFY|5.0|After buying this headset and using it for a few months for gaming, I ended up having to buy a SECOND one just for work, because it's just that great. The sound quality is excellent, and despite the fact that I am surrounded by loud fans and other background noise, my teammates don't report hearing anything except me through the mic. And the best part is I can hear this ANYWHERE in my house, and anywhere at work within the department. The signal is quite impressive.<br /><br />This headset operates on the 2.4GHz band, which can be problematic because it could have interference with wifi signals and microwaves. However, despite using many wireless devices, I haven't had a major problem with interference. The only time I noticed a problem was when I moved my router temporarily right next to my computer and also had several devices (phones, ipad, etc.) in the same area. When I did this, every few hours, the signal would cut out for a few seconds and come back. However, just moving the router away a little bit solved the problem.<br /><br />I ended up getting curious about this so I looked at the signal with a spectrum analyzer. It turns out that when you're nearby, it chooses a frequency that's outside of the wifi range (at least, in my analysis it did). When you're further away (50+ feet), it chooses frequencies that are within wifi range, but employs frequency hopping to try to dodge interference. While it was doing this, the sound was still crystal clear and continuous; it does this silently behind the scenes. There's some pretty impressive technology going on to maintain that quality signal.<br /><br />All-in-all, this headset is a little pricey, but if you want a quality wireless headset, especially for gaming, this is the one I recommend.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I could not get into this book at first. HARD to keep the characters straight.  Tried again after everyone was talking about the book.  So glad I did.  This is a wonderful story.  I could see these characters in people I know.  Real life people.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|It has a unique storyline but was easy to follow. The characters are well drawn and you care about them. Really keeps your interest. Highly recommend, I am not a gamer but I throughly enjpyed reading this book.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I'd never read a book like The Fault in Our Stars before until now. As an avid book reader I highly recommend reading this book. It will touch you, and it will make you feel. One of the best books I have EVER read. It's a tear jerker but it's totally worth reading.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I loved the way the trilogy ended.  Suzanne really ended the story line between Katniss and Peeta the right way.  Great read!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Great stories, great characters, diverse cast, scary as heck - what else do you need? This Season seems grittier and delves into more complexity in human behavior/response.
1451648545|5.0|After reading this book I can't decide who I want to be more when I grow up - Steve Jobs or Walter Isaacson.  It's hard to imagine anyone who had a stronger impact on multiple industries than Steve Jobs.  First computers, then movies, music and telecommunications - Jobs revolutionized them all.  And it's hard to imagine someone being more influential over industrial design, branding, advertising and public relations than Steve Jobs.  As Isaacson states - Steve Jobs is likely to go down in history as most likely to be remembered 100 years from now - just as the great inventors Thomas Edison and Benjamin Franklin are today.  But Walter Isaacson also deserves big kudos for the writing style.  As a wannabe author myself I gained a new appreciation for Isaacson gift for words and storytelling.<br /><br />I felt like I was sitting in the room next to Jobs as he walked you through each chapter of his life.  You laugh.  You cry.  You turn up your nose.  You feel a real emotional connection as you read stories about Jobs parking in handicap spots with no license plates; walking around Atari's headquarters barefoot without deodorant; and subsisting on diets of carrots and fruits.  You can't help but smile at the stories of Jobs arguing with hospital nurses after his surgery about the design of the mask he was asked to wear; refusing to meet with President Obama because he hadn't personally called to request the session and switching on the reality-distortion field to convince everyone that anything was possible.  At times it is hard to believe you are reading a true biography that is non-fiction.
B007QA3AH2|4.0|As somewhat of a science fiction as well as a comedy fan, I really enjoyed this movie. A light-hearted jest at the more serious science fiction television shows and the bloated ego of the main character make this movie a welcome distraction from Star Trek and Star Wars.
0743233832|4.0|good book would recommend to anyone who enjoys history and the art of leadership. The book came quick and in great condition
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|it's better than 1974 movie. Not a great movie but it was good. If your just in the mood to watch a good old movie this is a good choice.

B000PAAH3K|3.0|Fascinating psychological stories/studies told the Malcolm Gladwell style and hence an interesting read. The power of information processing is all about thin-slicing (extraneous information to be discarded) an event and how our adaptive unconscious utilizes it brilliantly to provide us with valuable insights in real life situations. The author talks how great decision makers hone and trust their instincts to serve them in times of need and also when this impressive ability clearly fails both the experts and laymen. Particularly, how our biases influence this ability.<br /><br />However, after a few chapters you do get a gist of the book and then it is just stories with the same message all over. The stories and the case studies cited are engaging and enthralling but somehow they do not appear to flow correctly. I got a the feeling that the author is going off tangent on many occasions for e.g the Coke vs Pepsi case, Silvan Tomkins and Paul Ekman story and Paul Ekman's FACS. These stories are very intriguing in itself but I felt the author could have talked a little less about it. Having said that this book is engaging and will keep you entertained.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|I don't think I've ever read a trilogy that quite like this one.  I honestly couldn't put it down.  Every second was thrilling and had me on the edge of my seat.  I have seriously fallen in love with these characters and their ways of life.  Great story, great read, and even though I hate to describe it this way, great ending.  Knock out of the park home run for Veronica Roth.

B00F91RYL8|5.0|Awesome. I have never watched a Zombie movie before and this was a great way to start, its not too over the top.
B001HM1PFO|5.0|I feel that this movie crosses bridges that most people are afraid to cross, and I appreciate it for that. It's got great music, and great acting.
B009NZS6LI|4.0|Out of most of the classic novels that I have read, I would have to say that pride and prejudice is my favorite. I love how overall the reader has to find the hints that there is a love story going on, and how anything is possible in this story line. This beloved story will always remain with me because no matter how different people can be, there is always a chance for growth and love. The exterior of this novel was very interesting to me, even though I wouldn’t have imagined light blue and pea green together it was a nice mix. The interior of the book was really old fashion and I absolutely loved it! The pages are lined with the pea green color, each page is very thick, and I loved how the bookmark came attached. Overall I loved the novel and its physical features!
B00E0SX118|5.0|We loved this in the theatre, we love it on DVD. So excited to own the movie so we can watch it over and over again.
B008JFUPZI|3.0|Its Ok - not as good as Men in Black.  It often seemed hurried.  Their seems to be a trend in the industry to do this and then 6 months later release the extended version which is what the director really wanted us to see.  So if you really like a movie you end up buying it twice!  This feels like they cut out some good plot material.  It's a fun view and a family movie as the monsters are pretty silly.
B009CVRQLY|4.0|After an long wait Celine finally releases an new CD since 2007's Taking Chances disc. I'm giving the album 4 out of 5 stars because I don't care for the 2 duets on the disc. The 1st one with Ne-Yo and the 2nd with Stevie Wonder. They do nothing for me. Sorry. Also I could have done without the alien machine aka the reverb/ vocal dubbing on many of the new tracks. I guess Celine wants to stay current with the 18 to 30 age group. I can understand that to an point. On the positive side I enjoyed the songs: Water and a Flame, Unfinished Songs, and At Seventeen. I was really hoping Celine was going to go back to her earlier English language albums with this release. Guess not. I was hoping the experimenting would have ended with the Taking Chances sessions. Don't get me wrong I like some of the songs on the T C album but its more misses then hits for me. Also wasn't this album originally suppose to be an double CD with new material and a 2nd disc with songs from the new Vegas show? I guess Sony/Columbia didn't want to spend the extra cash on an double album.<br /><br />Bottom line I know its Celine's album and she can choose the songs she wants to record and how she wants to record them I would prefer 90's Celine that's all. I wish she would record another Let's Talk about Love, Falling Into You, or Celine Dion type CD more ballads main stream pop and her natural voice. The booklet is very well done. Dion still looks stunning in the album booklet.

B0026IQYEA|5.0|Beautifully done, scenery took me to the places I visited in the early 90s.  Cate Blanchett was superb as Elizabeth and the supportive roles of the men were very well done.  This movie also helped me understand the Reformation of Great Britain and the beginning of the Church of England.
B00BWWS81S|5.0|With eautiful songs and thoughtful lyrics, this album creates a powerful mood each time I hear it.  A very different album from previous KT Tunstall work, but try artists grow and change.  This album is quiet, but its power makes you listen to it carefully.<br />Get it.
B00EOO55GW|5.0|This is by far their best album. I've listened to every song at least 20 times and it's still not getting old. It's so refreshing to listen to metal in it's purest form. None of that techo infused crap that most of the bands have been doing these days. Just talented artists pushing their strings and percussions to the max. Buy this album! You won't regret it.
B00FAIPDAE|5.0|it is almost exactly like clash clans. it is fun, cool, and roman (better than cavemen). this game is the best of the best ad far as these kind of games go., just make it a little easier to get the crowns, or able to buy them.
B009CVRQLY|5.0|Celine does it again! This CD showcases various aspects of her voice and style.  Love the title song,especially after hearing her talk about what the lyrics mean to her and her interpretation. Beautiful.
0896898288|1.0|Do NOT waste your money on this book unless you simply want a reference book for blocks.  The blocks are not represented true to size, there are no cutting instructions, and the templates are on a cd that you have to print out one per page.  Additionally, the templates are NOT true to size, causing blocks to be smaller than required.  It'd be so much easier to go online and find blocks you like and make your own sampler quilt!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Am a new mobile owner - a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1.  Had to replace a 6-yr old laptop...not exactly sure how apps work.  Found out I don't have to do much...just click 'install' and there it is.  Piece of cake for me...a retired person whose first full time job was wiring printed circuit boards in 1961!  Now I can carry all my books everywhere and not have to worry about their size, cost, weight and space on the bookshelf.  I store them on the cloud!  Now I take my tablet to Church, on trips, etc.  Have always loved reading...now I have access to lots of books with the best limited-budget number in the world:  mostly Free!  Now, if I could just get rid of some annoying apps that Google made sure are residing in my tablet (unrelated to my free Kindle!).
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I love this deviece its wireless what more can you ask for, I'm giving it 4 stars because it needs a 5% improvement. There's a<br />5 second transmittable delay from pc, cell, tablet to Tv. It needs to work with more devices and Apps other that its great.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|This app is so very simple to use. Good features thinking about upgrading to wake up to my own tunes.
B000B5OD4I|4.0|Good:<br />1.) Awesome movement at this price point<br />2.) Very easy to set time and date<br />3.) Hands and lume are amazing. So easy to read and create a great look (Formal or casual)<br />4.) Great bezel and body. Very well made<br /><br />Bad:<br />1.) Face is off-black almost super dark grey. Personal taste would like true black face to match the bezel<br />2.) Bracelet feels very flimsy - ordering a Seiko Super Oyster Type II ASAP and that will make this watch amazing!<br />3.) Small scratch on face near Seiko logo. May need to return as it appears to be a defect<br /><br />All around I recommend this watch and hope to get many years of use out of it!
076115678X|5.0|This book told me everything I needed to know about caring for and even trimming curly hair. Within a few days of ditching my old, drying and damaging hair care products and techniques, my hair began looking and feeling great! Even without buying their specially made signature hair products, you can use their advice to choose fine products from local sources. I am very happy with this book!
B005CRQ2DK|3.0|Great book! Disappointed that it was only compatible with one of our kindles. Would not download on the other one.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Super interesting.  The story stayed with me for days after finishing the book. I have recommended it to many friends.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I loved the first 2 books. If you loved them too, this is a must-read just to get closure on the stories. But I hate the style. I also disliked the first 60% of the story so much! I almost stopped reading it. But I'm glad I finished it, because I really liked the surprise ending. I think big fans will love it, but hard core fans will be too sad & hate it. If you didn't love the first 2 books, don't bother reading this one
0393037010|5.0|Patrick O'Brian - read one, you'll read them all. He is the very best.  If you have any association with the Navy, either RN or USN, you will absolutely love O'Brian's books.
B00542USJW|5.0|This is an awesome movie! The Blue-ray version is fantastic and brings out the great colors of the movie! Highly recommend this version!
0060191325|5.0|One of my favorite books of all times!  Definitely a book that I would suggest all to read before and after marriage.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|This product is really good, it allows to manage your main websites of news by Rss system. I could choose my principal sites such as terra, yahoo, emol, diario financiero and the like in just one screen.
B001MSMULG|4.0|Overall the book is fast-paced and draws you into the story.  There are moments when you want to tell Silva to get on with the story, but for the most part this is an exciting book with a good story line and a protagonist you want to like.
B00CWV9FQA|4.0|This movie is very kitchy and definitely pays homage to the lego toys while not taking too much away from the comic book source material.  My Daughter loved it!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Definitely one of the best books that me and my wife have ever read!  If you don't know your love language, go get this book today!  One of the best books on relationships hands down!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I think this app could have a few more updated features but I'm stoked they finally have it again. I can't put it down.
B003B02PF4|4.0|A satisfying twisted tale of humbled hubris. Grisham weaves around Washington DC rooms of power and small N Italian streets like a pro skier through slalom gates.  It's fun, slightly fanciful but believable enough to enjoy the Italian immersion of the first half. The pace quickens considerably but we don't wipe out all the down. I long for the sequel of true mature love, but JG probably won't write that one. Still a wonderful tour of Italy.
B00CPTUNBK|4.0|My daughter loved this movie.  It stars the same ponies from the television show, but with a twist.  The only downside is that now my daughter wants the new dolls.
B00177E1Z0|5.0|Outstanding soundtrack for one of my favorite movies.  The lyrics and story inspire my soul and help propell me through life for the past 30+ years.  An American classic.
B003S897U0|3.0|It pains me to give 3 stars to this.<br /><br />This rendition, for the most part, just never resonated with me.  I love every crowes album from beginning to end and feel the band has evolved like a fine wine.  Until the Frost/before the freeze was just amazing..and very thankful for the awesome Cabin Fever video that accompanied the release.  It took me a few listens to realize that, as opposed to Southern Harmony, which hits you over the head with a sledgehammer of rock.<br /><br />I've also been seeing the Crowes live every chance I get since 1992, as every show is different (unless it's at a casino..haha).  I too love CR solo material/tours. My least fav songs to see live are She talks to Angels and Hard to Handle..overplayed, mass audience stuff.  Good songs, but they get old to me.  I know the casual fans dig it though, so that's ok.<br /><br />This CD just doesn't appeal to me.  Feels kinda meh on most songs.  Effort vocally seems not the usual inspired Chris for some reason.  Less emotional and more going through the motions.<br /><br />For the record, I even like By your side/lions, which many fans seem to dislike.  I think some of their best songs came off BYS like Virtue and Vice, Heavy, Horsehead, & Go tell the Congregation.  I like that every album is a different flavor.  I came to love Luther's slide, and was sad to see him go.<br /><br />If you are new to the crowes, I wouldn't recommend this as a first album for sure.  Die hards might like it...and I'm a die hard, but never feel like listening to this one.  I even found myself skipping and shutting it off in the car and I never do that w/crowes music.  The reason I'm writing this review, is because this is the first ever Crowes release I'm putting on ebay.  I cherish the rest.<br /><br />Since others ranked, here is my list.  It's hard to rank really..they are all so good.  If you want a good live performance get Freak n Roll into the fog.  Awesome DVD w/ Great sound and HD video.  I think that was the peak of the Marc Ford year(s).<br /><br />Southern Harmony<br />Before the Frost/Until the Freeze<br />Amorica<br />By your side<br />3 Snakes<br />Warpaint<br />Shake your money maker<br />Lost Crowes<br />Lions<br />Live 2002<br />Croweology
B008602KQI|4.0|This is one of those movies that stays with you.  Although not nearly as good as the book - which was really compelling- the movie holds your interest, is well acted, and the costumes and special effects are great.
B0056JJ1M8|5.0|As always, Samuel L. Jackson portrays a character that is a strong individual whom develops the character of others.  The young men in this moving, the basketball players, learn to respect themselves and others, work as a team, hone their skills, grow their minds, set goals and raise the bar for themselves in life.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I want to no more this is a good book buy you will be hook on page one . It is all action and a little romance I don't want to spoil it get this book
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book was hot in the beginning and the middle. However the last chapter went ice cold. It seemed like the author just wanted to be done writing it or meet a deadline. Enjoyed the book though. Reading it makes you want your man to be like him :p
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|When I received the disks initially, there was damage done to the inside of the box and two disks.  Amazaon replaced it rapidly with a new one.  Love the series!  The cast has great chemistry!
B00902AKK4|5.0|Its a really good game for those who like solving puzzles. I will recommend it for especially kids and students it makes learning and playing more interesting
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use this app every day with my bakery accounts and I'm very pleased. It's easy to use and very handy!
1250030951|5.0|Cath has just started college and it's not working out so well. Her twin is too busy for her, her roommate is scary, the dining halls are overwhelming, her father may be having a meltdown, and all she wants to do is write Simon Snow fan fiction--Simon Snow being a Harry Potter like series. Cath has thousands of fans around the world for her online Simon Snow spin-offs, but no friends other than the twin who is now ignoring her. Sound like a downer? It's too funny and hopeful for that.  Cath may skew to the quirky introvert part of the social spectrum but being equal parts snark and heart she's no pushover, and since she's a quick study and has a way with words her witty comebacks when cornered are thrilling. There is a lot at stake for Cath and I found her story irresistible. Building relationships in her own style and finding her own writing voice become complementary journeys in this well plotted but character driven book. Because there is so much in it about writing it's a perfect NaNoWriMo novel for anyone in the midst of trying to pound out 50,000 words of fiction.
B005LAIH2C|1.0|I was expecting an exciting movie and it wasnt, it was awful and a total waste of money! Would not recomend it to anyone
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is my favorite of the hunger games books just the way they worded the horific destruction of district 12 and how they broke down the shield in the games (my favorite part)
B002QE3CTY|4.0|Interesting story, definitely not what I expected. Keeps you guessing until the end. Lots of great descriptions of the maze, which made it feel real. I look forward to reading the next book in the series to find out more.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush is so much fun with many challenges and variety in each level.  It is addicting, intriguing, and captivating!
B007REV4T8|5.0|As always it was another wonderful action movie.  I never get tired of watching 007.  I would recommend this movie if you<br />love James Bond and Action movies!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I thought that this novel would be a dark and twisty thriller, but it goes much deeper than that! It is psychological and thrilling, yes, but also deeply entertaining and explorative of the things that motivate people. I think everyone can relate with both Nick and Amy, and that's what makes this novel so engrossing.
0307278255|5.0|I thought the stories, particularly the interconnected ones, very well written.  Ms. Lahiri's characters come alive, and the tensions between generations are believable.  I look forward to reading everything she writes.
0316113514|5.0|Great book.  Explains many things I have always believed about exercise and the brain.  I am going to buy for all my brothers , sister, and brother in law.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I check the weather often and love how I can see the temperature in the notifications on Kindle Fire, no matter where I'm at!
B000002MX7|4.0|LOVE THIS ALBUM!!! CAME IN THE MAIL PRETTY QUICK. BRSND NEW ALBUM SOUNDS AND PLAYS GREAT,WILL BUY IN THE FUTURE AGAIN.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is a fun game but highly addictive. I just don't like the idea that you need to spend your own money if you get stuck.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Amazon needs to catch up with Facebook. It keeps telling me in the app to update, but Amazon just says open. This is really annoying. It's facebook. But Amazon isn't making money on it so just to check with it then. My Kindle Fire HD isn't just for reading books ya know.
0385340990|5.0|Although I've had my own copy for many years, I recently purchased another copy as a gift for a friend who wasn't aware that the Channel Islands were occupied by the Germans almost from the beginning of World war II, or that the residents were totally cut off from the rest of the world for five years.  The phone cable to both England and France had been cut.  There was no mail coming in or going out.  But more importantly no supplies, food or otherwise, were coming in.  Even the Germans soldiers were starving toward the end.  &#34;Potato Peel Society&#34;, although fiction, is based on accounts of Channel Islanders trapped there for the duration, and is a testament to how they managed to survive with humor and little else while living under the Germans.  Like so many prisoners of war, they were able to outwit their captors throughout their confinement.  The &#34;literary society&#34; formed on the spot to save an Islander from certain death for being caught out after curfew is just one example of their courage and ingenuity.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|I am still in the midst of reading this.  It seems written well and I am enjoying getting to know the main character Mae. The gist of this novel is that The  Circle is apparent social networking company (a fairly obvious combination of Facebook, Twitter and Google, etc).<br />It is fun fodder for those who question all the 'assumed sharing' of our monetized information market. I'm about 1/2 way through and there is some suspense building and the characters are interesting.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|...Outstanding!!!<br />Eminem does it again!  Just wow.  If you're an Eminem fan, you won't be disappointed.<br />Great job - thanks for the music, MM!!
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Seems to be a great starter app to go along with my other methods of learning this great language!  I love the way it revisits things time and again.  Repetition is our greatest learning tool!
B0091REZMW|4.0|Haven't played very long. So far so good. Still trying to figure most of it out. Will rate again the more familiar with the game I get.
B004JXXKWY|5.0|Exposes the hair-raising sub-world of big finance. Well written, easy to understand and enjoyable. six and two more words required.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|This is a very good production of a magic concert.<br />The video is top quality.<br />The sound in the CD is amazing, considering that it is a live performance
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|It would be decent to have more game modes and maps but this game as nice gameplay good graphics and lots of guns to kill with!
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|I'd say this might be the best yet from Eminem..it's got everything you'd expect from an Eminem album and more...definitely recommend
B00BSBR9N6|3.0|At first Don, with his constant BMI evaluations of everyone, is amusing.  However, it grew tiring after awhile. The end was very predictable.  In all, not great but a quick and amusing read for the most part.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I played castle Ville on face book this was fun similar and easy I just started so I guess we will see
B00CH3DBNQ|4.0|I really enjoyed the book and the insight it provided to the struggles of girls and woman in Pakistan against ingrained cultural and religious norms. It was also interesting to read about the struggles with the Taliban and the Pakistani military and the devastating impact on Swat valley - incredible stories - which never make it to the western media.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|The Bourne franchise continues to please with its spacing of releases, pleasing us with anticipation, as well as non-stop spy action.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is a very interesting bookwith no likable characters yet I love it. I have to admit that I haven't finished it yet and I am looking forward to finding some time to sit down and savor the ending.
B00FN811SY|5.0|An accurate easy to understand revision.  Includes an excellent glossary of Bible terms and informative appendices that add to the value of this Bible.  A must have for every Bible lover!
B000FC1192|4.0|Coraline is a bored young girl wo had just moved into a new home. Tired of not getting what she wants and her parents not paying to much attention to her, she is tempted to stay with her other mother who lives in a world behind a secret door. A mother who wats her there forever and always...
B00F35BV64|5.0|The Star Trek franchise will continue to now and then produce a screenplay that Gene Rodenberry, its original creator, would enjoy watching.  Perhaps the films are planned for release far enough apart to get &#34;Trekkies&#34; excited, and still pique the curiosity of other more casual Star Trek fans.  This tactic of &#34;new script on the same foundation&#34;; ( the allegory being that each new Star Trek film can be likened to a &#34;new house&#34; on a similar foundation), to provide a theme of familiarity blended with the excitement of the infinite number of situations future explorers could theoretically encounter &#34;in the cold blackness of eternity&#34;.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book. It touched me and made me think of cancer in a whole new way. Word of advice have a box of tissues near by.
B000FCKPHG|5.0|This is probably the one book that i've read that I warmly recommend to anyone, really anyone! It's way and far beyond all the easy self-help books on the market. With intelligence and humor Carol Dweck takes you into the world of the growth mindset, and, in an easy way, shows you the great research that is done in the field. This is so important that it should be part of any young peoples education. I wish I had ready to long time ago. Aged 33, I know at least that from now on I will do many things differently, and gain from it!
B0089LOG02|5.0|I was equally engaged by both vivian and molly's stories.  So different yet so much the same.  Will read again.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Fun but when your friends &quot;help&quot; you unlock a level nothing happens. Which is  annoying as he'll. But otherwise it's addictive as hell.....
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Hidden pictures in this game are better than others.  Objects are in different locations.  Collections provide tools and energy to keep the game going.
B0064T6LV8|3.0|Mostly for the young grandkids to play, reminds me of playing on a pinball machine growing up and no quarters required.
B001HM1PFO|5.0|Favorite musical of all damn time.  It's from another planet!  Hotter than jail bait! Golden! Delightfully campy and soooo trantastic!
B00992CF6W|3.0|It's a good game but it needs update lots acculy but I played it on my friend's Xbox there is way more blocks and more spawner eggs and mate stuff to do so I suggest that you wait for an update before you buy it but for now it's a waste of time and money and space on the kindle fire
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I finished it but I want to keep playing I wish there were more levels. I also like how you get rebuild a civilization for it as well
B00821OX98|5.0|Nice story line. However the Amazon strategy of asking for $24 to see the end of Season 3 is nasty.<br />I decided it was a good place to stop watching it.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Long the length of rope of time and tide, every man and boy worthy of sail on a lake or sea needs to read this book and decide for him or herself to be worthy of such adventure.
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|Best tower defense game (series) of all time, period.  Awesome graphics, awesome strategy, awesome humor, perfect balance.  This one is a bit more challenging than the first but still totall playable for a novice and a pro because of the differenct difficulty levels.  Very re-playable, I always try to win every level on every difficulty without letting a single bad gy througheach time. I wish I could work for this company.  Oh, and its totally worth the purchase price and does NOT require more money afterwards in order to get the full experience.  Any money that you can spend on the game is totally optional and has NO impact on the quality of product that you purchase at the original price.  Though, this is one instance that I find myself not minding to spend a few bucks in order to have fun with the extra heroes that are available to purchase.  I wish they were a bit cheaper so that I could buy them all, but really the idea of spending the money on bonus material doesnt make you feel mad, its fun!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Loved it. Book three was the best.  Sad at the end but the right way to end this series. I might have chose a they live happy ever after but this author chose a more realistic ending. A great read !!!
B004SDEP38|5.0|Documents To Go helps with the function of<br />online web sites like YouTube.  It improves other<br />internet procedures using documents or files.
B0043X88EK|5.0|The album is fabulous, obviously.  But I can't get it to transfer to itunes from the god*am cloud player.  This is a truly horrendous experience.  I am furious and disgusted.  Why make this hard for us to purchase and enjoy the product.  Amazon, this sux.
B008JFUN6E|5.0|One of the better Sci/Fi dystopian films in a long time, one of the better Sci/Fi films period. Great action throughout, well done direction overall, the story can be a bit slow in spots but that's OK, it's to be expected in most movies, Damon and Blomkamp really capture a great vision of social commentary mixed with entertaining action, (really bloody too, which always helps) and I can't forget to mention Copley as Kruger the the baddie, WOW, a scene stealer!!! he's great.
B00AIBZLVY|5.0|Item arrived on time and as stated.  The movie is truly a horror movie with no blood and/or gore.  Thanks for the speedy service.
0393307050|4.0|Good movie, good value.  My husband and I both enjoy watchiing it.  We also lent it to friends who also enjoyed it very  much.
0061950726|5.0|Kept my attention throughout. Kline did a good job of intertwining two stories, then bringing them together.  My book club loved it, and I've recommended it to others.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|it was such an intense book for such a blah ending.<br />poor thinking on the writers part.<br /><br />disappointed and for that reason won't read sequels.
B00FG1Q5J8|5.0|This is an excellent game! It's single player and doesn't need a net connection so it's perfect for my Kindle tablet.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game except for the impossibly hard levels they put in your way so you will spend money on power ups….. Making people wait months to pass a level is stupid….. I play anyway and never pay them anything!  lol
0385537131|5.0|A truly fantastic novel by John Grisham.  Spellbinding as only Grisham can do it.  I have read all of his books, and as usual he is the best.  Keep them coming!!
B004G7UTXG|5.0|I saw it decades ago and now it seems to be a more interesting movie. I recommend it for anybody interested in history of the Americas.
6305428271|4.0|This is a fantastic movie story line but the language is really bad. Michelle Pfeiffer does a amazing job in this movie
B004GYY714|5.0|Cannot live without this app. It is the best streaming app I have! I am writing this because this stupid rating system asks me to spend my valuable time writing nonsense before it will except my rating. My star rating should be enough!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  John Gresham does not disappoint this reader.  Another court room drama, about the legality of a hand written will is a real page turner, full of twists and turns  with discovery of new evidence.  Follow the clues. But you will still be surprised at the outcome.  Well done, Mr. Grisham.
B008JFUS0U|5.0|With this movie, the Thor franchise has found its perfect feel. Despite an almost overload of secondary characters, each one feels essential to their moment in the story. While different from the previous film, it picks up right where &#34;Avengers&#34; left off in terms of story and feel. The dynamic between Thor and Loki wasn't the usual &#34;let's just fight all the time&#34; thing, and you got the feeling that perhaps they had indeed been close at one time in their lives rather than just always enemies.<br /><br />There is a moment in the film that is the galvanizing hinge to bring Loki into the fight. The &#34;Coulson&#34; moment (to borrow an idea from &#34;Avengers&#34;) doesn't feel like a plot device or like it was thrown in for shock value. Instead, it's a logical progression for the characters and their world.<br /><br />Yes, it's a breathless film when it finally takes off, and it can get a little overwhelming with all the stuff going on, but even then it just feels like a great next step in Marvel films after &#34;Avengers&#34;. &#34;Iron Man 3&#34; was a faltering step for Marvel this year, but this moving gives me hope for what's ahead in the Marvel movie universe. I also love the mid-credits stinger that sets the stage perfectly for another great Marvel movie coming out next year: &#34;Guardians of the Galaxy&#34;.
B008JFUR10|4.0|I know this film was critically panned, but for an evening's entertainment, my family enjoyed this action-packed sci-fi thriller.  The movie brings to life a concept derived from comics and/or anime.  There's no realism or logic to the premise, it's simply entertainment.  For the right viewers, this is a great escape.  Take the movie at face value and enjoy!
B00CA6WLAE|5.0|I loved this book.  By the end I was crying.  I still am crying.  I love these books !¡!  I hope you can keep writing.  Your so talented.  Plus it takes talent to act sing and dance not to mention writing.  But yes I want a book 3.
B0093FNZT6|3.0|I read this book for book club. My view is that Eben reached enlightenment .<br />The book is well written with a precise description of his experience .
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Wow...what a great series and what a great blu-ray.  The picture is great and I love season play.  No spoilers here...Claire Danes is amazing.  I think I fell in love.
B004TACMZ8|2.0|I thought it would work better.  I am unable to trust it with electrical wires, and my $15 Zircon is more accurate for finding studs.  It is also somewhat large.

B0026O475M|5.0|Tom Hanks does it again, I highly recommend this movie to anyone with a sense of adventure.  Great Movie, again.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Vibrant colors! Attention grabbed! My grandson loves to help collect treasures and loves to see the fish.  There are always new fish, with new challenges.

B00APUYWYA|5.0|We all love this movie (from child to teen to parent).  Very heartening.  Love the music, the relationship, the friendships, the event.  Lots of fun!
B0018PH3L0|5.0|Amazing story, great actors.  I recommend this very highly.  I've watched it over and over and will watch it again and again.  5 Stars are not enough...!
B006LSZECO|5.0|A fun book in a twisted way! Very compelling read, as you are led down a path of truth v. fiction in this crazy relationship.

B005I4JG80|5.0|I really like the comparison between American parenting styles and French parenting styles. It's written very well and reads more like a story than a 'How to' book.
B00015YVDG|5.0|I enjoy this movie, Mel Gibson does it again with a quirk in the story, great movie, worth the price.

B00FEHXCIG|4.0|A sequel to both the earlier “Iron Man” movies and the multi-character “The Avengers,” “Iron Man 3” finds Tony Stark suffering from panic attacks after his close brush with death during the traumatic battle of New York that took place in the latter film. Now he’s up against an evil techno genius played by Guy Pearce who’s created an army of exploding warriors he plans to use to take over the world.<br /><br />Written by Drew Pearce and director Shane Black, the plot isn’t all that compelling this time around, but as usual, it is Robert Downey, Jr. who keeps the super hero relatable and life-sized amidst the crassness of the movie’s multi-million dollar production values and special effects. Downey’s greatest achievement is that he manages to be wisecracky and smart-alecky without becoming cynical. This is enhanced by the chemistry between him and Gwyneth Paltrow as his erstwhile ladylove and company CEO Pepper Potts.<br /><br />The special effects are predictably spectacular - with a jumping-out-of-an-airplane scene an eye-popping, heart-stopping standout - but, as with the earlier films in the series, it’s the humanity of the title character that makes it all work.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|I love this group and this CD is out of this world. I would recommend this to everyone.The music and vocals are awesome and this is better than I expected.  It brought back some of the sounds that Stryper is known for. It is just an excellent CD and would be great in your music collection.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|Why is this rated five stars? Robert Downey, Jr. that's why. Lots of action and use of bad language, IMO not appropriate for kids under 9.
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|fantastic story fast paced lots of action well done keeps you on the edge zombies are kinda creepy and fast
B00F35B8F8|3.0|Disappointing, sorry to say.  Got this for my wife, she's the star tek fan in the house, and from the reviews I thought we'd have a good time, but it dragged and left us hanging.  Bummer!  This is what happens when you spend too much time trying to make a period piece instead of making a good movie.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|One of the best shows ever. I have watched these at least three times. A must get for for anybody who likes these kind of shows.
B0054IOWTS|5.0|If you love adventure movies set in impossible locations this one is really hard to beat. Yes I was really disappointed by the dialog in the opening scenes, which is laughable. But once you get past the first 10-minutes, you realize this has all the makings of a compelling drama well worth the running time. And I assure you, all the characters redeem themselves in the end, despite their cartoonish portrayal in the beginning. At least, the few that make it to the end.<br /><br />If you are an outdoor adventure buff, Highly recommended. P.s. the movie is realistic. I've explored caves with underground river systems and I've scuba-dived in the Cenotes (sinkholes in southern Mexico). Although not with the gear they use in this movie!
B0044RUSZM|5.0|Perfectly crafted - makes my MacBook air work flow seemless with a paired thunderbolt monitor. I use it every day.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This is my third Gillian Flynn novel, and now I am wishing there were more to enjoy. This is an excellent story about the impact of dysfunction on the psyche, and coming to terms with people who create ill spaces in our lives.<br /><br />The story revolves around a small town which appears to have its own serial murderer targeting young teen girls. Reporter Camille Preraker grew up in the town and is given an assignment to report on the story and investigate it for her Chicago news employer. So Camille returns to her home town and stays at her mother's house while interviewing local people, but her mother is not what you'd call an easy person to live with. Camille has to face her worst demons, facing a family she may have been emotionally better to keep a distance from, while trying to figure out who might be he story is lively and keeps the mind thinking, especially as the reader approaches the end of the book and starts to put pieces together in the hopes of figuring out the conclusion.<br /><br />Author Gillian Flynn is an expert in popping surprises on us and in writing about dysfunctional personalities. While it is hard to top her novel Gone Girl, this book takes a respectable second place to it. A memorable story, though the content may be heavy duty for some. The story moves along quite quickly.<br /><br />The audiobook is well performed by the narrator, an enjoyable listen for a long commute.
B003R0MF1W|5.0|Loved it loved it loved it can't get enough of it love it they loved it ya I can't wait
0802473156|5.0|Fantastic book. Once you find your love language it make it easier to explain what you need from your spouse, boyfriend and love ones. Also, once you find your significant others love language it explains alot about them and helps to improve your relationship. Absolutely Worth reading. I love this product and recommend it to everyone!
B00C8S9VKM|3.0|I enjoyed it, but it felt somewhat superficial.  This just didn't grab me as much as other books by Bryson.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I love all Mitch Rapp books and will miss his character.  It's nice to think one man could make the right decisions without all the hoopla and lies about politics and save the world.
B002XXUWMI|4.0|Ahh the good old days. This was the harbinger of cgi over simple effects. The Matrix was right around the corner
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I really like that game, playing with my 4 year old is fun time. I dislike all in app purchases. However I do understand that they need to be able to earn money.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Yes, I said it. It's one of the best shows on TV. Updated stories, but still in the spirit of the original stories
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Make sure that you read this book because it will teach you everything you need and want to know. If one direction was reading this paragraph right now, I know they will enjoy reading it because if I love it, they will like it too.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I enjoy the twists and plots that take place in every episode. I watched the first episode and was hooked.
B0012S59ZU|5.0|There is nothing I can or should add to the mythology of this album. Brilliant! By name and nature. Listen
B009ZE27US|4.0|This is a very fun app to play with friends and family.  The funniest part is when adults use it the age is younger and when kids use it the age is higher I guess because adults want to be younger and kids want to be older. So I really hope ever one would get this app because it is fun to use even though it doesn't tell the truth I s still fun to play as y. My family enjoyed it so much .  Mostly when we prank our family members to tell th e truth about there age and we do this as to them and laugh as o hard when it says your 48 or something. So I really hope you get this app. And I hope this was helpful.:D

B000SCHC0Q|5.0|So moving, sad, and unforgettable.  Hosseini's descriptive writing transported me to Kabul.  It is also a great lesson in the history of the many wars in such a short time period.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Very simple and easy to set up for your personal needs. Nice to wake up to music of my choice rather than the same dull buzz.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was great. I loved the challenge of finding the clues. No boredom here! Keep up the excellent work.
B008JFUS0U|3.0|Ok now after that excursion into the wierd world I'd still like for someone to sort of explain how Loki died even though I saw him die but he used his powers to take over the image of his dad Odin and take over the throne after Thor went back to Asgard (Heaven) to tell his dad that he wouldn't want to take the throne because of all the death and destruction that it has and had caused, yes there will be a sequel because there's a short trailer after the credits that I won't give away because the next Captain America is coming up next year 4/2014. I didn't understand where all that jumping between worlds was coming from so I guess those were anomalies, space time continuum stuff.<br />Some of it didn't make much sense to me because it didn't tie in with the first movie or at least I don't think that it did.<br />I just don't think that it was as good as the first one. I was watching some pretty funny stuff on YouTube with these guys in bloopers and there was one sequence where Thor was tossing around his hammer pretty good but kept missing but it was dancing around for something that's supposed to be so heavy.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I love the size and wireless streaming from my phone/laptop, but the limited uses (Netflix, Pandora and Chrome) make it really more of a novelty item.  Hopefully they strike some deals soon to increase the useability of this device.
B00FWPWNKS|4.0|This game is a fun waste of time and battery. The only thing I would change is get rid of the time aspect and go with moves only.
B00G722T22|4.0|I must admit I've never been a big fan, but this album I enjoyed. There are some songs that are not my taste as with any artist. This woman has a beautiful voice with full range to sing anything she wants. She isn't a child anymore and this shows me where she is going! I look forward to hearing where she going.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is a lovely kit! I just hope Google adds full desktop mirroring to support all Windows application.<br />Where's my Netflix trail subscription by the way?!
B000002KB9|5.0|Words fall utterly short of describing the majesty, the evil, the never-before-heard power and darkness of this album, and the legions of worshippers that it created (but I'll try to describe it anyway).  When this album came out in February 1970, critics said it was a rehashing of the late '60s blues rock like Cream.  But it became immediately obvious that it was much more than that, as the fans quickly latched on and copies of the album began flying off record store shelves.  Sabbath had already been playing shows around England under various other names, like Polka Tulk Blues Band, and Earth, and their blues rock jams had garnered a sizeable fan following.  When they went in to record this, their first album, they thought they had only two days to record and mix it, so they recorded it all live in one day so that they would have a day to mix it.  Turns out that the two days they were allotted was for recording, so they could have spent more time on recording if they needed it. But they didn't need it, and in fact one day to record seemed like a lot to them.  They played their live show songs and added some overdubbed guitar and a few sound effects and that was it.  Ozzy sang live with them in a vocal booth and they all tracked together, giving the songs a solid jam feel, and showcasing their solidness and togetherness as a band.<br />Merely a rehashing of blues rock like Cream?  I think not.  Just listen to the first track, just the first 40 secs of the first track and its immediately obvious that this is something much darker and more evil than anything that had come out before, or since.  Then Ozzy starts singing and its immediately obvious again that this is not your same old blues-based rock.  Singing about darkness and evil in his signature nasally and distinctive voice, when he gets to the end of the 2nd verse and screams &#34;Oh no no, please God help me!&#34; he cements the track as the most evil and terrifying song of the decade.  Did they know what theywere creating?  I doubt they had any idea that what they were doing was so innovative that it would be hailed as the creator of the genre of heavy metal.  No other rock band had the element of horror like Black Sabbath did with this first recording, and people graviated to that.<br />Not only are the lyrics and riffs dark, even the tone that Tony Iommi gets out of his guitar is menacing and vicious.  Because of an accident in the factory where he was working, he lost the tips of his middle two fretting fingers, and was almost going to give up playing altogether, until his old boss played him some Django Reinhardt, the famous 2-fingered Gypsy jazz guitarist.  Because of this accident, he had to come up with new ways to make his tone heavy and huge, and in the process created a sound that spawned an entire genre. Think I'm over-exaggerating?  Think again.  There would be no heavy metal without Tony Iommi and Black Sabbath.  Sure there are other bands that helped create the sound that became heavy metal, such as Led Zep, Jimi Hendrix, Deep Purple, Cream, Blue Cheer, Leaf Hound, etc., and their influence should not be down-played.  But Black Sabbath took these inflluences and forged them into a new sound that was far more menacing and dark, which is a crucial component of metal.<br />Anyway, if you like Sabbath's other albums and somehow haven't bought this one yet, do yourself a service and buy this album.  There is so much raw energy and potential in this album that its amazing.  Its not quite as solid as Paranoid as a whole, but it is an absolute necessity to own and stands tall, taller even than Paranoid, as the beginning of heavy metal.<br />If you like classic rock in general, this is a crucial album for fully understanding rock history, as it is a landmark album of the seventies.  If you like new doom metal, buy this album and see where it all began.  If you like jazzy rock tunes and jam bands, there are great jazzy rock jams on here that you would dig.  If youare a heavy metal purist, you already own this album, so buy it on cassette for your car or something.  If you like Zeppelin, Cream, Hendrix, Leaf Hound, Blue Cheer, Deep Purple, AC/DC, Iron Maiden, Metallica, Diamond Head, any rock band from the late sixties or seventies, buy this album, you'll enjoy it.<br />Highlight songs of the album: all of them!  But I guess if I have to choose, I'd say- 'Black Sabbath', 'The Wizard', 'NIB', 'Wicked World'.
1451629184|5.0|The book is very heart tugging but, shows how much the human spirit can endure.  Jaycee is a wonderful strong woman.
B00F6JKT7O|5.0|first effort in 16+ years is them not losing a single step in fact they are better with AGE!  Yipppeee
B00G4ZPE6A|1.0|Way better than Teenage Dream. This album is not just filled with sex with bad overly obvious sexual innuendos that weren't really even innuendos because of they obvious they were. This album even while not perfect is much more consistent maybe a little boring to some as many of the songs are slower paced but it definitely is much more tolerable than most of the tracks off Teenage Dream which was recently voted worst album of the decade by Billboard voters.
006202406X|4.0|I have been waiting for this book ever since I finished Insurgent July 2012.  I reread the first two with my book club (discussing it tonight) on my recommendation and everyone loved the first two.  While I read over a lot of the 1 stars and 5 stars, I have to admit I can see their points.  I was sucked in from the beginning of Allegiant.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br /><br />For me there are some real highs about the book and some What???<br /><br />TOBIAS<br />I LOVE that we got to hear Tobias's voice. Although remembering whose voice I was reading was frustrating - it would have been better if each was written in their own font (one for Tris's chapters, one font for Tobias's chapters).  I think Tobias's voice and thoughts could have been a bit deeper.  I know some people accused him of a being a bit babyish, I just don't see that.  I see a boy who was abused and had to grow up way too fast without love and nurturing in his house.  Once his mom was \\"killed\\" he had to fend for himself and try to not cross his father.  Through his thoughts and in his chapters we get glimpses of this same little boy.<br /><br />WAR<br />I know the end of the war between the factionless and the Allegiant was all too abrupt and really should have been a bit deeper and more complex.  I get why his mom gave in - Tobias watched her sitting and ruminating over the glass sculpture she gave him and what mother doesn't want her son. I think she realized that the evil she was turning into was the same evil her husband was.  But again, this could have been explored and explained in a little more detail.<br /><br />ETC.<br />Yes, there were some people who were gay.  I'm sure there were other \\"GD\\" things that would have been neat to see - like they were all living a secret life because of their genetics.  This could have been explored a bit more, or explained a bit more.  It makes sense why they were in hiding, and I honestly saw that one coming early on, but it would have been nicer for it to be a bitdeeper.<br /><br />CALEB<br />I think he should have died, committed suicide, left the compound, or SOMETHING.  He is such a wimp and pathetic.  His sister RISKED HER LIFE for him and she died instead of him and he still is a wimp???!!!???!!! GRRRRRRRR<br /><br />DEATHS<br />Tris's death was inevitable.  Doesn't mean I didn't spend the last 50 pages bawling my eyes out!  And yes, I had to reread that ending a few times for it to really sink in.  I think her thoughts on death could have been a bit more and I think it would have been greater if she could have killed David while she died.  Revenge is sweet!!<br /><br />Tori's death was quick and not sweet.  I think there should have been a bit more to this - she played a very important role in a lot of ways. There should have been something more about her being memorialized after her death.<br /><br />Huh???<br />So....not too far away they have planes on the runway at O'Hare, yet they've NEVER flown over Chicago????  And the folks in the Chicago compound have NEVER seen or heard a plane???<br /><br />And the secret government outside the compound has sent people in and information back and forth yet they've NEVER gotten caught????<br /><br />And people have gotten out of Chicago as dead and everyone's okay with it????<br /><br />All the evil peeps get their brains washed and can go on living???  Yeah, there's justice for you....<br /><br />EPILOGUE<br />Honestly, I was surprised that Tobias wasn't with anybody else.  I like the character he turned into and the direction his life was heading.  I LOVED that he conquered his fear for Tris.  You really could read the love he had for her in his actions and who he was \\"today\\" as a character.<br /><br />I'm hoping that a 4th book comes out and it's Tobias and his life and how he's rebuilding their world.  It would be great to see the rest of the United States and the world!!!
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|EPIC 3D madness!! So much in the 3D, packaged came fast and in great condition. My son and I, have been watching once a week since it's arrival! Tons and Tons of special features, also.
B000P0J0A6|4.0|This is an absolutely great movie. It will always be a classic!<br />I would totally recommend this movie for everyone!
B000FCK65W|5.0|I can't believe it took me so long to find and read - devour! - this classic.  Its depiction of true poverty in early 1900s Brooklyn and a girl's struggle to survive it should be mandatory reading for all US students.
0553582011|3.0|I didn't start reading Game of Thrones until after A Dance with Dragons was released, and it was the negative reviews of this book that kept me from starting the series for a long time.  I was surprised at the time the negativity the book was receiving.  It made me afraid to read through 4 books and get caught up in a series that apparently turned bad.  So I avoided the series for almost another year.  But as a fantasy nerd I couldn't resist the temptation to get caught up in another epic high fantasy series, so I decided to go for it.<br /><br />I am sooo glad I did.  The series is spectacular.  But without digressing, let me state that I enjoyed this book.  Yes, it's overly-long, I can agree to that complaint.  It's not as concise as the first three, and there isn't amazing plot advancement on every page like Martin expertly crafted in the previous books.  But I didn't mind as much, only because I love absorbing everything in a well established fantasy world.  That's one of the biggest appeals of fantasy novels to me.  I love stories with histories and lore embedded deeply into them.<br /><br />If you enjoy immersing yourself in a highly detailed medieval fantasy world, I think you're going to like this series, and thus, this book.  I can agree its more or less the weakest in the series, but at no point did I want to stop reading about this amazing universe and the characters within it.  Important things still happen, your favorite characters make some big decisions, and the book sets many characters up to do some cool things that should be quite interesting in the next book.<br /><br />Writing a review for a book in a series feels rather odd, only because most people who are reading a series will pick up the next book no matter what the reviews say.  I don't care what anybody has to say about his next book, Winds of Winter, I'm buying it day one regardless!<br /><br />If you are not deeply interested in the Universe of Westeros, and have only been reading the series because, well, the story and plot and twists have been amazing, then perhaps I could recommend you pass on the book and drop the series.  It's at its slowest and least interesting here than any other book, and if the fantasy universe and the bigger picture isn't enough to keep you reading, you may find yourself very bored waiting for characters to do the next big, unpredictable thing.  It may not be worth your time to read this.<br /><br />That being said, I really hope Martin improves on book six.  I still liked ADWD, but even I was disappointed that it wasnt as amazing as the first three.  What fan wouldn't be?  3 out of 5 stars, only because the first 3 novels were 5 star masterpieces, and AFFC dropped to 4 stars, and this is not as good as AFFC, so 3 stars it is.  Here's hoping Martin gets his mojo back for book 6 and blows us away again.ies because, well, the story and plot and twists have been amazing, then perhaps I could recommend you pass on the book and drop the series.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I like it.  I'm not sure if I would purchase it again compared to a Roku.  The device works without issue, for the most part, and was easy to set up.<br /><br />The biggest issue is the 3rd party apps that you are required to use.  Not all of them function that great at this point.  The netflix one sometimes presents difficulties with navigating around, for example.  Not a big enough inconvenience to really trouble me, but it may just be easier to get a dedicated device next time, like a Roku.

There was Hope, but now Despair, I am trudging thru this, afraid I may miss something that will be referred to in a subsequent novel.  Can't wait to finish it.  Makes me wonder where Mr.Child's editor was, appears to have been yawning & not honest with the author.

B0050DIWFC|2.0|While there appears to be a good story the writing drags it down. There's no discernible voice in the novel and the characters aren't terribly likeable or relatable.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I haven't use this knife in the field yet but already can't resist to modify it.  I stripped the paint off, smoothen the factory edge, and change to a wood handle that i bought from ebay, and now it is ready to be admired.  I love the feeling of combining solid metal with hard wood handle.  Although the plastic handle is not bad but just can't stand the artificial feel of it.  A wood handle adds a sense of identity and a connection to nature.<br />A little disappointment is that the new powdered coated version knife comes with only laser printed logo instead of stamped.  The logo barely shows after the paint is stripped and sanded.<br />Sheath is hard and solid.  replacing the nylon part of the sheath with a tek-lok is a good addition for fixed belt carrying.  I would love to buy a leather sheath, but as of now its too expensive.  Perhaps sometimes later in life.<br />Can't wait to use my bk2 in the woods to start some awesome fire.

B00E9A656K|5.0|First of all PROPS to the graphics I mean look at it it's so HD. Second is the gameplay it's so addicting I've been playing for 4 hours straight and I'm on tier two . I highly recommend  this game. Now stop reading this review and GET THE GAME!!!!
B00BGI086Q|5.0|They do a great job with this show. Great action scenes and some great characters. I've always enjoyed superhero movies and tv shows, and Arrow is a spectacular and exciting show.
B000XUBFE2|3.0|It took a few pages to understand who was telling the story.  It's hard to imagine the hardships people had to endure during this period in time.  It is a good book, a prime example of people coming to the aid of others in the face of adversity.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|I'm recommending this to my friends... Cool game, very creative, many hours of play. Next best thing to magic...Well done
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Good book! Very descriptive, very cool and  just an incredibly doin book to read. The Hunger Games are my new favorite book
B00CL151G4|5.0|As a lifelong Sherlock Holmes fan, I was very happy to see the outstanding job they've done with this show. It's updated for modern viewers but the characters are so true to Doyle's vision that the show feels perfect to a diehard Holmesian.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|The first 2 were suspenseful, well-written page turners.  The last book in the series was a disappointment.  She changed the writing style of this book to bounce back and forth between the 2 main characters...it didn't work.  The author wrote in the same voice for both so if you weren't paying attention you wouldn't even realize it had switched characters.  It felt like she was just rushing to get the series done and the whole book felt like she was just making sure things from the first 2 books were tied up with a nice bow.  I could not put the first 2 books down and it was a struggle to finish the 3rd.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Now I found it how to change the folder location where the videos should be downloaded to, now I can download them to the external memory card and I think it's the best youtube downloader for Android out there!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Enjoyed every episode and it just blows the doors off season 2 as so many story lines come to a head.
B00004YA66|5.0|Great movie,you won't be disappointed! Exciting from the start to the end.loved it. Don't know how it took so long to see this movie.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Great book, this book has been amazing for my relationship. I would recommend it to every couple. 5 stars hands down.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Pretty Awesome... Does what it's supposed to... But it's not free... Read the permissions before you download people... But no complaints here...
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The 4 stars is for the application. It's my Candy Crush game, now available on my Kindle. Game has slower response, which is a bit annoying, but it still satisfies my crushing addiction. Also the smaller screen is s big change for my old eyes. I do recommend it to puzzle enthusiasts.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I am reminded of Fannie Flagg's descriptive and enchanting writing style!  This book paints such a picture and makes the reader fall in love with Guernsey!  Absolutely the best book I have read in years!  As an American, I don't think I was taught much about the German occupation, and I'm shocked and saddened to realize how many facts are embedded into this story.  The emotions as we read are quite real!
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie for teens and adults!  My 13 year old loved this movie and has watched it more than once. Unique story with nonstop action!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I think I will like this book a lot of my friends have read it and said it was amazing
B00G722T22|4.0|I have always liked her because of her catchy hooks and lyrics. Her tough girl attitude is a great piece of Rock theater. Her new album revisits some of her tried and true ticks but also explores some territory as well. I found her voice on soe tracks quite different -deeper more nuanced and grown up than her valley girl voice. Nice touch doing a song with Manson!
B003YWUTKM|5.0|Bought it because of David Gilmour. The whole album is excellent. Reminds me of music from early 70's. Gilmour has the ability to sound musical in all contexts.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Just started watching it with the gf. Intense. Also Cranston is an amazing actor considering he was the father on malcom.
B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|Thought provoking implications for New World Order and the use of social media. Subject gives you reason to pause and consider the impact of social media as well as NSA revalations. I would consider this rather critical reading to  begin to understand what the future will look like. Have to wonder if their model is Google? Once you read this, you will never use a happy face, or frown or make a recommendation without thinking about the implications for future. A must read! And, a must share! And, a must conversation!
B005OHTSLG|1.0|actually i didn't read it.  Somehow readers' reviews tell all one cares to know.<br />The interview with Charlie Rose confirms it.  Yes he's cute but boring & self<br />absorbed.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|A true musical legend. He can play anything. Highly recommended! Excellent production. His newest solo work keeps getting better. A classic performance.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|AWESOME!!! Everyone should watch this show =D I wish I would've caught it when it was actually on TV so I wouldn't have had to buy the DVDs!
B008JGSM6G|3.0|An OK game<br /><br />A pleasant and mindless way to while away a few minutes while waiting for an appointment to begin
0394873742|5.0|Getting my son excited to read  books (or even look at them) was a challenge since it just wasnt interesting to him. This book is so big and fascinating it really helped peak his interest. He lays it out and plays with his toys on top, making stories with the pictures. Its still a favorite in the house a year later
B00CTT9646|5.0|Star Trek why wouldn't it be 5 Star. All in one package. All at once. Had too have it all.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved King's book, very hard to put down.  Scary enough to make you think twice about folks traveling in rolling campers.  As long as Stephen writes, I will buy his books - he is my favorite author.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|does the job well, so far no problems whatsoever, a little pricy, but it's from mother ship Apple … No brainer. Well contracted, a must for anyone that needs to do presentations through projectors or TV's/Monitors other than Apple. there are no projectors with Thunderbolt port available yet ...
6305291446|5.0|This is my favorite Halloween movie out of them all! My favorite song from Creed is in the movie and the collectors series has a video by them plus a trivia game.
B008JFUNNM|5.0|This is an excellent movie, superbly acted, tightly scripted and masterfully directed.<br /><br />Paul Greengrass has shown once again he is a master storyteller of real life human drama, as well as building tension for the audience.<br /><br />Tom Hanks is entirely believable as the ship's captain, and the supporting cast is uniformly excellent. Barkhad Abdi, as the leader of the pirates, stands out for his portrayal of a Somali fisherman who is desperately- yet hopelessly- attempting to escape his impoverished life.<br /><br />The true story is told entirely straight, which adds to the attraction of the movie. The characters are presented realistically. There is a sensitive blend of storytelling, action, and character analysis, which draws you into the story. Also, the political dynamics and drivers are explored and explained.<br /><br />Highly recommended
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It is awesome and super fun! Except after you play a round each time it takes a long time to load. Bummer. All around it is a pretty good game
B009JZSC9S|5.0|We are hooked on this wonderful show.Great writing, acting, characters and storyline! We can't wait to see the next episode.
B00G32QIEG|4.0|It had a lot of action and had some funny parts as well. Good overall entertainment with a great group of actors.
B00742GBDM|4.0|I have become a fan of Jane Austen's work in recent years. I had just finished reading &#34;Mansfield Park&#34; when I saw this video available. I do enjoy watching the characters come to life. However, the changes made in the story lowers my favor. Also, the face to camera narration scenes created a more frivolous feel to the story. Fanny is not a frivolous character.
B00594XOZU|1.0|This app is so stupid who makes an app that won't let them log in? Fix it because right now everyone hates this app!
B004Q3UL2O|3.0|Just an ok movie, but depiction of Pharmaceutical Sales was spot on! Would have been a good made for TV movie.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book was a exceptional read but I wouldn't recommend it to younger readers because of how well it depicts how people would react
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I feel like some of the levels are unattainable without boosters. If you don't have friends that play, you're out of luck and have to pay, which I don't feel is fair. Also when you do opt in and pay for the booster, you only get one? Such a rip off! Overall game play is fun. I just feel it's unacceptable that you don't have fair opportunity to earn boosters without paying real money.
B00280LYHS|5.0|The Last book to the series was the best!! It was a great ending to a great series! I enjoyed everything about it. It was thrilling, humorous,and interesting! Riordan made every word worth reading!!!!!!!<br /><br />-C.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Great app. Keep you connected when you are not at home or someone else is on your computer. Use it daily.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This was a shocking story told from the perspective of a five year old boy held captive with his mother in a tool shed. They eventual craft a plan to escape from the hell of the tool shed. This was a truly unique story, I don't think I've ever read a story told from the prospective of a child.<br /><br />I was captivated and finished reading this in 3 days.  I highly recommend it, but make sure not to start reading it unless you have some time to finish because it's a real page turner.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Most beautifully written sad story.  Zusak uses words in an ingenious way to paint pictures of emotions. I'm glad to have found The Book Thief.
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|Only a couple levels in and I'm already loving it! I thought the first kingdom rush was great this by far has been more fun and challenging. Well done!
B004GYY714|3.0|Not a bad app but l have others that are better and easier to use. It will do in a pinch
B007SGLZP8|4.0|John Grisham writes another suspensful novel with unexpected twists and turns. Very entertaining in light of the recent unauthorized prison releases.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|When will we get the  beach format with the air boat ???  Just got it on my computer with Windows 8.  We need an update . Love this game .
B00340LM8C|5.0|A terrific showcase for two Hollywood icons in their prime executing a Hitchcock production! It doesn't get any better than this.
B00DW1WR14|4.0|Can't stop listening to track 2. Mind Your Manners is my NEW favorite Pearl Jam song. Overall another great album from these guys. Hearing some punk influences in the guitar riffs and great writing collectively.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Then when began Bevan Kaman Hagan Smith diversion SanDisk  hahaha Shah Sheehan has Shah Shabbat shamans disposal panic diagnosis sandbag.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Love it....<br />Awesome game.  Easy play great graphics.  Great game for all ages.  Wish food wasn't so expensive, but hey good things are worth waiting for.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This app works perfectly fine, as long as you have high speed internet you shouldnt have any problems. Its awesome, it does everything you would normally do on a smartphone... Had this App for over a year and its Perfect, no glitches.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|The action is minimal however it is a great movie. The end is a bit depressing I expected a happier ending.
