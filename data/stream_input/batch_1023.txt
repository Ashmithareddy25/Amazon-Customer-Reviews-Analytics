B003EYVXSW|2.0|In many horror films people do stupid things, but this film takes the cake. IF there is a correct choice, a bad choice, and a really frick'n stupid choice, you can guess which one they will take.  I like films where it's fun, and stupid (crank, A-Team, or ZombieLand, for example), but I like at least one or two times in the film where people would do what a normal person would do.  Even \\"Bad Santa\\" fails to push you as far as this film does.    Choice: Make the hybrid, or not.... make it.  It attacked you. Kill it, or keep it..... keep it.  It attacks your friend. Kill it, or Keep it.... Have sex with it.  You've come to kill it, but it looks sick. Kill it, or try to nurse it to health..... nurse it.  It's dead. Chop it up for testing, burn it, or bury it in a shallow grave..... shallow grave.  Stab it with a giant stick, but it's not dead. Stab it again, or wait...... Wait for it to pull the stick out and kill you.  You smashed it's head with a rock, after it raped you, but it's still alive. Wait again, or keep smashing? .... wait just long enough for it to kill your friends, then smash.  It raped you. Have the baby? .... sure, why not.    Species was much more exciting, and intelligent...... I can't believe I wrote that...... i just called Species \\"Intelligent\\"..... well.... compared to THIS film... it's ART.
B003X6ZNAA|3.0|After watching the end of Season 5 of Supernatural, I was excited to find another supernatural-type show--this time, set in a beautiful little town in Maine.    That excitement only goes so far.  The female lead's only strength is her open-mindedness to the supernatural; her male co-stars bring unique characters that bring varying amounts of worth to the story; the writing is not as strong as one would hope for a show that's trying to get itself off the ground...and by the third episode, I shouldn't feel that the show is formulaic.    Little glimpses into each character's past improve the show now and then, such as Audrey's association with a woman from the past (who may or may not be her brother), Nathan's inability to feel pain and his branding as a freak by some members of the town, and Duke's, well...Dukishness.    If the writing improves, the characters are properly developed, and the story diverges from \\"he-didn't-realize-he-had-superpowers-and-is-hurting-people\\", this could be a winner.
B00006ADFL|5.0|Truth is often much more enthralling than fiction.  This statement has never been more accurate than when examining Peter Jackson's unforgettable film, \\"Heavenly Creatures.\\" Set during the early 1950's, this film explores the obsessive friendship and desperate loneliness of two young girls.<br /><br />In Christ Church, New Zealand, Pauline Reiper is an introverted 14-year-old who lives with her mother and father, Honora and Herbert.  The family runs a boardinghouse, and Pauline keeps to herself.<br />Enter Juliet Hume, a flamboyant, romantically-minded, yet ultimately tormented girl from an upper-class family.  Her father, Henry, rector of Canterbury college, has moved his family to Christ Church.<br />The two girls meet at school.  They find that they share many common interests: a love for opera, art, literature, and medieval life.  They also find that they were both afflicted with illness at young ages.  As the girls friendship progresses, they create an elaborate \\"Fourth World,\\" and a fantasy kingdom called Brovnia.  fantasy and reality merge with rapid frequency.  When the girls parents try to separate them, Pauline and Juliet lash out in the only way they feel they can.<br /><br />This movie grabs you from the very beginning.  Pauline's lower class life is wonderfully contrasted to Juliet's prestigious one.  Pauline comes from a family who truly loves her, (Sarah Paierce and Simon O'Connor turn in stellar performances as Pauline's parents), yet Juliet comes from a self-centered background.  Her parents are self-absorbed and rarely give Juliet the attention she craves.  Perhaps the most heartwrenching scene is the one where Juliet is abandoned by her parents when she is ill with tubercolosis.<br /><br />Mostly, we see the events unfold through Pauline's eyes.  She sees Juliet's life as ideal and longs to be a part of Juliet's family.  The script intersperses verbatim diary entries from Pauline that provide a glimps into her mind.  I especially liked the fact that the girls were not portrayed as helpless victims, but humans responsible for their actions.  None of the principle characters are \\"cookie-cutter\\" representations but real humans who struggle.  The portrayals are chilling yet also sympathetic.  Kate Winslet is excellent as Juliet.  Her over-the-top performance provides a glimpse into the mind of a wildly imaginative yet sad child.  Melanie Lynsky is superb as Pauline, and the viewer understands how the girls were drawn to each other in real life: they had such similar personalities.<br />My only complaint about the film is the lesbian subplot and the treatment of Christianity.  I can understand why Juliet would have trouble believing God's love, especially when one considers the hypocrisy exhibited by her parents.  Juliet has been reported to say that she and Pauline were obsessive, but they never engaged in a sexual relationship.<br /><br />I just learned from researching the case that Juliet Hume is now writing under the name Anne Perry! I was absolutely astonished! Anne Perry's writing is excellent, and I am greatly comforted to know that both girls are free.  It is truly tragic that such young lives were ruined by irrational fear, and that a kindhearted woman lost her life.<br /><br />This film reminded me of the importance of being a good mentor to children.  We can all learn to give kids support and to be available to help them whenever possible.  Please give this enthralling film a chance.  God bless you all.as helpless victims, but humans responsible for their actions.  None of the principle characters are \\"cookie-cutter\\" representations but real humans who struggle.

0790729989|1.0|I thought Morgan Freeman(Ironically a Cheater himself years later in real Life) and Brad Pitt(on a roll) did their part good,the story is unique but overall I found the movie disturbing and over the top when it came to the mayhem, on top of that you have Kevin Spacey(someone I detest and always plays the bad guy so it is fitting). My problem doesn't lay with the story but the way it carries itself in total disgust.
0307341542|5.0|I received the book at about 5pm last night, and was finished reading it before midnight (in between preparing and serving dinner).  This is exactly the type of book that I search high and low for... it is an on-the-edge-of-your-seat dark psychological thriller, filled with interesting characters, unexpected twists and just enough detail to draw you in without overkill.  I am ordering her second book tonight and eagerly anticipate its arrival!!
9562916464|4.0|This book has been around for a long time; and its an essential to any writer's library, of course the later edition done with white, is a lot longer and a more in-depth, you'll still satisfied with the quick and easy read.
B002VPEAOE|4.0|If you like to lounge about in a book about the class differences of pre-war England and the struggles of the upper classes and the lower classes who serve them, you would probably enjoy this novel.  The mystery unfolds slowly, which suits me well.  Your sympathies stay with the maid who entered service very young and felt deep and abiding loyalty to the family's children, who were near her own age.  The problems of the once important family filter down to her, and she does her best to protect the people she serves, in spite of their faults.  The relationships among the characters are compelling, and the mystery of what really happened that night at the party pulls the reader along throughout the story.
B003OCWF6I|3.0|This is a good action movie, and I was pleasantly surprised by the film when I saw it in the theaters. It keeps the core elements of the comic book series, and manages to not lose the books charm. You DON'T have to read the books to enjoy the movie, but if like the move, the books are even better.
B0017HPHBM|5.0|This was such a great movie.  The Dark Knight was so good that so often people forget how good Batman Begins was.  The special features disc is so cool.  You flip through all the features like the pages of a comic book, and there are so many features.  Great product.  Would recommend to anyone.
0545123283|4.0|I loved Shiver, the first novel in the series, and I was both surprised and excited that it had a sequel. Surprised because Shiver ended so perfectly that I wasn't sure what there was left to say except Happily Ever After over and over again. I was excited because I wanted to know just what exactly Stiefvater could think of next for our two young protagonists, and I knew she would write it beautifully, whatever it was.<br /><br />As the days get warmer and longer, it seems as if Grace and Sam have everything they could have ever wanted. Sam has been \\"cured\\" of his werewolf-ness, and the idea that he has the rest of his life as a human stretched out in front of him is something he wakes up to in wonder every day. Our two young lovers have dodged what seemed like the inescapable bullet, but they are soon confronted with other growing problems.<br /><br />First, the new wolves. Beck, Sam's adoptive father (and also werewolf) returned at the end of the first novel with several newly \\"turned\\" werewolves. One of these new wolves is Cole, former lead singer of the band NARKOTIKA. His face has been splashed across millions of tabloids and magazines, and while music is his life, becoming famous has nearly killed him. Or, more accurately, made him want to kill himself. You name it, Cole's done it. Booze, drugs, hundreds of faceless groupies... the life of a rockstar, the life of endless entertainment and meaningless existence. Becoming a wolf, fated to stay an animal forever in a few short years, is the next best thing to suicide.<br /><br />Secondly, Grace's absentee parents have fully re-entered her life upon realizing that Sam is much more than just some high school fling. Along with the fact that her parents are interfering with her hard-won love life, Grace is starting to feel sick... a sickness she and Sam thought had been cured, a sickness that is inhumane, wild, and uncontrollable.<br /><br />I was just as drawn into Linger as I was Shiver. I think it's safe to say that Stiefvater avoided the \\"sequel slump\\" and was able to keep the story of Grace and Sam together and still romantic. The introduction of Cole as a new character and Isabel as a stronger presence also made for a great story, and while at first I was skeptical of Cole being a cliche drugged-up rockstar with problems and a magnetism that draws every single teenage girl to his self-destructiveness, Stiefvater made it work and Cole didn't feel awkward or contrived at all. I especially enjoyed his interactions with the always entertainingly-prickly Isabel, and I'm looking forward to seeing where they go in future books.<br /><br />Sam and Grace were just as well written as in the first novel, and made me very nicely nostalgic for that unique, once-in-a-lifetime teenage-first-love-passionate-bliss. Ahh. To contrast this, and to provide a conflict, Grace's parents were cold and stupid and a little unbelievable in their newfound stiffness towards Sam. The parents were a little cardboard-cut-out in their dumbness and Total Evil Parent crusade against their daughter's boyfriend, and while it made for great emotion, it felt a little contrived to me.<br /><br />But what makes me really enjoy these books is Steifvater's descriptions of the forest and landscape around Mercy Falls (Grace's hometown) and the world that Grace and Sam live in, whether it's a rundown little diner that you can almost feel the grease on your fingers, or a wild, cold forest. The way the author describes the deadening, bone-shattering cold of the Midwest is so real and all these little details really suck the reader in.<br /><br />Great sequel. I really advise readers to start from the first book, otherwise Linger will be all too confusing!l slump\\" and was able to keep the story of Grace and Sam together and still romantic.

B00127RAJY|3.0|I bought this to see if it would help me lose some weight.  I have plateaued so I was hoping to kick it up a notch to see if it will work (plus eating better will help).  I am only on day 3, level 1 and it's tough.  When doing the cardio part, i try to take it easy or modify (which she doesn't like) by walking or some other movement to keep my heart rate up.  I know many talk about the knee problems and I would recommend the DVD Strong Knees.  I noticed relief after the first time I did the strengthening and stretching.  Of course I will need to continue for lasting relief.  I will continue to use the DVD to see what results I get so that is why I have given it three stars at this time.
B002UZXJA6|5.0|The Songs of the Heart Album is the latest of the outstanding CD's by a   fantastic group. The Angelic sound of there voices can calm any problems  you have and create a serene environment at any time. Although the   members have changed over the years, David Downs continues to find new   voices to fit the style of Celtic Women. Absolutely wonderful.
0156034026|3.0|This story is typical of many we have heard, read & watched about the effects of 9/11. It is but one perspective. The enjoyment is in how the story is being told, although you can guess from the start that it is not the setting the narrator suggests.
B001GCUNW6|5.0|My 3 year old son watches it over and over by request.  He sits thru the entire movie, which is rare as most parents can testify to.  Looks great on BluRay, clever, touching and funny.  My kid loves dinasaurs, so it's a natural hit in our house.  Good buy at the right price.
B003J27WFW|5.0|If you are a Rush fan, you will like this.  There's not as much music as you might expect, but there are other DVD's for that.  This was not intended to just show their music, it was designed to tell their story.  It does that very well.  As a 35 year Rush fan, I thoroughly enjoyed this.
B000SSPL2Q|5.0|This is truly a top-notch collection of the complete symphonies of Jean Sibelius out there....Jarvi, long-steeped in this music, certainly is one of the TWO best interpreters of these works. The other, of course, is Osmo Vanska, that set, also highly recommended [[ASIN:B00005Q450 Sibelius: The Complete Symphonies]].<br /><br />Neeme Jarvi knows these works inside-out, and together with the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra present truly in-depth performances of these Scandanavian monolithic works. DG gives us great demonstration quality sound, strings with a beautiful sheen, and brass with true bite, paced majestically by the inimitable Jarvi, one of the finest conductors/interpreters to come our way.<br /><br />I honestly find no weak links here to speak of, but wish for a less introspective Fourth that carries more involvement, more bite if you will. This is not a complaint, really, as the work still holds together.<br /><br />The other works, filling up the discs, are all first rate, and I must say that I am most pleased to have here included the wonderful \\"Nightride and Sunrise\\" op. 55, not usually a presented work, and truly worthy of disc space and certainly your time!<br /><br />What could I wish for? Well, I wish I had realized that this set was also available in SACD format before ordering it, for only a very few dollars more! What a bargain this set is in SACD...I would urge you to go for that one for the small price difference.<br /><br />The complaint(s) about no documentation are truly minimalistic here, I believe. These recordings are all first-rate, they are presented at a bargain price, etc., and while I usually do complain about no documentation, in this case, DG is forgiven because of what they are giving us at such a great price. Listen, folks, if you need more information regarding these works and Sibelius, it is easily and readily available on line...take this bargain, and spend a little time looking up what you need to know!<br /><br />This set is exemplary....you're in for a real treat, believe me!<br /><br />~operabruinexemplary....you're in for a real treat, believe me!<br /><br />~operabruin

0307454541|1.0|2015 update:<br />The hate I have for this book haunts me. I can not get over how terrible it is and yet people still love it. WTF!!<br />I have recently started making hollow books as a hobby. I think this will be my favorite title to gut and remove from circulation. Most other books I feel a little guilty about. But killing copies of this book is downright therapeutic. Contact me if you'd like one of these special text-less copies.<br /><br />Original review 2011:<br />So many of the other 1 star reviews already say how I feel about this book. I can not imagine what any of the top reviews saw in this book. I'd even heard it pushed on NPR like a million times last month.... &#34;the trilogy of the summer&#34;... blah blah blah<br /><br />Garbage! Trash! Compost material! Rubbish! Refuse! Debris! Litter! Junk! Waste!<br /><br />I mostly get books from the library. I only bought this at an airport because I did not want to take my current hard cover library book on a long trip cross country. &#34;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&#34; was a quick and easy pick before the 7 hour plane ride. I read it for about 30 minutes before tossing it back in my bag.<br /><br />BUT because I have this thing about finishing books I didn't throw it out.... But  the only way I could continue to plow my stubborn why past the 150 page mark was to rent the movie. I am soooo not joking. I had to know that something, anything, or nothing was going to happen in the rest of the book before I could continue.<br /><br />It is boring. It is poorly written and poorly translated (the movie is also poorly translated through both voice acting and subtitles!!!). It is 3x too long for the content. The violent/sexual scenes fall solely into the category of shock entertainment.<br /><br />Save your money for a better book. I wish I had.<br /><br />***************************<br />UPDATE: It's June 2012 and I still don't understand why this story is still so popular. I even went so far as renting the American version of the film that just came out. MUCH better treatment of the story, but the story is still basically crap. I guess I just don't get &#34;it&#34;.he story is still basically crap. I guess I just don't get &#34;it&#34;.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|This is Eminem's best album to date.  I say that, because everybody can relate to these songs.  I don't care if you're blk, wht, esp, or whatever, this is a great album.  This is the more serious side of Eminem, not the joking one.  Talkin '2 Myself, Space Bound, and No Love alone are reasons to sink your face in this album.  You're Never Over had tears coming from my eyes, and this is coming from a grown man who's good at holding his emotions.  I bought Recovery & Curren$y's Pilot Talk, and wasn't disappionted.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Breaking Bad remains the best serial scripted show on television. Season 3 had some great moments and continued the downward spiral of the shows characters, some of them without even realizing it. The seduction of money is at the root of most of the evil in this show. Excessive pride and arrogance is the other major culprit.   While this was a good season the show continues to become more like a Hollywood movie as it gets a little over the top in parts, and pushes the believability factor. They need to keep things interesting and exciting, but I hope they don't abandoned the realizm that was at the heart of the first season, and has been one of the show's great strengths.   (Spoilers)  Walt's relationship with Jessie is nearing a skitzo one as in some episodes he is done with him, even mocking him, and in other episodes he puts his life on the line and everything he's worked for to save him. Both did very bad things they didn't want or have to do, to help each other out this season. Both killed in cold blood and have crossed lines that can't be uncrossed. Interestingly enough, Jessie, despite being a dumber, street junkie, seems to have a more inherent morality then Walt, when it comes down to it.   The personalities and politics of the drug trade are taking their tole, and people are suffering and dying because it. I'm curious to see what role or response other family will have when and if they learn the truth about Walt's money, especially Hank & Maria, now that they have unknowingly benefitted from it.   There were some tense moments this season, including Hank's near capture of Walt & Jessie, Hanks blowout on Jessie, and the  attack on Hank by the Mexican cartel cousins. Not forgetting Jessie's showdown with the drug dealers and Walt's near executions. I'm curious to see how Season 4 will transpire, given the current state of affairs, the relationship between Walt and Gus is likely to only get worse, meaning some drastic changes will have to be made.  If you enjoyed the first two seasons will enjoy this one as well.
0439023483|5.0|Not only could I not put it down but I had extreme whip lash from the constant ACTION!  This is normally a book that I would not read but when a coworker of mine demanded that I read it, I gave in and am so glad that I did.  I understand people's comparisons of the plot to some other books, I will agree that the idea of a game where the opponants have to kill each other in order to win is not a new one but the character detail and the romance and the things that they have to do, not just for the preservation of their own lives, but for the lives of their families is breath taking!  CATCHING FIRE the sequel to THE HUNGER GAMES is equally as good and I am waiting with baited breath for MOCKINGJAY in 21 days!  A MUST MUST READ.

B000FC1PFW|5.0|Evil Under the Sun is a fantastic book by the one and only Agatha Christie. It starts off when a famous detective, Hercule Poirot, goes to the Jolly Roger Hotel for a nice relaxing vacation. Among the other guests are Arlena Stuart, a beautiful, man-stealer, rich woman. Events turn wild and Arlena is murdered. Who on earth would do such a thing? I thought I knew the exact person who killed her but the ending reveals a very different story. This is a GREAT book and it keeps you guessing until the last page.    -Corinne, 13
B002ZG980U|4.0|I went to the show to go see this thinking that it would just be another run of the mill Sci-fi flick. However, I was pleasantly surprised at the original plot and beautiful cinematography put into the dream and fight sequences. I especially liked the \\"dream within a dream\\" concept. The acting was good, but Leo is in it so you know it would be. The supporting cast did a wonderful job as well. The only issue that I have about the film is that they didn't quite explain how they created the technology or the hardware to hack into an individuals dreams. However, I could have forgot something and this is the type of film that you watch a second time just to make sure there wasn't something you missed. I'm really hoping that they make a sequel for this, and I'm sure they will, because the movie ends in a cliffhanger. This is definitely going in the DVD collection when it comes out. 4 1/2 stars for me.
030726999X|5.0|I happened upon the first book, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo by accident.  It wasn't typically a book that would catch my interest.  Once I started reading it, I could not put it down.  Same with the second and last book.  I thoroughly enjoyed my time spent in Larsson's trilogy.  I HATED to come to the end.  Three of the best books I have ever read.  Highly recommend these books to anyone and everyone.  The best!!!!!
B002ZG9788|4.0|im a huge fan of the original, hollywood does greek mythology. great story there, the best haryhausen ever. didnt catch the 3d version, but im pretty happy with my blu-ray, its pretty damn crisp. and i like it, it puts the whole story into a deeper base, and i think its well done.  my only gripe is the tendency to try to 'overpack' the action scenes, much like the transformer movies, theres just too much going on, im just a mere mortal, i can only comprehend so much visually. i end up knowing that something took place, what exactly, i couldn't tell you. why would you spend so much time and effort to produce a blurry, mediocre action sequence? i know somebody hit somebody with a sword, or something, but for zues'sake let me see it.
030726999X|5.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo<br />The Girl Who Played with Fire<br />The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest<br /><br />Stieg Larsson's three-part novel celebrates the author's admiration for powerful women through the typically masculine authorial device of having all the women fall for his idealized persona, Mikael Blomkvist.<br /><br />The series of over-capable women who beg to have sex with Mikael includes a variety of characters, but Larsson isolates power as their core charm by focusing on the one who wouldn't seem to have any others, Lisbeth Salander.  She has no figure, bad hair, no \\"personality,\\" and doesn't cook, but aside from that ...<br /><br />In Lisbeth, Larsson essentially gives Edmond Dantes (aka le Comte de Monte Cristo) a baby sister who shares her big brother's super-human powers, updated for the Information Age.  Like Dantes, Lisbeth merges fantastic cunning and physical strength to escape imprisonment, work the system for an inexhaustible fortune, and create an unstoppable extra-legal machine of revenge for the outrages suffered by women in general including herself, and more particularly her mother (vs. his father in Dantes' case).  She even celebrates final victory by sailing off anonymously to an island in the same sea as Dantes' isle of Monte Cristo.<br /><br />The Mikael-Lisbeth team's adventures in suffering and righting wrongs provides the crime-thriller framework for the trilogy.  Larsson writes plainly but unerringly and with detail and patience, yet he stuffs the trilogy with so many Hollywood camera-ready set pieces that you might suppose he also hoped to rival Dumas for sheer derring-do (and box office).  But I think Larsson was wiser than that.<br /><br />What rescues the novel from being a Larsson/Blomkvist wet dream is not just its political correctness but above all its ambition to rescue Lisbeth from the powerful woman's signature cynicism towards men and the world in general.<br /><br />Lisbeth has it all, including taking sex whenever she wants it from whomever she fancies (female and male), and she generally looks down on the world, both for its glaring evils and just because she is so superior.  She is also in a way more fortunate than Mikael in that the series of men who are interested in her are older and wiser.  Mikael's women think he's cute and want his ... um ... body.  Lisbeth's men think she's terrific and want her to grow up.<br /><br />Larsson has enough perspective to cast himself (Mikael) as somewhat cavalier about relationships, but he also endows Mikael with an abstract ethical sense that he applies to society through his career in journalism and to Lisbeth as her friend.  It's Mikael who harps to Lisbeth on Larsson's definition of friendship as a combination of \\"respect and trust.\\"  Lisbeth's other influences -- Palmgren, Armansky, Jonasson, Iversen (the judge), and one woman, Mikael's sister Annika Giannini -- all lecture her on the need to stop treating others with disrespect.<br /><br />The author reads Lisbeth's mind as she gradually opens herself to appreciation of others (mainly men) as full people, who might want her (or any woman's) body in the right circumstances but who also just happen to like and respect her.  (She's pretty wonderful, after all.)  It takes Lisbeth a while to see that she might be happier (and more just) if she were to accept and reciprocate their friendship, with whatever quotient of affection that might include.  As the trilogy proceeds she's getting there, and remember that at its end she's only 27 years old.<br /><br />Larsson leaves the reader to imagine the course this will take.  In the trilogy's closing lines, Lisbeth debates letting Mikael into her apartment for coffee, a friendly gesture that she decides to make even though it is still a challenge for her.  But as it happens she's wearing only a towel.<br /><br />So, what will it be?  :-)le and male), and she generally looks down on the world, both for its glaring evils and just because she is so superior.

B003ITZBVI|5.0|alot of us know whos under the hood, for those who dont, i envy the revelation. very well done, top to bottom. i wondered if dvd vs. blu-ray would matter for animation, its really better, thats all i can say. Mark Hamill doesnt voice the joker, bummer, but johnny D (bender) does, and does pretty darn good. im putting in five stars, alot for the animated action, well choreographed (how? that wouldve been a great extra feature), mostly for a great story, and a good job of showing so much DCU history in one event without skimping on story.
B003A3K3JW|5.0|So many commercial releases are all about hype and Dudamel has been hyped more than any conductor since Bernstein obviously, or Karajan. He is clearly galvanizing and inspiring to the orchestras he conducts. I work with many New York Philharmonic players regularly and to a person they speak of him in hallowed tones. Still, I cast a jaundiced eye on these things usually. This release would prove me wrong. It is remarkable and mainly for one reason. R H Y T H M!!!!! You could scarcely ever hope to get a better account of this piece than the Esa Pekka Salonen traversal a few years back with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. That sounded so good and they had played the piece a thousand times in the years prior to the Disney Hall recording. The orchestra was tight and seemed to play the score as if it was in their bones. I listen to this though and think, \\"OH MY LORD, that is what Stravinsky wanted in his dreams RHYTHMICALLY!!!! RHYTHMICALLY!\\" The engineering is odd at times with classic DG highlighting of certain instruments to heighten the effect of this or that section to the detriment of the overall balance. The rhythm though is really incredible. Everyone should hear this Sacrificial Dance. Has it ever sounded inevitable??? Anyone who has ever heard it assumes this fact, \\"Stravinsky wants you off your guard. He wants to keep jabbing at us rhythmically. You must not be able to get it in your head. The accents must always surprise and confound.\\" Well.....do you think he ever wanted it to swing and feel in the groove and tight as a drum in all its asymmetry????\\" Maybe not, but if you want to hear a Sacrificial Dance that sounds as together as the Atomic Count Basie or the New York Phil playing Symphonic Dances from West Side Story, then buy this record. I still can't get over it. Yes, Gergiev is essential as is the Salonen. The Rattle is an also ran at this point and the Dorati and Bernstein hopelessly overrated (and this is coming from a Bernstein fanatic--the Bernstein video of him rehearsing this with a youth orchestra in 1987 is an absolute must). Get this. This piece will never grow old.\\"  It is a miracle and puts Stravinsky up there with the greatest composers to ever pick up a pen. Just astonishing. R Mathes
B00000IYWH|5.0|Elvis was HORNY for music after 2 years in the army (who ever drafted him was an idiot). And it shows on this fabulous album. This is what Elvis sounds like when The Colonel would spare him the silly movies. Here Elvis enormous talent just flows with a bunch of superb musicians and songs to work with. One of the best by ANYONE ANYTIME!
0316017922|4.0|We read this book for our book club, and I found it very interesting! Although, there were some things that I thought were perhaps a bit of a stretch, I loved to learn the backgrounds of the people he discussed and the possibilities of the effect it had on shaping their futures. It will definitely be an interesting discussion at book club.
B0000CAQ26|1.0|Pink is trying way too hard to shove her attitude in the faces of her listeners with this album.  Every song has some atempt at being the bad rebel chick somewhere in it.  Besides that, the songs just don't stand out to me at all.
B0021L8V0M|2.0|At first glance, Salt  looked like it had a lot of potential to deliver a thriller that utilized both pulse racing action and a strong female lead. However, it's unfortunate that that's all the film really was. Other than Angelina Jolie beating the snot out of men twice her size for an hour and a half, the film offered little else.<br /><br />It makes sense that children who are trained to be Russian spies while they're young would be capable of doing extraordinary things that the average human being wouldn't be able to, but Salt seemed borderline superhuman at times. The ability to handle various firearms and making homemade bombs out of cleaning supplies is one thing, but climbing around skyscrapers and bouncing off the walls like Spider-Man seemed like a bit of a stretch. The way she'd steal things as she was passing by came off as more of an unlikely repeated occurrence of both luck and convenience rather than a skillful attribute.<br /><br />The storyline is also ridiculously outlandish. It includes such gems as Lee Harvey Oswald actually being a Russian spy named Alek and a rather predictable plot twist in the climax. One of the weakest parts of the film is how inconclusive Salt's motifs come off as. The film was probably trying to keep you guessing as to whether or not Salt was actually a spy up until the big reveal, but her actions appear more confusing than anything and are relatively unclear until the end. Then her reasoning behind her actions just seemed so one-dimensional and dull that you wonder why you even bothered to watch this thriller to begin with. Not to mention that the film has a bigger open-ending than Predators did earlier this year.<br /><br />Salt does deliver some fast paced, bone crunching action and features an incredibly strong female lead, but its preposterous and predictable storyline drags it down. Salt is way too similar to everything else Angelina Jolie has done to go out of your way and see. The bottom line is the film treads familiar ground that you've already seen before and has probably been done better. If you're dead set on seeing Salt, I strongly encourage you to wait until it hits DVD and Blu-ray. Otherwise, skip it altogether.already seen before and has probably been done better.

B00005RFAI|2.0|When will artists realize that \\"Nobody understands my pain.  Nobody likes me.  I am so misunderstood and unapreciated\\" is not a good act to try to make a career out of.  Pink is just trying to sell the rebel rocker thing too hard here.  The only song I like is \\"Just Like a Pill,\\" and don't ask me why I even like that.  Her first CD was so much better.
B003ITZBW2|5.0|Since Batman TAS ended I have always looked forward to the new DC Universe animated movies featuring the Dark Knight.  And while I enjoyed Gotham Knight, Batman/Superman, and the JLA movies, I always wanted something more.  Well Bruce Timm and the boys delivered with Batman: Under the Red Hood!!    It's Batman's world:  dark, raw, and violent.   The only way it should be presented.  The animation, storyline, and voice actors were spot on.  And while I am partial to Tim Conroy as Batman, Bruce Greenwood does Gotham's favorite son justice.  Even Doogie Howser kicks butt as Nightwing.      I would even go so far as to compare this movie with Batman Begins and The Dark Knight.  A bold statement, I know.      Bottom line, if you love Batman buy this film.  It is outstanding.
0307456633|5.0|There are many detective series featuring women sleuths, ranging from gentle Miss Marple and not so gentle Agatha Raisin in the quiet English countryside, Amelia Peabody in Egypt, various others scattered throughout the United States and Canada but this series takes us to a place few stories have taken mystery readers to before - Botswana.  Our sleuth/guide is Precious Ramotswe, a woman built to traditional African proportions, who after an unhappy marriage took the money left to her by her father and opened up a detective agency.  Her specialities were mostly the small everyday matters that touched the lives of her neighbors, the wandering husband, the rebellious teenager to name a few.  What sets this apart from the usual woman detective cozy is that it is set in Botswana, a landlocked nation in southern Africa.  Precious is very much an African woman, and not just in her 'traditional build'.  Her outlook on life and her approach to solving her cases are also African - she seeks out the truth in her cases but also considers what is in the best interests of all parties involved.    This is very much a cozy series in that the story of Precious' life both past and present is as important as her cases.  This is the first book in the series so there was a great amount of time spent on establishing back stories for the main characters.  There are quite a few subplots that promise to be dealt with in later books.  This has been made into an HBO series, one that diverges slightly in some details from the books.      This is a delightful series of charming stories told in a gentle voice.  The stories are G, or at most mild PG stories making this a great choice for cozy fans ranging from young teens to senior citizens while still engaging those in between.
B003ICWTR4|4.0|Loved this DVD.  Even after having seen Bruce perform live over 10 times, I do not get tired of watching him--this DVD is no exception.   Loved the unique cover of \\"London Calling\\" AND Bruce's genuine surprise that he ain't as young as he used to be (see moment on the stairs in front of the stage).  At that moment, he uses some colorful language which is refreshing and spontaneous.  As with most of Bruce's live performances, it starts slowly and builds to a rewarding frenzy.  I was dancing and singing along in my living room.  You will not be disappointed in adding this DVD to your collection!
B003OF3R0S|5.0|Love this album! They once again did an Amazing job! The Rev would be proud
B003EV6DBM|2.0|It's taken a long time for me to finally admit what has been obvious from the moment the new rebooted series first graced the screens in 2005, the \\"new\\" Doctor Who is pure schlock and an insult to the original classic series.  I've been a fan of Doctor Who since accidently stumbling upon it on PBS since the mid-1980s.  I eagerly awaited its inevitable return.  But what came back was not a revamped, serious adult science fiction program, but a childish, poorly written cringe inducing cross between the Power Rangers and Lost in Space.<br /><br />The \\"Big Bang\\", the final episode of this series is emblematic of the failures of the new series as a whole.  The Doctor is bestowed with nearly super human abilities and a near total fixation on his sonic screwdriver, which has gone from merely opening doors to doing everything just short of revitalizing the dead.  The plot is riven with Sci Fi mumbo jumbo that doesn't even attempt to make any sense, complete with interwoven time streams that break all \\"laws\\" of time travel that the series has put in place.<br /><br />Nearly half this \\"epic\\" episode is filled with a rehash of the adventures of the current series and an emphasis on the personal life of Amy Pond.  Its climax is literally a fairy tale.<br /><br />What has been most disappointing about the new series, putting aside its near relentless multicultarism, political correctness, fixation on the Earth, and soap opera focus on the Doctor's companions personal lives, has been its failure to introduce anything new and memorable.  What interesting new companion has traveled with the Doctor, what new alien species has arisen to threaten the universe?  Destroying Gallifrey and the Time Lords in the Time War was a questionable maneuver, (especially in light of the series continual story lines involving the Daleks, who were supposedly destroyed as well), but at least it opened up new possibilities.  The Time Lords kept order in the Universe and the Daleks kept lesser species atbay.  Who has arisen in their absence?  Although there are vague references to the \\"Shadow Proclamation\\" controlling some kind of international constabulary, this angle is never explored. What's left is hardly worth watching, let alone reviewing.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Wow, im not much of a football fan or a country music fan but neither are that apparent in the movie. the story line is well written and the message is more sound than any movie ive seen in a long time. Well worth watching more than once.
B003O86MY8|4.0|Being a huge David Garrett fan,(I own David's complete collection, both European and US releases and have seen David perform live twice)I anxiously awaited the release of Rock Symphonies.  I am enjoying David's latest offering but am able to see that the quality has slipped.  I don't place the entire blame of this artistic falter at David's feet, rather I blame his record label.  These people are relentless and look at an artist that is producing money and buzz with $$ signs in their minds.  Their concern for the heart and soul of an artist is too far down on their lists.  They push artists to perform and create at a pace that fails to allow for the time necessary to produce greatness.  The whirlwind that is created around David Garrett is quite exciting and easy to get caught up in.  These artists are made to feel that they have a limited amount of time to make their mark on the Big Stage(a concept that Record Labels endorse, since the bottom line.....producing money is what really matters to them).  I sincerely hope that Mr. Garrett will be able to get the time needed for future projects.  I plan to enjoy his music for many years to come and hope that The Big Machine does not diminish David Garrett's considerable talent.
1591391105|5.0|The title hooked me.  The introduction intrigued me. \\"The president of the United States gets 100 days to prove himself; you get 90.\\" The first chapter plowed new ground with five propositions on transitioning to a new job. \\"Too often...the new leader behaves more like a virus...\\"  Really? Why?<br /><br />In this remarkable book (I can think of seven transitions where this book would have saved me--and others--major pain), Michael Watkins, a Harvard Business School prof, delivers a thoughtful and well-reasoned plan for what he calls \\"critical success strategies for new leaders at all levels.\\" It's the difference between virtuous and vicious. He says, per Proposition #3, \\"that the overriding goal in a transition is to build momentum by creating virtuous cycles that build credibility and by avoiding getting caught in vicious cycles that damage credibility.\\"<br /><br />I'm recommending this to all my clients.  The first 90 days of a new job are critical for everyone: first-time managers, long-time managers now leading new departments, plus first-time CEOs and experienced CEOs recruited to other organizations. \\"Like swimming,\\" says Watkins, \\"transitioning is a teachable skill.\\"<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest a-ha moment was his brilliant segmenting of the four kinds of organizations (or departments).  Which one did you inherit in your last transition?  His acronym, \\"STARS,\\" describes the four: Start-up, Turn-Around, Realignment, and Sustaining Success.  A successful CEO of a Turn-Around may fail at a Realignment.  Chapter 3, \\"Match Strategy to Situation,\\" is worth the price of the book.  The \\"STARS\\" theme oozes out and through all the chapters.  Example: rewarding success is easiest in a Start-up, and rarely acknowledged in a Realignment.  He explains why.<br /><br />He gives examples across all sizes of organizations: small departments, medium-size companies and then an astounding example from Coca-Cola.  Warning leaders than no one is immune from the perils of transition, he discusses the CEO stint of Douglas Ivester, promoted to Coke's CEO in 1997, after serving three years as president and COO.<br /><br />\\"But Ivester was unable to make the leap from COO to CEO. He refused to name a new COO, even when strongly pressed to do so by Coke's board of directors. Instead, he continued to act as a `superCOO' and maintained daily contact with the sixteen people who reported to him.  His extraordinary attention to detail which had been such a virtue in finance and operations, proved to be a hindrance in his new position.

B003OF3R0S|5.0|I have listened to this one since grabbing it this morning and can't stop listening. It's a very good tribute to Rev and a masterpiece of heavy and haunting music. I do wish they had paced it better, but I think the album does what was intended and reminds you of the great writing the Rev was capable of. Their best to date in my opinion.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I suspect this first CD was intended to show Susan Boyle could sing in a variety of styles.  And she can.  From secular to religious.  Ballad to blues. Now, in her next CD, I look forward to her settling in to what she feels most interested in and comfortable with. Her version of \\"Cry me a river\\" is a delightful surprise.  \\"How great thou art\\" was enjoyable but not extraordinary. This CD demonstrates her voice range enables her to tackle almost any song she likes and with pleasing styling.  As enjoyable as this CD is, however, I bet those which follow will be even better if her handlers let her be.  A great start for Susan Boyle.

1934356557|5.0|Having been a database developer for nearly 10 years, I have learned the trouble areas that we can get into and wished that I had a resource like SQL Antipatterns: Avoiding the Pitfalls of Database Programming long ago.<br /><br />From dealing with SQL injection to learning how to store data in a more logical way to many other goodies of database programming that will help you from falling on your face, this is a great text.  It's also a niche market that I haven't seen in other SQL/database books in the past.<br /><br />Keeping that in mind, this is by no means a SQL reference book.  This is for the experienced database developer/admin that wants to improve their skillset, not learn how to write basic SELECT and UPDATE queries.<br /><br />Great book!!<br /><br />***** RECOMMENDED
B003OF3R0S|4.0|I have been fan of Avenged Sevenfold since the begenning of their carrers. Like most of you , their last album disapointed me alot.Not long after , they lost their drummer. I really thought it was the end of Avenged. But , they're back with Nightmare. To be honest i didn't expected anything from them and i listened the album just because i tought it couldn't be worst then their last cd. I was right. This album is, in fact , really good. Mister Shadow don't scream too often but the guitars and the drum are pretty good.It was a great suprise. The end of the album , 2-3 songs , is not as good at the beggening that's why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Still a great album , but not perfect. If you're a fan of Avenged Sevenfold , got buy it right away , you won't be disapointed this time.

B002ZFQD0E|3.0|Yes, I admit that I eventually got with Janelle Monae's Metropolis.  I bought this one and if you couldn't get enough of her the first time, this is a JMonae-Fest for you!  Lots of catchy tunes and a non-stop beginning to this CD are the positives.  I let the CD run while doing chores around the house and nothing makes me press the fast forward button.  It is like a soundtrack, overtures and all.  Only thing I didn't like was that there were no lyrics included this time.  There are some times when she gets screechy in the voice...I strongly advise anyone just discovering this artist to make sure they get the first CD and make sure they like it.  She takes full artistic license with this one.  I wonder what she's going to do next.  As interesting as this foray has been, a third CD on this same premise is going to get old.

B003OJBWGK|4.0|With their debut album, Los Angeles popsters Best Coast deliver a flavorful collection of sugary pop tunes slathered in a lo-fi sonic haze that suggests the raw energy, youthful exuberance and addictive hooks of early Ramones (\\"[I Wish He Was My] Boyfriend\\" could easily be a companion piece to the Ramones \\"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\\") mixed with the sweet melodies of the Go Go's. This is pop of the bubblegum variety to be sure, but it's not your typical generic brand. It's pop with a slightly twisted soul and just enough tongue in cheek humor to make it palatable for both teenage girls and middle aged hipsters.     Singer/songwriter Bethany Cosentino pens lyrics from the viewpoint of a down to earth if rather insecure and self conscious every girl who blurts out her feelings with the kind of simple honesty that's as endearing as it is amusing. Whether pining for a boyfriend or repeatedly declaring to a crush that \\"When I'm with you I have fun,\\" Cosentino isn't out to change the world or to provide any earth shattering truths or revelations. She's content to merely revel in the immediacy of a young woman's feelings as she navigates the pathways of romance and emotional pratfalls. \\"Maybe I'm just crazy,\\" Cosentino opines in the uber catchy title track \\"Crazy For You.\\"     Some listeners may be put off by the limited scope of the album's subject matter and the repetitive lyrics, but then again this is the sound of a band just starting to realize its potential and not stepping very far outside its comfort zone as it shapes its identity. There's time for complexity later on. For now, let's just appreciate the musings of a woman who can sound perfectly sincere when uttering lines like, \\"I promise you I won't be such a brat. If I promise you anything, I promise you that.\\"

I used the concepts from this book to create a highly effective marketing plan during an internship, and worked on a team to help bring these concepts to life throughout my current company. This is a must read for anyone who regularly needs to make messages stick--politicians, business leaders, teachers, marketers, pastors, parents, etc. What's perhaps most interesting is that the Heath brothers write the book true to the principles they espouse, making the book highly readable, interesting, and memorable.
0061124265|5.0|So this was an amazing book. I will preface my review by saying that, yes I did read the book because of the Sarah Michelle Gellar movie coming to DVD/Blu-Ray in August (yeah that's right, I am pimping SMG to you), and I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie. Now I'm worried that the movie won't be that great, because it's a very psychological book and the thoughts of multiple characters are put on pages and I don't know how well that will translate to the screen. I guess we'll have to wait and see.   Anyway, Veronika herself is an unusual character. She had no real reason for her attempted suicide beyond the reason that she just wanted to. As the back of the book suggests, Veronika was beautiful, intelligent, and other attractive adjectives... so why did she want to die? The book never really goes over that too much, mainly because Veronika herself doesn't know, so why should we, the readers looking onto her life, know more? Moreso the book asks the question of Will Veronika live?. And you don't find that out until the very end of the novel. I'm not too sure whether or not I liked the ending... on one hand, I kind of wanted it to happen, but on the other I didn't. It's all very confusing and I'm limiting myself here because I don't want to give away any spoilers. I recommend that you just read the book. (:

You will not be disappointed by getting this DVD - it will leave you hoping the show comes back for more!!!  p.s. That was my flashforward - that we were watching the new season next fall.

B003L20ICE|5.0|Powerful picture of the imperfect, complicated, painful and yet loving and nurturing family landscape.  The film succeeds in showing that the construct of the family doesn't really matter, traditional or none traditional, the issues are familiarly same.  Due to the presence of 2 female partners, the story's increased sensitivity and sincerity (Moore and Bening play outstanding roles of Nic and Jules as a lesbian couple) pulls the viewer right into it.  Anybody, who loved, was married and tried to do the right thing while raising children won't be left untouched and unmoved by the film's authentic and comical at times attempt to explore the depth of the human soul.

I feel like with Aphrodite Kylie has really hit a high point in her career. Her first albums (Kylie on up to Let's Get To It) were a little too cheesy and assembly line produced for my taste. Rhythm of Love was an exception. Then Kylie went experimental for albums Kylie Minogue and Impossible Princess, which I quite enjoyed. With Light Years, she returned to dance music only with a more knowing and professional edge. Light Years, while sometimes a bit too campy, had some great tunes that I count as some of Kylie's best work. Fever followed and gave us her biggest international hit as well as a plethora of other great songs. A lot of people didn't care for the followup Body Language. With an album like Fever, it's hard to follow up without taking heavy criticism and comparisons. Body Language was kind of a departure from her previous work but I actually liked most of it. Can't please everyone I guess. With X, Kylie gave us an edgier pop sound and I liked the majority of the album although there were a few songs that didn't fit and should have been left off. Aphrodite, however, is more highly enjoyable and listenable with far fewer clunkers than most of the predecessors.  The album is not perfect, but it's closer to perfection than the previous releases. The album's opening track \\"All The Lovers\\" is a beautiful declaration of love and not being afraid to feel it \\"even if it throws you to the fire.\\" I won't get into the social undertone of this song because that's not Kylie's biggest appeal in the first place. I will say that this song really moved me. Count on Kylie to deliver a statement without taking herself too seriously and thus making it look effortless and unintended -unlike some artists who feel the need to beat you in the head with their views.  The album is so listenable and fun without being pretentious. Kylie is an artist who seems to know herself. She doesn't need to go egocentric on us and force her ideas and philosophical wanderings into our faces. She lets us escape from the dimness that real life puts us through and join her in her world of dance and smiles. She makes fun dance pop. And she does it well, especially this time around.
B00005O3VC|5.0|I was looking for a copy of \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\\" to introduce my son to the genre (and see the movie myself again).  This item is the movie, absolutely no problems with the product, good price too.
B00004Y6NW|5.0|Since this album came out, this has been one of my \\"go-to\\" music selections.  I have worn out two copies if it in vinyl, a couple if cassette tapes, and have never tired of it.  I've had it on my hard drive, but have missed having it in my car.  I finally broke down and purchased the CD and have realized just how much I really like this album.  I guess with as many copies of this album as I have purchased over the years, I have helped keep Mark Knopfler in guitar strings.  It is definitely one of my top ten albums.
B003OF3R0S|2.0|I've never really been a big Avenged Sevenfold fan in the first place and nothing has really changed. I heard the new track on the radio, and found out Mike Portnoy(Dream Theater) was playing on all the tracks, so i gave it a spin. Yes i know its about The Rev(drummer) and his death last year, but if the guy died from a lethal dose of alcohol mixed with prescription drugs then he must have been suicidal, or troubled in some way. The songs are just very simple and the production is very thin, Portnoy really adds nothing to the band and isn't nearly as freelance off the wall with his playing as there former skinsman. Some of the guitar riffs and harmonies are pretty good but the album really just falls flat because most of the songs are mellow and you really wait for something catch or the song to really take off and it never does. In a few cases like \\"Buried Alive\\" for instance the song takes its time but eventually has a decent uplift towards the end. The singers voice really just sounds worn out in most cases, but is actually pretty strong on God Hates Us, only this missing is the All, Slayer anyone? So i agree with some of the people who think this band sounds like a hopped up version of a glam band such as L.A guns and actually they resemble them quite a bit. Now if you want to start bashing go ahead, just remember these guys are not METAL MESSIAHS as i've said before, they are what they are. But fans of this band are very rude and seem to take it to personally when someone doesnt like them. I could care less if people like what i listen to and i'm not going to cuss them out and be a jerk about it just because of this. So do me a favor lay the $%$k off and do the same, its just a band. And this thing about the drummer dying and being disrespectful is just ludicrous. If he mixed drugs with alcohol then obviously the dude had a problem, tragic? Well kind of, but not really. R.I.P though. So as i said the album just doesnt do anything for me, as none of the other ones did, they do have a few catchy choruses here and there but other than that, there is NOTHING special about Avenged Sevenfold. As a matter a fact some of the songs really suck, there i said it, crucify me now, send me straight to hell for the burning. I don't like Neil Diamond but i don't have anyone leaving nasty comments when i give him a bad review, so get over it.:D
B000F4RHB6|5.0|This is a great CD ! All the songs on it are enjoyable. I choose this CD to put in my car's CD player over and over again !
B003ITZBW2|5.0|Just watched it today, I had to comment about it. People always complain about the voice actors...the cast did great..Batman, Nightwing, RED HOOD..they all sounded great.I'm not going to comment on Joker's voice, instead I will praise his animation...Joker looked GREAT. The movie is much adult oriented this time, ..good. I can't recommend it enough..great moments, shocking and touching at the same time. the final battle, the final scene..the intro music, which is the same played at the end could be used for a live action movie. I want to see more of the guy behind the red hood...    SPOILER ALERT; Remember what Joker does with a pencil in THE DARK KNIGHT?...watch this movie and see what he does..with a glass..and be surprised like I was.....ENJOY IT for what it is, a dark, violent, good BATMAN story.  I would love to see the Killing joke....
141690977X|3.0|When I got this book, I just wanted to read something that would make me laugh. Mission accomplished. I thought this was a funny book. I could relate to it bc I have friends in some situations that were described in the book. I will pass this book on so I don't have to be the one to say 'he will call'.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Words cannot encompass what this album means to me. When I heard it, I knew right away, that it was what I had been waiting my whole life to hear. Its taught me so much. Every song is laden with meaning and a powerful message. I genuinely pity those who are too shallow to grasp it. To me, this album is more than just music and Radiohead is more than just a band; they're the soundtrack to life.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is the best workout ever! I am very, very impress with how fast level 1 has made me feel.  The first day after my workout i almost die of how tired i felt and how hard it was, but i went and did it again. I have not yet worked on level 2 bc i am still working on achieving level 1 successfully. I really recommend this dvd bc what one week of working out with it, no gym has done for me over a month period! This dvd workout is the best! It was the best money spend! I felt the change in my body after the first workout! no dvd workout has done that for me! and trust me i have brought one too many, so i know what i am saying!
B003JZT2AW|5.0|As a longtime Oasis fan, I bought this to support the band I love and get the music videos in high quality. As a compilation, this is certainly better than Stop the Clocks which is the only major Oasis release that I refused to buy. If you are so inclined, buy this package to get a US viewable DVD of the bands music videos and give the 2 CDs with the singles to a friend and keep the live disc for yourself.
030726999X|4.0|I liked the third book, but I did not like that the main character had a less active role in this one.  I also thought the first half was slow and the last half wrapped up too quickly.  It definitely appeared to be written for a sequel.  Unfortunately the author has passed away.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|\\"Stranger than Fiction\\" is a funny film following a boring and regimented man who works for the IRS. As he performs his daily menial tasks he begins hearing narration of his own life. The film progresses as he attempts to determine who is doing the narration and begins to examine his own life at the same time. Working as an IRS auditor has few perks and some funny scenes ensue as he attempts to perform a job that he begins to realize has very little appeal to him.     Will Ferrell's interactions with his fellow castmates is right on and all of the performances are believable and revealing. It's amazing to see the correlation between film and writing and the depth of study into literature and writers is excellent. This film shows an appealing humanity and smart humor that everyone will enjoy.
B003OF3R0S|4.0|On Christmas 2009, Jimmy \\"The Rev\\" Sullivan handed in a demo for a song he had written entitled \\"Death\\" and proclaimed, \\"That's it, that's the last song for this record.\\" Three days later, the Avenged Sevenfold drummer was found in his home, dead from a lethal mix of prescription drugs and alcohol. On Tuesday, A7X will release that record, now called Nightmare, which is not only the last physical recording of The Rev's legacy, but also his tribute.<br /><br />Musically, Nightmare picks up where 2007's self titled release left off. The sonic maturation that A7X has shown on every disc continues not only instrumentally but also in the vocal timbre of singer M. Shadows. Long gone is the blood curdling screamer from Waking the Fallen; what remains in his stead is a hard rock voice with a strength and tone no less unique than the icons known only by one name: Ozzy. Halford. Dio. (Shadows? Perhaps, if A7X continues on the path they seem to be destined for.)<br /><br />As Virgil led Dante through Hell, so Shadows leads us through the band's own descent into darkness, greeting us on the album opening title track, \\"Now your nightmare comes to life!\\" What follows is vintage Sevenfold: tight, syncopated guitars over a steady and churning rhythm section that veer off into chaotic but melodically fluid harmony guitar leads and blistering technical solos. Synyster Gates and Zacky Vengeance can arguably be called the greatest guitar duo since the turn of the century and certainly have earned the right to be named among such stalwarts as Downing/Tipton, Murray/Smith, and Degarmo/Wilton.<br /><br />With such familiarity emanating from the speakers, it's easy to forget that The Rev isn't holding it all together, as he always had before. In his place is Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy, who along with the always capable Johnny Christ on bass make up the backbone of A7X on Nightmare and the subsequent tour. Considered by many (and also The Rev) to be one of the greatest living drummers in the world, Portnoy shows admirable restraint and respect for his late predecessor, remaining as true as possible to The Rev's written parts from the demo versions of the album's tracks. That's not to say his mark isn't on it however. \\"Natural Born Killer\\" is classic Portnoy with an extreme double bass section punctuated by his single signature splash hit. The rocker is also indicative of the album as a whole and most likely predictive of A7X's future.<br /><br />While it starts out with an almost grindcore passage of metal brutality, \\"Natural Born Killer\\" is, for all intents and purposes, a hard rock song. And while also containing more than a few moments of metal brilliance, Nightmare is, in fact, very much a hard rock album. At this point it shouldn't really surprise anyone - the biggest stylistic change from metalcore to melodic metal happened between Waking the Fallen and City of Evil and all the \\"hardcore\\" fans who complained about the band \\"selling out\\" at that time are (hopefully) long gone. Since then, the band has continued to gradually evolve into what they are today.<br /><br />Avenged Sevenfold haven't abandoned their roots though. Songs like \\"Buried Alive\\" and \\"God Hates Us\\" feature some Metallica inspired thrash that would make any metalhead proud. And these songs don't come off as bones thrown to older fans - they're very much a part of who A7X still is and probably, to some extent, always will be. But the majority of riffs and rhythms throughout Nightmare rely more on blues based progressions than ever before. A perfect example of this is \\"Tonight the World Dies,\\" a dirty bayou blues rocker with some wicked slide guitar work reminiscent of a Louisiana voodoo version of STP's \\"Interstate Love Song.\\"<br /><br />There are a few missteps. \\"Danger Line\\" comes off as generic and uninspired and probably shouldn't have been programmed so high up in the track listing. The play-by-numbers metal ballad chorus of \\"Buried Alive\\" is a letdown after a wonderful opening filled with Zeppelin melancholy. And whoever mixed the album should be ashamed that Johnny Christ is buried so deep. But in the grand scheme of things, none of this matters.<br /><br />The central and most important focus of Nightmare are the lyrics and the overarching theme of death as well as the guilt, bitterness, and doubt of those left behind. Equal parts diary and therapy, the album is unapologetically the bared soul of lives torn apart by The Rev's tragic ending. \\"Will you stay away forever? How will I live without the ones I love?\\" sings Shadows on \\"So Far Away,\\" an intimate letter to The Rev; a song of all the things that remain unsaid, of the feelings that we all take for granted in our most precious relationships. It's heartbreaking - but not without hope as Shadows knows he will be reunited with his friend again admitting, \\"I'll see you...when He lets me.\\"<br /><br />It all culminates with the final song that The Rev turned in last Christmas, now called, \\"Fiction.\\" Written before his death, the symphonic epic sends chills to hear the foreshadowing in The Rev's own words, \\"Left this life to set me free, took a piece of you inside of me. Now this hurt can finally fade, promise me you'll never be afraid.\\" In the ultimate emotional turn, The Rev's own vocals were left in the recording and they are soul crushing as he sings, \\"I know you'll find your own way when I am not with you.\\" His voice fades out and Shadows picks up his part, and his burden as the one left behind. The song is a masterpiece and the greatest gift The Rev could have left for us.<br /><br />The album closes with Save Me, a perfect bookend to the album opener. Opening with a discordant instrumental symbolizing the attempted escape from the hour-long Nightmare, the song continues to chronicle the theme of being left behind and the pleas to join The Rev in the afterlife. The realization arrives that the \\"nightmare\\" of The Rev's passing may feel like a dream but they will inevitably awake into a reality where he is gone and nothing will bring him back. Although still angry and bitter, Shadows know he must go on alone and begs, \\"Help me find my way.\\" And though he can't join his friend yet, he knows that they will always be connected as he repeats, \\"Tonight we all die young,\\" until the album comes to its end.<br /><br />For better or worse, Nightmare can only be judged in light of the tragic events that preceded it. Because of that, it's hard to critique an album where the listener transcends the musical experience to become a voyeuristic observer of the bands grief and recovery process. But while uncomfortable at times, it is ultimately hopeful, and needs to be recognized as not only an important addition to the A7X discography but also a powerful statement about losing the ones we love and living in the aftermath.whoever mixed the album should be ashamed that Johnny Christ is buried so deep.

B0021L8V0M|3.0|Last night's bargain-rack movie was \\"Salt\\" starring Angelina Jolie. I found it on the five-dollar rack at Wal-Mart. I watched the director's cut. Well, it was one of these fast-moving, high-action, violent movies with little depth of thought. It's also one of these post-cold war movies where  Russia and America are still locked into the mutual destruction thing. Yaawwwnnnn!<br /><br />Jolie plays Evelyn Salt, supposedly and American girl who's parents were killed in a Russian car wreck. She returned to America and eventually worked her way into high levels of the CIA. But wait, she was originally brainwashed (trained) to be a sleeper agent for Russia and was awakened in the US by the capture of her trainer during a questioning period. Well, she then reverted back to her Russian training and become a potential assassinator of the president of the US. Well, this story had more twists and turns than the Mississippi River and I just lost interest in this bizarre  and impossible fantasy spy adventure. It's a high adventure action flick and some of the stunts are really amazing and will hold your attention. Likewise, there's a lot of bullets flying, death and destruction. Jolie plays a one-wonan destruction crew, and not too convincingly. It's an interesting twist, however.<br /><br />The movie is hard for me to rate. The story/script is nonsense. The acting is reasonably good. The sets and stunts are spectacular. It held my attention and was good entertainment. Would I watch it again? No.
B002ZG9846|4.0|What can be said about Kick-Ass the movie... I thought it was a pretty damn good movie. I'm always on the fence when Hollywood decides to make a comic into a movie mostly because I'm always afraid they're going to butcher it (images of 'Wanted' flashing before eyes) so I usually end up watching them just to be sure that they paid the proper respect to the original story (Welcome images of 'Watchmen' flash before eyes). With Kick-Ass, they stayed pretty true to the original story even as far as the ultra violence goes because if you read the issues, it's pretty brutal. They deviated significantly with \\"Big Daddy's\\" story and also the relationship between Dave Lizewski (Kick-Ass) and Katie Deauxma his \\"love interest\\". I guess American audiences aren't quite ready to see how those stories truly unfolded cuz they most definitely did NOT happen the way the movie portrayed them but regardless, I still think they did a pretty damn good job with the movie. They went in a different direction adding a comedic element to the movie but that worked cuz throughout the movie I remember being shocked by the violence (in a good way) and also laughing quite a bit throughout. They definitely went a bit overboard with the whole jet pack gattling gun at the end there but all in all it's definitely worth the buy. Oh and if you haven't actually read the original story and can't quite afford the $20 PER issue and HIGHER for the single issues, do yourself a favor and buy the trade. Excellent read
B000MNP2KI|4.0|I have to admit that I have seen every James Bond movie. I used to watch the marathons on TBS during summer vacation when I was in elementary school. (Marathons also watched include...Elvis musicals and Frankie Avalon beach movies.) Casino Royale has changed the texture of the Bond genre. Gone are the tired cliches of the classic James bond movies, we now get to see a little bit into the mind of James Bond (He has a mind?) and begin to understand his motivations. I have to applaud the film makers in picking this particular book as a platform for the new James Bond, Daniel Craig, it allows Bond to start over in film and in person.    I have read the book, and while the film is different, I didn't like it any less. Daniel Craig brings a realness to James Bond that hasn't been seen for a long time. It was great to see all of the cheesiness removed and a physically fit and young guy play the lead! I highly recommend this film to all Bond and non-Bond fans.
0756655730|5.0|Should you or your teenage children be interested in prehistoric life on Earth then this visual history book is a must.<br />Not only is the text and time graphs of excellent quality, so are all the pictures.<br />You will find too much information and have to make a small personal plan for absorbing everything.<br />The book is modern, may be a bit heavy, but a pleasure to study, also for readers entering the prehistoric age for the first time.
0807126063|4.0|I wanted to read this book because everybody told me that it was the funniest thing they'd ever read. There were a couple of parts that made me chuckle, but I never at any point had to put the book down because I was laughing too hard. Despite this fact, the book is still good and worth a read. Also, I could see how someone nostalgic for \\"old\\" New Orleans (pre-Katrina, mostly) might enjoy this book.<br /><br />One thing is for certain. O'Toole definitely showed some promise, and it's a shame he didn't live to grace us with more literature.
0143038419|5.0|The book follows one woman's journey to leave her past behind and grow into her present and future.  I truly enjoyed the book.  For someone who has undertaken major changes in life before and is contemplating another, it was both enlightening and encouraging.  I highly recommend this book!!
B002OT731E|1.0|Don't get me wrong, I love the Rolling Stones. Which is why I wanted to leave this review. Those of you who love this group are probably going to hate this CD. I love these guys' music, old and new. But this CD was atrocious! They really didn't sound like themselves. I kept trying to listen to the CD: I'd have it on in the car and, after a few minutes, I'd find myself thinking, \\"What a horrible cover!\\" . . . only to remember that it isn't a cover: it's really them. The whole CD sounded like some crappy band was doing a Stones tribute. DO NOT BUY THIS!!! :P

1400052173|2.0|High on the list of science books, Amazon listed \\"The Immortal Life..\\" I had just finished reading a science book, \\"The Anatomy of an Epidemic,\\" by Robert Whitaker, and I found it a \\"knock-your-socks-off\\" educational experience--and interesting! I wanted to read another science book, so I downloaded this book by Rebecca Skloot to my Kindle. I thought I might learn about cell culture, how cell cultures can be used to discover new treatments for cancer, etc. What I found instead were a few scattered pages about cell culture, especially of Henrietta Lacks's cancer cells, and countless pages that droned on and on with details about how Henrietta Lacks and her family were poorly treated in the 1950's. Someone interested in the bad treatment of blacks in the 1950's might like this book, but I much preferred Whitaker's book on mental disorders and psychotropic meds for interesting scientific information.
1597801585|4.0|As a long-term resident of Thailand and as an avid science fiction reader, I knew I HAD to read this book not because of its odd premise but to proofread for cultural, geographic or linguistic errors... so my initial interest in Windup Girl was one of cynicism.<br /><br />If you're interested in the more intricate details of what Bacigalupi was talking about when he mentions Thai places, language and customs then read further below. If you want to know if I liked to the book or not, then read this: Yes, though I don't think it's good enough for a Hugo award. And yes, I do hope he writes a sequel, albeit with my humble assistance.<br /><br />The first half of the book immerses the reader in Bangkok geography with prominent locations such as Rama 9 Road, Ploen Chit, Yaowarat and the Chao Phraya River. Bacigalupi places the future windup spring factory on Rama 9 Road, when currently the area serves as a residential/commercial area, unsuitable for industrial use. Given that the Bangkok in Windup Girl is of the future, this can be looked past. Yaowarat is described as a slum suitable for the `yellow card' immigrants who are of Chinese-Malay origin. Modern day Yaowarat has some of the highest land values in Thailand so it seems unlikely for it to become a home to poor immigrants but at the same time, Yaowarat is also known as Chinatown where most of the shopkeepers are of Thai-Chinese origin. Having the Chinese-Malay immigrants housed on the same land of the Thai-Chinese paints a picture of sympathetic existence in a new country. So, the locations in Bangkok aren't glaringly incorrect, just a little skewed in favor of the future plot of Bacigalupi. My only problems with are the occasional cobbled roads (there are none), the supposedly `long walk' from Rama 9 Road Yaowarat would actually be quite the overland trek by foot and Rama 12 Road, which will most likely never come into existence (touchy subject, honestly).<br /><br />There is a mixture of Thai, Chinese and Japanese in Windup Girl and the language depends on which narrative path is followed. Hong Seng uses some Chinese words which I don't understand, Jaidee and the other Thai characters use Thai which though the Romanization is bad I can still understand it, while Emiko is Japanese and speaks all three languages which is confusing because the italicized could be Thai, Chinese of Japanese. I had a big problem with the Romanization as it wasn't standardized. I didn't know what `heeya' meant because of the bad spelling, which should have been more properly spelt `hia' or `hee-a' which means a villain (or a person who brings bad luck, also the name of the monitor lizard). More Romanization which made me flinch were `kothorh' (kau tote), `padh seeu' (phat si-ew) and the province of Kanchanaburi was misspelled as `Katchanaburi.' When characters drink alcohol, Bacigalupi calls it `laolao' but I've never heard it called that before though `lao' means alcohol. Perhaps he meant `laokhao' which would be rice wine but it's a forgivable mistake.<br /><br />Culturally, I found just one or two flaws as I did with language and location. All the Thai characters go by their full first name when in reality Thai's will use a nickname, only using their given name in formal circumstances. One would often find modern nicknames in Thailand like Pear, Apple, Pepsi, Ice, Soda instead of the traditional names Chaya, Kanya, Ratana and Jaidee. And the biggest no-no came when Bacigalupi changed the feudal/social hierarchy of Thailand with `the king places the environment ministry above even monks.' I had to shake my head at his and strongly disagree as even the monks are above the king in the hierarchy as they are the sole vehicles for the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha.<br /><br />The last quarter of the book made me smile as Bacigalupi started to include some in-the-know humor which would fly over the heads of the average reader. It started to feel like he kept an eye out for the science fiction readers in Thailand... namely, me. Bacigalupi includes the name Chart Korbjitti as significant to Thai folklore on page 213 when in reality Chart is an award-winning Thai novelist and columnist (I've actually read two of his novels before). There is a scene on pages 215-218 when the female characters Kanya and Ratana confront each other when Kanya is of lower rank and has to `play the part of the dee' while Ratana has to `play the part of the tom.' This is a tongue-in-cheek reference to a lesbian relationship (lady and tomboy) which I won't go on about, but it's still quite funny how he slipped that in there. Bacigalupi even manages to swear in Thai with `kot rai' which means `damn evil' or another word stronger than `damn.'<br /><br />Windup Girl is also somewhat timely as some of the conflict is between the white shirts and the yellow cards, which in the past four years in Thailand the conflict has been between yellow shirts and red shirts... both equally destroying the image of a peaceful kingdom. Also included is a militant religious group called the Green Headbands, though the militant Islamists in the south of Thailand have yet to foil like in the capitol of Bangkok.<br /><br />All in all, it was a good solid novel even with its sometimes flighty characters, annoying conversations with a ghost and vivid descriptions of a jade phallus in action. If Bacigalupi pens a sequel to Windup Girl, you can expect me to be waiting in line for it if it even reaches the shelves on the poorly stocked bookstores of Kinokuniya here. I'm a fan.<br /><br />*** Maybe it was simply an oversight that Bacigalupi included the word `Chapter' only in front of chapters 19, 26 and 28 but he had me conspiring for a while flipping through the pages trying to find a common theme in the chapters, yet to no avail.des the name Chart Korbjitti as significant to Thai folklore on page 213 when in reality Chart is an award-winning Thai novelist and columnist (I've actually read two of his novels before).

Bacigalupi even manages to swear in Thai with `kot rai' which means `damn evil' or another word stronger than `damn.'     Windup Girl is also somewhat timely as some of the conflict is between the white shirts and the yellow cards, which in the past four years in Thailand the conflict has been between yellow shirts and red shirts... both equally destroying the image of a peaceful kingdom. Also included is a militant religious group called the Green Headbands, though the militant Islamists in the south of Thailand have yet to foil like in the capitol of Bangkok.    All in all, it was a good solid novel even with its sometimes flighty characters, annoying conversations with a ghost and vivid descriptions of a jade phallus in action. If Bacigalupi pens a sequel to Windup Girl, you can expect me to be waiting in line for it if it even reaches the shelves on the poorly stocked bookstores of Kinokuniya here. I'm a fan.    *** Maybe it was simply an oversight that Bacigalupi included the word `Chapter' only in front of chapters 19, 26 and 28 but he had me conspiring for a while flipping through the pages trying to find a common theme in the chapters, yet to no avail.
0440242401|3.0|I am a big fan of this author and while I enjoyed this book, it is far from one being one of my favorites. There were parts that were funny but it didn't make me laugh out loud, the way Shopaholic or The Undomestic Godess did. I also didn't really enjoy the plot line (spoiler alert!) involving the main character being being an adultress. It wasn't a terrible book - just not a great one.
B001TD1XWG|4.0|I was hesitant buying this cd after looking at some people's reviews for it. But after taking a brief listen i decided to go buy it. It is definately different from the norm for him but, i like it. Of course im in to rock music alot too but, its a nice change of pace cd for me. Really like \\"Drop the World\\", \\"Paradice\\", and \\"Knockout\\" but, as i listen to it more i think more songs are going to grow on me.
B000OVLBEO|1.0|The special effects are quite excellent.. But..    If you paint a turd gold you still are left with a gold colored turd.    Anybody who read the comics should be insulted.. anybody who didn't probably should feel that way as well if only due to the lack of any real acting by a rather good cast of actors most of which have enjoyed in other films.    Personal Note/Whine:  Worst part of this movie for me was seeing what they thought was Blackheart.. They took the son of the Devil of the marvel universe and cut off his balls.. at least they didn't make him sparkle when exposed to sunlight and give him a boy band make over.. no... wait.. I guess can only be glad they didn't make him sparkle and did a decent job with the eyeliner...

B000F4LPJ6|5.0|Kinji Fukasaku made a superb movie about an apocalyptic future in which violence, overpopulation and depletion of natural resources surround the Japanese environment in the boundaries of the third millennium. A chaotic world is depressed into total anarchy. The young people don't want to know anything about taking classes.<br /><br />But then an injured professor will assume a deadly project: a mortal game where its participants must kill each other until juts one survives, being the winner.<br /><br />And so this horrid human chase will take place into a desert island. A solid script filled of violence but smart reflections about the value of the human life, specially when you are turning around the fists of clock: three days of Darwinian survival.<br /><br />Don't miss it.

1932100385|5.0|The China Study was recommended by my son who is a Chiropractor and recognized that I needed to change my eating habits. I have Prostate Cancer and am following some of the suggestions from the book. The research that has gone int this study is amazing and should be recommended reading for all parents that are concerned with the well-being of their children. What we have eaten throughout our lives has poisoned our systems and what we can learn from the studies done from observations of other countries is unbelievable. Nutrition is everything and adjustments to our diet will help us live longer, happier lives.
B003HARV3Y|1.0|This book was awesome. The movie was unacceptably horrible, it was a waste. A waste of time... effort... and money (mine and the cost of production).     One normally expects movies to be a bit inaccurate... one also accepts that there is a certain.... value, per say... that is lost in the transition of book to movie. However... what was done to this book is unforgivable.     Nothing is accurate. Nothing even touches good acting. It was a mediocre film with a whole lot of \\"nothing\\" thrown into it.     I thought, perhaps, that it might be because it was made to target a much younger age group.... however, the comment Persephone makes,\\"I've never had satyr before....\\" leads me to believe otherwise. Also, even if the movie WAS targeted for a much younger age group, even that fell short. My four year old AND nine year old, were unimpressed. My friends six year old was so captivated by the movie... he fell asleep.     In the production, a lot of important information was cut out.... I would say roughly... all of it. It makes me wonder if they will even attempt a sequel. .. I certainly hope not. I cannot even fathom how they will tie everything in.     Once again, I  know that books and their movie counterparts are rarely exactly alike... however... EVERYTHING is not normally lost in the transition.     I will not be seeing the sequel, or anything resembling a take in the novels again. I refuse to commit  my time or spend my money supporting such a colossal waste.     I would give this movie zero stars if I could. If you want to be unimpressed, rent it from the redbox. But please, do not waste your money on buying the DVD.

0786838655|5.0|Start with an entertaining story, with plenty of conflict, solved by both fighting and thinking.  Add humor, and good references to Greek and Roman mythology.  Throw in some likeable (and unlikeable) characters.  End up with a thoroughly readable and enjoyable book. I plan to continue with the series.
B003ITZBVS|4.0|I've always liked Batman. No, the comics aren't always great. The movies are either too silly or too serious for my taste and the animated versions seem to keep trying to immitate the 1990's cartoon (with the exception of the fun 'Brave and the Bold'). While I wasn't completely sold on the original comic-story, Batman: Under the Red Hood mixes the darker sensibilities of modern Batman incarnations with the fun and emotional context of the 1990's animated series. The result is surprisingly good.<br /><br />Like the comic, Batman: Under the Red Hood involves a new vigilante in Gotham city named 'Red Hood'. Unlike Batman, Red Hood kills criminals but seems to be doing a more effective job at cleaning up the city than Batman ever did. As the Dark Knight investigates this new player he's forced to confront past tragedies as well as villains Black Mask and The Joker. The story (written by comics writer Judd Winick) doesn't always ring true and is told a bit un-evenly in parts (usually unvolving some rushed but neccessary exposition and a cool but out-of-place opening fight scene) but the emotional connections between each character keep things grounded and the final confrontation between Batman and the Red Hood is a knockout! The action scenes are also well done, even with the somewhat blocky character designs.<br /><br />The voice work is quite good for the most part. Bruce Greenwood won't make you forget Kevin Conroy but he's appropriatly brooding as Batman/Bruce Wayne. Wade Williams perfectly mixes fun and psychotic as Black Mask and Jason Isaacs and Neil Patrick Harris give brief but memorable contributions as Ra's al Ghul and Nightwing. I liked John DiMaggio as the Joker for no other reason than that he didn't remind me of any other incarnation (and if he sounds a bit 'off' I blame some uninspired dialogue). As good as these voice actor's were however it's really Jensen Ackles as the Red Hood and Vincent and Alexander Martella as the two different ages of Jason Todd that steal the show and bring real weight to their characters.<br /><br />While Batman: Under the Red Hood may not be the best Batman story ever, it is a VERY good one. If you're a Batman fan or just looking for a good superhero flick that won't waste too much time (at 75 minutes) this is definitly worth a look!how and bring real weight to their characters.    While Batman: Under the Red Hood may not be the best Batman story ever, it is a VERY good one.

B003HLM2QO|4.0|Scream, is one of Ozzy's best albums. The band sounds great. At times, I can hear Zakk's \\"influence,\\" on a couple of tracks. Gus G, is a good guitarist. He gets the job done. Though, he doesn't stand out from the other guitarists that Ozzy has worked with in the past.<br /><br />Tommy Clufetos, plays drums and is quite good. Rob Blasko Nicholson, returns on bass, and is a great bassist.<br /><br />There is a raspy quality to Ozzy's vocals throughout the album. His vocal style may be changing, for better or for worse, yet he can still deliver. The album is full of energy. Something one can expect from an Ozzy album.<br /><br />I think Scream, is up there with such quality albums as, Down To Earth and No More Tears. Its sound touches upon his great early releases, too.<br /><br />Standout tracks include; Let It Die, Time, Digging Me Down, Soul Sucker, I Want It More and Let Me Hear You Scream.
B003HARV3Y|4.0|I loved the books, and mythology. this movie is really good in my estimation..but they did leave out some key characters from book. uh, clarise? duh? all the ares bit? and isn't percy supposed to be younger? alot younger--I saw a clip that the author was on set--what happened?! maybe like the HP books/movies--they'll get better as they go along. in a book, you can do anything w/the characters. translating to movie, a little harder. clash of the titans was almost all CG, we don't want that. but we do want the imagination from the books to eek itself out to the movie version...don't we? anyhoo, it's still a pretty good adaptation to movie screen. hoping it really gets way better. give it a view...
B00005K3O4|5.0|I thought I had seen the worst films every made, but then, then I saw this.  And somehow, with the tacky story, silly plot, absurd situations, I was still charmed.<br /><br />All the town kids are up at the town's make-out place.  Just hanging around in their cars.  Suddenly, something falls from the sky!  Is it a falling star?  The heroine and hero start walking through the dark woods to find out.  And what do they find?  We already know what will be there, because the town's bumpkin just took a look!  It's a circus tent in the middle of nowhere.  And in that tent, which is really a flying saucer created by design challenged aliens, are killer klowns.  Just stopping by earth for a little fast food.  They quickly begin wrapping the towns folks in cotton candy cocoons (to save for latter).Obviously, the heroes must save the town.<br /><br /> Not since Hark Tsui's vampire film, or the wonderful Indian movie, \\"The Fog,\\" have I seen such a genuinely stupid plot.  But I loved every minute of it.  This is just so much fun.  I guess there must be talent in there to create something like this.<br /><br /> This film, with its underlying social commentary,  will make you laugh, make you cry, and maybe, just maybe, learn a little something about yourself.  Nahhh.  It's just pointless fun.  It belongs on any list of wonderful, inspired, silliness.
B003OF3R0S|5.0|This cd is amazing hands down. Rip The Rev. Mike Portnoy right choice for the Job. One of my favorite drummers. I'm so glad he stepped in for the job. Rev would of been proud. Best Metal cd of the year so far. Synestar gates and zach r amazing too. Too all you haters. This album is awesome best cd of the yr as well as Dream Theater's Black Clouds cd. I have heard all the other metal releases this yr so far and they don't live up to this cd. Ozzy's cd was eh. Korn's was decent and all the other cds that came out were ok but nothing as great as this.
B001QWBM62|5.0|I'm helping a friend with a film shoot.  It's tedious work, but if something breaks or goes wrong, guess what?  You've now got actors and crew and hangers-on just sitting around, stewing.<br /><br />The film is being shot in high-def, but the excellent camcorder is not burdened with doing the sound.  The Zoom H4n Handy Recorder is.  We've got it hooked up to a boom with a shotgun mike.<br /><br />This is an excellent recorder.  It handles recording the actors in exemplary fashion.  The display is simple enough to be pretty intuitive, with very little instruction.  Now I'm not going to say that you can go out and buy this recorder and start knocking on Steven Spielberg's door.  This is not a mixing board with multiple tracks one can lay down.  This is a four-channel recorder, and for filming, it's great.  We have a young guy who wants to be a director (who doesn't) hanging around the set.  The sound director took pity on him and let him run the recorder for a while on non-critical shoots.  He picked it up in a couple of minutes, and did pretty well holding the boom and running the recorder.<br /><br />I've been pretty impressed with the capability of this recorder, and the sound is excellent.  I can only attest to its versatility on the set; I've not tried it with recording a band, or bird calls or whatever.  But I can tell you that this recorder is just about perfect for location shooting.  Combined with the shotgun mike, it works really well.  Now if we can just get the actors to learn their lines better...<br /><br />Highly recommended.  It's worth every penny of its very reasonable cost.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This was a GREAT book.  To be honest though, I really couldn't put down any of them, but this one especially.  I really do hope that Stieg Larsson's Ex finishes the 4th one and publishes it.  This was really a terrific book.
B003PGNBO8|5.0|After all the boring humdrum shows to grace the small screen, it is with pleasure that I name this show as a step in the right direction.  As someone who doesn't watch a lot of television, it speaks for the calibre of this show, that I wouldn't miss an episode.    This series gives the viewer everything; quality storyline, credible acting, perfect level of suspense.  Every episode leaves you wanting more.  The story unfolds at a tantalising pace, revealing just the right level of knowledge and intrigue.    This is not to be missed.
B0034DI5Q6|1.0|There was SO much hype for this book so I couldn't wait to read it! When it came in the mail I immediately started reading..The first couple pages were very dull and boring but I just kept telling myself I'd get into it eventually. By page 230 I still hadn't gotten into it so I gave up on it! I don't know if it's just me but usually I love this genre and I'm a HUGE reader but I don't know. I was very disappointed to say the least!
B00004RD54|3.0|Oh boy, Rock & Roll Animal actually has numerous obstacles standing in the way of what could have been a potentially great album.  As it stands, it definitely misses the mark.    The biggest problem is the fact every single song sounds the same.  The rhythm section speeds along the same way in every track, the guitar playing appears in the most obvious places and plays more or less the most predictable notes imaginable, and Lou Reed's mannerisms concerning his vocals don't really feel any different from the studio versions.      Listening to \\"Heroin\\" (a song I was never a big fan of in the first place, but that's beside the point) you *know* exactly what's going to happen- Lou Reed's vocals will sound exactly like they do on the Velvet Underground version, and when the speeding up part from the rhythm section appears, you know what's going to happen next- a relatively bland and funky guitar solo will soon follow.      I swear this same exact funky rhythm can be heard throughout the majority of \\"Rock 'n' Roll\\" and \\"White Light/White Heat\\" as well.  It never changes.  You either like it, or you don't.  It strongly resembles early Bruce Springsteen in fact, and particularly a song of his called \\"The E. Street Shuffle\\".  It's strikingly similar, in fact.    Velvet Underground fans should seriously stick with the Velvet Underground versions instead.    Another mind-boggling thing about the popularity concerning this album- why is THIS particular album so popular when there's quite a few live albums from the same time period that feature better and heavier guitar solos, better sound quality, and just an overall better album?  I don't get it.  I can think of other live albums by artists such as Humble Pie, the James Gang, and Rory Gallagher that absolutely *destroy* the performances you hear on Rock & Roll Animal.      You can't really say it's because Lou Reed captured the true spirit of rock and roll better than those musicians either, because the style of hard rock thisalbum is going for *is* in the exact same genre as the rock artists I mention above.    Overall, yeah, this is disappointing.  If you're looking for a Lou Reed album, pick up Berlin instead.  THAT'S an awesome album.  Rock & Roll Animal is just one of several severely dated live albums from the early 70's, but without any particularly good guitar playing or songwriting to enhance the experience.  Any good guitar solos are few and far between, such as at the very end of \\"Rock 'n' Roll\\".      You know perfectly well that \\"Heroin\\", \\"White Light/White Heat\\", \\"Sweet Jane\\" and \\"Rock 'n' Roll\\" are four songs that sound VERY different from each other.  This album makes those songs sound exactly the same.    I assume people only admire this album so much because of the legacy of the Velvet Underground which makes people want to search for anything by Lou Reed that might remotely resemble the VU.  Just stick with the Velvet Underground and avoid secondrate albums like these that don't properly show you what the VU was all about.
B000SEGTI0|5.0|Having seen the move \\"Blade Runner\\" many years I had been meaning to read this for a long time.       I knew the book was different then the movie in important ways, but it was only when I finally got to read it did I realize how much better the book is, just like every other movie adaptation of Dick's novels and stories.    Things I thought were great:  - The sheep angle  - The main character has a wife  - J.R. is a much more meaningful character  - There are more androids, and their interactions with humans are much more complex  - The setting is much more vividly described    I read this on the Kindle, there were no gotchas with this ebook, it was a pleasure to read and there were no mistakes with the formatting.

B0011N1WE8|3.0|When I first read the description for Penelope, I was expecting a storyline so insanely whacky that I wouldn't be able to contain myself.  Instead, the storyline aimed for a more serious direction involving a girl with a snout on her face.    I realize this is just a make believe storyline, but I found it quite weird whenever someone immediately noticed the snout on the girls face they'd immediately either take off running, jump out a window, etc.  Her snout honestly wasn't THAT bad.  In fact, you might even say it's kind of cute.      The writers probably should have gone the extra mile to make the snout bigger and grosser to REALLY intensify the girls shocking appearance.    Anyway, the storytelling is about the girls parents trying to keep her hidden in the house for the rest of her life so nobody from the outside world will make fun of her appearance.  Unfortunately, the girl continues having urges to meet guys and fall in love, so she eventually has to find the courage to leave home and see what the outside world is like.    The first 20 minutes of storytelling are really bland and well, to be honest, completely terrible.  It talks about a family curse, but it's so far-fetched and quite unrelated to what the actual storyline is about, that it leaves me completely cold.    Not enough potential to tell a more interesting story.  That's my overall impression of it.    The movie is definitely *very* short on actual laughs.  This is because it tries to tell a (somewhat) serious story, and fails to impress me on a personal level.      So to sum up the film- not enough laughs, and not a good enough storyline severely hurts the quality of it.

160094048X|4.0|When I found out Isa and Terry were making a cookies cookbook along the veins of their cupcake book, I was so, so excited. It was VCTOTW that pushed me from just vegetarian to vegan. Everything in this cookbook is AMAZING. The chocolate peanut butter pillows are quite possibly the most perfect cookie ever. I had a dinner party at my house, made those cookies, plus the banana ice cream recipe from Veganomicon, and I swear, despite everyone being super full, people could not stop eating the cookies.    I've tried a few other recipes, like the big fat rice krispie treats (I loved them, but my husband was meh on them - he's not vegan and wasn't crazy about the strong brown rice syrup taste), mocha mamas (yum), and the caramel pecan bars (AMAZING!). The latter 2 I made for a party at a friend's house, and while the mocha mamas were good, everyone raved about the caramel pecan bars. SO GOOD! The only recipe I haven't had success with were the lazy samoas, which turned out flat as pancakes - they tasted good - but I wasn't about to take them to a party as they looked a mess. However, thanks to the troubleshooting guide, I plan on trying them again soon and adding a bit more flour.    There is something exciting about cookies that no other dessert can convey - maybe it makes us feel like kids again? Because my husband went through this whole book and indicated all the recipes he wants to try. That alone makes the price of the book worth it to me.

0385737947|4.0|Thomas wakes up in a lift with no other memory besides his first name. The lift deposits him in the Glade, a large courtyard surrounded by impossibly high stone walls. The Glade is populated by teenage boys in the same situation as him, they also have no memory. But they have made a life for themselves in this place, their only hope is trying to solve the maze that surrounds the walls. The Maze is a dangerous place, filled with terrifying half-machine/half-slug monsters that exist solely to sting the boys, thereby posioning them with a deadly toxin. The day after Thomas arrives in the Glade, something unexpected happens. A comatose girl is delivered into the maze, and she has a message: She's the last one. Ever.. The boys know everything is going to change, and Thomas just might have some answers.<br /><br />I am a little disappointed. With all the raving reviews and awesome premise, I expected it to be much better. It just wasn't that thrilling for me, and the plot wore thin. Most of the book was based of off someone conviently remembering stuff. And the action wasn't tense enough. I always knew Thomas was going to end up all right. I was especially disappointed in Thomas's first night in the maze. It had the opportunity to be absolutely terrifying, but by then all the terror of the Grievers had vanished, and the whole scene seemded to make up two hours at the most, and not an entire night.<br /><br />The ending was very good though, and very suspenseful. I was completely absorbed in those last few chapters, and every turned down ice cream in order to finish.<br /><br />The writing and characters were simple. The writing was typical actiony fare. Thomas was a bit of a Gary Stu, with no real faults. Chuck was great though.....I'm sad now.<br /><br />So anyway, it was good. Not great, but good. I am anxiously waiting for the sequel, and hope the books get better.
B001GCUO5M|5.0|I'm sure there will be comparisons made between the two films now that Inception is out. IMO, the latter is superior, but this one is just as cerebrally challenging. I think I took the view that what we see we see through the character's eyes, eyes trained to investigate all the facts of the case. Everyone plays along with him. They know he is good at his job and must tread carefully so as not to spook him. He has come to the island to investigate a case. In so doing, he interviews everyone and that information is what we get until the end of the film when we realize all the clues have been laid out all along. The flashbacks to Dachau are critical. Today we would call it PTS syndrome. He hallucinates; at an early point, we begin to see the confusion in his observations and to question his own circuitous logic. But I don't think anybody would have guessed what is revealed at the end.  I hate spoilers in reviews, and I'm not giving them away here. I will just say this is a must-see film with first-rate acting and directing. However, the premise has been lifted to a way higher level with the aforementioned Chris Nolan film.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|Every person is unique and so is every singer. This new singer has to deal with a big legacy of Layne Staley, but the question is not if he is a good stand in, but if he is a good new singer for the band AiC. In my opinion he is that absolutely, and the sound of the band (album and live performing) is still typically AiC. With a bit of another sauce, but that is logical because Layne is, sad enough, dead. If I could choose between no more new AiC-material or this revival, I choose 100% this. I've seen them live and bought (of course) the album and I'm very glad that they are alive again. Next week I'm watching them live for the 2nd time this year and I advise everyone to go out and see AiC!!!...
0307592839|1.0|This was my second time around with Jennifer Egan, and the results were the same both times.  When I tried \\"Emerald City\\" ten years ago, I could barely get past the first ten pages before I had to put it down.  Wary of \\"Goon Squad\\" but seduced by reviewers, I decided to give her another go.  Unfortunately, her skills have not improved.  Her problem is not that she's a bad writer--it's that she's an uninspired one.  Her writing is methodical; it has no spark, no flair.  Egan put all of her energy into constructing an elaborate postmodern vehicle.  This novelty act gets all the attention, but it isn't why the novel fails.  It fails because the experimentation did nothing to invigorate her prose.  Her sentences lie there flat on the page, inert.  And because her language never takes off, neither does her story.

0545123283|5.0|In Linger, the sequel to Shiver, Sam is beyond excited that he's stayed human through the cold months of winter, which means he's cured of his werewolf nature. He's looking forward--cautiously--to being with Grace forever, though the loss of Beck and the other wolves still hurts. Grace, meanwhile, has begun to worry her parents with her devotion to Sam, and when they catch him in her room one night, the hammer of doom descends. Which would be bad enough, but there's something wrong with Grace, something really awful, and she is beginning to realize she's not going to be around for much longer.<br /><br />Linger is captivating from the first chapter and doesn't let go with the last page. Mixed into the deep connection between Grace and Sam, we also get the stories of Isabel, Grace's friend, and Cole, a newly turned wolf who also happens to be a rock star looking for a way out of his life. The viewpoints shift frequently in Linger; while I might not have been enamored of Cole especially in the beginning, I came to care equally for all four by the time the book closed. It's that good.<br /><br />There are lots of emotions packed into Linger, and a sense of forboding surrounds almost every page. The stress Grace feels and the doubt that continues to permeate everything Sam does is palpable, and I actually liked the dynamic that Cole brings to the wolves. There is desperation, denial, and hope all wrapped up in Grace's life, and a sense of urgency kept me turning the pages. This one lived up to my expectations fully, and I'll be waiting eagerly for the final installment, Forever.

Mutating neutrinos? What is that? Once you get by the gibberish, you get into a bad script. The actors did what they could to save it, but when the script goes south, Cusack couldn't carry the load. There are long drawn out ridiculous scenes where Cusack barely saves his family as the world collapses only inches behind him. Limos and Winnebagos do not handle like NASCARs. Woody Harrelson as a modern day conspiracy prophet gave us some good moments, I wish there would have been more of him. This movie plays on the hype of 2012. It is for suckers. In 2013 we won't be watching it one way or the other.
B0013816GK|5.0|What can one say about music and a recording that offers a glimpse of heaven? Thank you! The singing, recording technique, and interpretation are as good as advertised. This version of Verdi's masterpiece uses slightly more majestic and slower tempos than my other recording of it. This gave more of the feel of the sovereignty of God and a believer filled with awe at God's majesty. The passion of the Dies Irae was still there, and the overall production conveyed a compelling mystical spirituality. The artists are extraordinary in their beauty and ability to interpret this heavenly piece.

B0002CHIJW|3.0|The premise of this film is great and simple: revenge.  While not original, it still has merits.  It's probably been used more times as a plot element throughout human history than anything except love.  To elaborate a bit, the plot revolves around a woman who is viciously raped by a gang of depraved locals while on a summer retreat from NY City to work on a novel in a small country town.  But a great premise alone does not make a good film.<br /><br />The foundation (its premise) is the only thing this film has going for itself. The acting is extremely bad (amateurish would be a too kind), especially considering the lame dialogue, the pacing of the movie excruciatingly slow, and you can find better examples of cinematography on YouTube.<br /><br />Did I mention the acting is bad?  The acting is bad by any standard.  I've seen better acting by porn stars - see Sasha Grey and Traci Lords.  I've seen better acting IN a porn movie.  No wait... I've seen better acting by a cereal box in a commercial.  If the corpse of Laurence Olivier were to be disinterred and put in a film, it would have better screen presence than all of the actors in this film combined.  The acting is atrocious.  The rape scenes, while graphic, are completely unbelievable, comical, in fact.  My brain was confused.  I didn't know whether to be shocked or laugh at the acting of the men.  A film like this, as with many others, relies on the \\"suspension of disbelief.\\"  If you can't convince the audience that what their watching is plausible, then you'll most likely lose them.<br /><br />Not only was the acting horrible, but the characters were utterly stereotypical, painfully so.  The villains consist of a group of degenerate country locals: the leader, a few cronies, and the town idiot.  The town idiot was particularly annoying!  I couldn't help but think of \\"Scary Movie\\" and Officer Doofy[...]<br /><br />Another complaint is the pacing.  The film takes entirely too long to setup the plot.  It was a wasted effort.  It seems like nearly half of the film is wasted waiting for the rape scene.  The characters are so \\"flat\\" and one-dimensional that it can't be argued that the pacing of the film is being used to develop the characters.  And the character dialogue is so boring that it only causes the film to drag along at the pace of a bike rider at a NASCAR event.  There's nothing intriguing or captivating about the dialogue.  There's nothing to hold you - no effort is made to interest the viewer in the main character or give insight into the villains or anything worthwhile.<br /><br />What do I like about the film, you are probably asking - besides the aforementioned premise?  I honestly loved the main character.  I loved the revenge she took out on her attackers - and it is brutal!!!  She basically uses guerrilla tactics to overcome a stronger and more numerous enemy. She divides and conquers.  She uses fear, uncertainty, weakness, distraction, and concern over each other to lure her enemies in and eliminate them.  The second half of the film actually makes watching it worth the experience.<br /><br />The film is shocking, no doubt, but I've seen worse.  I'm a horror film fan and, generally, not a big fan of torture porn, which is what I'd say best describes this film.  In fact, I'd say it helped to spawn the whole genre.  It's worth watching once, but I can't say I'd ever watch it again.  I'm actually now looking forward to the remake, which will come out this year.  I suspect that the issues that I had will be cleaned up in the remake, including the pacing, dialogue, acting, characterization, etc.  It might be one of the rare instances in which the remake is better than the original.  But one thing that it probably won't \\"one-up\\" the original is impact that the film itself had.  The original caused a great deal of scandal, and was, in fact, banned in many countries.  Whether or not the remake will live up to the original... well, we'll see.ly half of the film is wasted waiting for the rape scene.

B002ZG977Y|3.0|\\"I went to this film, because I wanted to be entertained, and I was.\\"<br />\\"Why go to movies to nit-pick?  It just wants to be entertaining.\\"<br />\\"Why take a film like this so seriously?  It was just trying to entertaining.\\"<br /><br />These above quotes are things you will read all over websites.  They are the lowest common denominator of cop-out quotes defending a film that will be forgotten long before it even hits home video.  EVERY MOVIE'S GOAL IS TO ENTERTAIN.  DUH!  What movie wasn't trying to be entertaing?  Please find me this film that specifically wanted to not entertain.  I would like to see it.  JEEEEZ.<br /><br />Anyway, the new REMAKE of Clash of the Titans is pretty much one of the few films I've seen that truly lives up to the title remake.  It's just as cheesy as the original Clash.  The acting just as stilted to over-the-top.  And the special effects are the real star.  Sure, the original Clash(a childhood favorite of mine) was silly and cheesy, but guess what, so is the remake.  It's got the same stupid cornball Greek mythology and bland characters.  The original film had the benefit of many well regarded theatre actors slumming it in small parts of Greek gods, so it had an advantage of over the top fun acting.<br /><br />I'm not sure if the special effects are better in this version.  They're more modern, but not really any more convincing.  Design-wise they're fun to look at and cool, but I never really thought I was watching actual characters doing battle or interacting with characters of flesh and blood, but rather watching live actors duke it out with special effects.  So, on that level it's the same as the original.  Though, with the exception of the Kraken, I thought Harryhausen's designs were a bit cooler.<br /><br />There's no real drama or even story to this film.  None of the characters really have an arch or a conflict of any interest.  Seriously, they don't.  It's all very slight and unassuming.  And the heroic acting that follows from Sam Worthington is the same.  He's fine in the film.  Though, a dash of Hamlin's Perseus' charm would've gone a long way.<br /><br />Liam Neeson and Ralphe Fiennes showing up to even read the phone book would be more than enough with these type of stupid movies, so they can't be fouled for their particiaption in this film.  They seem to be having fun and they're both very effective in their respective and totally silly roles.<br /><br />So, basically this film has a thin plot to hang special effects sequences on.  It's retains most the elements of story from the original with minor changes that don't really \\"change\\" the point of the film or where it's going.  I really had hoped this would've been better.  I wanted to like it more on a real cinematic level, and not on the guilty pleasure cheese level of Michael Bay's original Transformers.  I wanted this thing to be Jaws, Star Wars, or even Speed, but it's just time diverting, undemanding and curiously entertaining.  It's no classic.  I garuntee(though I could be wrong) it will be forgotten by most before next year.<br /><br />I appreciate the work and skill that took to put this thing together.  I'm sure it will make a ton of money.  I'm sure the CGI will be award worthy.  But who cares?  Big box office and 'kewl' special effects don't really mean much anymore.  Everything is a hit and everything has 'kewl' special effects.  So, when annoying peeps who utter with disdainn things like, \\"why take a film that just wants to entertain so seriously and nit-pick\\", just reply back, \\"BECAUSE I WASN'T ENTERTAINED, and my tastes have grown tired of the same thing every summer and want more from my entertainment.\\"  That's all.<br /><br />I'm not bashing the film.  It's worth a rent.  It's worth a buy if you admire the designers behind the CGI special effects.  I found the thing entertaining, but not consuming.  It's really the same thing with the original.  I imagine if I was six and saw this thing for the first time I would be enthralled, and then fifteen years or so later laugh at how silly the thing I loved ultimately is.  SO, this remake gets three stars for having cool monsters, cheesy but fun premise that made me smile, and bringing my inner six year old out to play.  Now it's time to put the inner-kiddie to bed so I can watch a new Atom Egoyan film.<br /><br />PS: It's a Warner Blu Ray so the picture and sound is amazing, better than the theater.  The special features are more sparse than I would have expected, but it mostly deals with special effects and in much depth.  THere's a throw away puff piece about new action hero Sam Worthington that's just promotional, but if you're a fan of him, then you'll love it.  That's it.  No commentary unfortunately, that's my favorite special feature. I would've also liked a comparison piece about this and the original, kind of like they did on the remake of House on Haunted Hills DVD.  It could've had a cool interview with Harryhausen and his thoughts on one of his babys being remake.  Ho hum.he thing I loved ultimately is.

0307474712|5.0|I loved this book and read into the early morning hours many times, because I didn't want to let the characters go. Witty, insightful and a wonderful surprise, as I didn't know about this author previously. I highly recommend this book to anyone, but especially those who came of age in the 70s.

0385512058|5.0|I was given this book as a gift about three years ago by a colleague. I read it in one weekend, but I go back and review often. I have highlighted, written notes, dog eared and stuck post-it flags all over the thing. If you are new to networking this book will give you everything you need to know to get started. Even if you have been in sales for a long time this book will help you to recharge the batteries; and get you to rethink the way you propect.  Read it. Study it. Memorize it. It will give you great ideas.

B001G5ZNEQ|5.0|Whether you are student of jazz or just a fan, this is a landmark, must have item for your collection.  This is probably one of Herbie Hancock's greatest albums.  It helped to establish the fairly young Herbie Hancock as a solo artist and band leader.  Prior to this albums release, Hancock was already established as a great sideman.  On this album you really get to hear his \\"voice\\" and his creative genius.  All I can say is that if you don't own this album, your collection is incomplete.
B003PGNBO8|5.0|I am one of the millions of people who watched the first episode of \\"Flashforward\\" on ABC and was hooked from beginning to end. This show has everything you could possibly want, good acting, good story and good action. I was pretty bummed when I found out the show was canceled, don't understand how that could have happened. If you are bored with current summer TV, I recommend picking this DVD up, it's very entertaining and if you become a fan like me, we can hope that maybe this show gets picked up by a different network.
B000002KHH|4.0|Although I don't review many albums/Cd's, I can say that this one is a classic and very good.  I grew up during the disco era and I can say that there was a backlash to the dancing happy tunes (I remember chucking disco 45's into the air....Peaches and Herb, Michael Jackson, etc.).  It soon became Black Sabbath, Pink Floyd, AC/DC, Van Halen, Tom Petty, etc, because they were the anti-disco groups.  I experienced it first hand, but I can tell you that I don't regret the change and I have always remembered the bands that had a more hard edge during my teens.  This is one of the greater influential bands that was around during those times.  And because I am older, I can say that it brings back great memories of hanging out with my friends and partying the night away.....isn't that what music is supposed to do (transport you to a different time).  Although I may listen to different things for the most part, there is a soft spot for those special nights that I share with people who are close to me....those special nights with Black Sabbath, Pink Floyd and the likes.  That's what music is all about! Rock on!!!
B003ITZBVI|4.0|I've liked most of the DC's recent forays into animation on varying levels, but none of them really hit the mark for me. The scripts in those other titles just weren't good enough and brought the entire production down. Many of them had excellent voice actors and animation, but that couldn't save a poor script.     Batman: Under the Red Hood is different.    Managing to cram five different arcs from the comics into a movie just under 90 minutes is impressive. Managing to do that and keep the entire thing remarkably faithful and have it turn out well is on another level.    The movie starts off with the final moments of the comic arc 'Death in the Family' featured in Batman #426-429, where the Joker sadistically kills Jason Todd aka the second Robin. This scene isn't extremely graphic and most of the violence is kept off screen, but as other reviewers have warned please take the PG-13 rating seriously. From there the story jumps forward five years and compresses Batman #635-650, taking bits and pieces from all four story arcs, to form the rest of the movie. Yes, there are changes. Some are large, including writing out Superboy Prime's role (which is a very very good thing). Others are smaller, from leaving out certain characters and subplots to changing how the Red Hood gets a hold of the Joker. None of these truly matter, as the heart of the story has been distilled and streamlined in a very faithful way.    So faithful are they that some of the dialogue is taken straight out of the comics, including the finale. This is how comic adaptations should be done.    For the most part the cast is excellent, though there will be fans that are disgruntled over fan favorites Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill not contributing. They've defined their respective characters for so long that many, including myself, have a hard time accepting new voice actors in their stead. Bruce Greenwood proved a lot of people wrong though, and I could see him voicing Batman from here on out.    JohnDiMaggio had the biggest shoes to fill though, and didn't quite do it for me. His Joker was a cross between Ledger's movie portrayal and Hamill's animation counterpart, and while not bad by any means, just didn't sound right to me. It didn't help that I kept hearing Bender from Futurama, either. The laugh was almost perfect, but his speaking voice was just...too husky. This is absolutely going to be up to individual preference though. His line delivery is excellent and there's nothing wrong with his performance. I'm just too used to Hamill, I guess.    The rest of the cast is spot on and practically a dream cast. Neil Patrick Harris is great as the light hearted, cracking wise Nightwing. Jensen Ackles is given the difficult task of voicing a character that covers the entire emotional spectrum during the course of the movie, and does it well. Jason Isaacs is by far the best Ra's al Ghul we've had. But my personal favorite has to be Wade Williams as Black Mask. He IS that character for me now.    Batman: Under the Red Hood is easily on par with Batman: Mask of the Phantasm, that other excellent animated film. It very well may end up being better after additional viewings if I can put Hamill as the Joker behind me. I really hope this is a sign of things to come from DC's animation division.

1416594787|5.0|Unlike past books where Dawkins spends most of his time beating on religion, this book concentrates on explaining the workings of evolution.  The book is an excellent piece that clearly demonstrates with the support of observation based evidence, that evolution is not \\"just\\" a theory, it is a fact.  (By the way, if you are one of the folks that thinks that theory is little more than a guess, you might want to read the first chapter.  You are a serious need of a dictionary).  The middle chapters dragged a bit because the explanation of geological processes can be a bit boring.  But hang in there, understanding such processes is critical in grasping how evidence is collected.<br /><br />Evolution is the greatest show on earth and we, along with the rest of nature, are wonderful examples of this phenomenon.

It's a \\"on the edge of your seat\\" kind of movie from start to finish.  Kate Beckinsale is gorgeous as always, and actually makes amputation sexy! (You'll see what I mean.)  If you love action/suspense/mystery movies, you will love this.  I have no idea why this movie did not get better reviews, but I am sooooo glad I found it.  My new \\"favorite\\" movie!
075640407X|5.0|I read a lot of books.  With that said, I enjoy most of what I read.  Every 10 books or so I find one that I like rereading at least once a year.  Out of that small handful, one or two are ones that I might reread every six months. Since I have owned Name of the Wind - paperback copy, I've read it until the cover fell off, I've purchased the audio book, and am pre-ordering The Wise Man's Fear.<br /><br />It has been a long time since I have been so drawn into a story.  A long time since reading a book causes me to experience the story via different aspects.  A long time since rereading a story hasn't bored me into wanting to skip through the 'boring' chapters.<br /><br />I love the storyline.<br />I fell in love with the characters.<br /><br />After I finished I was immediately hungry for more.<br /><br />Mr. Rothfuss is exceedingly talented.  I hope he continues to entertain us indefinitely.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor.  Purchase this book and be entertained.
B001AQO3WY|4.0|A must watch for any war movie/series fan. I consider it the 'Band of Brothers' for the Iraq War. Although I am not a military veteran, it seems to touch upon many of the aspects of recent wartime, like friendly-fire, officers that shouldn't be officers, PTS, etc.      Acting is superb, esp James Ransone. HBO fans remember him from Ziggy in 'The Wire'. Make sure to pay attention when he goes on one of his philosophic rants!    Reasons it doesn't get 5-stars:  - When you first put in the DVD, you get tons of HBO preview stuff that you have to watch before you can access the main menu. Give yourself a good five minutes the first time you use the DVD.  - Didn't like the Director's commentary....they don't talk about the scene you are watching and what they were trying to communicate to the viewer; instead they just keep going on rants on how good the actors do, filming location, etc. and rarely get specific on the scene you are viewing.  - For the military novice, be prepared to be diluged with military-speak and abbreviations. Luckily, there is a 'dictionary' booklet inside the DVD case which helps, and the subtitling (even English) is an option. I found they would start talking about some abbreviation over and over and had to pause and look it up a lot.
B0036EH3XE|2.0|(Beware spoiler ahead)          Just in case your the last person to know, your first guess - that's right, your very first, just minutes after you started watching way back when - was right. They are really dead and this isn't real. No, I'm not joking.         Amazingly, there's no more sense to it than that. Sure there were great characters, dialogue and moments that made it up to this point the best show on TV. But, you can't say the faith that one day you would get the answers didn't help make it so. I mean, with all that was going on it couldn't be that they are dead because that would be too easy. Right? I know that is what we all thought. They are going to give us something for hanging around all this time. For waiting year after year as the knot got both larger and tighter. Sure that with one pull of one string it was all going to unravel in one masterful move. This had to make sense and not something easy and cheesey like its a dream or purgatory or they are dead. The show is too good for that. If it were that they were all dead, we said to ourselves, then we could essentially write anything and cheaply boost characters and dialogue with the tension of a place that hosts imortality, mysterious projects, strange inhabitants, magical numbers, ancient mysteries, convergence of fates, time and space travel, ghosts, monsters, and rituals that never need to be explained. They wouldn't do that to us. We have been too loyal. We are true believers in the show and defended it to all those of left it saying, they would regret it for not sticking with it as there would be an equally amazing and beautifully clear explanation that will do justice to these phenomenal characters that were presented. Just wait and see!         Well, guess again. They are dead and there are no good answers.          With that, the same characters might as well have been on a freaking mystical iceberg, magical swamp or forgotten subway station and it would not have made a difference! You see,a main character, the island, a place which time and time again we are told is central to it all, an active living player upon which all the characters, suspense and action was built upon and elevated...the one central character that despite who else was in the spotlight was continuously presented and thefore forced us to speculated on for six long years and for which we waited to have its own final flash forward/sideways/back (flash anything) was...was..was...? Roll credits.          That is what you get. A post mortem family reunion but not with everyone. Some characters get resolution, but not all. Some answers are given but not the good ones. Oh, almost forgot. The baby makes it out alive.  Thanks for the bone, JJ.         In all, it ends not like the show it started as, but like a cop out dressed up to appear as art and depth. Now there are those who liked the ending, but those are the same people that are facinated could also be facinated by a painting with single black dot in the center. Listen, it's empty and it sucks! Plain and simple.       As another reviewer wisely suggested, save your money and make up your own ending. Trust me, it will be more satisfying.
B003O86FMW|5.0|..... but soon after i started i couldn't stop reading. The book had the same grasping effect that the first had; where you had to read it through all the way to the end and it was agonizing to put it down and not know the ending. Even though I thought I knew how it was going to turn out every surprise captivated me and added more suspense. The books are fairly easy to read, though the themes are more advanced for a younger audience, and the pace keeps the story moving along like the first book so you never get bored. The first book was incredible and, despite the other comment about it being a middle book, I thought it was more serious than the first. More was at stake in this book than just their own lives. This makes everything more risky and all their actions guarded. I like this suspense and what it adds to the story. I also enjoy how Peeta and Katniss's relationship is not so pretending as in the last book, but more genuine (at least  from Katniss's side, Peeta was always genuine). But the title is fulfilling, everything really does seem to \\"catch fire\\" and we are left on a cliff waiting to see how large the explosion will be. I don't know how she is going to unfold all the things she set up to happen but, I have confidence in her writing for the next book as the last two were exceptional and haven't let me down yet.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|Taylor Swift is  a very talented singer & songwriter. This is  a GREAT CD!!
B002ZG977Y|5.0|Comparisons with the 1981 original are inevitable. I see this new version of the Clash of the Titans as more of a reimagining of the story than a remake of the original. This leaves us with two completely different stories that are each outstanding in their own right. Although the story is pretty straight forward it is told as an epic quest that the demigod Perseus experiences as he wrestles with his identity while battling fierce giant scorpions, the three witches, the Gorgon, Medusa, and the condemned Calibos culminating in a final showdown with the giant and terrifying Kraken, mythic sea creature set loose by the gods to destroy the city of Argos and the beautiful Andromeda who is being sacrificed to assuage the wrath of the gods. The motive for this epic quest is that the humans have rebelled against the gods and after killing Perseus' earthly family Hades has used the human rebellion as a means to defeat his brother Zeus to become King of the gods but he must also contend with a vengeful Perseus.<br /><br />Liam Neeson was an excellent choice as Zeus with his booming voice and commanding presence and Ralph Fiennes does a spectacular job as the deliciously evil Hades, king of the Underworld. Sam Worthington also does an excellent job as the hero Perseus whom he portrays as a smoldering angry warrior forced into circumstances beyond his control as he comes to terms with who he is. The special effects of the movie are equally spectacular and top notch and as a lover of giant monsters this version of the behemoth Kraken of the deep is worth the price of admission. I just wish he would have had more screen time. As an epic action adventure movie the Clash of the Titans delivers 2 hours of enjoyable fun and exciting entertainment.
0393072231|4.0|This is a good book and well worth reading for anyone who wants to have a better understanding of what happened in the mortgage securities market that led to the massive financial crisis.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I thought the focus on a few players who figured out the fundamentals of the underlying risks and made huge fortunes in so doing was not the best way to tell the story.  Interesting to some degree, but not as thorough and broad as I would have liked.  More focus on the inside of the investment banks, loan originators and rating agencies would have been welcome.      I expected a lot from this book - I had heard that all the key Congressional players were reading it to help them figure out the crisis.  So, I hoped to see a more comprehensive look at the key factors.  It really doesn't deliver that.
B003EYVXYQ|5.0|Let me start off by saying there is no bigger a fan of GAR than myself so at times I may come off biased in my review. Now that being said I did like this movie but it's definitely no where as good as the \\"Master of all things Zombie\\" is capable of. The film had it's moments. Even the so-called cheesy CGI scene at the beginning was pretty cool in my book. Overall this is simply one of those films where if you are a hard core fan of GAR you'll like it and if you're not chances are you won't.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|Great movie - one of the best Star Trek motion pictures.  Full of action and numerous near death scenes for the characters.  It gives history of how the Enterprise crew originally meet - though clearly the use of space time continuum could change that history.  In any case the I've watched the movie numerous times and enjoy it each time.    Well worth the purchase though the digital copy no longer works as the offer was rescinded though no comment of this in the product description - that is a bit annoying!  When will these guys just let us put a copy of our purchases on our Ipod or PC so we can use it in the way we want.
B003OF3R0S|4.0|I've been on board with A7X since \\"Sounding the Seventh Trumpet\\". At the time of \\"Waking the Fallen\\" and later \\"City of Evil\\", A7X carved a classic metal meets hardcore niche. It had that Iron Maiden feel, but would drift into thrash elements with the speed of the riffs and drums, and some hardcore screams from Shadows. Although the dynamic solos,top notch guitar work and musicianship are there, all is not perfect.     Fast forward to \\"Avenged Sevenfold\\" and now \\"Nightmare\\". A7X is slowly drifting away from a more traditional (retro) metal sound and experimenting. Sometimes it works, like title the track, \\"Nightmare\\" & \\"Welcome to the Family\\". Both are multi part beasts filled with amazing solos and riffage. Other times, like \\"Dangerline\\", they drift into pianos, horns and whistling. \\"Natural Born Killers\\" is a monster and not only is the best song on the CD, but one of the best they've done. \\"God Hates Us\\" brings in some serious growl from Shadows and it sounds terrific. The final four tracks though are a mixed bag of power ballads, piano work, atrocious guest vocals (that all but ruin the otherwise amazing piano work in \\"Victim\\"). Like the previous release, to avoid having songs sound the same, \\"Nightmare\\" takes some great (and terrible) twists.     A7X may be some of the best musicians in the game right now and certainly some of the best live performers of some very difficult source material, but they seem to be in need of a producer that can give them some direction. Much like Slipknot over the last 5 years, when they're good, they are amazing, but when they lose focus, the songs just don't click. It's like their talent gets in their way of just making a kick ass rock record. I would recommend a purchase, but many have compared this to \\"Awaking the Fallen\\", and that is not fair or accurate. Comparisons to G'n'R are more realistic. That's not a bad thing by any stretch. If A7X keeps up at this pace with the amazing live shows a solid albums, they have a chance todefine their generations hard rock scene.

0307454541|1.0|The story was engrossing but the level of graphic sexual violence towards women is just too disturbing for me.  Fortunately, the book has a \\"pre-view\\" of the next book in the series so that I know that the next book's premise is based on sexual violence too (a 13 yr old?!).  I'm disappointed because I would have certainly given this a higher rating and read the next books if the sexual violence was much less and certainly much less graphic.
B0000AUHQT|1.0|1.  I admit that I'm not sophisticated enough and \\"learned\\", but the truth must be said, this movie is just a complete bore.  If you're interested in the \\"The Great Gatsby\\", please, do yourself a favor and just read the book.
0316069906|5.0|It is slowly becoming common knowledge that factory farming is disgusting and pathetic from start to finish. But most people continue to eat factory-farmed meat. Before reading this book, I knew, at an intellectual level, that factory farming was inhumane in the most extreme sense of the word, but I also continued to eat factory-farmed meat, uncomfortably managing to put some psychological distance between myself and the animal nightmare that I was helping to sustain. This book is ideal for people like me, people who are at least somewhat familiar with the facts, but haven't completely internalized them at an emotional level. Committed meat-eaters will probably find Foer sanctimonious and use this perceived sanctimoniousness as an excuse to avoid thinking further about the \\"unpleasant\\" realities of factory farming. And people who are already committed vegans for ethical reasons will probably not find anything in this book that they didn't already know or feel. But to those of you who are on the fence about eating factory-farmed meat, this book is for you. Buy it, read it, talk about it, and give it to others on the fence who need a nudge in the right direction.

B002ZG9788|1.0|This film is beautifully produced, but be advised there is a major change in plot and attitude from the original.  The original film captured the classical relationship between mortals and the Gods as exists through out Greek Mythology.  The new film replaces that with pure modern anti-God hatred.  Zeus is no longer concerned with justice tempered by a love for his own family.  Now he's just a parasite on mankind.  As a Christian and a classical scholar I was deeply offended by this treatment of the Greek deities especially as it was clear to me the director had turned this story into a piece of atheist propaganda.  Accordingly this is the first film I walked out on in thirty years.  If you love God, Greek  Mythology, or the first film, avoid this film like the plague.    One star is too high a rating.
1441866868|4.0|Since time immemorial writers have written about the downfall of society and imagined the aftermath.  Some do it with a bang, others with a whisper but they almost always use the current \\"public fear\\" as the backdrop.  We've had nuclear war, runaway technology, biological outbreak, the list goes on.  The exhaustion of oil is nothing new but the resultant calorie economy and spring energy storage is certainly an interesting approach.  Instead of cyberpunk it is more of a \\"genepunk + steampunk\\" setting.<br /><br />I thought the author did a good job of following the consequences of these technological and economic changes throughout society.  It made the street scenes vibrant with strange descriptions that seemed both familiar and alien at the same time with the mixture of high and low tech side-by-side.<br /><br />I felt the back-story of setting could have used either a small introductory infodump or perhaps more exposition since this setting was so different than others I was used to, both in subject matter and setting.  I thought the gritty nature of the plot and the emotionally damaged characters lent a nice air of reality to the action.  The cheapness of human life in the setting is laid out clearly and makes the whole calorie system that much more disturbing.<br /><br />I could see a film or TV movie adaptation of this story doing well.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I pretty much held my breath through much of the book  many questions developed in the series answered   one of the best book i have ever read
B003OF3R0S|4.0|Nightmare: It's definitely a great piece of work. Whether I enjoy it as much as I wish I would, the music is amazing and integrates all of the styles of Avenged Sevenfold.<br /><br />The reason I did not enjoy this album as much as previous albums is because half the songs are soft. No joke, they really just did that. I don't know what Avenged Sevenfold is trying to do here, but I guess they forgot that they are neither a metalcore band NOR a hard rock band. I appreciate a couple soft songs in an album, but when it reaches half, especially when the band calls themselves a \\"hard rock band,\\" some one made some mistakes putting the songs together.<br /><br />Fortunately there are a few of their hard rock styled songs, and even a pure, beastly, metalcore song called \\"God Hates Us.\\" Never have I heard screaming like that.<br /><br />One tradition A7X keeps going is the amazing guitar and perfect vocals. In all of their songs that talent shines.<br /><br />This album is worth buying, but if Avenged Sevenfold had made this a hardrock/metalcore album with the same ideas, it would have earned 5/5 from me.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I'v had this Turtle Beach X41 headset for about a week now and I love the surround sound that I get from it. I had to get use to having these on my head but after a couple of days it wasn't bad. It's comfortable over the ears and doesn't sweat at all. I'm not impressed with the quality of the contruction materials, It seems like cheap plastic and I would of loved an all black version if they had one. Also, for the price of $200.00 you would think that it would include the AC wall adaptor and the Puck talkback cable instead of having to order it thru there website. These should of been added in the package. I was considering getting the Astro A40 but there is just too many wires to deal with and I wanted the less wires as possible.    As for the sound I can't complain at all, I hear things in the background in the games that I never heard of before and I have surround sound in my house which is wierd. I have the receiver next to me on a table not anywhere near the TV, Components, or Wireless Router, This will make you hear hissing or popping sounds from what I read on other reviews. I did not use the Toslink that came with the package as there cheaply made, I bought a 20ft toslink cable from another source with better quality. If you have a battery charger then using a AAA rechargable batteries are a non issue.    Overall i'm very pleased with the headset and I hope that in the future Turtle Beach will put some thought on the materials they use to build them. Especially for the price there asking for. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a Wireless headset to play on Xbox Live.

B0038QGXHW|2.0|Anyone with a passing interest in Jarrett's recorded work knows what I'm talking about. I fully embrace every enthusiastic five-star rating of the music recorded here. It's beautiful. I hoped, though, I could be spared the frustration of having Jarrett's Sniveling Whine once again corrupt an otherwise amazing listening experience. No such luck. I know, I know -- I should pay attention to the music, etc. I've been listening to Keith Jarrett for 25 years, even with the SW. This time I've just had enough. How does Jarrett expect anyone to overlook that intrusion time and time again? He's walked off stage because audience members were coughing too much. I'd bet if someone else started the SW during a concert he'd walk off for that too. At least I didn't try to follow the advice to \\"Call your wife or husband or lover in late at night and sit down and listen.\\" As soon as the SW foolishness began, more than the recording would have been ruined on that night......
0566076896|5.0|There are many fine reviews of \\"SPIN Selling\\" that are accurate, informative, and helpful.  My goal is not to duplicate their analyses -- I'll focus my observations on how the book has helped me to reconsider SPIN Selling from the context of having taking a formal training course on the topic in the past, while having just completed the book.    Several years ago the company I was with provided its sales force with a SPIN Selling sales training course.   This course was developed by someone other than Neil's organization.   I had come from a software engineering management position evolving to a consultative solution sales role.   At the time, I found the material very interesting and looking back on the years since the course, I firmly believe that the SPIN Selling methodology has helped me to more successfully sell to large accounts.    I picked up the book, \\"SPIN Selling\\", by Neil Rackham, a couple of weeks ago with the thought that it would be a timely refresher for the formal multi-day training program and associated role play that I participated in within the course framework.    Having the training behind me and having used SPIN Selling techniques in the real world as a foundation for reading this book was beneficial, however, I got a LOT more out of this book than I did from the training.      I would advise sales managers and motivated sales people to choose the book first, if possible, then schedule targeted, focused role play training as a follow-on within a week of book completion.    It is intriguing to explore the evolution of Neil's thinking as he and his colleagues followed real sales people into real sales calls to document their approaches to both small and large account sales.   For example, while reading about closing the sale, I thought back to the 1992 movie, Glengarry Glen Ross, and the famous scene on closing delivered by Alex Baldwin.  If you haven't seen it, search for this scene on the web and contrast it to the empirical results that Neildocuments in the book.  This is a surprise that I'll leave as an exercise for the reader to discover.  You'll enjoy it!   The training I'd taken really didn't explore closing in any way and rightly spent the majority of its time on the \\"I\\" and \\"N\\" of SPIN -- Implication questions and Need-Payoff questions.   It is helpful to have results of Neil's research on closing from the book to better appreciate the benefits of the SPIN method.    The book did a better job than my training on the following areas as well:    - Explaining the downside of focusing too much on the \\"S\\" and \\"P\\" of SPIN -- Situational and Problem questions.      - Providing a simple, memorable method to help a sales person to differentiate an Implication question from a Need-Payoff question.   The distinction is VERY important yet, as Neil explained, even he and his experienced team had struggled with correctly labeling certain questions until someone in their midst crafted a simple rule to make it easy.    - In consultative sales where there can be a long sales cycle, it is often necessary to get to the next stage of the process, then the stage after that, then repeat.   This is called advancing the sale.   The book does a nice job of detailing the process, which again, the training didn't touch.    - Having a technical background in computer science, I'm often instinctively draw to the features, benefits, and capabilities of a solution.  The book provided concrete examples of real sales dialogues where the seller went too deep on features to the detriment to the sale.   Fortunately for me, the training I had led me correctly down the path of crafting implication questions to draw out explicit needs, so I haven't fallen into the \\"feature\\" trap.  Thanks to the book, I know more of the background context on Neil's research that the training didn't provide.    In addition, the book introduced the concept of \\"Advantages\\" and split it off from \\"Benefits\\".   The course hadn't mention this, and it was enlightening to read about Advantages verse Benefits and the impact on small and large sales.    I didn't know that Advantages were not powerfully impactful on larger sales.   Now I know why to sparingly sprinkle Advantages in with the concentration being on pure Benefits.    - Small verses large sales -- the book details why successfully selling in each domain is different.    There's more to the SPIN method than I've covered here.   The good news is for me is that I was fortunate enough to pick this book up after a multi-year hiatus from the training.   What I learned from the book can be applied not only to Sales but to any people-focused relationship role, such as management, project/program management, technical writing, et al. where it is essential to uncover the explicit needs of a client or stakeholder.  Often, the client/stakeholder may not be able to articulate or even know all their explicit needs.  SPIN brings true value to you in your role and will provide you with the tools and methods to better partner with the client or stakeholder to  jointly discover their needs and how best to satisfy them.
B003OF3R0S|5.0|These guys worked their way to the top, every fan knows that. They were in their prime state, working on this album, when they lost a brother, a band mate, their drummer, their heart. With much pain and grief, they chose to guide the material to it's final form. The form that Jimmy The Rev helped and gave to this album. He recorded some vocals, wrote many of the songs. Even said good bye unintentionally when he finished writing Fiction:. \\"This will be the last song on the album\\". To listen to the song and not feel goosebumps is impossible, the emotion and mystery living inside those waves. This album should not be judge by sound, cause this album is a broken heart, a bitter symphony for the fans. An intimate sound to admire Jimmy's drums(He wrote the drum parts, Mike just played them)his lyrics, and their music. This is a prize that should be kept with the heart, we are listening to Jimmy's voice, and the work of his final days and happiness. My heart to these guys. My full support. I will not judge by song, but by tears and broken words. 5 stars is nothing to the profound connection to Avenged Sevenfold by music, this is music, heart and soul, tears and laughter. RIP Jimmy, you made my life better with your brothers, and today I celebrate your passion, rocking the hell out of this album!

B0000025KI|5.0|Back in college in 1980, it was who was better at the time AC-DC or Bruce Springsteen.  AC-DC had just released \\"Back In Black\\" and Bruce \\"The River\\", but as we all know heavy metal bands bring out more fans, but Bruce and the E-Streeters had things to say, and to these ears better music in the long run.  After the classic \\"Darkness On The Edge Of Town\\", Bruce and the boys went in the studio and produced some great rockers and tremendous ballads. Bruce had just turned 30 when he started recording \\"The River\\".  Song Highlights:  \\"The Ties That Bind\\" - Still a concert favorite, 60's sounding rock.  \\"Sherry Darling\\" - 50's sing a-long. Great sax by the Big Man.  \\"Jackson Cage\\" -Great Organ by Danny./ Kind of a Bob Dylan type song he would of made in the mid-60's.  \\"Two Hearts\\" - Great song. Concert favorite. Makes you happy your alive!  \\"Independence Day\\" - Another great ballad.  \\"Hungry Heart\\" - Bruce's first top 10 song  #5.  \\"Out In The Streets\\" - Another concert favorite still. Classic 60's sound.  \\"Crush On You\\" -Good timing number, great guitar by Bruce a very under rated guitar player.  \\"You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch\\") -You can tell the band was having a good time!  \\"I Wanna Marry You\\" - Back to 50's sound. \\"Little girl I wanna marry you\\".  \\"The River\\" - A classic ballad (sometimes you should hold off on sex).  \\"Point Blank\\" - Great piano by  Roy.  What a story.  \\"Cadillac Ranch\\" - A great party song.   \\"I'm A Rocker\\" - A salute to Johnny Rivers?  Great song!  Danny playing a galloping Organ, great Sax by Clarence.  \\"Fade Away\\" - 2nd single #20.  \\"Stolen Car\\" - Song that pre-dated \\"Nebraska\\".  \\"Ramrod\\" - Still performed in concert now and then.  Great innerplay between all players. Roller-rink Organ by Danny keeps this thing rockin'!.  \\"The Price You Pay\\" - \\"On the banks of the river he stayed to face the price you pay.\\"  Great harmonica by Bruce.  \\"Drive All Night\\" - A man who will do anything to be with his woman.  \\"Wreck On The Highway\\" - A song about death and what it's gonna do to the other person.      \\"The River hit #1 for 4 weeks.  Get Bruce's new DVD it is that good!  Also check-out the Gaslight Anthem \\"Sink Or Swim\\", \\"The '59 Sound\\" and the new \\"American Slang\\". If you like Bruce I think you'll like Gaslight Anthem.  The Band in 1980:   Roy Bittan  Clarence Clemons R.I.P.  Danny Federici - R.I.P.  Bruce Springsteen  Garry Tallent   Steve Van Zandt  Max Weinberg  Update 11-16-10.  Oh boy!  Bruce Springsteen releases his new box set \\"The Darkness On The Edge Of Town Story\\" 3 CD and 3 DVD set.  This is going to be a treasure for Bruce fans and people that enjoy the history of rock 'n roll!

B003O86MY8|5.0|\\"Rock Symphonies\\" is not your granny's oeuvre (although I dare say David has converted plenty of grannies).DG promised us an adventure and boy did he bring it!Here are a few thoughts that went through my head as I listened to the CD:ground breaking, exhilarating, exciting, dramatic,and perhaps most important of all, passionate. David's passion for pieces in this CD is so palpable, one can't help but be drawn in. Let's not forget the virtuosity. There is a lot going on in \\"Rock Symphonies\\", but the one constant is that David Garrett is one fabulously talented and original violin virtuoso.The better your sound system and the more often you listen to \\"Rock Symphonies\\"the more you will appreciate David's mind-bending interpretations of both Rock and Classic masterpieces. Bravo
030726999X|5.0|This is a great book that is not quite as good as the two preceding novels in the Millennium series for three reasons:  There is no compelling mystery in \\"Nest.\\"  There is less action (unless you count the courtroom as action). And early on there are some Swedish civics lessons that serve as interruptions to remind you that you are reading a book.<br /><br />But, like I said, this is still a great read.  I highly recommend all three books to any mystery reader provided they can tolerate some level of sadistic violence in book form.<br /><br />\\"Nest\\" picks up right where \\"Fire\\" left off.  Salander, though hanging to life by a thread, is already planning vengeance.  Blomkvist is attempting to clear Salander's name of the various charges the government has leveled against her without him revealing Salander's secrets.  And as a bit of a sideplot, Berger has a new job...and a stalker.  Hacker Nation has been enlisted to help all three parties.<br /><br />I was sorry to hear of the death of Mr. Larsson.  He created a unique and interesting character in Lisbeth Salander, the anti-social, genius hacker at the center of the Millennium series.  The Girl will be missed.
B001GM28HO|4.0|July, 27, 2010<br /><br />I must say that I jumped on the Lady Gaga bandwagon kinda late. At first, I couldn't really tolerate her music because it was pretty simple-minded in my eyes. In general, if you really think about it, most of it is still that way - nothing too deep.<br /><br />But that doesn't mean it's not fun! She has a way of making you just wanna let go, be yourself and have a great time and I think that's what she set out to accomplish.<br /><br />I almost love every song on the CD.<br /><br />-Just Dance Feat. Colby O'Donis- This track was the second track that I heard from Lady Gaga but is the first single. I actually heard it in a bar that I used to go to and I hated it back then. But it has since become one of my favorite Lady Gaga songs. Love it. 4.25 stars.<br /><br />-LoveGame- This song has an alright beat but it's kinda repetitive. It's not her best but it's OK. The third single. 3.5 stars.<br /><br />-Paparazzi- Another song that I didn't quite get at first. But the beat is cool and the production is mysterious. I also love the lyrics. It's just a fun song. One of her bigger songs from the album. 4 stars.<br /><br />-Pokerface- Her second single I believe. This song we all know by now. The \\"P-P-P-Pokerface\\" part is kinda annoying after a while, but some of the lyrics are fun. To me, it's not one of the better tracks on the album, but it's OK. The best part of the song is the bridge. 3.75 stars.<br /><br />-Eh, Eh (Nothing Left To Say)- This is probably the most simple and uncomplicated song on the album. But it's also one of the funnest. Lady Gaga has broken up with a guy in this one to find someone new that makes her happy. Has a very upbeat demeanor. Cherry, Cherry, Boom, Boom! 4.25 stars.<br /><br />-Beautiful, Dirty, Rich- This song has a mean beat. It also has sort of a party scene kinda vibe going on. I like the way she speaks in this song. 4 stars.<br /><br />*The Fame* My all-time favorite Lady Gaga song. It took a few listens for it to climb the pole to my favorite, but it's there now. It talks about how people want to achieve fame and how worthless it really is in the end. Sorta speaks about how we like shallow things like \\"body plastic\\" and \\"hot blondes in odd positions\\" if you know what I mean. ;) 4.5 stars.<br /><br />-Money Honey- This is another fun song. The beat is kinda old-school sounding but I like the \\"damn's\\" in the song. Not much to say about it but it's good. 4 stars.<br /><br />-Starstruck Feat. Space Cowboy & Flo Rida- This track is probably the only real filler in the album. I'm not crazy about it. 3.25 stars.<br /><br />-Boys, Boys, Boys- Well, this one is sorta filler too. 3.25 stars.<br /><br />-Paper Gangsta- In this one Lady Gaga kinda raps and it works. 3.5 stars.<br /><br />-I Like It Rough- This song is great. Stefani (Lady Gaga's real name) speaks on a relationship that isn't quite working in this one. Has a great feel to it. 4.25 stars.<br /><br />-Summerboy- A feel-good anthem about loving a boy for the summer. This song is kinda shallow and speaks on just a hook-up, but it doesn't really matter. It's still one of my favorites. 4 stars.<br /><br />All in all, I was shocked at how much I enjoyed this album. I don't usually get into dance pop all that much, but some songs have been good. Lately, everyone is getting into it though; Britney, Miley, Katy Perry, etc....Lady Gaga is one of the best at it though. I can't wait to see what she does for her third album.<br /><br />4 stars or an 8/10 (not an average).<br /><br />DOWNLOAD:<br />'The Fame'<br />'Just Dance'<br />'I Like It Rough' &<br />'Eh, Eh (Nothing Left To Say)want to achieve fame and how worthless it really is in the end.

1588167461|4.0|The book is a good reference on common fashion subjects (e.g., matching shoes with suit colors).  It also has useful and entertaining advice on subjects where each of us must make his own rules (e.g., who should wear what jeans).  I recommend it for most guys from 13-60 (I think men after age 60 are beyond fashion advice).
0312370849|5.0|I loved this book, as many others did in our Book Club. It was a fast read because you just want to know \\"what happens next?!\\" I loved the dual narration but was disappointed at the end when it was only Julia left telling the story. Her character got kind of annoying and the passion she had for researching this at the end was kind of unbelievable. I wish I would have found out more about Sarah's life at the end. Her narration was much better to read than Julia's. To all of those thumbing their noses at this book because the author didn't put more details/facts about the roundup in France -that is not the kind of book this was intended to be. It is a story about one little girl living during a horrible time and one modern day reporter who gets sucked into the child's awful story. For me it was my first time reading about this part of France's history of which I was totally ignorant. It was a very good story of which I won't soon forget.

B00004R99R|5.0|Remembering how much I enjoyed this movie throughout the years (and which it will never get old) I am deeply shocked of seeing the negative reviews for this classic film.  Greek mythology can be a very complex issue if not explained and detailed right and for Disney to get into all that non-sense would have been a waste of time and paper, and more so if it's a movie intended for kids and family. This is definitely one of my favorite Disney movies and the last one that I can remember enjoying the most. I loved every single character, the story line in the film and also the music.<br /><br />If you're into heavy Greek mythology, like many 1 star reviewers here have stated, and cannot tolerate for a `kids movie' to be altered into Disney style  adaptation then I suggest for you to watch something completely different, a documentary that portrays accurately everything you're looking for on the History channel.
0812550706|5.0|Note: There is no synopsis of the book here - Only [mostly] spoiler-free reactions.    As a rising Junior in college, I thoroughly enjoyed Ender's Game. But preferably, I think it would have had more impact had I read it in late middle school or early high school. I say this not because I feel the storyline is childish but because of Ender's consistent isolation. By this point in my life, I've found a niche for myself in life that finally makes me feel like I belong. In high school and middle school, no one feels that way and it's especially difficult if you're in advanced programs. Other children despise you for being better than them at anything. Kids who have higher grades than you tend to look at you as some kind of threat. Friendship is based on competition much like with Ender's situation. However, we were never trying to save the world, which presumably would make it infinitely worse.     Do I believe eleven/thirteen-year-old's could know a thing or two about politics? Yes. If they grew up around parents who constantly informed them of the world's standings, definitely. Mine never did, but I'm sure if they were interested enough, I could have picked it up when I was Peter/Valentine's age. Mainly what Valentine and Peter were doing was manipulating people. Children can easily read people. Have you never noticed children who get their way by guilt-tripping their parents? It's not difficult if you know where to push. And to be fair, Peter, who was two years older, instructed Valentine for years. It probably wasn't until she was thirteen too that she started writing by herself as Demosthenes. Peter was sixteen (high school) by the time he was accepted into politics. This is not far fetched to me. I knew genius high school kids who could have held their grounds in political debates without training for years in political circles.    Anyhow, what struck me as intriguing and phenomenal was how easily the children were used/brainwashed. The military raised Ender to be the perfect test subject and then manipulated him into believing that he wanted what they wanted. Some children start playing the piano when they are four. By the time they reach eleven, they're practically geniuses. Basically what you learn from Ender's Game is how impressionable children are. We seem to forget that sometimes. At the same time, those who think children are lesser beings because of youth are just plain wrong. I am amongst many when I say that I never felt like a child when I was one. I sat in on grown-up conversation more often than I played with children my own age. It was unusual and I didn't have tons of friends, but I found adults who wouldn't look down on me and who treated me plainly with respect and intelligence. Ender's Game reminds me a lot of my childhood. There were times where you would hit someone and feel like the scum of the earth for it later. Kids ganged up on you to get what they wanted. Kids are cruel. You learn a lot in your formative years about human nature and not much of it changes by the time you're an adult. See politics.    In all, I think Ender's Game is a great read. I'm reluctant to read the other books in the series because I'm afraid of the Curse of the First. They always seem to be the best and most complete in a series. :)
B002VPE1OS|4.0|If you are someone who is constantly bothered by the glare on your iPhone screen, this product is for you. I have owned all 4 iPhones, and have put various types of screens on each one until I found what I wanted. I tried:<br /><br />Clear screen protectors (don't help much, keys can still scratch them),<br />Mirror screen protectors (allows you to see yourself in the phone and reduces visibility from the side. You have to put brightness way up and that shortens battery life), and<br />Anti-glare screen protectors (decreases clarity but eliminates glare).<br /><br />Of those, my favorite has been the anti-glare. It provides some protection to the screen, but mainly eliminates the glare that can be so annoying in certain places.<br /><br />The real story here is the installation. How hard is it?  What I get bubbles? Can I do it myself or do I need to consult an expert? The answer to all those questions is \\"I honestly cannot know that with reasonable confidence\\". But I will give you my experience. I have purchased a bunch of cheap screen protectors on eBay as well as nicer brand name protectors at the apple store, and they are pretty much all the same. It's all about the technique. The included instructions do a good job at explaining the easiest way to mount the screen protector. The squeegee tool works well to help keep bubbling to a minimum, and if you are working in a clean environment with clean hands, you can usually peel off a crooked or bubbly protector and re apply. I messed up my first screen protector when a piece of hair or something got on the adhesive side and I couldn't get it off without messing up the whole thing. So I moved to a cleaner area and the second one went on flawlessly.<br /><br />This is a good product. I used this on my iPhone 3GS. I wanted to put on on my iPhone 4 but the glass on front is a bit taller and it doesn't cover the whole screen. I want to give this product 5 stars, but I think 4.5 is more accurate, and it won't allow me to do half a star so 4 it is. If you have very shaky hands or are just super clumsy, I would recommend you have someone who has installed these before do it for you. I have installed so many now and it gets easier each time. The main problem is to keep away from a dusty area or an area with a lot of pet hair. If you suffer with glare, grab a pack of these. It's worth a shot, and not too expensive. The screen pretty much eliminates all fingerprints from the screen, which is an added bonus.ery shaky hands or are just super clumsy, I would recommend you have someone who has installed these before do it for you.

0316017922|4.0|The main tenet of Outliers is that there is a logic behind why some people become successful, and it has more to do with legacy and opportunity than high IQ. He simply makes the point that both encountered the kind of \\"right place at the right time\\" opportunity that allowed them to capitalize on their talent, a delineation that often separates moderate from extraordinary success. The author asserts that there is no such thing as a self-made man, that \\"the true origins of high achievement\\" lie instead in the circumstances and influences of one's upbringing, combined with excellent timing. Gladwell suggests that things like what income level, culture, and time of a child's birth are important contributors to success, as well as a person's tenacity and agility. As the last of these is the least conventional, think of it this way: Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and many other computer masterminds would likely not have distinguished themselves.

B002ZG980U|4.0|Empathy turns out to be the biggest challenge that filmmaker Christopher Nolan faces in his audaciously intricate, sometimes confounding 2010 sci-fi action thriller. It's a 148-minute somersault of a ride viscerally engaging in its vivid elaboration of lucid dreaming. Ironically, there is little time to feel for the characters involved when the whole point of the movie is that nothing is meant to feel real. This dramatic dilemma is almost completely shouldered by the main protagonist Dom Cobb, a professional thief specializing in corporate espionage whose sharpened gifts as an \\"extractor\\" allows him to enter the dreams of others to obtain information that is otherwise inaccessible. Heading up a [[ASIN:B000EGDB10 Mission Impossible]]-type task force, Cobb has become a [[ASIN:0792163710 Shane]]-like solitary figure whose talents have cost him his family. He wants nothing more than to see the faces of his two young children.<br /><br />The movie wastes no time in giving Cobb a final mission, his one last shot at redemption which will allow him to reunite with his family back in the states. A Japanese tycoon named Saito wants Cobb to perform an act of \\"inception\\" in which he would plant an idea in the subconscious of Robert Fischer Jr., the son of a corporate rival who is about to inherit his father's energy conglomerate. Saito wants Fischer to dissolve the company to prevent the corporation's inevitable takeover of global energy resources, but Cobb's participation represents a risky maneuver that conjures up memories of his dead wife Mal. She figures in the dream episodes in unexpected ways that invariably cloud Cobb's judgment in executing upon the mission for Saito. A crack team has been assembled to aid Cobb - Arthur, the point man who researches the targets whose dreams will be infiltrated; Eames, a cocky forger who has the ability to change identities inside dreams; Yusuf, a chemist who has developed the powerful sedatives that take Cobb and crew into the dream state; and Ariadne, a preternaturally talented graduate student whom Cobb and Arthur train as their new architect.<br /><br />As both writer and director, Nolan methodically bends the storyline into a labyrinth that turns out to be circular in structure and contains at least  four layers of dreams in which the task force must tag team in order to wake up to the next higher level until they each face reality. This is easier said than done since he attempts to show the unconscious as a supremely unruly place where nothing ultimately makes sense, and that's the film's major conundrum since it demands that the narrative must make some amount of sense to make the viewer feel engaged with the story being told. Leonardo DiCaprio brings his trademark intensity to Cobb and manages a gravitas that helps ground the story at a human level, even when the plot convolutions get more and more elaborate and far-fetched. There are some impressive CGI set-pieces like the street of Paris folding over like an omelet, a train careening down a busy downtown street, and the eerie sight of a vacant city in a virtual limbo. Other scenes border on the silly like Arthur's fight scene amid a rotating hotel that make him look like he's doing a [[ASIN:B000UJ48SG 2001]] riff on Fred Astaire's classic dance routine in [[ASIN:B000P2A5BW Royal Wedding]], or the way Ariadne precociously diagnoses the solutions to fatalistic dreams like an worldly scholar.<br /><br />By no means does the approach translate into ineffectual performances by the rest of the eclectic cast. It's just that the actors reflect the generally poker-faced manner expected within the sci-fi genre. Joseph Gordon-Levitt ([[ASIN:B001UV4XUG (500) Days of Summer]]) plays Arthur just that way as does Ken Watanabe ([[ASIN:B0001JXOVC The Last Samurai]]) appropriately inscrutable as Saito. Ellen Page ([[ASIN:B000YABYLA Juno]]) neutralizes her naturally sardonic manner to play up Ariadne's naïve curiosity, but to her defense, she has some ofthe clunkiest dialogue to deliver. Tom Hardy and Dileep Rao fare better as Eames and Yusuf, respectively simply because they play plot devices more than people. Cillian Murphy ([[ASIN:B000EHRVOM Breakfast on Pluto]]) channels his usually intimidating intensity into Fischer's deceptively becalming manner, while an almost unrecognizable Tom Berenger manages to play his father's loyal associate with welcome gusto. As Mal, Marion Cotillard ([[ASIN:B00005JPX8 La Vie en Rose]]) has by far the film's most challenging role, maintaining a careful balance between a spectral figure of longing for Cobb and a manipulative femme fatale.<br /><br />As one would expect from a Nolan film, all the production details are exquisite. Wally Pfister's astonishing cinematography contributes immeasurably to the film's overall hypnotic effect, and Hans Zimmer's foreboding, percussive score thrusts the drama forward with momentum. This movie is too startling a work to ignore, but it would be disingenuous to say that this venture reflects a grand vision since the story is basically an elaborate heist movie. Everything is so well thought out that Nolan may have inadvertently prevented his audience from feeling the full emotional impact of the ending despite the superb editing job by Lee Smith that juggles all the concurrent dreams together. This is still masterful filmmaking from someone who could have focused a tad less on technique and a tad more on the untamed heart that really alters the order within our dreams.to deliver.

B003ITZBW2|5.0|Batman Under the Red Hood is an excellent addition to the DCAU. Bruce Greenwood does an excellent portrayal of Batman that is comparable to Kevin Conroy (GASP!) and John Dimagggio follows in the footsteps of Mark Hammil masterfully. Jense Ackles plays the Red Hood and does a decent job despite his limited acting ability. What makes this such an excellent movie is how all the characters are integrated together without feeling cluttered. Black Mask, Ras al Ghul, the Joker all play an equal part in this intricately woven tale. Some of the other Animated films, specifically the  Justice League ones feel too cluttered and the characters tend to lose themselves. What really makes this film stand tall above the rest is the flashbacks to Batman and Jason Todd in the early years. We get an inside look into the relationship between Batman and Robin as well as how a young Robin grows into a cocky, brash, and violent teenager. Nightwing is a great addition as well. We have never seen many team ups of Batman and Nightwing in the Animated Universe and watching them take on AMAZO and chase down the Red Hood was really fun to watch.   This is one of the better Batman films, but Parents beware, its violent. Put your kids to bed so Dad can watch it by himself. After watching this realtively short film, it leaves you craving a spiritual successor to Batman The ANimated Series; perhaps one with hour long episodes, overarching stories, and more adult themes. I can't get enough of these films. Keep churning them out DC!

Speaking as someone who grew up in the pristine wilderness of Montana, I'm a conservationist who doesn't much care for the radical eco-nazi Green movement, but I can relate to the ecological theme far more than you urbanites out there.  I don't have to buy into the propaganda to enjoy a movie with a message, even when it resorts to gross steriotypes. After all, the steriotypes do apply to certain corporations. Not all of them, but some of the multi-national corps are real stinkers. They operate above the laws of any given nation .. and, interstingly enough, that was the main theme of this movie.  As to the technical merits of the film ... well, I've got sense enough to enjoy a movie without picking the thing apart on technical merits. If a better version comes out later, I'll buy it. Until then .. pass the popcorn.

There are 3 or 4 decent songs towards the beginning of the album, but then the backend comes along. The last few songs are all slow and not even good! At least the slower songs on the last album were awesome songs! These ones are just boring! Needless to say, I am very disappointed with the effort put into this album. I know they can't do Waking The Fallen again, but at least give the fans a good mix of the last two CDs and not this garbage.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Hey all this is Sam AKA Para in the gaming review community. This is one of many gaming reviews I will be starting for Amazon, so I hope you enjoy. Going to be talking about the PS3 controller which I have to say right off the bat has a great feel to it. It is light but durable at the same time. After playing for long hours I notice no pain in my hands, just the way the designed this controller it just fits right in your hands and is not stressing out you muscles or having you to curve your hands around it just to hold it. The vibration feedback is very well and is not super strong that it feels like a back massager or making your hands go numb, but it is not also so weak that you cannot even feel it. It gives just the right amount. The motion control has been done very well and I was surprised at first but they nailed it. You don't even need a wii mote for the simple technology Sony has put in the controller lol. The triggers are in just the right position but the triggers themselves could use a bit of a lift, they just seem a bit too small. I love that everything is pressure sensitive from the triggers to the actually buttons with is great for racing games. The joy sticks are perfectly assessable and once again do not strain your hands trying to use them. Overall the controller is very nice and easy to use. Battery life is the best I have seen in a wireless controller to date. Good work Sony not changing to original controller, only improving them slightly (Don't change what isn't broken and Sony has done that with the controller). Hope this review helps and look forward for my other game reviews.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|Rabid fans of the novel will be disappointed at what's left out - for everyone else, this is probably the best of the Potter movies so far...fantastic art direction and cinematography, that help build up the sense that unstoppable Darkness is approaching Hogwarts... wonderfully poignant glimpses of the Hogwarts kids as teenagers who may be great at magic but don't know what to do with their hormones... though this episode is one last stop, before the two-part finale, it's deeply satisfying in its own right, as we see the wrenching end of the beloved characters' innocence -the last dark glimpse of Hogwarts before the Beginning of the End.
006621131X|5.0|I have been a fan of Patti Smith for many, many years, ok since \\"Horses\\" came out in 1975 (which I know dates me), but I wasn't really aware of her background, or her relationship with Robert Mapplethorpe, until I read this book.<br /><br />In \\"Just Kids\\" (299 pages), Patti Smith brings her memoir of primarily her relationship with Robert Mapplethorpe, but it brings so much more, giving brief glampses of her earliest upbringings in Pennsylvania and then New Jersey, and how she finally decides to go to New York in the late 60s, where by complete happenstance she meets Robert Mapplethorp. And then the book really takes off. Mapplethrope (who passed away in 1989) has become a controversial figure (I should now, since an exhibit of his here in Cincinnati 1990 resulted in charges of obscenity--which evetually were acquited), but you get a completely different sense in Patti's tales of Robert. They lived together for a number of years and it's clear that she treasured him a lot (and still does). When the book gets into the 73/74 era, this is where it really becomes fascinating stuff for music history buffs, as we see how Patti Smith the poet slowly but surely becomes Patti Smith the rock musician. Must read for any fan of rock history.<br /><br />The book has many heart-breaking moments, and Patti Smith writes the whole tale in such a respectful and loving way that I found myself turning the pages. I simply could not put this book down. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

As one of the best alternative acts of the last decade, The Gorillaz have been the consistently manufacturing classic tracks that I can repeat over and over and over. The Plastic Beach album is full of repeaters: Stylo, Welcome to the World of the Plastic Beach, Rhinestone Eyes, Empire Ants, Broken, Melancholy Hill....basically the whole album. I am glad that I've finally purchased a piece of work from the Gorillaz and Amazon.com was a wonderful way in which to do so. A very happy customer I am.

B002ZG994U|5.0|Remakes of old TV series make a lot of people sceptical - fans are not sure if the spirit of the series will be intact and those unfamiliar with the series are not sure if they would be able to follow the movie.     As someone who saw the A-team episodes only AFTER the movie I say: Fear Not!     Fans of the series - you will not be dissapointed! Actors do a great job, script is solid and you will enjoy this movie as much as the series.     Those who never saw the TV series: don't worry. The movie is very entertaining and you don't need to see the series in order to enjoy it.     And personally, I think that Sharlto Copley did a great job in this movie!

B003ITZBVS|5.0|Not as big a fan of Batman movies as I have some of the other DC universe titles but this one was worth getting. When I first started the movie I wondered who the Red Hood would be. Especially after The Joker appeared as The Red Hood in Batman Brave and Bold series. It starts off with the Joker having a new look killing second Robin Jason Todd then jumping five years to a Gotham that has the police patrol blimps we use to see in Batman The Animated series.  While I'm not sure if I prefer The Black Mask in this animated incarnation or that one from the previous THE BATMAN series better I find find this movie to have no dead spots. It just move from one action filled scheme like Batman and Nightwing taking on Amazo the android or The Red Hood giving the other drug lords little join but to follow his orders or else. A great cast of voice actors are provided for this picture and it has a wonderful preview of the next DC Universe movie coming out Sept 28 2010 staring Super girl.  The new Super girl's origin story taken directly from the pages of Superman/Batman comics the way Public Enemies had.

0060273224|3.0|Strengths:<br /><br />The magic - Very interesting and unique view of magic. Different than any book I've read. The \\"spells\\" combine speaking, writing and other sounds. And the magic is a mix of free and controlled magic, so to say. It's all very complex, really, but in a good way. And the idea of using bells to control the dead was simply genius.<br /><br />The dead - The whole mythology about death, the dead creatures, etc was captivating. Very cool dead creatures. His descriptions of dead armies of corpses falling apart (and the like) was bone-chilling.<br /><br />This section is short but this part of the book is truly amazing. And I do believe the book is worth reading for these strengths alone.<br /><br />Weaknesses:<br /><br />The world - The actual world, not the mythology. It was essentially medieval England/turn-of-the-20th-century England (the Old Kingdom and Ancelstierre respectively). And we barely got to see any of it, or any of the people who inhabited it. Absolutely no uniqueness at all with this world. The idea of the two separate countries and the Wall was interesting, but this wasn't developed enough to count.<br /><br />Good and bad mixed:<br /><br />The writing - Some passages were like poetry. Others were riddled with cliches, poor writing (his horribly misused similes come to mind) and just plain dry and boring sequences. I was amazed by the inconsistency of the quality of writing in this book. Too many times his word choices didn't put into my mind any sort of picture, it just became a jumble of words on a page. I had a hard time getting lost in the imagery the words created,  because a lot of times they didn't create anything. Then other times I could see exactly what was going on in my mind. Again, very inconsistent.<br /><br />The overall story - The action sequences were gripping. Very well done. The problem is that everything in between wasn't particularly interesting. I found that I had to force myself to turn the page, hoping that somewhere down the line something interesting would pop up. It did, but only about four or five times in the book, and really only in the second half. I will say this, when it's good, it's very good. And the ending comes together nicely.<br /><br />I've thought about why the overall story fell so flat with me. I believe it's because the main plot arc was pretty thin. Her father is missing. She goes on a journey to find him. An evil guy wants to stop her. That's pretty much it. A lot more happened, but it either didn't directly affect the main plot arc or it did but wasn't made clear exactly how until the very end (ie, was underdeveloped at the time). This might have worked if all the little adventures and side plot points were compelling in themselves, but most of the time they weren't. The only reason I kept reading was because this book got such high reviews.<br /><br />The characters - I realized while reading the final sequence that I did not particularly care who lived or died. Or what happened in the end. I liked Sabriel. I liked Touchstone. I liked Mogget. I just didn't connect at all with any of them. And I wouldn't even say that they lacked depth. We just weren't shown enough of it. I feel like there was a lot of wasted potential for Nix to really pull us into the emotions and motivations of these characters. This may be made up in later books in the series, but I have to judge this book on its own merits.<br /><br />IN SUMMARY: Interesting and compelling magic and mythology, but a weak plot and inconsistent writing and character development. I have to give it 3 stars. I wanted to give it 5. I wonder if a lot of people are swept up by the coolness of the mythology and magic and so don't focus on its other weaknesses. Whatever it is, this book just didn't impress me all that much.d, but only about four or five times in the book, and really only in the second half. I will say this, when it's good, it's very good. And the ending comes together nicely.    I've thought about why the overall story fell so flat with me. I believe it's because the main plot arc was pretty thin. Her father is missing. She goes on a journey to find him. An evil guy wants to stop her. That's pretty much it. A lot more happened, but it either didn't directly affect the main plot arc or it did but wasn't made clear exactly how until the very end (ie, was underdeveloped at the time). This might have worked if all the little adventures and side plot points were compelling in themselves, but most of the time they weren't. The only reason I kept reading was because this book got such high reviews.     The characters - I realized while reading the final sequence that I did not particularly care who lived or died. Or what happened in the end. I liked Sabriel. I liked Touchstone. I liked Mogget. I just didn't connect at all with any of them. And I wouldn't even say that they lacked depth. We just weren't shown enough of it. I feel like there was a lot of wasted potential for Nix to really pull us into the emotions and motivations of these characters. This may be made up in later books in the series, but I have to judge this book on its own merits.

0451205766|3.0|I came to the book first and then I saw the movie.  I have to admit, I find both of them to be overrated.  I enjoy mob books and films (Goodfellas and Puzo's The Last Don), but I struggled to get into this one.  The characters were somewhat wooden and uninteresting, and I never did see how Michael could have transformed from law-abiding son to a cold-hearted mob boss so easily.   However, as another reviwer suggested, this book would have had more potential as a Tom Wolfe-style novel documenting  life in the 1940's and 50's.  Puzo said that he was \\"selling out\\" by writing this book, and I believe that he was never happy with this book or receiving the reputation of a pulp writer.  Puzo's best book is Fool's Die.  Puzo's best mob book,in my opinion, is The Last Don.  It's kind of pulpy as well, but maybe because it was set in the contemporary period, I could identify with and enjoy it more.
B002HFJ77S|4.0|i was impressed with this different story and  character development of the 2 heroines. book takes you to the roaring twenties with your fun young grandma ghost as a guide. unique heart warming and genuine fun and also beautifully  written. may to try a shopholic book although i had no interest until i read this book and author's style. great fun!
B0017V7GLC|4.0|Velocifero and Witching Hour are so similar they could have been a two disc set. Not only are they consistent to each other, but each of them only contain one or two \\"wild card\\" tracks that break away in a different direction. I really like the two foreign language tracks on this disc. They are rare moments where Ladytron are slightly less recognizable. Ladytron are not like Goldfrapp, trying to make each disc sound different. Instead their evolution is much better paced and less eratic. However, a Goldfrapp/Ladytron concert bill would certainly get my money. I wonder if they know each other...
B002RI9ZQ8|2.0|I saw this had been in the top 100 for over a year and figured it must be the greatest book ever written, which it is not by far. Don't get me wrong it is not bad by any means, however It took me the best part of a week to get through the first half, and I found myself asking if I could really be bothered finishing it. The protagonist of the trilogy hardly even makes much of an appearance in the begging other than the odd paragraph here or a chapter there. However, the second half of the book is actually really well written and I read through it in one night.<br /><br />I don't know that I would really recommend this book, and I certainly will not be reading the rest of the trilogy.
B000002G89|5.0|Pretty much like anything Clapton has done so just recently added this early album to the mix. On first listen, was surprised to hear such a different mood in the music. Reading the reviews let us know that this was an album with another flavor, but kept waiting for the fast riffs and wailing of other albums. Was a little disappointed after one listen, but each time you hear this one it grows on you Now we consider this one really great, mellow sound and love to put this on and let it fill you with the sense of peace Clapton seems to have come to at this time of his life. The reggae sound in used in several of the songs and there is quite a variety on this one, from first to last take. He is still one of the BEST guitar artists.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I got this yesterday and have hardly been able to put it down since other than to sleep and eat ... It had me glued to it constantly.. Lots of exciting events happen and the protagonist is the sort of person that you could imagine as being your friend. Very well written and I can't wait to get the rest of the trilogy!!!
B001853NZK|5.0|I have been purchasing Ultra card products for over 20 years now.  This binder has a very high quality feel to it, you can tell they take pride in the durability of their product.  If you need a notebook to protect cards, or stamps or anything else you may think to put in it, I wouldn't hesitate to buy another 10 of these cause I know they will hold up.
B002ZG9788|2.0|The campy 1981 favorite Clash of the Titans gets a massive CGI-fed facelift with this remake directed by Louis Leterrier (The Incredible Hulk, Transporter 2), and it definitely isn't for the better.  Sam Worthington, hot on the heels of the success of Avatar, stars as the demigod Perseus, whose father Zeus (Liam Neeson) has grown disillusioned and unhappy with how the humans worship the Gods of Olympus.  When Zeus' evil brother Hades (Ralph Fiennes) plans on unleashing all hell upon the planet, Perseus leads a trek to stop him, before beautiful Princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) is sacrificed.  The Clash of the Titans remake features the familiar creatures from the original film: Medusa, giant scorpions, harpies, and of course, the Kraken (Bubo is here too in a throwaway cameo).  However, in re-creating a modern update, the filmmakers forgot one vital thing in the process: making it fun to watch.  While there is a cavalcade of action and PG-13 rated violence, this new Clash of the Titans lacks any of the fun elements or charm of its predecessor.  The original film, while cheesy, campy, and oh so dated now, still has a degree of charm to it regardless because it's just plain fun to watch and easy to enjoy.  Here, the story and action are so mindless and boring that it's just hard to keep paying attention.  Acting-wise Worthington is solid, as are Gemma Arterton and Mads Mikkelsen as his allies on his journey, but no one else makes any sort of lasting impression.  The CGI effects are a mix of good and surprisingly sub-par, yet somehow, Perseus' battle with Medusa is worth the price of admission alone.  All in all, this new take on Clash of the Titans may be worthwhile for younger viewers who have no knowledge of the original film, but for the rest of us who grew up with the original Ray Harryhausen-effects featured film, it'd be for the best to just disregard this remake.
0451169514|5.0|King has a natural (maybe supernatural) talent of writing horror novels. Everyone knows that. What a lot of folks don't know is he is one of our generations greatest writers period taking genre out of the equation. I've never read a novel that jumps back and forth to two timelines that I've enjoyed...until now. King does it effortlessly and fluidly. Also the story itself is so absorbing I had a hard time putting this book down each night. Childhood and childhood fears are two things King does great with and this story is no exception. The young characters come to life instantly. Its easy to picture each one. With all that said, this is perhaps the scariest novel I've ever read. One novel comes to mind that trumps this one in the scare department and its not King. It was immensely spooky because it dealt with not only childhood fears, which we can all relate to, but an evil of magnitudal proportions. Yes, this book is long but every paragraph is needed to build this story. Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy if you've never read this.
B003ITZBVI|3.0|Warning: spoilers ahead...<br /><br />Adapting his own much maligned comic storyline while writing Batman, Judd Winick's Batman: Under the Red Hood is the latest in the DC/Warner Bros. line of direct-to-video animated features.  Combining the controversial 80s storyline \\"A Death in the Family\\" with his own \\"Under the Hood\\" (along with a great nod to Alan Moore's classic \\"The Killing Joke\\", Winick weaves a tale involving a guilt-ridden Batman (voiced by Bruce Greenwood) who, years after the death of Jason Todd, the second Robin, at the hands of the Joker (voiced by John Di Maggio), finds himself at odds with the vigilante Red Hood (voiced by Supernatural's Jensen Ackles).  Red Hood appears to be carving a deadly path through Gotham City's criminal underworld ruled by Black Mask (voiced by Prison Break's Wade Williams) while at the same time hiding his own agenda with Batman; all of which leads up to the inevitable showdown and revelation.  For those unfamiliar with the comic storyline, Jason Todd was brought back from the dead after years of being one of those \\"untouchable\\" dead characters in comics (much like Bucky (who also came back from the dead in Captain America around the same time, Gwen Stacy, or Uncle Ben), who meant more in death than they ever did in life.  Winick's storyline wasn't quite praised at the time, although it does seem to fit better here as an animated feature.  That being said, even those who are unfamiliar with Batman comic continuity won't have much trouble figuring out Red Hood's identity.  The animation itself is sharp, some of the voices are well cast, and the feature as a whole is surprisingly quite violent.  With all that being said, the dialogue doesn't quite hold up well, Nightwing (voiced by Neil Patrick Harris) comes off as a laughable character, and compared to the past DC Universe features, Under the Red Hood just isn't as enthralling.  Still though, it's worth a look at the very least, and goes down much smoother than Winick's comic storyarc ever did.yarc ever did.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|So the movie is not as good as the movie but it answers questions and a good wrap up for the show \\"firefly.\\" anyway, I received this movie really fast and for a fair price. I think I paid about $8-$9 and shipping and handling. The movie was in excellent condition, it was almost as if no one has ever touched it. The case is pretty cool, not your normal DVD case and its Collector's edition which is a plus. I have not gone through the bonus features or anything yet but will soon. O
0316069906|5.0|For author Jonathan Foer, the imminent birth of his son forced him to rethink food on a fundamental level. Parents always want they best for their children, and for Foer it led to a three year journey into the philosophical, environmental, and health ramifications of eating animals. The result was 'Eating Animals', a highly relevant and accessible book, illuminating the the truth about animal agriculture and its effects on Western Civilization.<br /><br />'Eating Animals' begins with an articulate and thought-provoking deconstruction of our relationship with animals. It invites us to examine the stories and assumptions we hold about animals meanwhile show us the way most of these ideas actual play out in the world, namely, through exploitation. The proceeding chapters take the reader on an in-depth journey into the world of factory farming and its subsequent ramifications in public heath, the economy, the environment, science, and human rights. Included are interviews with farmers and activists, sharing their experience, insight, and hope for a radical transformation of systematic meat production.<br /><br />Foer's writing style is both casual and engaging, filled with personal anecdotes and reflections of his own journey into vegetarianism.  In fact, it is this quality that made 'Eating Animals' such a pleasure to read. The book reads more like a novel or personal memoir than an educational text. Its engaging and actually enjoyable to read, while also providing sound information on factory farming.<br /><br />'Eating Animals' should be required reading to all in the Western World. It's an important book, challenging the dominant paradigm we hold about animals and how we ethically ought to treat them. More over, 'Eating Animals' spans a wide spectrum of important information in a manner that is comprehensive and approachable. Read it and be transformed!
B003QSSIJ8|4.0|RPA and the United Nations of Sound is a gruop formed by Richard Paul Aschroft (the RPA in the band name) of UK band The Verve. Comprising Ashcroft, Steve Wyreman, Paul \\"DW\\" Wright, Derrick Wright and Reggie Dozier, their sound is a hybrid of the expansive Rock of The Verve with classic Soul leanings. The band name reflects their ethnic and musical diversity.<br /><br />Produced by Hip Hop producer No ID, one listen to opening cut the orchestral \\"Are you ready\\" and you'd be forgiven for thinking you were listening to The Verve. A typically long sprawling piece. Things don't change much on tracks like \\"Born again\\" (\\"Get up when you're on the floor, do you wanna fight some more?\\")  or \\"America\\" (with a guttural beat, snarling guitars, and lyrics finding Ashcroft seemingly searching for the soul of America).<br /><br />\\"This thing called life\\" is where things start to sound different, a lilting Soul ballad backed by a choir and the lyrics \\"Learn the drugs don't really work, unless you know the ones that hurt\\" - a nod to \\"The drugs don't work\\" from \\"Urban Hymns\\" perhaps. Other songs with Soul are \\"Good loving\\", the Bluesy \\"How deep is your man\\", the breezy falsetto sung Motown-style \\"Life can be so beautiful\\" (truly spectacular and the best thing here by miles), and the grandiose ballad \\"Let my soul rest\\". These really sound like the collaborative effort one would expect from the pedigree of musicians involved.<br /><br />\\"She brings me the music\\" is a tender piano/guitar ballad and an ode to his wife, while the solemn almost Gospel \\"Glory\\" is truly glorious.<br /><br />While Aschroft didn't fully push for a new sound, this is still hugely enjoyable. Here's hoping this isn't just a one-off collaboration.
B002ZG980U|4.0|I think 3.5 or 4 stars is an acceptable range. My father in law napped in spite of the five story IMAX theatre and sound system. The story is a little basic as some suggested, but surprisingly a few reviewers said they thought it was complicated and hard to follow. Anyone who has read a Phillip K. Dick SF novel knows this is all pretty standard mead. Gripping for such a long movie with tense scenes in which there are fights in weightlessnes and twirling rooms. It's all kind of gyratingly fantasticulating, but in the end, splendatious.
B000GFLE1S|5.0|I honestly had no idea what to expect from this movie. Frankly I thought it was great. It takes a crazy concept - a British shoe factory dedicated to making kinky red boots for transvestites - and makes it both heartwarming and funny. It manages to combine the best of both the Indie and Hollywood worlds - professional production quality and great acting (this is no cheap BBC production), but also a strong plot - and one that isn't as predictable as the usual Hollywood fare. I'm just surprised that this movie hasn't received more attention - it certainly deserves it. Chiwetel Ejiofor as the transvestite \\"Lola\\" is great, combining the confidence of a drag performer with the insecurities of a little boy. The soundtrack includes some great hits (I hate to admit it, but I actually like some of these songs better when they're sung by a \\"transvestite\\"). And it's all based on a true story! Highly recommended.
0307593525|5.0|Undoubtedly one of my best cookbooks. I've learned so much from it. It is a must have for anyone who is serious about being a good cook.
B003IY47JK|5.0|One of the very best albums that I have ever heard. If I could rate higher I would. Highly recommended if you love metal with women singing. Marco from Nightwish also does a fantastic job in this album too.
B0011UBDTK|4.0|Sex and the City is not a masterpiece. It is not the greatest show ever created. It is, however, generally good fun. The characters are a little uneven at times -- Carrie, for instance, seems to grow very little over the course of the show, while Miranda has a very satisfying arc and ends up a nearly completely different person.    I will say that the 6th and final season is *fantastic*, and well worth the build up. Watching the first movie with my wife without having seen any of the series, I thought it was decent. I've heard the second movie is ... not as decent. But I truly believe that if the two-part season finale had been released as a movie, it would have garnered critical acclaim. It's that good.    The actual box set is cute, nothing to gush over. The extras are sparse, but the episodes are all there. If you're looking for something to keep the insane Sex and The City fanatic occupied for years, you're out of luck, but really, it's what I expected.    Don't buy this set expecting a life changing event. But if you want to see a show that generally entertains, occasionally surprises, and always pushes boundaries, it's worth picking up.
B000002549|5.0|First, let me say, I'm a big Barbara Fan and also love classical music so this is the best of both worlds.  It's wonderful music that any classical fan would know and be familiar with but with Barbara's own beautiful voice.  I would recommend it highly
B003OF3R0S|4.0|This is a talented band. \\"God Hates Us\\" is a terrific song which fans of their earlier albums are going to like. The vocals are much more aggressive on that song, but the rest of the album, while still good, was a bit disheartening for me in the vocal department. Everybody is really tired of the \\"new style of singing versus the old style of screaming\\" argument that divides Avenged fans, but it's important to note that Avenged had become less aggressive vocally, and much less technical with their guitar-work on the self-titled album. This was a weak direction for them to take as a metal band, but their guitar players definitely woke back up with this new release.<br /><br />What Nightmare gives us is more of that technical guitar work from City of Evil mixed with the dark and moody atmosphere of their self-titled album, though not as melodramatic. It's pretty good. The song \\"Save Me\\" reveals how damn talented they are. As mentioned, though, the vocals were soft much too often. There are seriously like 5 ballad-sounding songs on this album. Of these, the only one I cared about at all was \\"Fiction\\" which features an awesome piano interwoven with cymbals and bass drums. It then turns into a duet with the vocalist and their recently deceased drummer, Jimmy, who wrote this song. It has an intensely ominous feel to it, and it's an absolute heartbreaker.<br /><br />No BS, that guy was talented. There were only two songs back on the self titled album I liked. One of them was the great \\"A Little Piece of Heaven,\\" which Jimmy wrote (Scream was the other one). This guy's passing was a big loss. Avenged has always broken through with some really creative stuff on every album and I think that's hard to deny. Jimmy was a big part of this creativity, though, so it might be a shaky future for Avenged. Pretty cool album we have here, though, and praise is due.

B003L45JLW|5.0|Tom Petty is not my favorite entertainer,  but, since sacd and dvd audio dissappeared I thought I would support any  offering in high definition(above 16/44).   Playing this through an Oppo 983SE really demonstrates what  audio offered to  the consumer really should sound like.  I only hope others will  offer similar surround (or high def) recordings.  I purchase most anything I can find on e-bay (about the only place you can  find most sacd/dvd audio). Why did the industry abandon those great formats?   If you have a surround system and a blue ray player, this disk is well worth the reasonable price I payed at Amazon.  Thanks.

B003ITZBVI|2.0|Batman Under the Red Hood has a decent storyline with some minor character. The movie is rated PG-13 and geared toward an older audience. With that said the animation itself is not impressive. I enjoy 2D animation, however, it seems with these direct to dvd animated movies the animation has not progressed. Anything that moves is brighter than the backgrounds which takes away from the visual aspect of the story. Its been an element of animation that I never liked. When other animated movies, that are geared towards adults or even children, have progressed the DC and Marvel animated films seem to stay the same. The perspective on the figures seem to be off, there's no weight to the action; its as if everyone in a fight defies gravity, and the detail of the characters are simple. I was never a fan of the Batman: TAS. I thought the block style animation was terrible and there was no fluidity to the motion of the characters. This is the case with some of the animation in this film. Some of the half hour cartoons today have better animation than these films. Dark and grittieness comes off as cheesy with simple animation. The opening credits sequence has more mood and tone than the rest of the film. The Batman Gotham Knights sticks out animation wise and its mostly done by japanimation artists. Save your money and rent these movies. If you like it, then purchase the movie. If these animated movies are going to be geared towards an older audience then there should be more to it than violence and people being murdered. The short running time and the animation that hasn't changed much since the 80's isn't going to do it for me.
B00005JPS6|4.0|I was reluctant to watch Bee Movie when it was released in theaters, but I decided to give it a try. My expectations were low and this movie surpassed them surprisingly. It was very funny, and I came out of the theaters in a really good mood. To be honest, the plot is pretty silly but this movie wasn't supposed to be a masterpiece, and it delivered a lot of laughs for me. I think that's why this movie wasn't a huge success with critics, you need a good story and good jokes to make a great movie, if one of these two elements is missing it makes the movie forgettable. Oh, and all the puns! They were so lame, I can't BEE-lieve Jerry Seinfeld wrote those in...Oops...Even on the DVD case you still can't escape the puns so if you don't enjoy puns BEE-ware of this movie. Gasp!!! I did it again! I'm un-BEE-lievably sorry. AAAHHH!!!<br /><br />DreamWorks talked about how impressive the 3D is in Bee Movie but I don't understand. It looks like standard 3D. I just don't see the enhanced technology. The humans in this movie look rather stiff, and lifeless besides the very main characters, an example is during a scene with a news report, the reporter's mouth is way out of sync with the vocal dialogue given. But, the bees look good and the honey looks very realistic. I also wasn't impressed with the bee hive, the colors aren't vibrant and it looked a little drab in my opinion. But I did like some of the creative objects in the hive, the bee's antennas are used as phones, the bees drive vehicles, and there is a device that lets you sharpen your stinger (A pencil sharpener) And Barry's closet is filled with the exact same black and yellow shirts. There are so many silly objects like these listed and it's so much fun spotting them.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed Bee Movie's Cast, Renee Zellweger voices Barry's human friend Vanessa and I though Barry and Vanessa's friendship was entirely believable. And Ken (who's voiced by Patrick Warburton) is hysterical, he just flips out so much in this movie and it really cracks me up. And there are many more celebrities featured in Bee Movie, Chris Rock, (voices a dragonfly) Oprah Winfrey, (voices a judge) Larry King, (voices \\"Bee\\" Larry King) Ray Liotta (as himself) and a bunch more. I was also excited that Mathew Broderick voiced a character in Bee Movie, he also was in the Lion King and I love that movie. So what I'm getting at is there's a great cast for Bee Movie.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie so much I decided to purchase the two disc special edition but I was disappointed. (I'll discuss the problems later on in my review.) The extras for disc one of Bee Movie were subpar and I was hoping I would see more about the making of the film, but there not bad. I loved the \\"TV Juniors\\", you really need to watch these, you don't learn anything about the movie but they will have you cracking up. They run around five minutes and this DVD includes sixteen of them, and they're so silly, one of the TV Juniors features Jerry Seinfeld and the DreamWorks crew as they search for \\"the elusive animators\\" and if captured, they're forced to work at DreamWorks. Also included were some deleted scenes and the live-action Bee Movie trailers. There are also two very brief features about Jerry Seinfeld's flight dressed as a bee in Cannes to promote Bee Movie, and a short feature about the cast of Bee Movie. Those were disc ones bonus features and they're fine for a standard DVD, but the bonus features on disc two are awful. All that's included is a music video, and a few children games. This is a two disc special edition! So I was disappointed that I spent more money than on the single disc edition and all I got were a few extra children games.<br /><br />If you enjoyed Bee Movie you need to own the DVD, but if you want to save money just buy the single disc edition, unless that is you enjoy children games and if that's the case go right ahead.and it really cracks me up.

B000LC4TJ0|4.0|Be honest with you, I didn't like the tempi of the overture. It surprised me that was from Harnoncourt. Because he was the forerunner of Mozart and other Baroque music for me. I have listened almost all his recordings on symphonies, he is the one who 'think-again' rather than just 'follow' the conventional taste.<br /><br />And later, I listened the overture again while I was watching this Figaro DVD (I never watched this opera before). You know, this time, I didn't bothered by the tempi of the overture anymore. I think it's fine. Even it's a lot slower than most of the version, the phrasing and the imagination are still there. Nothing really missed. The Wiener Philharmoniker is great of course. (I actually hear clearly the sound of the concertmaster, has anyone noticed that? he plays way louder than others)<br /><br />Since this is my first time to watch Figaro, I didn't had it's 'comedy' deep in mind. So, after I watched this production, I felt it is more like 'drama' than 'comedy'. This has been stated by other reviewers.<br /><br />I am not a huge fan of Anna (Susanna), I just think her voice is not as 'concentrated' as others (only for my taste). Maybe her voice could be better for Romantic operas. I will find out later though. But, her acting is not bad. And her dress in this Susanna is very elegant for me and I like her shoes (good choice) :)<br /><br />The 'invention' of the angel boy in this production is a genius idea. The stage sets are not changing much as usual probably because of the place. House of Mozart is relatively small.<br /><br />I think I am going to watch another version of Figaro later to see the different.<br /><br />Make sure you watch the bonus on the second DVD. It explains why Harnoncourt think the story of Figaro maybe can express in an altered direction.<br /><br />Yes, I do feel this opera is a bit long, perhaps it was because I was watching it at 2am.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Readers of The Hunger Games will NOT be disappointed by this sequel.  One of the best things about the series in general is the present-tense narrator-driven point of view and the loaded pace.  I practically galloped through this as fast as the first one.  Just when you think you know what's going to happen...<br /><br />If you don't read this after reading The Hunger Games you are doing yourself a complete disservice.
B000PAAJYW|3.0|I really liked this movie until near the ending where for some dumbo reason large frogs started falling out the sky. Really dumb, not to mention gross. This coming from one who has seen his large share of stupid movies amd dumb scenes but this one takes the cake. I mean, how difficult would it have been to have the same scenes be more realistic (and in line with the rest of the movie) with hail, say, the size of baseballs, or even softballs falling from the sky? I think I'll edit it myself with my software editing programs.
B00006AGHD|2.0|This movie was very slow moving, the plot was okay if you could stay awake. However this proved to be too much for me. I managed to fall asleep two times while trying to watch it on two different occasions. The third time was the charm, I did manage to stay awake. For me it wasn't worth it, love Robin Williams and Al Pacino but even that didn't really save the movie in my eyes. All that being said it did have an interesting twist at the end.

Faced with extinction, the survivors had devised a plan to save a remnant of humanity in an isolated, totally self-sufficient city.  It's citizens to be governed by a computer; its overriding directive: for every birth there must be a death.    You are not naturally born, but bred using the limited seed material taken from the populace.  A crystal life-clock will be embedded in your left palm - at first, it will be white.  You will learn from your sleep teacher that as you age your life clock will change color: as a child it is yellow, as a young adult it is green, as an older adult it is red, and when it begins flashing: death approaches.  Your last day is your thirtieth birthday, after that, your life clock goes black and you die.    Do not despair, everyone has a chance for renewal.  On your thirtieth birthday, report to the Carrousel.  You will don the ceremonial garb, take your place on the Carrousel with the others, as it begins to rotate you will be drawn upward, if you are chosen for renewal your life clock will be reset.

0618001905|5.0|While Hochschild does an excellent job shining a light on the happenings in the Congo from its initial colonial conquest until the downfall of its imperial master (the eponymous Leopold) perhaps his greater contribution is to remind us how little of actual history we are taught in our classes in school.<br /><br />Nearly everyone of my friends who read this book was shocked and saddened and not a little astounded as to how this colossal genocide has been erased from our collective memory. The book is best seen as an exhortation to scholars and historians in general to delve deeper into those obscure lacunae of history and tell us more about what really happened on the path here
006056251X|2.0|I am a Lisa Kleypas newbie. I have read three previous books (The Hathaways) which were absolutely great. I decided to go back before their time to read about the Wallflowers and I started with Evangeline Jenner's story. I can truly say my heart hurt that I spent $8.00 on this \\"book\\".    Kleypas making St.Vincent a hero after kidnapping another wallflower and threatening her with don't know what and then having the shyest Evie go to him because he would be her salvation. Really?     I'm all for sex scenes and it was good, but it just overran this book with it. There was no spark when they kissed, no after thought as to why it was so knee weak. It never gave any insite on what the characters were thinking. How they felt. Evie was not a strong women if she fell in love with a man who called her a \\"judgemental bitch.\\" Klepas spent WAY to much time and chapters on St. Vincent's distressed time.     The only thing I really liked about this book was Cam Rohan. The ending was blah, too rushed. My head hurts.
1591843065|5.0|I recently heard Dan speak at one of the marketing events and was abosolutely bought into the statement \\"The person who draws the best/simplest picture gets the funding.\\" That is very true.

Though the book could have been written in a more concise manner, it was educational and fun. It also makes you think. The concepts discussed are simple, yet brilliant.

B002YIHO7I|1.0|That's the problem I see here is as I've often seen before with other artists; movie stars and singers.  What happens is that people who become fans of an artist often become loyal to them to the point where they're willing to think only good of them no matter what; to the point where they're willing give 5 stars to an album they rarely listen to because their loyalty won't allow them to admit they don't really like it.     I'm a fan also, but I also try to be objective no matter how much it hurts me to say one of my fav artists made a crap album.  If you liked Sade because of her down to earth seductive sound as witnessed in her previous albums, you will be soarly dissapointed with this one.  In this album her seduction is gone and replaced with more conventional, childish, pop-like beats.  Most of the songs are about lost love, but they are not at all soulfull.  Instead they come off as desperate and depressing.  There's nothing special about this album.  It has no nuances.  Any subpar artist could have done this. I expected more from Sade.

The newer, spiffier Musicland opened just across the street some 18 months ago, and, as you might imagine, its broad selection and lower prices nearly put me out of business.

0393072231|5.0|In this fascinating book, ex-Wall Street Michael Lewis tells the story of some of those who betted against subprime mortgages, against Wall Street.<br /><br />Subprime mortgages were taken out by those least able to repay the loan. For example, a Mexican strawberry picker earning $14K was lent every cent he needed to buy a $724K house.<br /><br />Household Finance Corporation, with the biggest portfolio of subprime loans, lied to its borrowers they had an `effective rate of 7 per cent' when it was taking 12.5 per cent. In 2002, it settled out-of-court and paid a $484 million fine. In 2003, HSBC Group stupidly bought HFC for $15.5 billion.<br /><br />Goldman Sachs was `notorious for packaging America's worst home loans'. It paid rating agencies to re-rate BBB-rated mortgage bonds, gathered into collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), as AAA. (One hedge fund owner called the rating agencies `whores'.) Standard & Poor's managing director of CDO ratings e-mailed, \\"Any request for loan-level tapes is TOTALLY UNREASONABLE!!\\" Wall Street contracted its credit analysis to people who wouldn't do a credit analysis. $400 billion of CDOs were never properly vetted.<br /><br />By January 2007, Morgan Stanley's star trader had bought $16 billion in AAA-rated CDOs, composed entirely of BBB-rated subprime mortgage bonds. This led to the biggest-ever trading loss on Wall Street.<br /><br />As Lewis writes, the subprime mortgage market was `an engine of exploitation and, ultimately, destruction'. Financier Steve Eisman said, \\"The system was really, `f*** the poor.'\\" The entire business of consumer finance, he said, `existed to rip people off'.<br /><br />When Wall Street fell, Wall Street blamed the American people. The US government then bailed out, not the individual American borrowers, but Wall Street's firms, which had all bankrupted themselves by making dumb bets on subprime borrowers.<br /><br />Goldman Sachs lost its clients a billion dollars.

B002ZG981E|5.0|Inception  is an intricate film: in its storyline, its sets and its special effects. The film is a psychological heist drama that questions the boundaries of dreams and reality and incorporates all that is generally known and perceived to be occurring in the dream state. This film contains plenty of shoot-them-up and blow-them-up scenes to rival the average blockbuster, but Inception stands out due to a fine script, more than capable cast, and the mind-boggling questions it raises.    The film has a traditionally Christopher Nolan feel to it, particularly the very last scene that leaves the viewer to provide the ending that he or she feels inclined. I watched the 6:00 p.m. Monday showing of the film and the AMC theater was quite crowded. At the end of the movie, every single viewer groaned. But the expression was a response to the realization that the film's director wasn't about to provide all the answers.    The reason Christopher Nolan's movies - [[ASIN:B00003CXZ4 Memento]], [[ASIN:B000LC55F2 The Prestige]], [[ASIN:B001GZ6QEC The Dark Knight (+ BD Live) [Blu-ray]]], etc. - are fascinating is because Nolan is able to get his audience to invest in his characters and to believe the world he has created, but Nolan never manipulates his viewers or gives the Hollywood version of the happy endings that blockbusters are expected to have these days.    Nolan is intrinsically original in his storylines and in his portrayal of those storylines and Inception is no different.    I've heard the promotion for this movie as [[ASIN:B000P0J0AQ The Matrix]] meets Mememto. Such a comparison would not do Inception justice. To compare this movie to [[ASIN:B0018O4YSQ Dark City (Director's Cut) [Blu-ray]]] would be to limit the range that Inception undertakes. Simply put, Nolan's latest film is based on the sci-fi films that precede it but it's original in its scope and execution.    As one would expect with a Nolan film, the cast is an ensemble of some of the best actors, each of whomis able to share the screen without a grudge and to hold his or her own. Leonardo DiCaprio is fantastic in his portrayal of a thief who can penetrate the subconsciousness and extract and embed information at will. Both Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are the creme of the crop of those rarest Young Hollywood actors who are not only good-looking and youthful but are also talented. Cillian Murphy displays his naivete and boyish charm, whereas Marion Cotillard is rightfully convincing as the woman who insists of luring DiCaprio's character to spend eternity with her. And last but not least, Michael Caine proves once again that he is able to portray an old sage quite wisely.    It goes without saying, but the special effects and stunts are simply stunning. The art direction of this film deserves the highest accolades and it's quite obvious that without convincing effects this film wouldn't be believable at all.    In writing a review for the film, I came to the realization that I'm truly unable to the express how unique experience of watching this movie is. AWESOME is the only word that truly describes it, as in awe-aspiring fascination with the art of filmmaking and the way a filmmaker can stir up emotions and intellectual understanding in his viewers. This is the kind of film that needs multiple viewings to allow the viewers true immersion into the storyline and true understanding of the plot.
0061205699|5.0|Well, this is another classic novel that I hadn't yet read....hadn't seen the movie...didn't really know much of anything about it at all.  I basically knew that this was a book set in Alabama in the 1930s and it involved a legal case with some sort of racial tension.  In honor of its 50th anniversary, I decided it was high time I pick it up and get to it.    Right from the start I was drawn in by the youthful, vibrant voice of Scout, the 8 year old narrator.  I absolutely loved the way she described the town, the county, the people and everything in her life.  She has such an innocent and honest way of drawing the reader in.  Her simple storytelling narrative is humorous and disarming (which comes in handy as the theme gets heavier).  She did a wonderful job of painting an accurate description (at least as far as I'm concerned) of 1930s Alabama.  I really felt like I was there...like I knew and understood (at least through the eyes of a child) the people of Maycomb.    As I read, I kept waiting for \\"the shoe to drop.\\"  I knew that there was a trial somewhere in this book and that it had some climactic underpinnings in the plot.  As the story continued, I kept telling myself not to worry about the trial...that it would come eventually and that I should just enjoy the wonderful writing.  Harper Lee made it easy to forget the other problems that were coming up (the trial) and keep us engaged in the  intrigue and curiosity of Scout, Jem and Dill.  I loved the various \\"side stories\\" along the way.  They gave great insight into the characters in the town as well as the character of the society/community.    Slowly (but very interestingly) we finally arrive at the trial.  The tension is huge naturally and Scout is worried.  Because of her young age, some of the details she focuses on and her reactions are a little different than might be expected.  It was cool to see Jem's reaction through her eyes (as he gripped the railing so tightly his knuckles turned white).  I absolutely loved her confused and innocent reaction to the outcome of the trial.    What I found even more interesting is that when the trial ended, there were still a considerable number of pages left in the book.  I thought perhaps it would follow an appeals process or something but was glad that the rest of the story was much more engaging than just more courtroom drama.    I loved (and at the same time was disgusted) by the hypocritical action and behavior of the townsfolk after the trial as compared to their behavior before hand.  Most telling was the conversation at the afternoon meeting of the ladies that Scout was compelled to join with her aunt.  The way they almost acknowledged Tom's innocence and Atticus's benevolence and saying that Tom would have been fine if he'd been patient.      Then the conversation about Hitler and the Jews was an excellent counterpoint to the racial tension.  I loved the way that Scout could sense that there was a disconnect in the behavior/talk/action of the townsfolk as they discussed Hitler after behaving the way they did towards Blacks.  She could sense something was wrong and could almost quantify the nature of the disconnect, but she had a hard time acknowledging that there could be such a broad disconnect in the minds of people.    As we reach the end of the book, another climactic event sets events into turmoil.  I \\"predicted\\" one potential \\"sad\\" ending for the book and was actually relieved to see the book turn out the way it did.  There was still a degree of ambiguity as to exactly what happened, but I agree with Heck that there are times when things should be left alone.  Regardless of what actually/definitively happened, the end result is good for the community.  I'm a little concerned to know what happens to the Ewells and to Boo, but those sort of \\"loose ends\\" are to be expected in a novel with such an extensive depth.    There are so many wonderful themes in this book.  The racial tension and description of southern  life and souther racism are at the forefront.  But Lee also explores themes of class and family structure, moral courage and the nature of innocence.  The idea of innocence was especially interesting to me and felt especially poignant with the book coming from the voice of a young child going through such adult ordeals.  Scout's innocence about the world slowly fades as she watches the destruction of Tom's innocence as well as having her conceptions of Boo Radley transform from one of horror/monster to innocent and heroic.    I am very glad I finally got around to reading this book.  I feel like it is a great commentary on culture, society and prejudice.  I loved the narrative voice, the humor and fun way such a heavy bunch of themes were presented.  I really enjoyed the discussions between Scout, Atticus, Jem and the others.  The characters were deep and very well developed and provided great depth to the story.  There are so many small threads running through the story that I'm sure there is a lot to digest beyond the first read (aspects such as the fire, the teaching methods in the school, the various gifts in the tree, the other inhabitants on Scout's street, etc).  This is a rich and wonderful novel that I will gladly read again.    *****  5 out of 5 stars
0525423842|5.0|My son (age 14) and I read this together.  He enjoyed the easy flow of the book.  The words were age appropriate and the interest of the book held his attention (which is not easy at this age).  I hope there are other books to follow soon to keep his interest.
B000EAT246|5.0|I hadn't thought about this movie in quite some time. Seeing it way back as a kid my friends and I thought it was cool, but looking back it just seemed like a dated premise \\"so, it's a helicopter with guns on it...so what?\\" I was really stunned at how good a movie it is and how timely it actually all is. First of all, the acting is first-rate. Roy Scheider is as cool as a cucumber, Warren Oates is is grizzled best (\\"when you're walking on eggs, don't hop!\\"), Malcom McDowell overplays his slimy villain to great effect and both Candy Clark and Daniel Stern - while their characters are slightly annoying - are truly believable. Add to this a great screenplay buy the brilliant Dan O'Bannon (who wrote \\"Alien\\"). Then add the unfortunate fact that surveillance technology has been getting more and more intrusive since this film was released and you have quite a film. It's probably a smarter film than I realized it was growing up (back then we were just impressed with the helicopter chases). Another film that could be remade, but it isn't really necessary as it's still holding up (not that that ever stops Hollywood).
B003OF3R0S|5.0|One word. \\"WOW.\\" That one words somes it up. Wow for the melodies, wow for the instrumentation and lyrics, and wow for the heavy emotional impact.  This album is one of, if not THE best piece of work A7X has put together.  It has elements from all of their previous efforts, and some new sounds. Best of all, they went back to their roots in some areas (M. Shadow's amazing screaming.)  Mike Portnoy is a fantastic drummer, and I believe his performance on the album is a great tribute.  1 - Nightmare 5/5 - A great way to start the album, wth haunting notes and a pounding riff. It's great as well, because it was supposed to be a b-side, but they included it for The Rev because he liked the lyrics.  2 - Welcome to the Family 5/5 - This song starts with a riff that is very reminiscent of \\"Scream\\" or \\"Afterlife,\\" and the chorus makes you think of \\"Beast and the Harlot.\\" A great song.  3 - Danger Line 4/5 - A very good song about being a soldier, with great solos and marching snare at the end.  4 - Buried Alive 3/5 - Probably the weakest song on the album, but still a good song.  The beginning is kind of slow paced and melodic, until the halfway point when the beat picks up and the solos wail....then...a pounding riff that immediately reminds you of Metallica's \\"Ride the Lightning.\\"  5 - Natural Born Killer 4/5 - Another song with a great chorus.  6 - So Far Away 5/5 - This is the first song on the album that is a balad. With The Rev being gone, the impact this song has is even more moving.  7 - God Hates Us 5/5 - Amazing. This song has killer riffs that remind you of Pantera's work. The best part: Shadows does amazing screaming in this song. It's a very sinister sound, and it sounds great.  I'm glad they incorporated their early work with this. Fantastic.  8 - Victim 5/5 - Another ballad that rminds you immediately of The Rev. A great chorus.  9 - Tonight the World Dies 4/5 - A very dark and haunting melody.  10 - Fiction 6/5 - This is a masterpiece. The final song The Revever wrote. There aren't any guitars, only haunting piano with drums and orchestra. This song moved me to the brink of tears, and as soon as I heard The Rev's voice, I was just stunned. It's a very erie thing here, becase this song is about dying, and he wrote it 3 days before he died. It's very surreal.  The lyrics are amazing and very heartfelt, like \\"I Hope You Find Your Own Way, When I'm Not With You,\\" and \\"Now I think I understand - How this world can overcome a man.\\" It's sad, very sad, beautiful and moving. It almost seems like he knew he was on his way out. Shadows did a great job covering the majority of the vocals, with little bits here and there from The Rev.   11 - Save Me 5/5 - The epic end to an amazing record. The songs leads off like \\"Beast and the Harlot,\\" moves into something very dark and menacing, and leaves you with the line \\"Tonight we all die young.\\" An epic and incredible song.    So overall, this album is a complete master work. It's hard to say that, since The Rev isn't playing on it, but he helped write it, and that's the main part.    Though I was very eager to hear this album, after I did, I realized I may not have been quite ready.  It's still very hard to swallow the fact that Jimmy's gone. It feels like his presnce is still very strong with the music, though. \\"Fiction\\" is a song that I will probably never be able to listen to casually, like driving to work or with a bunch of people. I don't want to sound like all of those people who say \\"Oh no, my life is over now.\\" I didn't know him personally, though we all knew him through his music, and hearing that song, basically his goodbye, is something that is emotionally heavy. Right now, I have to listen to it alone, and try to adjust to the emotion. It'll take time to get used to some of these songs.   Anyway, this album is just simply WOW. There aren't very many albums I absolutley love on the first listen, but this is definitely one of them. The messages of each song are conveyed very clear, and none of these songs need time to grow on you. They're amazing the first time through, and many more times after that.  To conclude, Avenged Sevenfold and your amazing music lives om. Thank You. R.I.P.  Fans and newcomers alike will love this album. A great work of art.

The love between the main characters was intense and imediate and I have a hard time letting teens read about the kind of love that is just not real.

B002ZG977Y|1.0|When I first heard that they were remaking Clash of the Titans, I was ecstatic.  I like the campiness of the original, but I wondered just how amazing this movie could be with our modern day effects and film making techniques.  The result is not amazing at all.  I'm not certain where to begin.  I know that sitting in the theater, I kept thinking 'maybe this will get better.'  It never did.  Who would have thought that stop motion animation could trump CGI?  Also, who would have thought that Harry Hamlin's performance would be hands down the greater Perseus?<br /><br />First of all, the story is not too bad - but the underdevelopment of the characters is deplorable.  There are even a few members of the supporting cast that could have been wonderful.  But no.  The never had the chance to develop themselves, and then they died so suddenly and pointlessly that you pretty well forgot they had been there.  Sam Worthington displayed some of the worst acting I have ever witnessed.  At no time did you believe him in the role, and at no point do you even remotely pity him.  The gods were a joke.  Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are amazing actors, but even they came across as wooden and ineffective in this film.<br /><br />Medusa was horribly rendered - she's supposed to be horrific people!  She was nothing short of a bad joke, and the Kraken looked like a sea cucumber with teeth.  The only thing remotely improved over the old version was Pegasus.<br /><br />All in all, this movie was terrible to sit though, and the more I thought about it after leaving the theater, the worse it became.

Although the protagonist is a private eye, he is no more on a quest than are Oedipa Maas, Herbert Stencil, Tyrone Slothrop, or Mason & Dixon. Some readers think of this present Pynchonian installment as hard-boiled, a characteristic that is associated with the mystery genre, but there is also another possible interpretation: Rather than hard-boiled, the style is meant to describe a mean and desolate civilization, one completely void of compassion, of human warmth, or, for that matter, human contact. Characters who are not drugged, are caught up in pointless pop culture. If there is indeed a mystery to be solved, few are coherent enough to care. If some care, few are articulate enough to express this, even to themselves. As we make our way through Pynchon's fictions, from the renaissance of Mason & Dixon through the turn of the twentieth century of V. and Against the Day, and to the World War II of Gravity's Rainbow and the 60s of Lot 49, perhaps we can sense the beginnings of the coldness that comes to dominate Inherent Vice. In any case, if this book is a comedy, it is not playful. It may be Pynchon's most realistic story to-date.

B001N26GFC|5.0|You might initially think that the main character is slightly annoying and too carefree.  However, the film (as well as the main character herself) actually has an underlying serious note.  The story is a great reminder to consider that there may be much more to people than first impressions.
B001AQT0RC|5.0|Contact has long been in my list of top 10 movies. A big fan of Carl Sagan in my youth (his series Cosmos inspired many budding Astronomers I'm sure) seeing his novel contact realised as a motion picture was a joyful occasion for me and while there are a few differences from the book I was extremely pleased with the result.    The choice of Jodie Foster as Elly worked well as she brought her considerable acting talent to crafting a character driven by a thirst for knowledge and the need to know that we are not alone. Other powerful performances from Tom Skerrit and Matthew McConaughey round out the main characters in this movie nicely.     Stunning visuals, great soundtrack, and great philosophical questions to answer.    This will always be one of my favourite movies and I am glad that I can now enjoy it in magnificent full HD.

B003EV6DBW|4.0|Long time viewer here. Like a lot of Americans, I started watching Who when Tom Baker's episodes started airing here in the late 70s. But, I've since gone back and seen just about every episode made since the program's debut in 1963. This 2010 season saw the introduction of a new Doctor, new traveling companions and a new show runner/lead writer - all of which contribute to a slightly different feel from the episodes in the 2005-2009 era.    First off, of course, is Matt Smith's portrayal of the title character. Like a lot of the other reviewers, I wasn't sure at first about this relatively young actor's ability to portray the venerable time traveler. But, he actually delivers a very winning performance - humorously eccentric to a degree that we perhaps haven't seen in the role since Tom Baker, Smith also portrays a Doctor who is perhaps less self confident (and ultimately more human) than his immediate predecessors. I never looked forward to a long stay in the role by David Tennant, but I hope Matt Smith stays for many seasons to come.    New companion Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) has perhaps the most interesting character arc of any companion in the show's long history, but isn't as purely entertaining as her immediate predecessor Donna Noble (comedienne Catherine Tate).    Most importantly, though, is the contribution of new show runner Steven Moffat. Fans had high expectations for Moffat, given that he had already written some of the show's most outstanding (and scary) stories. One had only to think of stories like 2005's \\"The Empty Child\\" or 2007's \\"Blink\\" to wonder what this very talented writer would do when he was put in charge of the whole program. Alas, it's somewhat of a mixed bag. As a writer, Moffat seems to be a bit more plot oriented (and less character oriented) than his predecessor Russel Davies. This tends to make the pseudo science at this show's heart seem more solid and real and means that fewer stories devolve into downright nonsensical silliness. However, it also seems to have robbed the show of just a little of the emotional punch it had in the 2005-2009 era.     Ultimately, what we're left with is a show that seems more consistently good than it has been since the 2005 revival, but also fails to ever reach the heights of the handful of absolute classics from that era. Nevertheless, it's still a marginal improvement, particularly over the somewhat lackluster specials of 2009.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|I first saw Leonard Cohen on a PBS Special and was mesmerized - by his voice, the lyrics of his songs and the outstanding musicians on stage with him.  I couldn't believe that I had never heard of him before.  I quickly realized I had to have the CD so I could listen to the songs again and again to really hear the powerful and spiritual lyrics.  I shared the CD with a dear friend and she decided she had to keep it.  So, this is my second CD of the London performance.

For the picky it has a DTS non HD however the DTS a good mix.   As with any good transfer the real color tones jump out at you from the opening scene.Detail is sharp through the whole movie.
0385504225|1.0|***SOME SPOILERS***    This third installment of the Angels and Demons/Da Vinci Code series was a total flop! It took me 6 months to get through it. The story line didn't pick up until it was almost over, I was almost relieved when they killed Robert Langdon and then ruined it again when they brought him back to life.     Throughout the entire book Robert Langdon annoyed me, he was consistently boring throughout the book. He was still intelligent, but that was about it. He didn't do anything special, he didn't seem very involved in the story in the first place, and was very naive, closed-minded and didn't have any street smarts for a lot of the book, overall...I wanted him to die. Of course, once he did die, I was a little relieved that he was finally gone, but then the way that he was brought back to life was even almost like the author thought better of killing him off. Overall, he had no character growth whatsoever and if anything lost some of his character from the original two books.    The main character was not the only issue with the book...I felt like Dan Brown was having difficulty filling pages, so he decided to add as much random historical detail and scientific information as possible. Now, granted, in the first two books I really enjoyed that aspect, but in this one it was choppy and poorly done ---basically like the author was reading fan reviews, found out that we like to read about the historical and scientific details, and decided to add as much meaningless BS to the story as possible. The paragraphs came off as rambling, it was absurd.      When I was about half way through the book, I kept thinking that it would pick up. In reality, the action was already moving and I just could not get involved with the story line. The chapters were not enjoyable to process, they seemed to be all over the place which made it increasingly difficult to become involved in the story. Then at the end of the book, it happened all over again. The book was over, but then there were 2 more chapters to finish. It was driving me crazy that this book would not end.    Let's just say that this book was a 100% disappointment and I will not be reading anything from Dan Brown again.

B003EYVXXW|5.0|\\"Agora\\", starring the luminous Rachel Weisz as Hypatia, a brilliant mathematician and academic, set in the amazingly rendered Alexandria of Egypt in 415 C.E., shows us the events leading up to her murder by what we would call a blue-collar Christian fundamentalist mob egged on by a Christian fundamentalist Regent of the church in competition with a more secular Christian Roman governor.<br /><br />You can imagine a red state televangelist running for President against a Democratic senator from a blue state. Imagine the red states televangelist whipping up a frenzy of anger against a female college professor who had written a popular book about evolution who also happen to be a good friend of the Democratic senator. Now imagine that woman is assassinated by a crazy from a group of fundamentalists who were protesting that Senator.<br /><br />This movie is part dramatic juggernaut and part clockwork examination of the battle between irrationality and all its power to compel with the luminance of reason and a transcendent love of knowledge for its own sake.<br /><br />One thing might be a stumbling block. Hypatia in real life never discovered the heliocentric universe. However, the discovery of the sun centered solar system was a powerful choice as a literary device. You see, traditionally we have been taught a Earth centered view of the cosmos. By making the central metaphor a struggle to raise our view from a man-centered earth centered model of the universe to a impersonal Sun centered view of the universe we are seeing a metaphor for the struggle to displace irrationality with reason.<br /><br />The great tragedy represented beautifully and heartfeltly in this movie is that the struggle for power is an appeal to the rationality and all of the good things that reason can give us can be burned up and turned to smoke.

B000W07EKW|4.0|The Jason Bourne Collection contains all three Bourne films in a very interesting case.  I will not comment on the quality of the films, because most people have seen them and you know if you like this type of action movie or not.  I do enjoy these films, and so I wanted a collector's set.  The extras in this set are:<br />- The box is designed to look like a safe deposit box, and is very nice.<br />- A passport booklet (the size of a standard dvd box), with a simple and not too impressive design.<br />- Inside the passport booklet is a bonus disc with a few interview-style documentaries about the legacy of the Bourne series, including archive footage of Robert Ludlum, author of the novels on which the films are based.  The disc has less than an hour of total content, and the material wasn't particularly interesting.<br /><br />If the above-mentioned exclusives don't interest you, it would be cheaper to buy each of the films separately.  Here are the exact DVD versions that are included in the Jason Bourne Collection:<br />[[ASIN:B00023B1LC The Bourne Identity (Widescreen Extended Edition)]]<br />[[ASIN:B0002ZDVEU The Bourne Supremacy (Widescreen Edition)]]<br />[[ASIN:B000VWYJ86 The Bourne Ultimatum (Widescreen Edition)]]<br /><br />These discs are quality DVD versions with a good amount of bonus material on the making of the film, and it is often cheaper to buy them separately than it is to buy them together in this set.

I learned a lot from this book as well as being entertain by a thrilling story.<br /><br />I have never NOT read another of Dan Brown's works, so there was no need for comparison. This book was such a winner that I do plan to read more books by this author.<br /><br />The last 50+ pages were interesting with their historical information, but the main story was over and the last pages were unnecessary. Basically, the extra historical information seemed forced down the reader's throat. The survivors should have gone to the emergency room.

No way-the book should have ended after the main story came to an end.

1400052173|5.0|I was engrossed by this book.    My admiration and gratitude goes out to Professor Rebecca Skloot and to the Lacks family!  Congratulations!    Having worked in the field of tissue culture, human genetics, cancer research and dealing with the problems of cell line contamination, especially by HeLa Cells, I found this book helpful in telling the personal and family story of the Lacks family that we, I, often wondered about.    Very Moving.  In fact the story would make a great Movie!      The book also gave a lot of history about the early days of tissue culture and emphasized the importance of the break-through in tissue culture media development and the use of HeLa cells in the battle against polio.  I found this interesting.     Personally, I was frustrated in getting my Ph.D. partly because of the HeLa cell contamination described in the book.  My Ph.D professor would not let me bring into the lab another very aggressively growing cell line for my research because he thought it might contaminate other cell lines in the lab, like HeLa had.    A delay of a year and a half took a significant bite out of my 3 year scholarship.      Anyway, several years later, I had the chance for \\"revenge\\" and \\"exoneration\\" when I was able to confirm all the 14 or more HeLa cell suspect cell lines were indeed all the same genetically, using multiple polymorphic enzyme markers I learned to type in my Ph.D. professor's lab.      I also exonerated many other cancer cell lines as being bona fide and above suspicion of being contaminant cell lines because of their differences in the polymorphic enzymes they had - they had a genetic finger-print.    They could be used with confidence in cancer and biological research.     My work also found another contamination group of cell lines, all originating from one laboratory, that was subsequently published - alerting the research community.

B003C1SPX8|5.0|C'mon guys!  As some other reviewers have commented - this video is from a concert in 1983.  It might as well have been ancient Rome as far as video goes.  I have watched the VHS version of this for many years and I really like the concert.  Do I wish the video was better?  Of course I do.  Having lived through that time, it is what I expect so I'm not disappointed.  In fact, the quality is better than my VHS tape.  Also, my VHS has a 60 Hz buzz in the audio but the DVD version is clean.

B003OJBWGK|4.0|Pumping out 'Crazy for You' in the height of summer couldn't've been a better choice. Best Coast is dreamy, simple, fun, blunt, and great for blasting on even the cheapest of stereos. Best Coast channels Sleater-Kinney at their funnest, the simplicity of KRecords girl groups, the sloppiness of Hole, and the guitar noise only Kevin Shields could love. Noise aside, her voice is beautiful, too beautiful to be muddied over by fuzz, which happens quite frequently throughout the course of the album; moments in which the vocals peak, she has strong hints at Neko Case's siren call. I look forward to hearing that more prevalent on her following releases.

1401227821|5.0|What a damn fine collection!  If all artists could compile such a thick collection of high quality work the world would be a beautiful place.  But they can't, and the world sucks.  So buy this book and keep dreaming!  If you think you've got what it takes to depict gorgeous women in two dimensions, I suggest you compare notes with Mr. Hughes.  You're bound to be schooled on a thing or two (insert boob joke here).  I'd strongly recommend this collection to aspiring artists, there are many great tips and examples of process work.  Adam's cranky and often self-loathing commentary is great and even inspirational at times.  You know you want it, so buy the damn thing and be well.

B001EO2UJK|5.0|Wow!  The sound quality on these are SO much better it's beyond amazing. And it confirms for me,  that the Beatles catalog *should* have been done the same - just as it was done for \\"Yellow Submarine  Songtrack\\" (NOT 'Soundtrack'!), instead of just the remastering of the original mixes.     I didn't read many of the reviews for this box set (I can't believe all the one-star reviews!) on Amazon,  but on the first page, there's a review from an audio engineer that sums it up pretty well, that the  original  mixes were very poor to begin with. (Which makes me realize now, why the remastered CDs from the  early '90s were so bad. It brought out what was wrong to begin with, in a much more revealing format!)     \\"Foxtrot\\" was from the beginning (in 1972) and *still is* their hands-down best album. 'Super's Ready' has  to be the greatest musical creation of the entire decade!  It is so good, I went to Amazon to see if it's  available as a single-disk. It is not. But believe it or not, when I did the math of all my favorite tracks  from their first 3 albums (minus their actual first album on Decca, which I have on CD - it's not very good  by-the-way) from the box set, it honestly is 79+ minutes in length!! (And that's ALL of 'Foxtrot', except  for the first track, which ironically was the sole Single taken from that album. And 'Foxtrot' is a *long*  album too.     It's hard to explain (actually, there's a few Genesis fans that say this same thing on Amazon), but the  first three albums in the box set (1970, 1971 & 1972) *all go together musically* (style/instruments/etc.).  And when you listen to 'Selling England By The Pound\\" (which I've always loved), it becomes very clear!    And one last thing - the second disk is what's called DVD-Audio (in Surround Sound). Almost NOBODY  knows about this format, let alone OWNS the player! So except for some minor *regular* DVD video on  that same second disk, I don''t think many people will be listening to the audio portion of those disks!  (Especially considering HOW many people are happy with MP3s! That is SO absurd, it almost hurts.)
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I purchased these headphones for my home recording studio after reviewing countless offerings. I made this choice based on other users' reviews and the purported use of these headphones in professional recording studios. They are very comfortable, sound beautiful, have gold-plated connections, a screw-on 1/4\\" adapter and a robust cable. I have been very pleased with my purchase and plan to purchase a second set for when fellow musicians come over to lay down tracks. They have been comfortable to wear for long periods and fit around my ears perfectly. If you have larger ears this may not be the case. I cannot yet review their durability but all my old headphones had disintegrated in the Arizona heat.
006145205X|4.0|I approached this book with a healthy dose of skepticism, but have to admit that the author presents quite the compelling theory.  A theory that states why we shouldn't buy in to the doomsday predictions that are so rampant right now, but rather that we should be optimistic about the future.  He illustrates the human ability to learn and adapt from being presented with adversity.  Ridley doesn't convince the reader that bad times aren't on the way, but rather makes a compelling argument for our surviving the challenges ahead and perhaps even prospering from them. This book is certainly not filled with \\"pie in the sky\\" optimism, but it does show how we can actually prosper from the less than peachy times ahead.  Ridley supports his theories by looking back at the history of the human race and pointing to countless times we have overcome and prospered. Overall, an interesting, thought provoking, \\"Rationally Optimisic\\" read.

B003JYOFIW|5.0|I've been a Devo-tee since the boys from Ohio first began irritating the masses. I've seen them twice in concert; once for the \\"Freedom of Choice\\" tour in Orlando (to this day, the best live performance I've ever seen), and again for \\"New Traditionalists\\" in Gainesville, FL. To this day, I can't hear \\"Race of Doom\\" without seeing the group on their treadmills; truly inspired.<br /><br />If I had to imagine what sort of album the Spud Boys (surely \\"Spud Men\\" at this point) might have come up with after this many years, THIS ALBUM IS IT, AND THEN SOME. It's much better than I had hoped, and I was hoping for a lot.<br /><br />\\"Human Rocket\\" is a standout. I expected it to be about Devo's typical sexual innuendo (\\"Rocket in my Pocket/Plug without a Socket\\" from the song \\"Don't You Know\\" immediately springs to mind)... but the lyrics seemed more ominous than humorous; and for good reason after listening to it closely! It's the only song I've ever heard sung by and about a suicide bomber; and it works. It also doesn't hurt that it's a ripping song.<br /><br />I thought \\"Something for Everybody\\" was a rather grandiose title, but it truly lives up to the name. I've yet to play it for anyone who didn't like MOST of it, let alone merely \\"something\\"... and that's regardless of whether or not they were Devo fans. It has truly made me thirsty for more! Duty Now for the Present; Later is Now! Witness for yourself the truth about De-Evolution... now it HAS been told.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|It takes a while to get through the oddly written beginning, but once the story appears, it is a beautiful and intriguing read. I love when a book grabs me and makes me cry. The characters are well developed and entirely human. Read it...it will haunt you.
1416594787|5.0|Coming from a country where the theory of evolution is hardly put in question and is taught in school without any kind of opposition, I was quite surprised by the importance given to the rebuttal of creationist views.  I wish the author had also tackled Lamarquist views that are still hanging around--in the Old Continent at least. Despite of this, I strongly recommend this work, as it is clear, pedagogical, and illustrated with appealing examples. Educated readers might find the argumentation a bit slow, as the book is meant for the general public, but the prose is sufficiently well written for the pleasure to remain intact.
1416594787|5.0|This is the first book I have read by Richard Dawkins, and I found it to be very interesting. I certainly plan on reading more of his books in the future. In this book Dawkins attempts to present the reader with evidence that supports evolution. I think he did an admirable job at this. There are many things to recommend this book.     In chapter four, Dawkins discusses the various dating methods such as Carbon-14, Potassium-40, and Dendrochronology. He continues with a discussion of how the sedimentary record and isotopes support the reputed age of the earth.    In chapter five, he delves into how evolution has actually taken place before our very eyes. Here he discusses such topics as the Lizards of Pod Mrcaru, elephants in Uganda, an interesting E-coli experiment and a guppy experiment.     In a subsequent chapter, Dawkins explains the development of life from embryo to adult elaborating on such things such as Epigenesis, chemo-affinity, enzyme and protein formation, asymmetric cell division, and local rules.     I found the chapter on how DNA and the molecular clock can be used to ascertain the closeness of species to be quite interesting.    Overall, I believe that one can learn much about the evolutionary processes that are described in this book. Of course, if you want a better view of the whole picture, you need to read many books on the subject. No one book will give you everything you need to know on the subject.
1423113381|1.0|Riodan totally missed the mark with this one. My grandson and I devoured the Percy Jackson series -- and really wanted to love this new book, but \\"The Red Pyramid\\" was a boring and confusing mess. The main characters, especially the girl Sadie, were obnoxious and one-dimensional. Halfway through the book, I asked my highly literate 10 yr old grandson what he thought of the book so far; he hesitated -- finally saying, \\"um... I hate to say it, Pops, but it's terrible.\\" Once that was out in the open, we discussed every aspect of the story we'd read so far, which it turns out: we both secretly and silently hated. We agreed to stop reading and move on to a better read-aloud for our summer afternoons.     Sorry, Rick, but this was a huge disaster -- and actually left a bad taste in my grandson's cultural memory bank. You owe us $10 and a dozen or so precious, wasted hours.
B0036EBARO|3.0|*** 1/2<br /><br />Goldfrapp is nothing if not unpredictable. From their trippy, lo-fi debut \\"Felt Mountain,\\" to the electro-glam of \\"Supernature,\\" they've never really been a group that jumped on every latest sonic trend. They seem to be following their own muse, and I respect that.<br /><br />What's most surprising about \\"Head First\\" is the album's upbeat vibe. In fact, the album is so upbeat that it sometimes comes across as damn perky. Gone are the sonic and lyrical rough edges, the darkness, the creepiness, the brash sexuality ... they've been replaced by warmth, optimism, and sunny happy endings.<br /><br />Fortunately, Goldfrapp still inject a little bit of trippiness into tracks like \\"Dreaming\\" (probably my favorite), and the amelodic finale, \\"Voice Thing\\". But for the most part, this is a \\"happy in love\\" album, perfect for listeners who need a break from cynicism, or couples enjoying their honeymoons.
006190385X|4.0|I am a relatively new U2 fan.  I've known about them for 30 odd years now, but did not pay much attention to them until two years ago.  And all I've known about them is Bono and his ever presence in this world of ours.    So I thought it was time to find out more about this rock band and who it's members really are.  Was really surprised to learn that none of them are the least bit tall.  Was really surprised to learn that they have had very little confidence in themselves as a band for most of their lives together.  Was really surprised to learn that they are, with the exception of Adam, devout Christians.  And that The Edge loves to go out dancing with his wife.  And that Bono has a brother!!      All in all it made them more human to me.  I would have thought that being one of the biggest rock bands of all time, they would have indulged in the \\"Rock Star\\" life style more than a little.  With the exception of Adam (again), they are all family men and their families mean a great deal to them.  So - wow - very, very rich, very, very talented men who seem to be rooted firmly in the real world.  I was surprised and delighted to learn this about U2.  Makes me love them even more.    So - read this book if you love the lads from Ireland.  Rock out with them in the stadium concerts and respect them for the musicians and men that they are.  Each one of them would be worth knowing.

B000056NX5|5.0|An excellent updated version of the musical. I have been a major fan of the Ted Neeley version since it came out. still love it. This version allows Jesus more emotion, which I find makes him more human, more relatable. The single set staging is dramatic, put the musical back into a story, theatrical experience. Ted Neeley version done on location was effective in its time. This setting let it be grittier. I wasn't thrilled with the visuals of the whipping scene, but the musical part was excellent. I highly recommend this version as well as the original movie version.
B000QJLQY4|1.0|wtf?  Why is the Kindle electronic edition (with no physical delivery) more expensive than ANY OTHER form of this book?  More expensive than the audio, paperback and even hardcover?  Are they trying to get rid of the old paper stuff?  I would have bought this one but now won't as I would feel like even more than the sucker I usually am, buying things on impulse with the little BUY NOW button.
0470477237|3.0|Erik Qualman is Global Vice President of Online Marketing for EF Education with extensive experience in e-marketing, e-business, search engines, and maximising the impact of the social media. Social media includes social networking sites such as Facebook and Myspace, twittering, blogs and the internet. Qualman wakens the world to a new reality. As he writes, \\"the world as it was, no longer is\\"(p.14). This cryptic remark is the key construct of his book as he tries to show how social media has changed the way people connects, communicates, interacts, and changes their perception of reality.    Qualman confirms what most of us are aware-that social media is changing the very fabric of our society. His chapter on how Obama became president is illuminative. The data mining of people's use of search engine may predict future social trends is interesting. The little known fact that Pepsi, by using Yahoo's search engine data, was able to predict Britney Spears' popularity a few months in advance and are able to sign her up for their commercial is telling. Unfortunately this did not able to save her from the dangers of becoming a celebrity.    Social media especially micro-blogging such as twitter and texting, argues Qualman, actually makes people better because whatever they have sent into the internet will remains as a permanent record. While the records are permanent, it is debatable whether most people actually care about that-except maybe politicians and CEOs. People will continue to spin a more than perfect image of themselves online.    It is hard to prove that the economic influence of the social media is as powerful as Qualman suggests. People who are active in social media, called soialmedioraties, still remains a small segment of the demography which may not be identical to the demography that has the purchasing power. Nevertheless, it is worthwhile studying the trend especially since Facebook membership has reached half a million people. Still only a small fraction of this many people are active. Most will have an account with which they access for an occasional update.    In a people-driven economy, social media has potential for an increasing role. However as most of the people of less developed countries do not have internet access to this social media, one does wonders how this will translate to the rest of the world.

B003OJBWGA|5.0|Best Coast's debut record is a lovely little scuzzy pop gem. The band has been building a substantial buzz over the last year or so with a string of underground hit singles and splits, and now they've finally unleashed their first great work to the hungry masses. Best Coast, as the name implies, is a beach-inspired pop outfit, blending fuzzy melodies and simple, lovelorn lyrics to great effect. Crazy For You recalls the kind of heartsick feelings of teenage years, a simpler and more powerful time that we all long for again at some point.<br /><br />The album is short, but it's somewhat a boon, because this is music that could easily outstay its welcome. A 50+ minute album of fuzzy pop songs is inevitably going to lose its punch after awhile, so it was wise of the band to keep the album short and sweet. One of the more disappointing elements of the album is the reuse of a number of those aforementioned singles, which isn't uncommon, but given the time the band has been working on this record, I was hoping for a brand new set of songs. Nonetheless, the singles have been reworked and sharpened to a finer edge, and the album is truly a testament to razor-sharp love songs. The lyrics may not be the deepest you'll ever hear, but they're heartfelt and powerful in context of this collection of uptempo pop songs.<br /><br />Best Coast has been regarded through this year as a band to watch, and Crazy For You does not disappoint. A great album for any fan of noise and pop and any combination thereof.
B000FVNX2Q|1.0|I own six HP12Cs and just purchased three more for MBA grad school. These new ones are of such poor quality that they are unreliable. I turned one back into HP for refund that missed key entries at least 10% of the time. I literally smashed one today because it would calculate different answers each time for the same inputs (NPV problems), missed key entries, and had to be turned on sometimes 3 and 4 times before turning on. I tried to talk to HP about their quality, but they were not interested. Even my professors at the university do not recommend HP calculators any longer. That is too bad, because the RPN is so natural to use. I must say though, my older HP12Cs from the 1980s still work but albeit slowly compared to the new ones.
B0039TD7RC|4.0|Pretty good. I liked the additional bits of bluesy stuff. I have the album, I just wanted the Deluxe CD for the few extra tunes. Took forever to get here. Almost a month! Quite slow rolling.......
B003JLA4KS|5.0|Having been a fan of Rush for nearly thirty years, this film/documentary was truly enjoyable.  The directors did an outstanding job capturing the human side of these three musical pioneers.  Well worth the wait!!
B0000AOV85|5.0|Even if you are not obsessed with this album, you may be after you realize the brilliance of what was recorded and put together. Love the studio breakdowns and the artist's insight into the foundational chords of these songs and their inspiration. This DVD is a must-see. Heck, I rented it (Netflix) and then bought it.
B003VB5D84|4.0|I saw the 2hr version in the theater and was very imppressed. It was a little long to sit through all at once -- that is why the DVD will be nice as you can watch it at your leisure. I thought Doyle bramhall (or whatever his name was), was very good. He added a different feel to the show -- a little more energy. He was perfectly placed in a mix with the older legeneds and John Mayer and the other young dude (who sounded like a 50 year old blues legend) that played with Buddy Guy (who was that guy?! The kid was excellent, but I could hardly watch him, as he was over-enthusuastic. ZZ-top was fun, Jeff Beck was awesome, and Robert Cray was spectacular. Cray is also very animated and is any wonder he can play so well as he shakes all over the place while he jams. Joe Bonamassa was great, but Derek Trucks and Susan Tdeschi stole the show.
B0009X7664|5.0|I recently read [[ASIN:0446310786 To Kill a Mockingbird]] and I wanted to see how it translated on screen. This movie does a wonderful job capturing the issues Harper Lee brings up. The importance of morality, which highlights the injustices of social inequality and racism. Now, some things had to be cut to fit a two hour movie, many of the earlier side stories that show the moral high ground of Atticus Finch. While unfortunate, the movie still captures how he stands out as the Good vs. the Evil of the racist \\"Bob\\" Ewell. However, this is a movie so, things get compressed.     However, Gregory Peck is truly amazing as Atticus Finch, bringing the character to life. I dare say, if I ever read the book again, I'll visualize most of these actors and actresses. 5 star adaptation, 5 star story, 5 star acting. What else could you ask for? The extras are also pretty nice but I'm not a huge extras buff. The only thing you could ask for? Well I know what I'd ask for: Hollywood should make more movies like this.

B002ZG977Y|4.0|With a summer movie season that has been disappointing, I think you're better off staying home and watching Clash of the Titans. Clash of the Titans is a rare remake that's actually good. The film looks great and it's also exciting. I don't know why most critics didn't like the movie because it's actually much better than I expected. A critic at Newsday even said we didn't need Clash of the Titans since Percy Jackson already taught about Greek gods, but this movie is way better than that was.<br /><br />  Sam Worthington is one of the better action stars around these days and he's good in this movie. My only complaint is that he looks like he just got a buzz cut for the role. He looks pretty awkward next to everyone else that has long hair in movie, they could have at least thrown a wig on him or something lol. I guess since the gods give Perseus (Sam Worthington) weapons for his journey, that they also shave his head when he's sleeping. Hey, they are gods so maybe they even had electric razors in the early days of mankind.
B003405MF6|3.0|while this certainly is not a bad record, it is a disappointment. while jeff beck had managed to produ e some extraordinary modern reordds recntly, here he threads more traditional ground. as some other reviewers have pointed out this is a much more laid back record than previous ones. it is also much less innovative, indeed this kind of new age jazz guitar has been around for a while and is not that interesting. do not get me wrong, it is a good solid record, flawlessly played but a massi e disappointment when it comes to innovation. for any other artis it would be considered great but for jeff beck it is kind of so-so. at times it comes a little too close to being spa background music. anyway it is still pretty good and better than that wretched live set he released a year ago or so

B00319ECC4|5.0|I have been a Fear Factory fan since I was first introduced to the band by my best friend. My first FF album was obsolete and I continued to collect along the way with no disappointment. I have read reviews on other cds these guys came out with and nearly laughed myself into a comma with all the whining and crying about how their band isn't the same as it used to be, don't people have enough problems in life? or do they really need every little thing to bother and upset them? Anyway enough thinking outside the box. I enjoyed this cd from start to finish and still do I can't seem to overplay it enough the lyrics are just as good if not better than the first FF cd I ever heard. They may hurt the ears when listened to on full blast though but, it's worth it to almost go deaf to the pounding sounds of such a good band. It's best to buy this cd on a whim without hearing any of the songs first who needs to preview music? it's entertainment if you take it too seriously you might start crying like some of the other babies out there, need I say more?
0525421580|4.0|This was a great book, but I think character development could be worked on a little more. These kids seemed to have their issues define them, but there has to be more to them than that. I also think the book was ended a little too soon. Maybe they could end it a few days after the play? Otherwise I thought it was a good read. =)

B003H4I4JU|1.0|I had recently complained to Amazon that Ender's Game had been scanned and then poorly edited prior to releasing it here for sale.  Now I get into Speaker for the Dead, and if anything, this copy is even worse than the first book.  I am finding that the same issues that plagued the first book are there, and now letters are even missing from words.  The last few chapters really show where the publisher just gave up even trying to find anything...not that they seem to have caught the issues with words containing \\"ru\\" in them.    I am getting to think that some of these digital presses are just sending straight OCR copies over to Amazon as quick as they get a file completed.    Amazon...get some quality control going before you allow a book to be put up for sale!!
1591843162|3.0|I am listening to the audiobook and half way through part one I could not listen anymore. Even though the information is great, he never illustrates how to become a linchpin in the work place, no tips. No nothing. He also repeats the same idea with no new information to offer. This should have been a blog or a 20 minute talk on TED or something, but not a full book. After a couple of chapters it's a waste of time.
B003JLA4KS|5.0|This is what every Rush has been waiting for . What took you guys so long to figure out that you have the most dedicated fans in the world ? This is probably the best documentary on a band that I have seen . Some of the early footage is beyond belief that they actually took movies of early conversations with parents on careers in the band . This is beyond my highest expectations and even non-Rush fans have found this very interesting . A must have . The extras are about as long as the main documentary and just as good .
B002ZG98ZA|2.0|SEX AND THE CITY 2<br /><br />STARRING: Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall, Cynthia Nixon, Kristin Davis, Chris Noth, Raza Jaffrey, John Corbett, Alice Eve, Willie Garson, Jason Lewis, Evan Handler, Max Ryan, David Eigenberg, Mario Cantone, Alexandra Fong, Parker Fong and Liza Minnelli<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Michael Patrick King<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Michael Patrick King<br /><br />Rated: R<br />Genre: Romantic Comedy / Drama<br />Release Date: 27 May 2010<br />Review Date: 29 June 2010<br /><br />No man on earth... well let me rephrase with no straight man on earth, is a bigger Sex and the City fan than myself. The show was amazing. I've seen every episode of all six seasons numerous times, and I've seen the first film three times now, and thought it was incredibly perfect.<br /><br />I can't believe that most guys don't like this show. It's about four beautiful women learning from, thoroughly discussing, and actually having - lots of sex! What's not to like? Yeah there is a lot of sappy relationship stuff in there too - but most guys are in or want to be in relationships with women just like these. Maybe that's the key - they don't want to relive it on a T.V. show? I've personally learned so much from the show and I think women everywhere would agree with me in saying that most guys could pick up a hint or two from it as well. Man, I hope I don't get beat up by fellow dudes after writing this review!<br /><br />So why does the sequel fail to live up to the show and its predecessor? This movie is vastly far from the others in numerous ways. To find the two most blatant examples of what's missing, you need look no further than the title: SEX and the CITY; where are they? The majority of the film takes place in the Middle East, far away from our beloved New York, and where is all the sex? We get a measly two poor attempts at sex scenes, both of which involve only one of our gals. Why???<br /><br />And where are the intimate issues between the couples? Where are Carrie's well narrated writings of problems in her friend's relationships? Charlotte is jealous of the big breasted nanny? That's the best you could come up with, seriously? Where are the scenes of the four gals discussing their relationships, particularly at high class New York restaurants and cafes? And Steve and Harry are in the movie for maybe 30 seconds total! And we finally get Samantha single again, and she can't `be herself' because she's in the Middle East? LAME!<br /><br />Sex and the City 2 is basically a weak unnecessary wedding for an opening, followed by a boring look at the married life of Big and Carrie, followed by an extremely unrelenting sequence in the Middle East that went on and on and on! What happened here? This film could not have felt any further from Sex and the City if it tried to. Were it to be an original idea all on its own, perhaps it would have been somewhat tolerable. But for true die-hard Sex and the City fans like me, it's a disappointment to say the absolute least.<br /><br />The film opens with re-introducing Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda (Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis and Cynthia Nixon), which was done well. We see some humorous clips of how they all met in New York back in the `80s.<br /><br />I perked up in my seat as I thought the film was going to take the most obvious approach one would do with such an idea; have the first 10 minutes take place back in the `80s, while creating the conflict for the rest of the movie, taking place in the present. Why didn't they do this? Instead, they were only showing us the girls in `80s style fashion for a quick little moment of enjoyment, before they plant us in the middle of a ridiculous wedding sequence that went on for way too long. And why are these two characters getting married in the first place? When did they stop hating each other and fall in love?<br /><br />In addition to the wedding, there were several moments in the film that went on and on and were poorly edited. This one is written and directed by the same guy who brought us the first flick (Michael Patrick King) as well as several of the television episodes; so why did he veer so far from his usual path with this movie?<br /><br />One scene in the film I did like took place between Charlotte and Miranda. No other characters are in it with them, and they spill their guts to one another about the day to day struggles of marriage and being mothers. It was funny and heartfelt at the same time and was very well acted by both stars - but it didn't feel like Sex and the City. As nice as this was, we would rather have had or at least also had our traditional scene between Carrie and Miranda, where they share a personal moment. It's not found here.<br /><br />I've listened to interviews from all four women and Michael Patrick King and I get what they were attempting to do with this film. They wanted to just have fun and be a little ridiculous. They wanted to show the girls off on an adventure away from the city, and not have to worry about being too serious. While they did pack quite a few genuine laughs in here, the film is often too quirky and cheesy. Nearly the entire trip to the Middle East irritated me. I kept waiting for them to return to the Big Apple and close the film with some of the delicious originality that made me fall in love with the franchise... but it never happened.<br /><br />Michael Patrick King is on the fence as to whether or not he is going to do a third installment. He basically says that he's up for it if the fans are. As disappointed as I was with Sex and the City 2, I'm not giving up on him or these characters. If they stick to their original roots that we all enjoyed in the first picture and the show, then they can close this series on a good note.<br /><br />Michael Patrick King - sir, if you are reading this, it's very simple what we want to see in the third movie; two words, that can be found in this movie's title. Their initials are S and C.rst flick (Michael Patrick King) as well as several of the television episodes; so why did he veer so far from his usual path with this movie?

B00275EHJG|5.0|All I can say is that \\"We Loved It\\"!  This had to be the best of all 3.
B0038VPB5W|3.0|I became a fan of Bullet for My Valentine after playing Need for Speed Most Wanted and Hand of Blood was one of the tracks that was played during the races.  After this point i have purchased all of their cd's with the Hand of Blood EP being my favorite.  When Scream Aim Fire came out a few years back i was a little worried with how the sound had gone to the hardcore/screamo/metal mix to the sound of an 80's metal band.  At first i couldn't bring myself to even finish the album because of the huge difference in sounds.  Eventually i got over my disgust and listened to the album.  Although i didn't fall in love with the album i found it enjoyable to listen to (especially while playing video games).  I hadn't purchased this album until recently when it was dropped to 3.99 and found out this album is almost exactly like Scream Aim Fire.  This album pretty much follows the exact same formula as Scream Aim Fire with a few changes here and there.  Nothing mind blowing or original, so if you loved Scream Aim Fire chances are you will love this album as well.  As for me, i would give it a a 6.5 out of 10.
B003J27WFW|5.0|If you are a fan of Rush, this is the movie you wanted to see.
B003VDZK8K|4.0|I have listened to this album around 5 or 6 times now and still haven't come to a complete consensus on how i feel about it.  The album in a whole is a great album and i feel that if it was repackaged as a different band then my review would be on a complete different level.  I just feel that compared to their passed albums there is just something missing in the equation that made A7X who they really are.  If you look at their past work then you will see an equation that has been fairly consistent with a few changes here and there (most in the right direction) or some experimentation which is expected with all bands that expect to mature and obtain new fans.    When i first listened to the title track Nightmare i was really excited because i thought they were taking a huge step in the right direction combining City of Evil with their Self titled Album, but after the first couple tracks on Nightmare it is apparent that this is a whole new monster.  I feel without their drummer the lyrics to this album feel almost pushed and worn out without the strength in music and signing that usually comes with an A7X album.  I am hoping that this album grows on me the more i listen to it because i really want to be able to enjoy this album since they are one of my favorite bands since Waking the Fallen was released.  Overall i give this cd a 7.5 out of 10.  There are some defining tracks and some that you just get lost in and forget what you are listening to.  Nightmare and Naturally Born Killers are the strongest points and i feel that fiction, even though heart felt just gets lost in the clutter of the music and weak vocals. Hopefully when this tragedy has passed and they can put together an album that rivals Waking the Fallen or City of Evil.  Until then this will have to do
0670021652|5.0|And guess what? That doesn't make it a poor book only a different one. Can everyone who read Eat, Pray, Love and are considering reading this one please understand this one point? Look, if you're anything like me and love books you'll invariably find authors every once in awhile that resonate or appeal to you. Very often when this happens I'm apt to look a little more into their background to find out where they're coming from. This is always an interesting exercise and in the case of Miss Gilbert her background as a magazine writer, mostly for men's magazines informs her style. Thus Last American Man was written very much as a reportage of what she saw. Eat, Pray, Love recounted her adventures in finding herself after a difficult relationship and divorce. For those expecting another such book I think it's a little unreasonable to expect Miss Gilbert to be revisiting something she's presumably resolved.    Committed is the natural extension of this journey as she finds a man, falls in love and begins quite naturally to question all that we as a culture heap on the concept of marriage and being committed.  Having reached middle age and lived her life up to this point largely as a single woman she brings to the examination a more mature and balanced viewpoint than is currently popular in so many reality shows which continue to belabor the old canard of a \\"fairy tale romance\\". Not that these don't exist but romance and marriage just like infatuation and love are all very different things and Miss Gilbert deftly addresses these along with many of the cultural trappings that surround the institution of marriage. Hers is a fairly thorough but never tedious overview of how different cultures define male and female roles, expectations and dynamics not only today but through history. The issue of children, to have or not have them is one that many couples should read before embarking on yet another commitment all on its own!    All in all a very interesting read, an active reflection by a woman who is facing a choice many of us make or have made at early stages of our lives but who now looks at them through more mature and dare I say more sober eyes. Are some of her views unorthodox? In some cases 'yes' but that's precisely what makes them refreshing. My wife and I read it together finding it raised many interesting topics for discussion. I would recommend Committed to anyone who's in a relationship, married or not. A book worth reading is one that hopefully raises challenging issues - Committed is one of those books.
B00127RAJY|3.0|I have been doing this for about 40 days or so.  Sometimes I have had to take a break (I have a 1 year old and 3 year old and when naps don't happen, I don't get a workout in).  Anyway... I haven't lost any weight and have managed to gain 2 lbs... I do have much better ab muscles, though... :)  I have about 5-10 lbs to lose, much like many women in their 30's....     I get REALLY dizzy from this workout, too.  You go from lying down to standing up and back to lying down.  I have pretty low blood pressure, so I think that has something to do with it.  I also have a lot of knee pain from being an overpronator (my knees turn in due to flat feet).  I follow the lower impact stuff for that.      My biggest complaint is that Jillian annoys the heck out of me... the way she looks in the camera with that weird expression and the way she keeps talking about the one girls abs...  I just turn her down and turn my own music on now.  I switch from level 1 to 2 to 3 depending on my mood.  level 3 is really tough, but doable; at least I think it is...    I got this DVD for about $8 on sale, I don't have to leave my house, and I get a quick workout in during naptime.  Not the best DVD out there, but not the worst.  Just don't expect miracles...
0345441184|4.0|I have taken a lot of bus/train trips in my life to and from school and work. I don't read on these trips (I get sick) but many people do, and I always like to peek over and see what people are reading. The book I have most often seen being read is Marion Zimmer Bradley's 'The Mists of Avalon'. I think only the Harry Potter series comes close. I swear there was a time in the late 80's- early 90's that at least once a week I would see someone reading this on the train. I love stories about King Arthur so it always looked interesting, now after many years, I have finally read it.      As most will know, it is a retelling of the tale of King Arthur told from the point of view of the female characters: chiefly Morgaine (aka Morgan le Fay). The main theme of the tale is the conflict between Druidic paganism and Chistianity, as well as the love quadrangle between Morgaine, Lancelet (Lancelot), Gwenhwyfar (Guinevere) and Arthur. Overall I thought it was pretty good, although the pace is quite leisurely and the book is fairly long. One problem I found with the female centric approach, is that many famous occurrences of the Arthurian legend happen 'off-screen' as it were. For the most part this didn't affect the story much, except for the final confrontation between Arthur and Mordred, which I think should have been described more directly, considering it is the climax of the book.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|This is a nest of Russian dolls, the stories stepping through time then cut off for the next story to begin, then backwards through time to complete the stories begun. A clever arrangement, a constellation of words, a map to our possible future. North Korea seems to win out at some point since a Jong-Il type is running the entire planet. But never mind, even he with his golden arches logo will be swept aside in the tide of time as humanity descends into brutality. Gorgeously written.

B002VPE1B6|4.0|Avatar is an absolutely visually stunning film (no matter what you may think of the plot) and it comes across beautifully in this Blu-Ray edition.  If you only want to watch the movie and don't care about extras, buy this edition.  If you only own a standard-def DVD player but think you will upgrade to blu-ray in the next year, buy this edition.    But to someone who loves the special features and commentary on the making of the film, I would not recommend this edition.  I was very surprised when I plugged in the DVD to find that there was a play button, and a chapters button... that was it.    Personally, I'm buying the special edition when it comes out, and trading this version in.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|It's going to be better than DVD, right?  Of course it will, you have to upscale a DVD to get it to 720p or 1080i.  Lets not kid ourselves, the quality will be much clearer and sound quality should be improved.    I'll take it over a VHS/DVD any day.  As a Alien fan, who has probably watched Aliens at least a few hundred times, if not more, this is a great addition that I will watch over and over again.    I will get my money out of this box-set, there's no doubt about that!    And for those of you who are worried this will just be another transfer like Predator, read the comment below, from The Digital Bits...    \\"And for those of you who may have worried that any of the films will suffer the same DNR-ed fate as the recent Predator  Blu-ray, I've heard from multiple sources directly involved now that such fears are unnecessary. All four films have been given brand new HD transfers and the masters reportedly look fantastic. In fact, we've been told that when James Cameron viewed and approved the new Aliens master (Aliens  being the most troublesome looking film of the series in the past quality-wise), he was VERY pleased with the results. We'll have more on this set in the days and weeks ahead. \\"

0894803123|2.0|After reading all the reviews of this Ben and Jerry's ice cream recipe book, I ordered it.  I do not think it contains what I was looking forward to with the recipes contained therein., and would not order it again knowing its contents.  I found that surfing the internet gave me the recipes I wanted - for example pistachio ice cream, peanut butter cup ice cream, etc.
B0030UYXG4|5.0|This album is great.  The two extra songs are worth paying extra for. Alicia Keys fans will love it.
0307454541|1.0|I don't get it.  I found this book to be a real snooze.  A good editor could have easily cut 300 pages out of this turkey.  (If you're going to read it, start after p. 300--you'll save time and won't miss a thing unless you enjoy a lot of scenes of people drinking coffee.  Seriously.)  I've read that the series gets better with the next two books, but this hero was so boring, I'm not inclined to spend any more time with him.  And as for the girl of the title, she's hardly in it.  Hard to understand why Larsson would have created such a promising character and not used her to better effect.  I know, I know, these books are selling like hot cakes, but I have a feeling these fans are not devotees of the mystery/thriller genre.  I think the hoopla has made it the acceptable mystery for people who don't usually read mysteries.
0385470819|2.0|The book was okay although a back top corner was broken. The jacket was in a very tattered condition. I have received a refund back from Amazon.com so I will try to obtain another copy at a later date. The service from Amazon.com was exceptional.
B003L45JLW|3.0|Finally got a chance to listen to Petty's latest, MOJO, which has been released on Bluray in a 5.1 surround mix. There was an informative cover story in last month's Sound and Vision magazine about therecording process and I have to say Petty succeeded in what he was trying to accomplish with this mix. I wasn't a big fan of the DTS mixes made in the late 90s (with the exception of Lyle Lovett's Joshua Judges Ruth) because they were too gimmicky (cymbal crashes in the rear - really?). Petty's vocals weave in and out of the various speakers on \\"First Flash of Freedom\\" and \\"The Trip to Pirate's Cove\\" and it's a neat effect. Benmont Tench's keyboards are the real benefactors of this mix. Overall, the songs have more definition and depth. It's just too bad the songs themselves aren't better; this is pleasant Petty but it's not classic. Hat's off for the try and I hope more musicians take advantage of the higher resolution BluRay offers. If the labels would release high rez releases for audiophiles like us with extras (for example, on screen lyrics and guitar tabs would be nice or a commentary track) for $25 and a barebones edition for the general public under $10, they might have been able to stave off downloads.

0553382152|5.0|I loved this book. I couldn't put it down until I had read the whole book completely through. It will be one of those treasured books in my library. One of those books you would never consider parting with. If you want to read a great book with a great story I suggest you read it. I guarantee you will love it as much as I did.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|This was a fantastic book.  As a teacher, I loved reading about ancient Egypt.  I have read all of the Percy Jackson books (several times) and love Riordan's writing style.  I only hope that, if these books are made into movies, they will stay true to the book (not like the masacre of the Lightning Thief).
0452295548|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I could read it over and over again and again. She was so fortunate to get help in time. Another moment later and she might not be here today to tell her story. This book will have you laughing, crying, and on the edge of your seat. She had been through so much and yet her mother never left her side. She constantly challenged her mind so that she would one day be able to function again in this world. If you think the book is great, you should look her up on youtube and hear her miraculous story. It will have you laughing, crying and then crying again. The tears I cried were a resounding cry of joy. She is a very brave and strong woman to survive what she had been through. I guarantee if you buy this book you won't be disappointed.

1400052173|3.0|A sad and morally complicated story about the commercialization of the HeLa cells and the affect it has had on the \\"donors'\\" family.  These cells harvested, under questionable means, by a John Hopkins doctor in the 1950's were used in many scientific experiments but for all the good they have done, the \\"donor\\" family is deeply scared from the exploitation.<br />The author becomes involved with the skeptical Lacks family and does her best to inform them of what actually happened to their mother's tissue. In particular the author finally gains the trust of the daughter and teaches her on the history of her mother. There is hope that this enlightenment will help the family heal this decades old wound.
B003OF3R0S|5.0|The best way to discribe this album is to compare it to NIN's Downward Spiral.  The album start's off very heavy then song by song becomes much darker than the last. Obviously the band took a heavy loss when The Rev passed. A very talented drummer and a key point in the bands creative aspects. Everyone who compares every album to Waking the Fallen has to remember every band puts out atleast one flawless album. As times change so does the type of music bands produce. As for this album I would have to say yes it does not sound alot like thier predecessors but its still nothing short of brilliant.
B002KT3XH6|5.0|This book is a must read. I recommend it to anyone interested in Tudor History. Very detailed, easy reading and very intriguing. Excellent!
0545123283|4.0|When I read Shiver a few months ago, I didn't fall in love with the book like many others did.  Yes, I thought the story was beautifully written and the characters were pretty likeable, but it wasn't enough to \\"Wow!\\" me.  I still decided to give Linger a chance and I am so glad that I did, Linger managed to do what Shiver hadn't.  Which was leave me in complete awe over how amazing the story was and make me love all the characters, including the new pov's that were brought in, Isabel and Cole.<br /><br />There was so much going on in Linger with four very distinct voices, but even with all the characters and the different struggles they were all facing, not once did it feel rushed.  Linger still had the same slow paced, yet beautiful, and \\"lyrical prose \\" (as it's been described many times) that Shiver had.  With Shiver I struggled getting through the book and actually had to set it down quite a few times. Linger was the complete opposite and I actually didn't want the story to stop.<br /><br />One of the things I didn't like about Shiver were Grace's dimwitted oblivious parents.  Normally, I'm all for respecting the parents, but I was glad to see Grace's parents finally get theirs and actually have to step up as parents.<br /><br />There were so many wonderful scenes in this book. One scene in particular that especially stood out to me had to do with a deer. Note: chapter twenty-eight, pages 214-216.  That was such a painful, emotional moment, and revealed a lot about the character.  It's definitely a scene I wont be forgetting any time soon.<br /><br />I don't think there's much more I can say about Linger that hasn't already been said.  It's a perfect follow up to Shiver and if you haven't started this series yet, you definitely should because it tells a beautiful story about love and loss. I know I can't wait to see how it will all come to an end in Forever.
B002VPE1B6|4.0|The plot of the story is just ok, but the Picture Quality is simply the best i have witnessed on my TV.  It is worth getting if you want to show off your TV and Blu-ray player to friends when they come over.  it will knock their socks off!!
B003ITZBVI|5.0|So I finally got myself a PS3 and have moved into the world of Blu-ray...sort of. I still need a nice HD TV, but that's coming. So this won't be a review of how the Blu-ray quality of the picture held up, though even on the screen I watched it on it was absolutely beautiful. My friend just kept repeating \\"the animation is sick!\\" So yeah even without the TV it was gorgeous. Oh and the sound was great too, my other friend that was there was stunned right away by the clarity of sound. So that was cool too. And now that I've gotten that out of the way on to what you really came here to find out, was it any good?<br /><br />The answer is a resounding HELLYEAH!!!! I have been a fan of all of the DC Animated films, and this is by far the best in my opinion. Though they started off a little wobbly they have matured into some truly fun and well done films. I still say they should be at least 15 minutes longer each but they have started to make up for that a little with the DC Showcase shorts, but more on that in a bit.<br /><br />First Some quick background for the uninformed aka non-geeks. Everyone knows who Batman is. Most know who Robin is as well. A lot may not know however that there have been several Robins, three that are well known and loved or hated as it were. Dick Grayson was the first Robin, and grew into his own heroic mantle as Nightwing (recently taking on the mantle of the bat himself), while Jason Todd was the second Robin who was headstrong and less loved. Then there was Tim Drake, the third and arguably the best Robin, as he took the title from being just a sidekick to being his own solo hero, as well as following in Dick's footsteps and leading the Teen Titans.  Still with me? Good. Now in 1988 Jason Todd had become unloved by fans to the point where DC allowed fans to vote on the fate of Todd at the end of the \\"A Death in The Family\\" story arc. Fans voted him dead. And that's exactly where this movie starts, with the death of Jason Todd at the hands (or crowbar and bomb) of the Joker. Judd Winnick who wrote the \\"Under The Hood\\" arc that this film is based on struck gold with this. He not only faithfully adapted the story but improved it by streamlining it of all the crazy subplots and the \\"Crisis\\" event tie-in. And what a story it is!!! It's gripping, emotional, and action packed. I mean seriously ACTION PACKED! There's barely a lull in the film before you're off to the next chase or fight. The choreography for the fights is amazing too. But it's the story that propels these insane action scenes and it just keeps getting better as the film progresses.<br /><br />Five years after the death of Robin, there's a new vigilante taking on the criminal element in Gotham called the Red Hood. He's using the name of the Joker's first criminal identity and taking on all the crime lords in the city especially Black Mask, and he isn't afraid to shed a little, or a lot of blood. This naturally catches Batman's attention, and the chase is on. I really don't want to say too much more about the plot as if you're not a comic person, the person under the hood as it were is still a mystery, though not much of one due to obvious clues but still, it's a mystery all the same.<br /><br />The animation is slick and very well done. The Batman model looks like an updated version of the one seen in DC's last release \\"Justice League: Crisis on two Earths,\\" and is well detailed as are all the other characters. Kudos to DC for finally using Nightwing's comic uniform instead of the silly bird insignia they have been using (though the \\"Teen Titans\\" and \\"The Batman\\" versions were cool), and for crafting a Joker who truly looks sinister. And we can't talk about an animated flick without mentioning the voice cast. Wow! That's all I have to say. First of all Bruce Greenwood voicing Batman was rather good. I am one of the few that have been okay with most of the iterations of the character as I though each voice fit with that version of the character, but for this dark and brooding story and world, I felt that Greenwood captured it perfectly. Kevin Conroy who has voiced Bats for almost 20 years in animation is the iconic voice, and he would've been great, but Greenwood did an exceptional job. Neil Patrick Harris was spot on as Nightwing, he got his chatty personality but his detective upbringing down very well. Wade Williams was interesting as Black Mask. The character first appeared in animated form on \\"The Batman\\" voiced by James Remar and was cold, and calculating, never really losing his cool. This version is very cold when calm, but violently over the top when he's angered and I liked it. But the voice I loved most was John Dimagio as The Joker. You know DiMagio as Bender from \\"Futurama,\\" and here he's absolutely fantastic. A bit more deep voiced and gravely than I was used to, his humor is dry and he's constantly cracking himself up. But that dry delivery is amplified by the psychotic and sadistic things he says. Just wait til you see the final confrontation between Batman, Joker, and Red Hood.<br /><br />This movie was amazing, but the total package is made better by the DC Showcase short \\"Jonah Hex.\\" Thomas Jane (who wanted to play the part in the live-action film) voices Hex and he is awesome. Just like the last Showcase short \\"The Spectre,\\" Hex completely embodies the genre it attempts to capture. It is 100% a western in the vein of \\"The Outlaw Josey Wales\\" and other Eastwood classics. From the setting to the music it has a true western feel, and none of the cheesiness that was in the live-action film. This is what the film should have been. Rounding out the voice cast are Michael Rooker, Linda Hamilton and Michelle Trachtenberg. Other special features included are two documentaries about the two Robins featured in the film, Dick Grayson and Jason Todd. There's a first look at the upcoming \\"Superman/Batman: Apocalypse\\" based on the \\"Supergirl From Krypton\\" arc, some trailers, and of course Bruce Timm's picks from past cartoon series, this time all from \\"Batman: The Animated series,\\" with a personal favorite of mine being \\"Robin's Reckoning\\" telling Dick Grayson's origin. Don't look for any updated picture quality with these though. They're just as they are on the DVD.<br />All in all a good buy for anyone who is a fan of Batman or of just good action.g story and world, I felt that Greenwood captured it perfectly.

044024367X|1.0|Disappointment after reading the previous 11 books in the series: atheist Brit (not US, not Army, not Marine) outs himself. Reacher's bodily hygiene has bothered me from the first novel but in this book Childs displays mental hygiene even more lacking. Rather than a tight thriller, there is Reacher's shallow mocking of Child's cliche'd End Times Christians, in order to tell us \\"everybody's an atheist.\\" Next come crazed townsfolk blocking the highway while shouting \\"Out! Out! Out!\\" and beating the pavement, conspiracies between the \\"lay preacher\\" and the US Army to endanger wounded vets, soldiers and citizens.     Child's medical information is often faulty - but as a doctor, I don't expect standard of care in works of fiction. Unfortunately, Child's \\"Traumatic Brain Injury\\" site is not only poor in terms of medical accuracy; he uses Mr. Vaughn in a political statement more than a plot detail.    Buy another (author) and throw this one in the trash.
B003FXXNBW|5.0|Someone must have forgotten to tell the makers of \\"Undisputed 3\\"-that these types of movies aren't supposed to be this good.  Going into the experience I expected an entertaining but mediocre fighting movie-instead I found myself frequently surprised by the sheer amount of depth to the film.  The story is very solid with several nice touches.  The directing is also top notch and the level of TLC given to the final product by everyone involved is evident.  The acting is good too (Scott Adkins and Mykel Shannon Jenkins in particular) and the character development in the film is outstanding.  And as for the fight scenes, more than a few of the moves on display will leave you scraping your jaw off the ground trust me.  Boyka-the film's main protagonist is also an instantly likable character despite being the villain of the second film.  Though he says few words-everything that comes out of Boyka's mouth counts.  (Or makes you grin)  Not only is \\"Undisputed 3 a good fighting movie, it's a good movie period.  I'd love to see another sequel in the series featuring Boyka, especially after the way this one ended.  Good stuff.

1423113381|5.0|I initially read this book because my neice had to read it over the summer.  She is only ten and is completely lost.  Her teacher must be bonkers to think that any non-gifted child of ten years old would understand this book.  For pre-teens, teenagers or exceptionally strong readers this book would be great.  I found this book to be very entertaining.  I finished it in about 3 or 4 days, because it was that good.  I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys fantasy style reading or Egyptology.  Kids that enjoyed the Harry Potter series would most likely enjoy this book also.  Quick-moving, light-hearted and compelling.  A+.
076790592X|4.0|Facing certain death in a predetermined amount of time likely produces some of the most meaningful reflections of one's life.  I suspect anyone facing this would have a far more grounded viewpoint on the significance of material and philosophical aspects. In Tuesdays with Morrie, we are privy to conversations with Morrie Schwartz, a Brandeis University professor who died of Lou Gehrig's disease, and one of his affected students named Mitch Albom.<br /><br />Each chapter represents a conversation Morrie had with Mitch trying to provide some lasting guidance and perspective about life.  What makes this book especially profound is that Morrie is not just an ordinary person forced to reflect on his life, he in fact had spent a lifetime studying human expression.  The bulk of the book will give any reader pause, a point of relativity that enables one to consider for a moment what is truly is important.<br /><br />This book is short, sad, weighty, and most importantly profoundly valuable; one I'd recommend to anyone with an interest in examining life's philosophical questions.

The picture quality & sound effects were an A+  The action & cinematography were spectacular!  The voice overs for the characters were perfect!    Now the best part.....    the storyline was absolutely INCREDIBLE!!!!!!!!!  Let me say it again folks, the storyline was absolutely INCREDIBLE!!!!!!!!!  Several other characters play Superb roles & bring tremendous life to this movie...    I do not want to spoil it for anyone that has not seen the movie yet, but I can tell you that you will be impressed and thoroughly enjoy this materpiece from Bruce Timm...    This is the best Batman Animated movie to Date!!!    I hope the Batman/Superman apocolypse movie will be as good as this movie was and hopefully there will be many more of these DC animated movies coming soon.
630460291X|1.0|Haven't had a chance to watch the movie yet, but was very disappointed when I received it to open and find that the disc is front and back, making it necessary to stop the movie halfway through to turn the disc over. Definitely would not have purchased it if I had known this up-front.
B001MYIXAC|4.0|As ridiculous as it sounds, yes, the title of this review pretty much sums up the movie.  There are no real scares in this film, just a good story, subtly and intriguingly played out by the two young leads.  I highly recommend this film.  I did not use the supposedly butchered sub-titles, which have been mentioned in many other reviews here, but be warned that the English language overdubbing is also very bad.  The voice actors themselves are fine, but the tone of the voices is all wrong and does tend to take the viewer out of the movie.  The voices sound like people talking in an echoey sound studio, not the environments that you see on the screen.  At several points I got confused and thought the characters were supposed to be listening to a voice on a radio, until I realized what I was hearing was supposed to be the characters themselves!
030745455X|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. Too bad Stieg Larsson isn't around any longer. I've never read such a complex character in Lisbeth Salander. Her strangeness and complexity is the root of the book and character development makes a book wonderful rather than just the story. I loved it!
B000J5XS3C|5.0|I have had the Behringer XENYX 802 for about 6 months now, and it has done everything that I've wanted. I mainly use it to record guitar, but I've used it for various other things as well. I hook it up to my laptop via a Behringer UCA 202, and it works perfectly.       The only problem I had with it was when I first got it, it kept freezing and blasting a loud buzzing sound. The reason why it did this was because the power wasn't plugged into the back of it all the way, once I figured that out it never did it again.      Very good product, I would recommend it to anyone wanting to start a \\"mini-recording studio\\".
0061245097|5.0|Jeaniene Frost is one of those rare authors that can do everything. Her characters are real and engaging. Her stories are action-packed with great world-building and suspense. And her character dialogue is some of the wittiest and most laugh-out-loud funny of any I've encountered.<br /><br />All of these gold standards come together seamlessly once again in One Foot in the Grave, the second in Frost's addictive Night Huntress series. The story picks up four years after the end of Halfway to the Grave. Half-breed vampire hunter Cat Crawfield has left her rogue hunter days behind her in favor of a gig leading a black ops team of FBI agents tracking supernatural threats for the government. Unfortunately, Cat also left behind her Master Vampire boyfriend Bones -- and still can't seem to get over him. Her partner Tate is more than willing to be her partner in other ways, and nice-guy vet, Noah, even promises hope for a normal future.<br /><br />A normal future becomes a pipe dream for Cat once again, however, when she attracts the attention of a very powerful -- and dangerous -- vampire, as well as legions of paranormal hit men trying to track down the Red Reaper -- Cat's former identity. But when she unexpectedly crosses paths with Bones again, her old life and her new intertwine in surprising new ways.<br /><br />I love the Night Huntress books -- it's honestly hard not to gush. This book lost none of the steam built in the debut novel, and Cat's new vocation and friends bring new life to the story. The key characters continue to be the showstoppers, though. Bones, in particular, is one of the most drool-worthy characters in fiction. As a former fan \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\\" I wonder if Ms. Frost had Spike in mind when she conceived the delectable Bones. On every page, he's devilishly funny and as spicy as Tabasco.<br /><br />To sum it up, it's imperative to have the next book in the series on hand when you finish One Foot in the Grave. Trust me, you won't want to wait for what's waiting At Grave's End.End.

1595141979|5.0|Vampire Academy should probably be suffering from some kind of mid-series slump by its third book, Shadow Kiss. However, I guess someone failed to tell author Richelle Mead. Because there is nothing \\"filler\\" about this incredible, fast-paced continuation.<br /><br />In Shadow Kiss, Mead does answer many of the questions readers have puzzled over throughout the series. She provides some satisfying progress in the central romantic relationships in the novel, and gives her characters lots of opportunities for (painful) growth. If anything, I think Vampire Academy is ramping up -- this is by far my favorite book in the series thus far.<br /><br />Rose and her friends are still recovering from the loss they were dealt at the end of Frostbite, and Rose, especially is having a hard time recovering. She feels guilt and regret over her choices and their consequences, and some of those feelings seem to be playing out in hallucinations. Either that, or Rose really is seeing ghosts.<br /><br />She doesn't have much time to ponder the issue, though, because Rose and her fellow senior dhampirs have just begun their in-field training exercise. For the next six weeks, they will shadow their assigned Moroi and gain a glimpse of what their lives will be like in the future, protecting and guarding the lives of others at all times. However, Rose is most looking forward to the excuse to hang out with her best friend, Dragomir princess, Lissa, in the name of the exercise.<br /><br />However, nothings is as easy as it could be at Vampire Academy. Rose is assigned another Moroi to guard - not one of her favorite classmates. Royals on campus are showing up in classes with strange signs of violence that none will talk about. And Adrian, the older, royal Spirit-user that's set his sights on Rose, is making life complicated for both her and Lissa.<br /><br />The book's plot covers a lot of territory, but Mead makes each section of the story significant and interesting to readers. Every time I thought, \\"Wow, this has to be the high point,\\" Ms. Mead would take the story in a new (devastating) direction. To say the end was unexpected would be an understatement -- I absolutely didn't see it coming, and wouldn't dream of spoiling the twist here. However, it's a good thing I have Blood Promise sitting on my shelf waiting for me. I don't think I can stand the suspense much longer.oint,\\" Ms. Mead would take the story in a new (devastating) direction.

0385523904|5.0|This heart-rending work of nonfiction traces six North Koreans through their life stories, culminating in each case with immigration to South Korea. One would think this is a happy ending, but the defectors often regret leaving North Korea, even if they were escaping death by starvation.     The book consists of awful first-person accounts of the famine of the 1990s in the North. People would pick through animal droppings looking for grains of corn; one kindergarten teacher watched as her class dwindled from 50 to 15 as the students, one by one, starved to death.     As the author points out, someone who would emigrate from North Korea is a malcontent by nature. When they make it to the South, each following a suspenseful trip that belongs in a thriller, the problems of adjustment to society are even greater than they were in the North. One wonders what will happen when(if?) reunification occurs and millions of northerners migrate south in search of food; this book suggests the omens are not favourable.     Contributing to these individuals' maladjustment is the knowledge that their remaining family members are condemned to the death camps by the North Korean government, following the belief that an entire family bears responsibility for the guilt of any of its members. As one North-to-South immigrant puts it, My sisters died so I could drive a Hyundai.  Try enjoying the affluence of the South with that thought gnawing at your conscience.     If you're interested in North Korea, buy it. You won't be able to put it down.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|I don't do Christmas.  I've mentioned that before, but then again some people may not have taken me too seriously (I find the concept to be self-centered and manufactured).  That said, some may balk at me gushing over a Christmas movie, but I like what I like and this movie deserves my attention.  Talk about a movie that defies expectations.  Looking at the trailer for this film or glancing at the DVD cover and you'd think it's going to be `stupid funny' so when the film winds up displaying genuine sincerity with every laugh you find yourself scratching your hear in disbelief.<br /><br />This film has serious heart.<br /><br />The film tells the story of Buddy, a human who was adopted by Christmas elves when he was a baby and raised to believe that he too was an elf.  He made for a rather clumsy elf, being that he is kind of gigantic, and so he was eventually told the truth about his origin and sent off to the real world to find his human parents.  He does find his father, but that doesn't go over very well (especially since Buddy is so genuine in his overall naivety that he comes across like a complete nut-job).<br /><br />Sure, there is that whole `Christmas spirit' mumbo-jumbo that is so beautiful in context yet so inaccurate in application, but it works marvelously in this family centric film that nails nearly every mark it attempts to hit.<br /><br />This film just has `it'.<br /><br />In fact, this film has heaps of `it' in the form of Will Ferrell, James Caan, Bob Newhart, Mary Steenburgen and Zooey Deschanel.  I mean, really...what a marvelous cast.  Ferrell is just effortless and so wonderfully delightful as Buddy.  He captures the tone of this character with ease and delivers a performance we will remember and adore.  James Caan handles a stereotype with gusto, and Bob Newhart is just so huggable as Papa Elf.  I've always had a soft spot for Steenburgen, even when she hasn't deserved it, and Zooey Deschanel should be in EVERY movie.<br /><br />If you want a smart, witty, charming family film that will defy odds and really deliver than this is the one for you, whether you engage in the traditions that come from this over-hyped holiday or not.ll defy odds and really deliver than this is the one for you, whether you engage in the traditions that come from this over-hyped holiday or not.

030745455X|4.0|Mr. Larsson's first book, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, sucked me in and now I must read the next two in the series.  I was a bit less engrossed with The Girl Who Played With Fire, and I'm not certain why.  If the scene didn't involve Lisbeth, I found myself anxious to move on through the less interesting parts (a lot of detail) to get back to her.  Also, I feel that Lisbeth would never, ever consider getting breast augmentation. Such a procedure could be construed that she was lacking in some way because she had small breasts. Uh? Sorry to you five-star fans, but I believe the author's own anatomical preferences and sexual fantasies may have sent an unwilling Salander to the plastic surgeon.  I think little Lisbeth with a big attitude would have said, \\"If they don't like me the bleeping way I am, then bleep them!\\" Aside from these small details, I still liked the book and would recommend it.
0307454541|3.0|I was looking forward to this one, despite of some of the reservations that other reviewers have had (Larsson hates women! The plot is both convoluted and too easy to figure out!)  I must agree with the second point. About the first, I'm less sure.<br /><br />This starts when disgraced journalist Mikael Blomqvist, fresh from losing a libel case, gets an offer (ostensibly) to write a book about an old industrial family, the Vangers. The real job is to find out who murdered sixteen-year-old Harriet Vanger, back in the summer of 1966. With the aid of Lisbeth Salandar, a hacker with a total lack of social graces, Blomqvist eventually solves the mystery, and discovers some ugly family secrets.<br /><br />The book isn't bad, but the plot isn't cleanly executed either. I figured out a major plotpoint fairly early on, and I don't think that Mr. Larsson intended that. There are also subplots that either disappear with no explanation or get resolved too easily. Blomqvist's war with another rotten industrialst could have filled another book, while making this one tighter. The stuff about Blomqvist's lefty magazine, Millenium, could also fill its own book. These different threads aren't as well integrated as they should be. I kept thinking that somehow I had picked up a different book.<br /><br />There's also too much pointless description. We don't need to know the exact area of every room/house/flat that anyone walks into. Just tell us somebody ate a sandwich; we don't need to know what's on it. There are too many italics, and much of the dialog clunks. A diligent editor would have fixed all this.<br /><br />Did Larsson hate women? 'Hate' might be too strong a word, but I think he had some issues. You can't write a book purporting to blast violence against women, then write titillating scenes of . . . . violence against women.  Scenes whose details will put many readers off, and, I fear, will turn others on. It's too bad that Mr. Larsson isn't here to clear this up.<br /><br />I also can't shake the feeling that Stieg Larsson's death from a heart attack contributed to the hype surrounding this book. It's a passable first effort, not a great one.tieg Larsson's death from a heart attack contributed to the hype surrounding this book. It's a passable first effort, not a great one.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is so far from my normal type of reading (which is mainly historical fiction and southern fiction), but even *I* loved this. It was recommend to me by a friend who's been telling me for about 3 or 4 months now, that I need to read this. I kept putting if off, convinced I was gonna hate it, but she said since I read and enjoyed Ayn Rands 'Anthem', and Lowis Lowry's 'The Giver' is one of my all time favorite books, this is something I'd probably like. She was absolutely right.<br /><br />It was so hard to have to put this book down, and in some cases, I simply couldn't. I read WAY past my bedtime two nights in a row. I average 1 book a week...I finished this in 2 1/2 days...and I have a 2 year old to take care of! I won't summarize this book since it's been done here already about a gazillion times, so all I can do is add my recommendation to the other 1,000+ that are already here. Seriously, this is an excellent book, and you'll fly right through it. I immediately started 'Catching Fire' upon completion of this book, and I know I'm gonna be pulling my hair out waiting for 'Mockingjay'. This really is an amazingly good series.
B002ZG9788|3.0|The original \\"Clash of the Titans\\" contained a story that made you feel good and brought Greek mythology to life.  This version of \\"Titans\\" strips away all that was good about the first one, leaves you with characters that you care nothing about, and capitalizes on what was lacking in the original - the special effects.  Worth a look, but George Lucas once said something like \\"Special effects without a story is not much of a story\\".  Exactly.

B003OF3R0S|5.0|I've loved Avenged Sevenfold ever since hearing Waking the Fallen, easily one of my all-time favorite albums. I liked City of Evil, but it didn't give that same \\"oomph\\" that Waking did. Their self-titled grew on me, but it was because they grew as musicians, making a new kind of rock for themselves. Their new album is similar to the self titled, but with more heavy and light elements. There's metalcore growls and screaming on 'God Hates Us', and light piano as The Rev sings his final song on 'Fiction'. Mike Portnoy gives us the double-bass drumming and heavy cymbals throughout the album, and as much as he's respected as one of the greatest drummers to ever touch rock, The Rev had his own sound.     I'm giving this album 5/5 because it's a true Avenged Sevenfold release, with or without The Rev on drums.

B0038Z5SEW|5.0|\\"The Edge\\" is a story about a billionaire and two other men stranded in the Alaskan wilderness after a plane crash.  Part character study, part adventure,I think this film works on both levels.  Anthony Hopkins, who I rarely find sympathetic, is very touching as the rich husband of a beautiful model played by \\"beautiful model\\", Elle Macpherson.  Alec Baldwin, co-stars as Macpherson's secret lover and a fellow wilderness refugee with Hopkins.  Baldwin gets to play himself (my opinion), charming and funny on the surface, but who's true character is selfish and dangerously hateful.<br /><br />The location shooting is breathtaking and the supporting cast give wonderful support, most notably (among the human actors), L.Q. Jones is dead on target as the lodge manager and \\"would be\\" entrepreneur.  However, the true star of the film is Bart the Bear, playing(?) a man eating Grizzly bear relentlessly focused on making a meal of the stranded airplane survivors. To those of you not familar with this legendary animal actor, Bart had significant roles in \\"White Fang, among other adventure films, and a career making performance as the lead in \\"The Bear\\". He is absolutely on top of his game as the pursuer of our air crash survivors.  The film makers actually thank Bart and his trainer in the ending credits for making the film a reality.  In an industry where getting billing and credit is everything, that little thank you is saying a whole lot about a miracle animal actor.  This was Bart's last film, he died, too young, after the making of \\"The Edge\\".<br /><br />\\"The Edge\\" is a serious work by a top writer, David Mamet, and a good film, made by professionals.  The blu-ray edition makes the Alaskan wilderness look all the more beautiful and big.  I found the film highly entertaining and a fitting final contribution by one extraordinary bear.

When she fled to China she saw a dish of white rice and meat sitting on a stoop and realized that in China the dogs eat better than the doctors in North Korea.<br /><br />A kindergarten class starts with 50 students and finishes with 15, the missing children are either too weak to come to school, or have starved to death.<br /><br />Through it all the city of Chongjin itself dies.  One by one the factories close for lack of supplies or fuel.  The theaters and restaurants go dark from lack of electricity.  Then the wires and machines are looted for scrap metal.  Finally the food disappears.<br /><br />But it's not all doom and gloom.  Demick weaves in family dramas and a love story to remind us that behind the fearsome military and the insane government are real people with hopes, dreams and feelings.<br /><br />There are other miserable places in Earth but reading this book reminds me that no where else is the misery so deliberate.  The prosperity of South Korea and China show that there is no reason North Korea has to starve, there is no unrest, no famine.  The government has chosen this policy to maintain its insane vision of socialist and racial purity.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book enough.  Read it.

The bits about the dogs wasn't what was so off putting. It was her characterizations. I don't know if she realized she wasn't writing a J.D Robb book. The hero and heroine were having conversations as if they were the profilers of the killer, and psychologists that could assess what another human being is feeling without having been told in the first place. I couldn't finish it I was so disgusted. This book had so much potential to be another 'High Noon'

B001GCUO5M|3.0|Without giving anything away, I think that if you have not seen a similar story made into a movie, then this should be a brilliant watch for you.  I'm not sure why it received an R rating, as this felt more like a stereo typical PG-13/14 sitting.  They pretty much had me up until a certain turning point, at which they lost me nearly entirely.  Great acting and direction, along with a little bit of a been there done that, makes up my 3/5 star rating.  Lastly, I do think my expectations were greater.
B003OF3R0S|5.0|This album is by FAR there most complete work as musicians and a perfect way to pay tribute to the late great Rev. They do go a little away from sounding the 7th trumpet and more like Beast and Waking the Fallen but thats not a bad thing. They evolved in a good way I think. Mike Portnoy Shines in paying tribute to his biggest fan Jimmy The Rev and does an amazing job paying tribute to his style and sound. This album has everything from ballad like song to just straight up heavy hitters and head bangers. If you love Avenged Sevenfold then you won't be disappointed. This is top 5 albums of 2010 by Far.    1. Nightmare- 10/10- This is the title track and is one of their best ever and a great way to start of the albums. Some of Syns best guitar work and solo is in this track and the Revs drums are perfectly kept in tact by Mike.    2.Welcome to the Family-7/10- A good track that grows a little every time I hear it more so it might be a close 8. A blazing drum intro by Mike sets the tone for the song early.    3. Danger Line-9/10- One of the better overall tracks on here. Kinda A7X version of GNR's civil war and its a great thing. Guitars are fast and blazing throughout this one and is one of my fave tracks on here. Its about a soldiers life and missing his family. One of the better solos of Syn on this album.    4. Buried Alive-10/10- Another stand out track on here. The intro is epic and real sad. Great rhythm, Guitar, Drums and vocals. This is the second best track on here really touches on what they are going through and hits you hard. A slower track that might turn some people off but is a masterpiece. Again the solo shines here.    5.Natural Born Killer- 10/10- WOW. This is by far the best and heaviest track on here. The guitars are insane as is the burning intro. The drums are insane and classic rev style. Mike is a beast on this track along with Synister Gates. A great head banger and one of A7X all time best.    6. So Far Away-9/10- The slowest track on here buta great one. The acoustic in here is amazing and just makes you break down. Then comes the soulful solo right after. Grows on you the more you listen to it.    7. God Hates Us-9/10. Another strong track that starts of like a ballad but is anything but that. The riff in here is second only to Natural Born Killer. Drums shine again on this song with Portnoy. Syns faster solo is one here and is a killer one.    8. Victim- 7/10- In my opinion the weakest track on here, but one of Syns Better solos in the whole album and takes a couple of listens to like it.    9. Tonight the World Dies-8/10- A good slow pace song. With some good slide guitar and outro by Shadows and Synister Gates. Kind of has a western feel to it like gunslinger almost or sons of disaster feel.    10. Fiction-8/10- A really weird track like piece of heaven but a good one. This one has Rev singing with Shadows and is crazy because he is saying goodbye 3 days before he passed. This song really hits you if you are a big Rev fan its his style all the way and him saying goodbye to his fans and Friends in A7X. Has a great piano backing track the whole way.    11. Save Me-9/10- This blistering 10:56 long song is either gonna be a love or hate thing with almost everyone I think. Some are going to think its way overproduced and some are gonna love its genius and greatness. Synister Shines on this one as he progresses through the song with Insane solos and blazing riffs to slow it down and bring it back up all in one song. Mike shines on this one as well as he provides some real great drums along the way to match the changes of the song.
0545123283|3.0|Told from four characters' points of view, LINGER lacks action and movement, but its breathtakingly gorgeous writing, character development, and romance will have fans of SHIVER squealing with delight, thoroughly satisfied and craving more.<br /><br />Maggie Stiefvater has an envious way with words. Reading LINGER is like submerging yourself in exquisite poetry: the language flows off the page and whispers its way through your bloodstream, all the way into your heart. Some books rely on the strength of their plots and ideas to carry the story; Maggie Stiefvater has her words.<br /><br />At the same time, that was my biggest issue with LINGER, the one I had with SHIVER as well: I found the story lacking...well, heart, I guess. Grace and Sam's love is so all-encompassing, so beautifully expressed, that it's almost stifling, no matter how many songs they write and science problems they ponder (or whatever Grace's other interests besides Sam are). I I found myself sighing with frustration every time the two of them were in a scene together, so eager was I to move on to other scenes in which they didn't appear together and suck all the vivacity out of everything.<br /><br />Thankfully, Grace and Sam are the only ones who are so rigidly defined by their love for one another, leaving me free to enjoy the points of view of secondary characters such as Isabel, Grace's slightly obnoxious friend, and Cole, a sardonic newcomer with a troubled past. But even the new narratorial POVs are not enough to stave off this series' painstakingly slow pace. Maggie seems to enjoy taking her time with her words and mundane events. The upside of this is that new characters like Cole are fully fleshed out in a way few secondary characters introduced in the second book of a series ever are; the downside is that, unless you're a diehard SHIVER fan, the book is all too easy to put down.<br /><br />My interest in this series, however, is redeemed by Maggie pulling off another fantastic ending, one that will make your tongue wag in anticipation of the third book. In fact, despite the slow plotting, LINGER does very much up the stakes--in an extremely startling, yet gratefully welcome, way--for Grace and Sam's world. It satisfies SHIVER fans' craving for more beautiful writing and romance, and keeps the story turning by adding in these new, yet not entirely arbitrary, elements. My feelings toward LINGER are mixed, but Maggie's authoress powers are undeniable, and fans of Grace, Sam, and werewolf romance will be far from disappointed.in anticipation of the third book.

B002ZG980U|5.0|One hell of a joy ride I loved this movie it was done so well, I have not had such a good time at the movies in a long time.
030745455X|1.0|I read \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" and liked it very much so I went ahead and bought the sequel, \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire.\\" In the first book the author gives a brief description of the characters sexual activity in order to spice the story. However, in the second book, it appears the focus of the first part of the book is in the sexual promiscuity of the characters. After about a third of the book, I decided not to read it anymore. It reads as a cheap porno book instead of a good thriller story. I was very disappointed. The popularity of this book reminds me of the \\"King with no Clothes\\" story. Just because there is a media frenzy about the book does not mean it is any good. Here is my advice \\"Hey, the King has no Clothes!!!!!\\"
B001FB5634|5.0|This is not the best movie I've seen. In fact, I was surprised that it kind of lost steam and did not hold up as strongly in the last 1/4 of the movie as it did in the first 3/4. When I finished it I thought it was just alright but was at least not a waste of time. I watched this movie two weeks ago and I wake up each morning, lying in bed for thirty minutes or so thinking about its theme. Though it was not a superb movie as some say it is, in my opinion, it left me with something strong. That's why I give it 5 stars. You watch Avatar or whatever is out there and its gone from you before you exit the theater. This one stayed with me.
0312370849|5.0|I loved this book - I could barely put it down, but when I got to the part where we learn that Sarah commited suicide, I just about threw the book out the window.  How could a woman who has spent practically her whole life mourning the loss of her little brother then deliberately leave her own son behind by doing such a terrible thing? I felt that was so out of character for her, it just made her whole story unbelievable.  The overlying story of Julia was so intriguing that I loved it.  And I loved the ending.
1439102937|2.0|I went backpacking for a few days and I needed a physically light paperback to take.  This book was actually light in weight and in reading, which was good for me.  However, the book was very predictable.  The writing was a bit choppy and I felt disconnected with some of the characters.  I did not enjoy the ending - I thought that author wrapped the book up in a very typical storyline that was too expected.  I liked \\"The Devil Wears Prada,\\" but I would not recommend reading this one.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I loved \\"This Is It\\" in the theater and couldn't wait to have a copy. The pieced-together film, made up of Michael's rehearsals,  was so well done and Michael's genius in choosing and training the dancers, the unique choreography, special effects and his expertise in so many areas was mind blowing. I can't recommend ithe DVD highly enough.
B003PGNBO8|5.0|I loved Flashforward and looked forward to it each week. I was disappointed to hear that there would not be another season. With Lost being gone I believe that this group would enjoy the show.
B0036EH3TS|5.0|Armageddon is not Hamlet. And all the better, it is a fun, wild, free of logic, and well done. Liv Tyler is to die for, Bruce is classic. The Blu-Ray is excellent - though I did not even look for any extras, if there was not any that would be sad - like a making of. But I love it and the Blu-Ray quality.
0307474712|4.0|So many reviews I've seen for this book call it a fun beach read, and while the book is largely enjoyable, I think it would be unfair to group it in with the fluff normally associated with beach reads.  It's the in-depth look of a the friendship between Dex and Em (Em and Dex), and how these seemingly very different people forged a relationship that lasts so long.  Funny, Engaging, and moving at times, I think anyone who has ever said \\"How did I become friends with this person\\" will see themselves in the situations, if not the characters.
B002ZG977Y|2.0|DVD review: All it has is the movie and some deleted scene's. The BlueRay version has a different ending not in the movie as well as a digital copy for ur portable divice. Funny how they put the good stuff on blueray now and leave the dvd'rs with less.     Movie Review:Ever since I saw the original in theaters I have waited for this remake just for the special effects and the effects in the movie are amazing. The biggest issue I have with this movie is that it abandons all depth of story development for longer, bigger action sequences. The special effects were outstanding but the lack of journey and story left it feeling hollow and dull like just another 'polished' hollywood big budget movie I'm supposed to be wowed by and simply like. Perseus was a reluctant hero who was pulled away from his life and meant to die. This perseus is a little too driven and the underdevelopment of story between his adoptive family and perseus did NOTHING to create sympathy when they died. Even perseus didn't seem to really be haunted by their deaths. He was just angry, nothing else. There was no sense of travel either. It was all just montages of great looking locals that rushed us to the next action sequence. No sense of travel, danger or distance is to be felt. The biggest let down of all for me was the entire sequence in medusa's lair. This, as a kid, was the pinnacle of the movie for me. Yet this remake rushes through it so fast if you blink twice you'll miss most of it. There was NO suspense, NO build up, NO tension, perseus didn't even have to out-wit medusa as he did in the original. He just jumps blindly and manages to get the job done. It was an incredible let down. He didn't have to a whole lot of to do thinking in this movie. He just either has it handed to him or, after most/all of his soldiers die, manages to suddenly do what he should have done at that start of the fight. Perseus didn't even have to catch and tame Pegasus. It just shows up and lets him ride. The originalhad perseus thinking out every situation he was in and outwitting the baddies and the gods. It was a journey of life or death not one of rushing to the next sequence.     It seems as though the makers of this movie felt they had to do the whole thing BIGGER and GRANDER but their focus on that left all of what made this movie fun to watch out. Hollywood seems to have moved in that direction now, little or no real story anymore. Look back to the older movies and they had a better balance of story and action. This is what I call an, 'Independence day' movie. It's all special effects, fluff and hollywood polish that we are simply supposed to be wowed by but not pay attention too. (Independence day was a horrible movie with little story, full of plot holes. it is the perfect example of movie garbage, in my opinion). I have to agree with a poster here who said it would have been better to simply take the original and `special edition' it like star wars. That indeed would have been preferable to this remake. I say rent it FIRST before you buy it.
B000000ORE|4.0|Mesmerized by Appetite For Destruction, its rawness, its blues base, its power, the style of the vocals, etc. I looked, endlessly, for more music  like that. Frustrated I realized years later, that it didn't really get any better than that. Even Guns N' Roses never delivered again. Some people may not agree with me, but I can tell you that THIS WAS THE CLOSEST ALBUM I FOUND TO THAT. A found a lot of other bands that used hair spray like Guns, I guess that's why they call them Hair Metal bands; but I found a lot of their efforts lacking in musicianship and frankly, lacking a bit in testosterone.  If one would take a band like Def Leppard, with some pretty good talent, get them to man up and have them take some lessons on how to play good blues from the Black Crowes, you might be able to get an album like The Great Radio Controversy. THIS ALBUM IS NOTHING BUT AWESOME.  Genuine, honest, American based blues: hard and heavy rock n' roll. This is the best work by Tesla. I got other Tesla music, but I wasn't impressed. I won't waste your time mentioning \\"highlights\\" as this album is good all the way. You'll see. This album is the best kept secret from the Hair Metal years, and please don't think it's going to be like Ratt, Cinderella or Poison. The Great Radio Controversy is great music.
B0029NY9YO|2.0|Im not sure what this movie is celebrating, superheroes, murder mysteries, evil violence, or just the brand new hope for the end of music as we know it, replacing it with the whining voices that have been shunned or set aside all these years, because it is here they make their grand debut out of our consciousness. At any rate, the soundtrack sucks with over political overtones of the lost 60s, and believe me, if the soundtrack sucks (I would exit a bar that played any of this), the movie does too, cause there is no movie classic with soundtrack that sucks.  Even Thank God It's Friday disco movie had an award winning song in Last Dance. Now that was a real exit.
B0031YJFCQ|2.0|I'm a fan of the series.  Read the whole trilogy.<br />However, I only finished this book because of the previous books.  This finale was unedited, and coasted upon previous characterization and plot.<br />Feel free to read this book.  Just don't buy it.
B0031YJFCQ|1.0|UNDOUBTEDLY THE MOST AWFUL BOOK I'VE EVER TRIED TO READ.  TRY AS I MIGHT I COULDN'EVEN FINISH IT.....DIDN'T ENJOY THE LOCATIONS OR NAMES OF CHARACTERS THAT WERE USED.  SO MANY DIFFERENT CHARACTERS TO TRY TO KEEP UP WITH.  CAN'T BELIEVE IT GOT SO MANY GOOD REVIEWS.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Everything about this movie and the book tie-in, is astonishing. Much better than Al Gore's movie for that matter. I have shown it to my family members so they can make better choices in the food they buy and eat. Must see!
1607882302|5.0|I recently purchased the audio version so I could listen to it on the way to and from work.  I am currently listening to it a second time!  Tony is a great storyteller! What is captured in the book is the essence of being open and honest and how this impacts our bottom line.  We are all someone's customer and the relationships that we establish with one another are key to our success!     I learned that it is okay to stop doing something that doesn't fit!  Choose to be part of something that is bigger than yourself!  And have FUN!
0446563048|4.0|There has been quite a crop of customer service related books recently, as well as the classics in the field. They each have their own angle, and I'm going to use this brief review as a chance to summarize where Delivering Happiness falls in this group as well as how to complement it with a couple of other books with different approaches that make for a very well-rounded outlook in tandem. It teaches you how to make decisions that serendipitously bring you success. It also gives you practical steps that deliver happiness into your own life. I trust you will be able to apply quite a bit of it to your work, your clinic, your patients, and most importantly, to yourself.

0807014273|5.0|[[ASIN:0807014273 Man's Search for Meaning]]    Significant work indeed after Freud and Adler. The book shows by example of personal experience of the author, and that of many other, how the influence of one's thought power can make you live or die and the rightful thinking that can make one stand against all odds. The meaning for life is not defined by someone but to be found by each one of us and that the meaning exists whatever the living state of affairs be, is the message of the book. There probably has never been a worst place to live other than in concentration camps, as described in the book and the ordeal of living through it. The book also deals with the dimension of spiritual thinking a little (probably the 8 volumes of the theory proposed by Viktor Frankl has more info). A must read for students of psychology.
B001IF252M|2.0|Unfortunately when I received this adapter I tried plugging it into multiple different monitors with my very new (less than 3 month old macbook) and was disappointed to see no image every time. In the end I scheduled an appointment with a \\"Genius\\" and went to the apple store and they said it was a bad adapter and gave me a new one. I'd still say it's worth buying because it is the actual apple product, so if your like me and something does happen, an apple store can still take care of you. Moral of the story, Buyer Beware.

I am going to buy it to have in my library!  Great suspense and action and drama!  The actors are great!  Besides all the gossip about these 2 men they are great actors and they need to receive the credit they deserve!  I recommend this movie to all.  I have been telling everyone at my job about this fantastic movie!
B00008EY9G|4.0|With some big name stars such as John Cusack, Rebecca De Mornay, Amanda Peete and Ray Liotta, Identity is a thriller which takes on the premise of Agatha Christie's novel And Then There Were None. In this novel, ten people, who all share a secret, are all invited to an island, and one by one they begin to die until the killer is revealed. In similar fashion, in Identity ten people by chance find themselves at a desolate hotel on a stormy night. It seems that strange luck has brought them all together, but, once there, one by one they begin to die. All the characters have vastly different personalities, so you begin to question who the killer is. Meanwhile, while the mystery at the hotel builds, the story flashes to a deranged criminal being questioned by a psychologist about brutal murders. The two stories fuse together, but it may not be as clearly defined as someone thinks.     I'll admit that the first time I saw the film; I didn't really understand it or like it. I thought the ending was a little too far-fetched and silly, and felt cheated that much of the other parts of the film \\"didn't matter\\" or were rendered insignificant because of those events. However, after watching the film again, I believe there are several aspects that make Identity worthwhile. It is a film that draws you in because just when you are recovering from one mystery, there is another one which enters the scene. Events happen so rapidly that you might find yourself wanting to stop it (just to catch up and mentally take note). Another great aspect about Identity is that it makes you contemplate each scene; you can't really take any moment or scene off mentally, or you may miss something. In this way, it really is a smart thriller. Unlike some thrillers that explain everything away, this is a thriller that does the exact opposite (well, until the end), leaving you to put together all the clues.     Whether you like this movie or not, or find it an effective thriller/psychological mystery willdepend on whether you \\"buy\\" the ending. Things aren't really what they seem, and you have to view the film in terms of two distinct plot lines that only at the end of the film tie together. Those who despise Identity will take the ending to be a stunt; those who enjoy it may see it as a clever technique. We have often seen the thriller and await the twist, hoping to be able to predict it. I must say that Identity is a film that offers two puzzles. At the very least, Identity takes a different course to get to its conclusion, and separates itself in a good way from many of the predictable (blah) thrillers out there. The extra include a few deleted scenes, director commentary, and an on the set documentary.     This is a worthwhile thriller to check out.
0307588335|3.0|I read this book cover to cover.  Every chapter held my interest.  What a melodrama. I wasn't expecting to read an autobiography when I started this book, but by the time I finished it I thought the author's personal story strengthened the credibility of his opinions.
B001EP8EL2|4.0|The audio and video quality on the blu-ray are top notch. You also get Criterion's great selection of special features. They are definitely worth watching, even if you are just a casual fan of the film. The film itself is not for everybody, but you will probably enjoy it a lot if you like weird sci-fi. All in all a great buy, the only caveat is that I heard Criterion was losing the license for the film so the price will probably be going up.
B000000H57|5.0|Type O Negative, October Rust.  There are many reviews already, so I won't say much.  This album is truly fantastic.  Nothing quite compares.  It's a CD that has been with me for years (in several incarnations), and I don't know who I'd be without it.  If you don't already have October Rust, do yourself a favor and procure this bit of recorded magic!  [R.I.P. Peter]
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is an excellent 10-part series, focusing on not only on the tactical aspects of the military, but on the personal relationships developed during wartime. Well worth watching  - especially for those  interested in getting an overall view of the war in Europe.
B001GCUO16|2.0|The first act and opening credits of Wolverine are very strong, except for an uncomfortable, almost comical bit where a little boy runs around with claws. The Logan character, as played by Hugh Jackman is very well realized and easy to like - but the overblown plot around him is not going to make this movie watchable for generations. Hats off to Hugh Jackman for the performance - I paid to see the movie just his artistry more or less.<br /><br />Just eat your popcorn and enjoy the ride since it's not one you're likely to revisit.<br /><br />SPOILER: The Uncanny Valley is breached in the final scene when Professor Xavier (represented by the lost digital rights of Patrick Stewart) shows up looking like a broken Disney Animatronic. It's horrible. They should have cut that!

B001OQCV2O|1.0|I was in the mood for a wild, special effects extravaganza - but I didn't know I'd be renting this bomb of writing, directing, and choice special effects.<br /><br />The director is Roland Emmerich - you'll know him for 'excellent' fare such as Independence Day, Godzilla, The Patriot, The Day After Tomorrow (only Roland would make a global-warming movie about the earth freezing!), and so on. What these movies all have in common is an incredibly-hard-to-swallow over-the-top Karmic irony which sees bad character punished by random, action-oriented coincidence. Horrific disaster is treated like a sort of wonder-of-nature amazement (drinking game: every time they say something like, \\"you gotta see this!\\"). You can see the special effect coming from a mile away! The dramatic irony isn't subtle or thought-provoking, it's just obnoxious. One of these days, one of Roland Emmerich's films is going to come true, and he's going to rightfully say, \\"YOU GOTTA SEE THIS!\\"
B001C3KCSY|2.0|This is by far the worst Kings of Leon album. I have seen Kings of Leon live three times. Their live show is great and they are a talented band. However, this album is crap compared to their first three albums. If you are looking to get into Kings of Leon..then start with Youth and Young Manhood, then Aha Shake Heartbreak, then Because of the Times. If you are so into Kings that you have got to hear more, then by this album..or better yet listen to each track on youtube so that you know what you are getting yourself into.

B002SJIO5E|5.0|Don't be put off by the documentary format with which the movie opens; give it some time, and District 9 will reward you with great character writing and solid action sequences virtually mirroring war footage on CNN.<br /><br />When H.G. Wells wrote \\"The Time Machine\\" it was as much entertainment as it was a social commentary on the segregation of the aristocracy and the working class. This is what Science Fiction was born to do. And this is what District 9 does. So, on top of the great effects and action, it's been envisioned with a lot of political savvy, too.<br /><br />There's a bit of propaganda featured in the movie which bordered on the ridiculous - but it's forgivable against all else the film offers. Thanks, Peter Jackson for giving Blomkamp the cash!!

B001OQCV6K|3.0|Essentially a soft steampunk \\"reboot\\" of the classic Arthur Conan Doyle stories, \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" depicts the title character as a restless, obsessive mind in need of constant stimulation. Watson isn't as much the fool as he's been in previous cinematic incarnations, and the two know how to dish out combat and thrills 90's-style.<br /><br />The movie is packed with juicy production design and writing - it might be worth a second viewing if you can get past squirming through unabashed depictions of demonic worship (despite whatever rationality you possess). Is Guy Ritchie throwing out rebellion against his former lover's (Madonna) embrace of Kaballah?
B00361HV02|4.0|I have loved Black Rebel Motorcycle Club for about six or seven years now. I got into them after the release of TAKE THEM ON, ON YOUR OWN. A band from my native state, a distinct vocalist, moments of hard rock, but a band that could also survive slow songs without turning cheesy. After TAKE THEM ON, ON YOUR OWN, BRMC released HOWL, which, in my opinion, is an amazing album. A rootsy, southern rock, acoustic album that strays at times into deep soul and gospel music. Two genres I'm no real fan of, but when BRMC is the vessel, they managed to knock it out of the park.<br /><br />Then came BABY 81. And I think the two real problems with BABY 81 were 1. That it followed such an amazing album as HOWL, and 2. That it was so different from HOWL. For myself, I was severely disappointed because what I really wanted after HOWL was HOWL VOLUME 2. BRMC took things in a different direction, and now that a few years have passed and I have gone back and given BABY 81 another chance, I actually like it quite a bit, even though I feel some songs are a bit lengthy when they don't need to be.<br /><br />So now onto BEAT THE DEVIL'S TATTOO. This album maintains the same guitar power as BABY 81 had, but injects into it that southern roots feel that made me fall in love with HOWL. In fact, the whole album is so nearly a perfect hybrid between the previous and subsequent albums that I really feel like this should have separated the two. I think I would have liked this album more, and BABY 81 more as well. The album isn't new or original really, even as far as the previous work of BRMC, but it's a good listen, and a freshness lacking in the worship surrounding Miley Cyrus and Justin Beiber.<br /><br />The lyrics are also maturing. One thing I have always loved about BRMC is how well the emotion is conveyed in the vocals. \\"I'd never known her to cry/But this time was different for sure/She's shakin' with tears in her eyes/As she picks up what's left of the night\\" The beginning of the song 'The Toll,' is a fantastic break-up song, filled with simple drum and guitar chords, backed by a female vocalist (a rarity in BRMC). This bare style is what endeared me to HOWL, that something with so little physical substance can have such a profound effect.<br /><br />One last thing to mention is that BEAT THE DEVIL'S TATTOO seems longer than it actually is owing to how many slow songs there are on the album. The album barely reaches an hour in length, but because there are so few \\"rock\\" songs, it will feel longer. I'm not sure whether that's a good thing for others, but HOWL had mostly slow songs, and it is my favorite. In conclusion, you really can't go wrong with any BRMC album, and anyone who liked HOWL should definitely check this album out. Anyone who sort of stumbled into BRMC with BABY 81 and thought it was OK should still check this out. Sometimes BRMC zigs when you expect them to zag, but I, at least, will follow them wherever they go.c break-up song, filled with simple drum and guitar chords, backed by a female vocalist (a rarity in BRMC).

Visually beautiful, and the acting far superior than any of the others. This is surely the best Emma yet. The langugage a little more modern, but does explain the true nature of the characters far better than any other adaption of the book by Jane Austen. It is quite a happy affair to watch.

B001FB55H6|2.0|Spoilers abound in this review. Read on if you're ready for them.<br /><br />In the comic, two detectives piece together the murder of the Comedian - we see only flashes of the event, preserving the mystery of the Comedian's character and his killer. In the film, a 5-minute fight scene.<br />Rorshach, horrified by a killer's brutality, handcuffs the killer to a stove then burns down his house. In the film, Rorshach takes a meat cleaver and repeatedly chops on him.<br />The Owl and Sally Jupiter begin kissing in Archie (Owl's ship) - then, fade. In the film - a full sex scene.<br />Veidt kills half of New York teleporting an artificially created alien; implying that humankind has a greater threat than each other. Veidt cries over this sacrifice. In the film, Veidt kills millions upon millions all over the world and barely changes his voice. He seems more mad than calculating.<br /><br />In most every scene, Director Zack Synder emphasizes the visceral thrill over the psychologically complex in Alan Moore's Hugo-winning mystery. Do yourself a favor: read the comic instead and marvel at Alan Moore's complex, layered writing where boyish, testosterone-ish thrills are tossed aside for penetrating character drama.<br />[[ASIN:1401219268 Watchmen]]

In one night I read 2 chapters before becoming too tired to read anymore. It is a real page turner, especially if you are a veteran of tyria and know the races/classes/places being described. If you are new to tyria it provides a great look at what you can expect at the very least from Guild Wars 2.

B001HN6940|3.0|There is a problem with this review: I've never been an Alice enthusiast nor have I read the original books. So read on if that doesn't matter.<br /><br />Tim Burton is most courageous as a film visionary - his films break new attitudes and visual ground. Storytelling-wise, however, his films have memorable scenes chained together with a dental-floss-storyline and medium-to-slow pacing - but more power to him; he's doing what he loves in a market very closed to originality. Burton refreshingly breaks his storytelling pattern for 'Alice' with slightly quicker pacing, and still offers the ground-breaking visuals you ache for. The mixture of virtual and real - sometimes within the same character - is nearly seamless. Alice is played with a quiet sensitivity by Wasikowska, and it's through your strong sympathy with her character that you come to experience and love the characters and of 'Underland'.<br /><br />We are privileged to see the talent of Burton unfold as mainstream genius.

I have a good imagination but Jeremy Irons is a good story teller!    The message that resounded in my head was a quote repeated through the book, the universe will conspire to help you achieve your dreams. This sentiment is found in many other writings, leap and your angels will catch you, etc. Everyone has a personal destiny to fulfill.  After reading this book, I started on mine and I am well on my way!
B002FLO0MG|5.0|I love this movie.  I recently came across it as being used-very good condition.  It was and I was able to enjoy this movie again.<br />I love the dichotomy between the characters played by Kurt Russell and James Spader.  I think this is the first movie that I've seen with James Spader where he isn't a complete whacko.  Spader plays a Scientist that no one believes until he goes to work for the government that believes him because they have something that's unbelievable.<br />Kurt Russell plays the part of a Col. that has suffered hard times in his family situation and is forced to come back to work on a project he thinks is dangerous.  He is right, and wrong.<br />This is an enjoyable movie with extras that make it worth seeing again.

They have a unique approach to integrate their entire society so that their best students are geared into the top military positions and then move into the private sector of business, research, science, academia, etc.  They are brilliant at what they do and have much to offer other countries  in terms of help in development.  If only the world will listen.
B002LSI0N8|1.0|T2 is by far one of the greatest action flicks ever made - it's layered with modern themes, awesome action, and inspired performances from Hamilton, Furlong, and Morton. Cameron is a jerk, but his directing is intense - we rarely see such daring REAL stunt work anymore.<br />Outside of that, Terminator: Salvation stacks yet another mediocre attempt against an otherwise compelling idea. The effects are first class, there are some decent action sequences (well choreographed) but they can't save the plot which is held together with sheep hairs. If you're a fan, you'll find yourself going, \\"what?\\" and \\"I knew it!\\" alternately through the film. But you'll also say \\"that was cool\\" a few times, too. Just don't expect another T2... it's hard to outshine such brilliance, and the Terminator series struggles to meet the bar of regular film offerings with every installment.
B002ZG977Y|2.0|I was not impressed, not by the CGI or the way the mythology was mucked up. There are so many things wrong with this movie there just isn't room enough to list them all. I'll stick to the main points.<br /><br />Costumes were unimaginative and boring and belonged to a lot of different eras, but not the time period the movie covers. Danae was Acrisius's daughter and not his wife and she welcomed Zeus because she loved him. He appeared as a shower of gold and not an eagle wearing her father's, or in this case husband's, face and form. Too much like Uther Pendragon and Ygraine. Stick to the time period, people.<br /><br />The armor the gods' wore and the rest of the gods, other than Hermes, Zeus and Hades, standing around and looking blurry and ethereal was a waste of talent and film. The costumes were completely wrong for the time period -- again. At least they got the sandals right.<br /><br />The CGI, while dazzling, was a one note wonder. The Stygian witches, flying demons and Kraken all had the same basic facial and skull structure. I guess it's too difficult to actually create something new and interesting to breathe life into the more realistic and innovative claymation that Ray Harryhausen used in 1981. Sorry, geeks, not cutting it. Go back to school. What's with the djinn? They belong in the Middle East in a very different century, like during the time of Solomon, which is a few thousand years after Perseus. Pegasus in black and with really lame wings, not funny and not interesting. Medusa as a still beautiful woman with snakes for hair who goes all comic book villain when she turns men to stone, not even worth laughing about.<br /><br />Alexa Davalos as Andromeda was horrid casting. She would have been better as Io and Io, who was much prettier and had that fragile, ethereal beauty, would have been better as Andromeda. Even Alexa's handmaiden was prettier. Definitely, not the kind of girl a demi-god would risk his life saving, obviously, since he ended up with Io. Once again, the mythology was completely wrong since Perseus marries Andromeda and becomes king.<br /><br />What is all boils down to is that the original version in 1981 was better all around: costumes, acting, closer to the mythology, creatures and story line. For all its flash and CGI and martial effects, this one falls far down the scale of entertainment and should have been a direct to DVD release. The guys in the CGI department must have been on drugs or just too tired from doing a better movie to get it right and be completely original. Tell the burn-outs it's time to find a new job or go back to comic books.<br /><br />Rent this one. It's not worth the price to buy.y was completely wrong since Perseus marries Andromeda and becomes king.

B003OF3R0S|5.0|The central theme of Nightmare by Avenged Sevenfold is emotion. Certainly with the death of a fellow member of the band and a brother, the members of Avenged Sevenfold were swimming in an ocean of emotions. This album has remorse, confusion, and pure hate among other varied emotions that enable listeners to intake a small taste of the experience these talented individuals underwent.    Nightmare (5/5): The title and opening track of Nightmare begins your journey with a bang. This track starts off with a dreamy chime before blowing you away with Shadows screaming \\"nightmare\\" leading you into a high paced experienced. This track was well chosen as the leading single. It's very catchy and it isn't long before you're singing along learning of the bands nightmare that is about to unfold before you.    Welcome To The Family (5/5): This track is probably a future single and perhaps the most accessible song on the album. After a shout out to a \\"Waking the Fallen\\" instrumental intro Shadows jumps into the melody of this very catchy track. Like Nightmare this song is also set to prepare you for what's to come. It addresses the cacophony of emotions running rampant with their minds. We see that even the members of A7X aren't sure exactly what they are feeling it's a mixture of so many raw emotions, \\"When our thoughts are so numb and our feelings unsure  We all have emptiness inside, We all have answers to find, But you can't win this fight.\\" Among the catchy melody and chorus is a blazing a solo and Shadows intermixing a growl/whisper tone to conclude this track    Danger Line (3/5): This song starts off with a marching band type drum progression, before jumping into a moderately high passed jam. I enjoyed this song, but it just didn't seem to fit into the concept of the album. It's well known that Avenged Sevenfold are big supporters of the men, women, and children affected by war and the lives of soldiers, which this song exemplifies. There is an interesting surprise towardsthe end of the song when the melody and pace slows to almost a ballad, highly contrasting with the fairly quick pace the song initially sets. As I said before this is a pretty decent stand alone song, but just doesn't flow or mesh with the rest of the album.     Buried Alive (5/5): This track begins with a long, slower paced Metallica-esk intro of guitar bliss before finally jumping into the initial melody of the song. Maintaining the Thrash ballad feel the song jumps into a powerful chorus that takes you a little bit by surprise the first time you hear it. This song has a groove about it early on that will leave you feeling relaxed and intrigued before it hits the blistering solo that synyster shreds out with technical perfection. Soon after the solo, however, the song takes an adrenaline pumping twist, pounding out heavy chords and a deep base. With that we get the first real taste of Shadows screaming since Waking the fallen, which left my jaw on the floor. Lyrically, through the progression, the concept of the album is continued. While using the tracks \\"Nightmare\\" and \\"Welcome to the Family\\" as a basis for the album, Buried Alive suggest the feelings the band felt after the initial shock wore off. Without Jimmy the band felt, as the title suggests, trapped and helpless. The progression of the song also leans towards the experience of claustrophobia. At first the trapped feeling is subtle and leaves you vulnerable, but if the feeling continues to linger it doesn't take long before the feeling detonates into an overwhelming flurry of pain, as if not only were they trapped and alone but suffocating in their own hell. The final lines of this song bring Avenged Sevenfold forward to an angry acceptance of what has happened to them this past year as Shadows bellows \\"THIS IS NOW YOUR LIFE, DIE BURIED ALIVE\\"    Natural Born Killer (5/5): This track will blow your mind away the first time you hear it. This track begins at a blistering speed and only lets up a little during the chorus just so you can process the instrumental inferno that just took place and will undoubtedly continue post chorus. What stood out to me on this song was the drumming. Portnoy did a great job filling in for The Rev, but it's still very obvious that it was in fact Portnoy doing the drumming on this album, while doing his best to keep The Rev's memory alive. This track, however, just screamed The Rev in every direction. If I didn't know it was Portnoy I would have thought Jimmy was able to leave this beat behind. To me, due to the drumming, this song is the most complete. It not only has a nostalgic feel about it, seeing as how it could be a love child of \\"Waking the Fallen\\" and \\"City of Evil,\\" but also the fact that you can almost sense Jimmy behind the kit.     So Far Away (4/5): This song dismisses any intro and jumps into the emotional ride. The lyrics for this song were written by Synyster as his goodbye or just his feelings for The Rev. The song begins with a very straight forward verse, a guitar, and Shadows singing his words, that's about it. This song wasn't meant to be impressive really, it was just meant to help heal. Synyster opens his heart for this song describing who Jimmy was to him and how he's felt upon losing his best friend. Even though it probably wasn't meant to impress, parts of it still deserve notice. The solo in this song is simply gorgeous. Synyster begins with an acoustic medley following a slight pause before jumping into the sweet sound of steel. It's nowhere near his most complicated piece, but it speaks to the listeners without remorse, leaving a long lasting impression. While this song can be hard to listen to without tears welling up in your eyes, you'll find yourself wanting to experience this one over and over.     God Hates us (Holy **** 5/5): After So far away this track begins with a lighthearted intro meant to settle you in for the ride. Then out of nowhere this song jumps right out of the speakers drop kicks you in the face, beats you senselessly while you are down, and leaves you feeling entirely violated, yet somehow you enjoyed it. If there was any question as to whether Shadows would pull out some screams again, this track will solidify your belief. This is the hardest song I've heard from the band and it just devours you with raw emotion. Not only is this band hurt, but they are pissed. You can hear the anger and tears behind Shadows' words and it will drive you down the same path. This song will upset and offend some people while, taking the rest as its hostage of brilliance until this song comes to and lighthearted outro, leaving as subtly as it came.     Victim (5/5): This song begins with the chiming of what I would expect to be church bells and the choral female sounds influenced by Pink Floyd before transitioning into a very touching song. The feeling I got from this song was pure confusion. Avenged Sevenfold has vented some of their anger and beginning to accept what happened to them, but they still can't be sure. \\"And some say this can't be real, And I've lost my power to feel, tonight we are all just victims of a crime,\\" the fairly catchy chorus sang by Shadows reveals that although they are accepting what has happened, they just don't know why. Why did this have to happen to their brother? Why did this have to happen to them? why did this have to happen to our fans? This track touched me unlike any other. We all do feel like something was taken from us, that there's really no just cause, and that it's something that we will never get back.    Tonight The World Dies (4/5): This song took me a while to warm up to, but it's actually a great piece in itself. This track continues the concept of the album with a blues influence to it. It remains blues oriented throughout rarely deviating from the somber feeling. This track illustrates that even with their loss they will continue to hold on, perhaps frozen in place with their emotions. Although the time moves on, they will live each day, perhaps feeling as if they could have done something to prevent this tragedy, but they know it's too late now. Even though time does continue to move their world has collapsed and they will never be the same. This song will probably only be appreciated by more hardcore fans. It's unlike anything Avenged Sevenfold has done in the past and true fans will understand the feelings and emotions behind it, but casual fans will probably be left unsatisfied.     Fiction (2.5/5 or 5/5): This song is what will be remembered as Jimmy's last legacy. It was originally entitled \\"Death\\" when Jimmy presented it mere days before his death. It was almost as if he knew his time was up and that he wanted us all to be ok without him. \\"Left this life to set me free, took a piece of you inside of me. All this hurt can finally fade ,promise me you'll never feel afraid.\\" While listening to this song I was almost brought to tears. It's haunting hearing this song which is the only song to include Jimmy's vocals. The lyrics for this song are so appropriate considering the situation we are all in. Perhaps, with time, we can all learn to move on and celebrate his life properly, but for now we will continue to mourn. I gave this song two ratings, because of the perspective it can have. To hardcore A7X fans, this song is as much a blessing as it is a curse. We absorb as much of Jimmy as we can and this is a wonderful tribute to Jimmy's memory. To the casual fan, however, this song will not be satisfying. The gothic piano melody can be intoxicating, but as the band wanted it, the rest remained fairly untouched. The vocals from Jimmy were demos, though done very well, it's easy to think that they would be cleaner had Jimmy had the time to properly record them, especially during a few of the spoken parts where the quality is not what it could have been. Also, while the band could have probably altered this song with other instruments and melodic adjustments, they felt that would tarnish The Rev's memory. So for the hardcore fans this song is a masterpiece and something that will have a lasting effect on us. For the casual fan this song will just fade away as a memory of a song that just didn't seem finished.    Save Me (5/5): This song shows that perhaps Mike Portnoy and Dream Theater may have had a little bit of influence on Avenged Sevenfold much as they influenced him. This song is an epic progressive metal adventure with a catchy melody and haunting lyrics. This song moves through progression changes and melody shifts, with brilliant instrumental technicality over the 11min track. This track puts a wonderful conclusion to this concept album. The lyrics suggest that A7X knows they can't go back to a time where they can be with Jimmy again, but that's not to say they have seen the last of their fallen brother. In this song it sounds like the band is trying to speak directly to Jimmy hoping he can hear their plea. They wanted him to stay, but they want him to know that although they will walk this path without him that they will soon join their brother in internal life. As they march through the days alone, they are praying for the day when they can reunite with him once again. This song is a masterpiece, even those who are not huge fans can appreciate everything that went into making this song an epic journey.    Closing thoughts:       Hardcore Fans: Album (9.3/10)  This album is an amazing treat for hardcore fans. The band said that it was not a concept album, but the album very much plays as a concept album directed at the loss of Jimmy. With everything that has happened in the A7X family this album hits every emotion and directs us through the bands journey. We should all be happy that we got an album at all, much less one of amazing quality and delivery.     Win: Fiction - Getting to hear the Rev's voice and brilliance one more time.    Fail: Danger Line - Not a horrible track, but didn't mesh with the rest of the album at all.    Casual Fans: Album (7.5/10)*as well as I can think about it objectively.  Casual fans will find great interest in the albums heavier tracks such as God Hates Us, Natural Born Killer, Nightmare, and Welcome to the Family, but the rest of the album may be lacking for them. This album has a much darker mood and a generally slower pace than Avenged Sevenfold's previous albums, leaving something to be desired from casual fans, who enjoyed the party rock of Beast and the Harlot and Bat Country.     Win: Welcome to the Family - A high paced, very catchy, thrilling song that will make just about everybody who enjoys music bounce with approval.    Fail: Fiction - This track just can't be appreciated if you don't understand the meaning behind the album.    One last thing, this review was simply my personal perspective of the meaning behind the songs and the album as whole.
B00139W3NE|2.0|**1/2<br /><br />Based on the novel by Philip Pullman (the first of a trilogy), \\"The Golden Compass\\" takes us to a parallel universe where humans mind-meld with shape-shifting creatures known as daemons, children are kidnapped and \\"re-programmed\\" to live without those daemons, and society is ruled by a mysterious, all-powerful Magisterium that tells people what they are to think and how they are to live.  Lyra (Dakota Blue Richards) is a feisty young orphan whose uncle, Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig), is hot on the trail of a scientific discovery regarding the nature of the universe - a discovery that, if proven true, could completely upend the paradigm that allows the Magisterium to remain in power.  Naturally, Lyra is one of only a handful of very special people who possess the gift of unlocking the mystery of a golden compass said to hold the key to something or other of great importance (in all honesty, this type of mystical mumbo-jumbo is not exactly my cup of tea).  British and American acting stalwarts Ian McKellen, Tom Courtenay, Christopher Lee, Sam Elliott, Derek Jacobi, and Nicole Kidman round out the cast.<br /><br />Much has been made of the supposed anti-religion/pro-science slant in the story (\\"magisterium\\" is the term for the teaching authority of the Roman Catholic Church), and, indeed, Pullman, a renowned Freethinker, has admitted that he wrote his trilogy of fantasy novels (called, collectively, \\"His Dark Materials\\") partly as a rebuttal to C.S. Lewis' \\"Narnia\\" series - though the Magisterium doesn`t seem to be any more objectionable as a literary device than the societal super-structures we find in \\"Brave New World\\" or \\"1984\\" or \\"Fahrenheit 451,\\" or countless other such tales (though I gather that the movie somewhat dilutes this aspect of the original story anyway).<br /><br />If truth be told, I really don`t have much use for films of this genre, but I will say that I find the movie version of \\"The Golden Compass\\" to be a bit more imaginative and a trifle less plodding than the recent cinematization of \\"Chronicles of Narnia.\\"  Plus, \\"Compass\\" provides a sometimes breathtakingly beautiful vision of what life might be like on a parallel planet.  But, when all is said and done, it's still just the same old mishmash of talking animals, mythological creatures, precocious youngsters, fantasy battle sequences and over-worked allegory we`ve encountered oh so many times before.<br /><br />Stay tuned for the next installment.than the recent cinematization of \\"Chronicles of Narnia.\\"  Plus, \\"Compass\\" provides a sometimes breathtakingly beautiful vision of what life might be like on a parallel planet.

B0034JKZ3G|4.0|CG Animation is a beautiful thing - it's given animation permission to explore themes that it couldn't before, like non-musical stories. Disney Traditional still hasn't gotten that in their thick skulls, and this movie makes many of same mistakes they were making post-Lion King (a politically correct voodoo priestess?! C'mon!).<br /><br />But the movie is no less enjoyable; a great tale about balancing ambitions with character. It contains characters with strong dreams to risk, in addition to a villian worthy of fear (Parents, it may be rated G, but there are some shocking moments in the graveyard). As an aside, there are fantastic animation moments, worthy of the name Disney contained in 3 of the songs. During these sequences, you \\"leave\\" the story for a moment, enjoy it, and when you're back you'll say to yourself, \\"Oh yeah, we left off here\\".<br /><br />While watching this movie, remind yourself that those lines you're seeing (which define the characters) are actually the artists'own marks (albeit the clean-up artist, but the movement is straight from the animator) - and that, my friends, is a privilege.
B002ZG98LO|3.0|They should've renamed this sequel to PREADATORS: THE LIP SERVICE TO THE ORIGINAL SEQUEL.  Yeah, this should've been better.  Though, it's not bad, and it's very entertaining, it really brings NOTHING new to the table.  Actually, it pays so much homage and uses so many elements from the first film that it comes off more as fan fiction than a legitimate sequel.<br /><br />The acting is great in it though.  Adrien Brody is truly a great modern actor who can play anything.  Sure, Predators is way, WAY below his range, but he's never played a character like the one in this film before, a cynical-world weary-mercenary.  He's convincing and totally holds the screen whenever he's around.  AND he's convenient to explain to the rest of the cast what the hell is actually going on in the plot IE explaining it to the audience.  Did anyone else think it was convenient how he kind of caught on to what was actually happening with relative ease?  Alice Braga is in the film and I'm fast becoming a fan of this actress.  She just needs to start picking better characters and better films to be in.  The rest of the cast is negligable cyphers who show up to grimace and then die.  Except Topher Grace.  He adds a sense of humor to the film, that it so much needs.  All the characters that end up on this reserve planet are soldiers or killers of some sort except him.  He's a doctor.  Now if you're mildy retarded or have never seen a film before, ANY FILM, then you might not be able to guess what plot twist he's involved in at the beginning of the third act.  Danny Trejo is underused, which is a crime, but there is a Machete trailer attached to Predators(this film was produced by Machete creator and co-director Robert Rodriguez) so that should help you get your Trejo fill.<br /><br />The action is paces and choreographed well for each desired effect.  The special effects creatures and CGI are fine, and the designs are interesting.  The pace is zippy and tense.  But the problems of why this film is just elevated to being only SLIGHTLY better than Predator 2 and the first AVP film are as follows:<br /><br />Why go back to a jungle?  We've seen this already.  Sure, it's an alien planet, but the friggin' jungle looks exactly like....um, Hawaii?  This is already dull.  Why not set it in the old west, ancient Japan, outer space, the far future...SOMETHING NEW.<br /><br />The convict character was the most edgey and orignal character added to the stock of action movie cliche's, so why not do more with him.  His line about what he's going to do when he gets home, \\"Rapin'\\", is truly twisted and darkly funny.  This film needed more of this.<br /><br />Why not touch more on what the Predator aliens culture is?  Sure, we learn that there are different tribes, but it's really only there as a plot device for escaping the planet and isn't really used for anything revolutionary.<br /><br />Is it me or is it WAY convenient that the Alice Braga character just happened to know the entire plot of the first Predator because she works for the AMerican goverment?  I guess she was out of town or on another mission during Predator 2, because she doesn't mention, or rather, give a really, REALLY long expositional plot synopsis of that film like she does for the first.<br /><br />As Adrien Brody's character made his way to the spaceship, alone, what did he plan on doing once on board?  He can't fly an alien craft, as far as we're lead to know.  Even if he could, how would he know where to go?  He doesn't even know what galaxy he's in, let alone what the instruments, whatever alien langauge they might be, read as far as direction or the amount of fuel he's got.<br /><br />This isn't really a complaint but more of an observation: Why did John Debney get credit for scoring this picture?  I didn't hear one original note.  I just figured they took Alan Silvestri's original score from the first two pictures and grafted them where appropriate.<br /><br />I liked this film.  It was fun and exciting enough.  I just want more.  This is 23 year old franchise.  Take us somewhere new.  This film, with its game reserve planet premise, just has enough to push it over mediocre, but there's so much more.  Why not?  They're noble, tribal, hunting for sport, but super sophisticated technological alien creatures from who know where?  There's better premises to fit these aliens in, but I just don't think there's enough creativity in Hollyweird to must it up.  OR maybe it's just safer to remake with some slight tweaks the original film.  No one gets scared by any sort of ORIGINAL direction, and they feel nice and safe and ready to veg' out.  That's fine, but I'm officially done with this franchise until they start to think out of the box.<br /><br />This film was directed by Nimrod Antal(the superior horror film Vacancy and the abysmal actioner Armored) and he has a good sense of action.  He doesn't have the stylistic signature of the original Predator's director John Mctiernan(Die Hard, The Hunt for Red October), but he at least knows that geography is important when setting up big action cluster-f&**ks.  He wrings genuine suspense from the set up and displays a flair for action.  There's modern editing of fast cuts, but random CU to ECU shots cut together like a music video are noteably and commendably abscent.  Taking notes Michael Bay? Yeah, didn't think so, you're friggin' rich, and you still don't know how to tell a story.  Whatever.  Antal has a great film in him I think, but it's not this.  How could it be?  This is a sequel to a film that came out over twenty years ago!<br /><br />PS: The new to this franchise creature team of KNB Effects is AWESOME.  They've made the most effective Predators yet, old and new.  And the vagina visaged monsters are the real reason I go to see these films anyway.Take us somewhere new.

B00335EQ0E|5.0|My daughter is 1 and loves this movie.  I hardly remembered watching it when I was little.  Still a cute movie, but much shorter than the new Disney movies.  Great classic.
B001KVZ6ES|5.0|I know people say that this film is inspirational, made them cry, etc. I'm not saying that's false - but I am saying that until you understand the main character his language is initially a little shocking. There's also some pretty disturbing implied violence near the end. But don't let any of that stop you from seeing this movie.<br /><br />Oscar winners tend to look like the same film in the best film category, but this movie trumps the typical Oscar winner in genre, performance and just good written truth novelist style. Eastwood mumbles quite a bit, and his presence swings from humorous to downright intimidating in just seconds. The movie successfully changes your opinion of every character, and in a VERY rare Hollywood moment includes a sympathetic priest character. I can't tell you how many directors are scared to include THAT. For that, and many other reasons, Gran Torino is a bold film, and worthy of your evening.
B002ZCDR88|5.0|\\"Leave Your Sleep\\" is so beautiful I can only wonder how Natalie, or anyone, pulled it off. A journey through elation, melancholy and bliss, and you come out feeling like a newborn, more alive to the world around you.
0439023521|5.0|This book was recommend to be by a friend. Although the target audience is young adult I'm 39 and found the book very entertaining.  Its very intense and a page turner, after reading the first installment I couldn't wait to get the the second book.
B000002C4J|3.0|I liked the CD and songs on it, but the only problem was that the quality of the sound was poor, regardless of the kind of system i used in playing it. It didnt sound so well in my car nor at home.
B003NFM3JU|2.0|Motion Capture gets slightly better with every film that Zemeckis makes, but why in California's holy name does he keep making them? With Polar Express and this one, they are both stories which strain under his efforts to make them feature length through pointless lengthy action, over-dramatic pauses, and obvious hamming on the CG process.<br /><br />If you don't know what I'm talking about, then observe as you and your friends look at each other saying, \\"why doesn't he just get on with it?\\", and sigh loudly as moments are stretched intolerably. There's a \\"roller-coaster\\" sequence near the end that made me almost walk out on it. On the upside, the performance capture of Scrooge is pretty good, and each frame looks like a painting. So: hats off, Modelers, Lighting Directors, and Rigging Directors! Get out and support those guys, and look for the amazing, magical Geordie Martinez in the rigging and animation credits, and shout \\"HUZZAH!\\"
B002UZXJA6|5.0|If you haven't seen the Celtic Woman concerts on PBS, you've missed some of the best family entertainment in a long time.
B003VB5D84|4.0|I couldn't disagree with the first review more.  I thoroughly enjoyed the 2 hour theatre release.  My big disappointment?  Only 30 seconds of BB King (in the finale).  The DVD is FOUR hours so I hope to see BB King on the DVD.  I am buying this DVD for two brothers, one a percussionist, one a guitarist.  The biggest query I have is about Citizen Cope.  Has Eric Clpton taken him under his wing, although the performer has been around 14 or more years?  \\"Cope's\\" performance showed a lot of Clapton virtuosity. I also hope the DVD has more 'Ronnie' Wood. ZZ Top can do no wrong. I thoroughly enjoyed the artists I was not familar with, especially the young man playing with Buddy Guy \\"Five Long Years.\\"  I liked the performer and performance \\"Chicken in the Kitchen\\"(Robert Cray?).  The first reviewer- pshaw.  $12.50 is a dinner at Chili's, this concert will satisfactorily stay with me in memory longer than my last meal.  The \\"four\\" is probably a bit premature because IF the DVD has more Ron Wood and BB King, I will rewrite my review and give it a \\"five\\".
0553582453|5.0|There is just something amazingly fun when the author refers to little \\"secrets\\" in the Liveship Traders Series.    I won't give any spoliers, I know Robin Hobb hates spoilers....but when characters refer to events that happened in Bingtown or Jamillia and you have read that series it really feels like you are in on a special little secret.    I loved this book.    The quality of writing is great, and it is so much fun when characters reveal things that you know from reading her past works, but that Fitz doesn't know because he hasnt experienced them.    Wow.  Great job Robin!
B0021L8V1Q|4.0|The first time out, the contracts are signed, the director and actors and script writers involved are all hungry to earn our favor - because everyone wins in a successful franchise. And this attitude contributes to the likelihood of a great first movie - like Iron Man. But once they have earned our favor, there's some pressure to live up to the original, but not much else. This is why sequels are so tricky.<br />The mature acting skills of Robert Downy, Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow liven up an otherwise gaudy script which follows too many characters and complex plotlines. Samuel Jackson is great with power and rage roles - but he doesn't fit heroic or calm types, and his chemistry with Downy is almost nil. Don Cheadle is usually amazing (Traitor, Traffic), but in this movie his acting is stilted. Johannsen has about 10 lines, lots of hot body shots (no problem with THAT), and a single kick-butt action scene - and that's because the action scenes were crafted by cartoon action genius Genndy Tartakovsky (of Samurai Jack fame). Expect excitement and less compelling character exploration for Iron Man 2.
B002RL7VKC|4.0|Armed with cash from the grandparents, my two year old daughter chose this Duplo tractor set to blow her money on. I had my reservations. It's not that it's a bad set, but at retail price, you're paying a lot for a set that has little versatility. Of course, since she has no concept of money, my daughter doesn't seem to mind.    The tractor is essentially a one-piece affair with seating for one Duplo character and a loader that can be clipped on or removed and has three stationary positions when attached. The trailer clips onto the tractor or any other Duplo vehicle, and has a green bed for carting blocks or whatnot (which can be removed to allow room for stacking standard Duplo pieces). Included also are a farmer (adult male), a dalmation, and a pitchfork which can be placed into the farmer's hand. Then there are four 2x2 dot blocks in two shades of yellow.     My daughter has played with this set, in conjuction with her wide array of basic block sets, almost constantly since she brought it home. It's renewed her interest in all her Legos, which had been waning a bit. Because it's brought a fresh perspective to the old toys, the tractor set turned out to be money well-spent in terms of entertainment value for us.     This set, for those concerned with country of origin, is made in Denmark, Hungary, China and the Czech Republic.
B001QXCYZY|5.0|This USB mic is fantastic.  Easy to use with USB, as you don't need any external hardware to get the recordings into the computer.  Behringer's C-1U sound quality is fantastic, as the condenser mic only picks nearby sounds.  (Within reason, of course.)<br /><br />I bought the mic in conjunction with a tabletop stand, a spider mount, and a pop-filter.  All of which are recommended for a recording station.
B000OONQ30|5.0|I bought this for my mother-in-law and she loves it.  She enjoys sitting down to watch it just as much as she enjoys it as background music.  She even puts it on for my 2-1/2 year old son and he is captivated by the music.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|This is not the Star Trek of my youth, and I was a big fan - yet this movie delivers the freaking goods in ways that the wussy-fied Star Trek of the nineties could only dream about (Deep Space Nine, Voyager).  In this film, we're no longer in conflict about sipping 'tainted' mushroom soup (see Voyager - no, don't see it), now the stakes are real, larger than life, and important in the journey of this young crew. The entire cast raises the bar on performances, interaction, good chemistry and comedic timing.  It's uncanny how much Zachary Quinto resembles Leonard Nimoy in the role of Spock, while still putting his own tweak to the character. Chris Pine IS Captain Kirk.<br />Dr. McCoy is lovable and comedic and played to a \\"T \\"by Karl Urban.<br /><br />It is very rare - preciously rare - that a big-budget franchise employs first class effects, compelling sound, and 3 strong Acts all in the service of character-driven storytelling. \\"Star Trek\\" is that rarity. This is Star Trek as space opera, big and adventurous, and is only given proper justice by seeing it in hi-def!
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|I absolutely love the idea that the girls got to spend wonderful quality time together in a foreign city. What a great idea to spend it in Abu Dhabi. How different can it be when compared to New York City.  The weather, the fashions, the taste level, the social constraints, absolutely make this film a fun watch. Look out for the Samantha confrontation with the locals. But what remains the same are the tight friendships between the four leading ladies and the wonderful fashions that absolutely pop in the hot desert landscape. Truly spectacular, I absolutely enjoyed myself while watching this on the silver screen. It's a wonderful companion piece to the years of TV drama the SATC girls have given us. This movie is not your typical half-hour episode. And I have to thank Mr. King for willing to go out of the box and bring us this extravaganza. Seriously, it's been more than 10 years since SATC debut on HBO. You seriously cannot expect things to remain the same. The women have evolved and changed. But thankfully, their sense of humor, their friendship and their smarts remains the same. I give this film two enthusiastic thumbs up! Watch it and enjoy!
B003PGNBO8|5.0|There is SO much crap on TV these days. Then a series like this comes along, that not only has the entertainment power of a \\"Lost\\" (which was great in its own right), but a more compelling and interesting premise, to boot. And it gets canceled. Why are the networks so short-sighted? People don't watch because they schedule (and promote) shows so poorly, then they cancel them because no one is watching. They give the good slots to the crap reality shows, and people watch them because they are the only thing that's on. Then the networks use those numbers to justify keeping that garbage on the air. What's wrong with them?!?<br /><br />There are a lot of shows that were canceled long before they should have, but this was one of the worst. It's even more disheartening when you consider the things that ARE given long runs on TV. Just shows the deterioration of our culture. True art is being replaced with mindless claptrap.<br /><br />At least give this show a shot if you haven't seen it already. You won't be disappointed in the show; only that it was canceled way too soon.
B001FB5634|4.0|I didn't think I'd like this movie. I wasn't looking forward to it. It just seemed so bleak and depressing. It is very much so, but it's still a great movie. I love the director's other film, and this one has top notch performances as well. I always like Viggo. He's an amazing actor, and he carries this film a long way. The kid did a fine job too, and the people they meet along the way were also excellent especially the old man played by Robert Duvall (one of my all-time favorites).
B002ZG9846|4.0|\\"...out of all the thousands of people in the world, you'd think that ONE would try it, try to become a super-hero.\\" And with that statement, Dave Lizewski, aka Kick ***, uttered the gunshot that ushered in the 2010 summer movie season a month in advance.<br />Dave's got all the marks of a great hero - he's likeable everyman, and decides to don mask and tights to fight crime in New York city... even though he's invisible at school, a nobody. This is no Tony Stark, this no Bruce Wayne - but Dave could possibly be one of the greatest superheros to walk across the silver in a while.<br />The R-rating is justly earned - bloody, realistic violence that's also gruesomely creative (spoiler: one mob interrogation involves a microwave), and suggestive private moments, but there is truth in it all, and it doesn't take away from the generous reward of the third act. Kick ***, well, I won't say it... but it does.
B0036EH3XE|1.0|Six season is not only the concluding chapter of one of the could-have-been BEST television series of all time but also a test to show the real potential of the show front-runners damon lindelof and carlton cuse. My intentions of the review is not about the whether it satisfied the heart or the mind, but to question the inconsistency of could-have-been epic TV show.<br /><br />JUST ONE BIG LOOPHOLE SPOILER to derive my review:<br /><br />Season 5:<br />At the end of the season 5 \\"Follow the Leader\\", Richard says to the REBORN Locke that the only possible explanation for him to come from the dead was because of JACOB.<br /><br />Season 6:<br />The so called BEST episode of the entire season - \\"Ab Aeterno\\", Jacob explicitly mentions to Richard he cannot bring anyone from the dead and ends up giving Richard the wish of being Immortal.<br /><br />If you have a decent IQ, you will understand until otherwise if Richard is cursed with poor memory it doesn't make sense for him to not figure out the REBORN Locke is MIB/ Smokey, Jacob wouldn't been dead and hence the entire season 6 is Pure 100% Crap.<br /><br />A magician is only as good as his tricks and showmanship. The tricks by the show-front-runners were more mysteries, and the showmanship in the form of very good actors (terry o quinn, michael emerson and many others) who can deliver the poorest of lines with their mind-blowing performance. Jack Bender one the main directors of Lost needs due credit for presenting the show in the best possible manner/package.<br /><br />So depending on your IQ, it is upto you to fall for one six-yr heck of a magic.<br /><br />I am NOT looking for the best plot but for some consistency from a show,<br />1. which had secured an end date three years back,<br />2. the writers said they had a plan from the BEGINNING. (ya right, just ask the polar bear)<br /><br />My Review ends here.<br /><br />NOW TO VENT OUT MY FRUSTRATION ON SOME KEY INCONSISTENCIES:<br /><br />1. Desmond's false vision of Claire and Aron getting on the Chopper,<br />2. Charles widmore role unexplained to a point that his role was nothing other than crap,<br />3. lindelof and cuse said they explained the mythology regarding the number 4,8,15,16,23,42 partly in pre-series finale interview, was sheer crap. They could have left the mystery rather un-resolved.<br />4. All the ONE-LINERS to tie up the loose ends (The whispers, all the ghosts were MIB).<br />5. And finally, when Jacob's Island mother said dont ask any more questions regarding the Island to Jacob it was slap on my face for loving the show for the last six years.<br /><br />By the way, if I were to guess, all the 5-star ratings is one of the many tricks by the show-front-runners.hat his role was nothing other than crap,  3. lindelof and cuse said they explained the mythology regarding the number 4,8,15,16,23,42 partly in pre-series finale interview, was sheer crap.

I have used it just a few times and I already notice a difference in my stamina and strength. It is an awesome workout. Jillian is great, the moves are fluid and not difficult and she cues well. If you are looking for something easy pass this up. If you want results and you are willing to push yourself get it!
B002ZG9788|4.0|After reading a lot of reviews about this movie and there were more negatives than positives, I still bought the blu-ray on day one simply because I am a huge SAM WORTHINGTON fan, I was a bit skeptical, and thank God, the movie, the blu-ray quality delivered, the movie is much better than I anticipated, I like the script and I love the special effects, picture quality is great as well as the audio, I am happy and satisfied with this disc, a great addition to my blu-ray library.
B002VPE1B6|3.0|You'll get preached to about mother earth and how bad we're spoiling it (even though the earth withstood a meteoric impact and survived just fine) and it actually takes quite a bit away from an otherwise engaging script.<br /><br />On the oher hand, you can't miss Avatar. It's gorgeous to look at, the capture performances are both artistically and technologically inspired and the CG is sometimes indistinguishable from live filming. It is a historic event, a milestone of digital cinema. Because for the first time you can forget that digital film is what you're watching. Many cinema studies will go back to \\"Avatar\\" for decades to come until they create something better and more expensive for us to consume. But the script seems like it was written in the early 90s. You'll get a classic 90s villian-hero confrontation complete with a library of cliche catch-phrases, but some sharply choreographed action sequences like no other director can deliver today. And on Blu-Ray it is stunning.<br /><br />A word of advice: Don't buy a 3D TV. 3D is highly overrated, it's just the compensation Hollywood's looking for to ease their fear of the home theater business.  Just quietly wait until they get over it, and continue to buy movies in 2D.

B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Yes, I'm sure you've heard about Ledger's outstanding performance as the Joker - but it's not just a \\"say-nothing-ill-of-the-dead\\" review. It's a truly original, as well as faithful performance. Jack Nicholson didn't really perform the genius of the Joker as much as his craziness; it was more like Nicholson doing macabre vaudeville. It wasn't the real Joker. This is the real Joker through and through, but re-envisioned with a dose of realism. And by saying this, I dare you to find Heath Ledger anywhere in that mad man on the silver screen.<br /><br />The script is sharp, delves into Batman's psyche better than any cinematic endeavor to date (except for one game: [[ASIN:B001E8VB6O Batman: Arkham Asylum]].  This is just the current level of performance gifted to director Nolan.<br /><br />The entire cast is the strongest of any recent movie I've seen, but I will say there's one moment where Bale's raspy voice as the Dark Knight is kind of awkward. No movie's perfect, but this one may well inspire a three-time viewing.

0307266303|5.0|If you are still reading reviews by the tim eyou get to this one, any summary of critique of the book isn't going to change your mind, you've most likey decided to read it and now are just skimming the reviews to see what other people said.  So simply put, this is one of the best books I have ever read, Friday Night Lights and Into the Wild put together, mixed with some philosophy and science. I can guarantee that anybody that reads this book will have a shift in perception, no matter who you are or where you come from, if you are human, this book is going to tilt your world on its head.  Think Daniel Quinn style, like in Ishmael or Story of B, this author touches universal truths that make the reader view the world differently after reading it.  So buy it, don't get it from the library, and read it once or twice before passing it onto a friend.  For real.
B001DWXUWY|5.0|Gaslight's sophomore effort that is The '59 Sound is nothing short of spectacular. This is music that draws you in from the instant you hear the fast paced opener of Great Expectations and never let's you go. Their music is passionate, moving, and above anything else - real. They sing about things people can relate to and they do it with such elegance and craft you're not fully aware you're getting a story and a song at the same time. Overall this CD is just simply incredible and should not be missed. Buy it, you won't regret it.

B000SMWUPS|4.0|I have a Phil & Ted's Dash stroller which has a funky brake system.  You have to move the push/handle bar to its lowest position to engage the stroller's brakes.  Of course when doing so, it means that this product is angled to a ~45 degree pitch -- so if you have a drink in the holder, it may spill (potentially hot coffee on the baby right below).  Product could be improved upon if instead of straight velcro attachments on the sides, if there was a swivel mechanism allowing for any angle attachment and the product would stay level.  I'm sure it works fine on most strollers though - as most don't have this handle bar braking system.

1441408266|5.0|If you are reading this review, it is likely that you are familiar with The Law of Attraction. This is its initial book, written in 1912 by Charles F. Haanel. I am a proponent--a believer. A couple caveats: The book is written in archaic language and style, which can be hard to understand at times. And, that being one, there are other ironies as well. And lastly, my ultimate question remains unanswered. Nevertheless, FIVE STARS. This book is amazing!<br /><br />The basic premise of this book is that the world of your experience (your outer world) reflects your inner world. In other words--the unseen creates the seen. The world of your senses is dictated by your mind. Mind is what is commonly referred to as \\"God.\\" Mind is omnipotent, omnipresent, and omniscient. Most of what goes on, 90%, happens at the sub-conscious level. So the trick is, the \\"master key\\" is--in the language of Freud, to make the unconscious conscious. The Law of Attraction is Freud's, \\"There are no accidents.\\" Whatever is happening in your life is a direct effect of your mind. You are the cause of all that happens. There are no accidents. This is abrasive to most people.<br /><br />Consider this: \\"Every person is the reflection of the thought he has entertained during his lifetime. THIS IS STAMPED ON HIS FACE (my caps), his form, his character, his environment.\\" (p. 116). Difficulties, inharmonies, and obstacles indicate that we are either refusing to give out what we no longer need, or refusing to accept what we require.\\" (p. 120).<br /><br />I love this, being a writing coach: \\"... see that the words ... are exact ... put together carefully because accuracy in building words and sentences is the highest form of architecture in civilization and is a passport to success.' (p.123) That is exactly what I tell my students.<br /><br />Here is the problem there doesn't seem to be a solution to: You only know what you know. Haanel acknowledges this, saying that people (their minds) are products of their environment and are imprinted early with habits, customs, and traditions; and these then govern their behavior and thoughts. So how can a person break out? He says to seek silence and listen - called meditation today. Empty the mind of all the crap that has been deposited by powerful others. Okay, great. But how would you know to do that, if you are not predisposed to question authority and are open and curious? Not everyone is. He say as much: \\"The average person is entirely innocent of any deep thinking; he accepts the ideas of others, and repeats them ...\\" (p.185). It's a \\"Catch-22.\\" There's no way out. (From the novel by Joseph Heller.) Novelists and writers are the most powerful of all people, by the way. That's from Haanel, but I agree. But what if a person is not a reader? Most aren't; and then those that do often read only what they like ... like attracts like--it is law.<br /><br />So if you are reading this, you already know this. But, to practice it is really hard, let me tell you. To take full and complete responsibility for everything that happens to you is easier said than done. And here is another question I haven't found an answer to - what happens when desire (within and without) conflicts? I want you and you want him and he wants you to be like him and you fold yourself into him and he uses you for his desire and you lose yourself--your I? Am I just to watch? Am I to just be my \\"whole, perfect, strong, powerful, loving, harmonious, happy self ... and let you self-destruct? Huh? Huh? Huh?<br /><br />\\"Fear is the cloud that hides the sun.\\" I am unafraid.early with habits, customs, and traditions; and these then govern their behavior and thoughts. So how can a person break out?

B001GCUO5W|4.0|While I need to watch this movie a second time before I can say if I buy into it completely, I can say it is effective. Scorsese does a wonderful job of getting you wrapped up in the world of Shutter Island, an asylum/prison where the criminally insane are treated. The music, set design, and cinematography do an excellent job of providing a creepy, discomforting atmosphere.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio plays Teddy Daniels, a U.S. Marshal called to Shutter Island with his new partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) to investigate the disappearance of Rachel, a patient there because she drowned her 3 children. Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley), one of those in charge on the island, treats the people there as patients who could be rehabilitated if treated with respect; in contrast, Teddy sees them more like criminals, the same way the prison guards and Warden on the Island view them. Likewise, other doctors believe the patients must be controlled either via lobotomies or drugs.<br /><br />Cawley and others appear less than cooperative with Teddy in his investigation, although he is allowed to interview the staff and patients. Nothing about the disappearance makes sense - Rachel left behind her shoes, nobody saw her leave, and there's been no evidence aside from a strange note Teddy finds in her room. Eventually Teddy confides in Chuck, telling him why he took the case - the man who started the house fire which killed Teddy's wife and kids was a patient there but has since disappeared. Teddy spoke with Noyce, a former patient from the Island, and got the idea that strange experiments might be occurring on the Island. Having served in World War II and helped free a concentration camp, Teddy was aware of the horrors people are capable of and continued to have disturbing visions and dreams. His dreams also feature his wife Dolores (Michelle Williams) in various settings such as their burning house. These visions and dreams also seem to provide clues for the investigation. When Rachel suddenly reappears safe and sound, Teddy still continues his investigation into the island and the whereabouts of his wife's killer.<br /><br />A hurricane crops up while Teddy and Chuck are on the Island, providing for an even moodier atmosphere and more tense moments. The structure of the Island with its isolation and rocky cliffs add to the feeling of being trapped. The acting is great, the dialog fits perfectly, and Scorsese's directing makes you feel like you're there. All of this is important for the twist ending. The movie as a whole left me feeling disturbed and needing to see it again to clarify some things.safe and sound, Teddy still continues his investigation into the island and the whereabouts of his wife's killer.

Shame on you Denzel for agreeing to this movie.
B003OF3R0S|5.0|Going into this album, I had very high expectations for it being that I have been an Avenged Sevenfold since 2003, Waking the Fallen.  I for one found their change to singing as a giant leap in the right direction.  It of course didn't always work but did show thier maturity as a band.  This album is nothing short of amazing.  The first seven songs, with the exception of so far away, really set the mood for the album and are some of the heaviest songs avenged has done.  My particular favorites from the first seven are Nightmare, Buried Alive, and Natural Born Killers.  God Hates us sees a return to screaming, but done in a much closer style to Pantera and it is pulled off splendidly.     After song seven some folks will say that the album turns into a collection of ballads and that's where I disagree.  Song 8 victim is just a phenomenal slow metal/hard rock jam.  Tonight the world dies is the best song stone temple pilots never wrote, has a harder big empty feel.  Song 10 Fiction is probably the strangest song on the album, my least favorite, but still a good haunting duet with piano, (shadows & the rev).  Song 11 Save me is classic City of evil A7X 11 minutes long, thundering drums, and blistering guitars.  Sensational way to end the CD.    I know that I am biased as I have been a fan for a long time, this album is truely right up there with this years greats.  It is a return to City of evil style A7X, and a departure from the more straight forward rockers on the self titled album.     Also, to everyone that says this album only appeals to teenagers, that is simply not a true statement.  I am 28 and have enjoyed them for years and not one bit of their subject matter is whiney or EMO.  I also enjoy all the heavy metal regulars (lamb of god, pantera, mastodon, high on fire, etc.)  The talent and sound of A7X just continues to draw me to their music more often than the screaming metal bands of today.  Give the cd an open minded honest listen and you will not be disappointed.  For fans of Iron Maiden, Metallica, Guns N Roses, basically any good singing metal/hard rock band.
B003ITZBVI|5.0|I have always liked Bat Man cartoons, especially after Warned Brothers took up the franchise in the early 90's and presented a more serious, moodier Bat Man.<br />This movie is a great addition to anyone's collection because it presents a very interesting side of Batman that we don't usually see: a weak side that feels regret or maybe even guilt. And very well done with excellent voice acting and a great animation style.<br /><br />The only warning I have here is for parents: It carries a PG-13 rating due to the violence level. I would caution parents to not show this to young audiences at all. I usually let my 8-year old son watch DC cartoons with me (his favorite is Justice League), but under no circumstance would I let him see this one with me. Examples of what happens that I don't consider appropriate for kids are: beating to death using a crowbar, sniper shots to the head to other characters, massive beatings with weapons, murder with improvised weapons and hand guns. In fact, I think this is THE most violent Batman cartoon I have seen.
B003ITZBW2|5.0|When I first subscribed to DC Comics 5 years ago, this storyline was already underway. Though knowing the backstory of Jason Todd's death and Joker's identity as the original Red Hood, I was still very confused. I didn't really attach to the story and even now, I don't really get modern comics, my tastes lying back in the Golden and Silver Age (even some tales of the '70s), so when I heard that this was the next film the DCU line, I was a little disappointed. But now that I've seen it, I now consider it my second favorite animated Batman movie.<br /><br />The first few minutes detail the pivotal events that occurred in the \\"Death in the Family\\" storyline of the late '80s. I'll admit I thought the scenes with Joker thrashing Robin with the crowbar would be a lot more brutal, but I was nonetheless shocked with the end result. When I mentioned last time that less is more (heck I even had a discussion about that topic with a customer where I work, which I found eerie), it proves that we don't need to see the Joker strike him every time. Once was enough and after that, most of it was done in shadow or off-screen, which is really all the audience needs to know that this kid is being tortured to within an inch of his life. When the movie flashes forward and Batman has recollections about the times he and Todd worked together, it shows that he was similar to Dick Grayson in his youth but as Jason grew into his teens, he attempted to take the law into his own hands. Batman's reacts with sorrow and regret as he faces his past, and it was a nice touch when was talking about how he'd like nothing better to kill Joker but knows that he could never return from that path.<br /><br />The animation was crisp and the characters looked great, though on the cover of the DVD and on the menus, the characters reflect how they appeared in the comics but in the actual film, they didn't really have any resemblance. New Frontier and Public Enemies, while being adapted to Bruce Timm's style, still had a passing resemblance to how they appeared in those books. Black Mask however, didn't look as intimidating. Even in The Batman, he looked more of a threat (I don't think they added pupils in that version).<br /><br />This voice cast is one of the best they've pulled off so far. Since Batman first appeared in New Frontier, we've gone through four different actors, and, Conroy aside, each has been able to make the role their own for that particular movie. Bruce Greenwood is no acception, bringing the pain and anguish that Batman is feeling as he sees his former partner alive really shows in his performance. Jensen Ackles makes Red Hood psychotic but during the scene when he and Batman fight off the guys with the \\"lightsabers\\" (were they in the comic?), he has Jason feel nostalgic about the adventures they had before. Neil Patrick Harris brought some levity as Nightwing to an otherwise dark film and it was welcome. None of his sarcastic remarks didn't come off as forced or inappropriate. As for the villains; though Mark Hamill will always remain my favorite, John DiMaggio was funny and lethal as the Joker, one of my favorite scenes being when he and Black Mask are in the prison cell. Though I felt out of place (I was watching this with my family) when I started laughing with all the dead guys lying around. I'm a very morbid person. Jason Isaacs was great as Ra's al Ghul and I almost wish (the key word being almost) that he had done the voice for Batman: TAS. Though he and Batman are enemies, he had no intention of Robin dying and he revived Robin with, I think anyway, good intentions (though even he should've realized that the Lazarus Pit would drive Jason crazy). Wade Williams, while good as Black Mask, seemed over the top. With all the yelling and screaming, I had very hard time of thinking of him as a threat. Again, the interpretation seen in The Batman was done very well, an unknown person with a very large organization, who had a deep gravelly voice supported the mystery behind that skull.<br /><br />The Jonah Hex short I wasn't too crazy about. All power to those who do like the character though, this is just my opinion but outside of his appearances in Batman and JLU, he didn't come off to me as an impressive character. Also judging by the live action film that was just released, it didn't look all that impressive, for the Wild West, there sure were a lot of explosions (and it had Megan Fox, which also probably didn't help it). It did have some good points though, the animation was great and the voice cast was good.that skull.    The Jonah Hex short I wasn't too crazy about.

B003E48AYC|5.0|I pre-ordered this in the 3-disc Edition and it was in my hand barely a day after the release date. It was in perfect condition without cracks or smudges (I was worried it might be damaged in transit). As for the movie itself, I love Burton films and this is a gem! Good value.
0634022296|4.0|The book is fine as a resource, but it has been assembled under the assumption that the songs will be played on a guitar; the transcriptions account for The Beatles' capo'ing their guitars during the songs' recordings, and so present the chords relative to the capo, rather than presenting the originally-recorded chords. For guitarists, this is certainly a useful shortcut, but if you play (as I do) on a ukulele, and want to play the originally-recorded chords, you're forced to re-transpose, noting the number of frets the guitar has been capo'd and transposing each chord down accordingly.
0375507256|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this novel whiched weaved the lives of disparate but amazingly interesting protaganists.  Simultaneously a work of historical fiction, comedy, and dystopian sc-fi.  As I read this book I felt that the author was showing me a window into what makes up civilization: empathy, cruelty, absurdity.  Many parts of the novel I thought were profound - as if I were attending a philosophical discussion on life, love, and choices with a very \\"lern'd\\" teacher.  Since I am new to this author I look forward to his other novels now.

B00064X3BI|5.0|Was somewhat reluctant to buy this because the Clapton stuff of this period isn't exactly audiophile material.  But I do love some of the songs so when it popped up on sale I took a chance.  On my setup (2 channel SACD only so no surround mix) this sounds excellent- about as good a sound as I think is possible with the material.  It is very smooth and some might see that as a lack of bite and impact.  To me it is what the music calls for.  It went into my player and stayed there for about two weeks which is always the sign of great music and great sound.
B001EO748M|1.0|We purchased this disc set and when it came in the mail we opened it up and it had two disc 2's and no disc 1.  So we reported it to Amazon, got it returned, and then exchanged (very quickly and effeciently I might add).  Got the second order in the the mail and it too had only two disc 2's and no disc 1.  I was very dissapointed that they would come that way and that it obviously was not a mishap the first time.  So I had to end up returning the second order and ordering it through another distributer.     I love Amazon and will still shop here, dont get me wrong. But it is sad that I cannot get a hold of someone from Amazon to inform them of the defect of this particular disc set.     Owell hope everyone reads my review.
B000A78Z82|4.0|Every once in a while, a record creeps up on me.  This one, I bought a couple of years ago, listened to it once or twice, and thought \\"meh...what's all the hype about?\\".    Fast forward a couple of years, and I'm rifling through my endlessly disorganized piles of CDs, looking for something else, and I come across \\"Cripple Crow\\" in one of the stacks.  I think to myself \\"...wait, I don't remember buying that; but I guess I did...I do remember it got all kinds of critical praise...\\".      I didn't find the CD I was actually looking for (big surprise!), but I took \\"Cripple Crow\\" with me in the car, and as I listened to it in its entirety, I was blown away.      Some people complain about Banhart's vocal stylings.  While there are other influences, Marc Bolan's influence comes through strongest, at least on \\"Cripple Crow\\".    Mr. Banhart's first name is Hindi influenced.  For those familiar with Hinduism, one of its main tenets is karma and reincarnation.  Seems to me Marc Bolan's karma was good enough for him to be reincarnated into the body of Devendra Banhart.    He's been labeled everything from \\"freak folk\\" to \\"neo folk\\", to \\"neo hippie\\" and a bunch of other things.  Label Mr. Banhart's music anyway you want, but it has a mystical, playful feel about it, and it's great stuff.

B002ZG995E|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect with this movie> I was completely blown away. My husband and I both absolutely loved it! Sharlto Copley surprised us more than anyone. I liked the guy in District 9 but didn't really see him as Murdock. He was superbly manic.<br />Liam rarely has a miss and he was dead on balls Hannibal. Bradley is gorgeous as usual and Rampage held his own as well. It's just a fun, crazy action movie. That's what I expect from The A-Team....
0061703087|3.0|I read it to the end (which is saying something) but didn't really think it was that good. I was left thinking it was intended as the skeleton on which to base a movie, or at least written with that hope in mind. I have to admit, I probably wouldn't have thought this if I didn't already know of Michael Crichton's relationship with Hollywood. I also knew Crichton was sympathetic towards the Men's Movement before picking this up.<br /><br />I will say this book was very frightening. Rather than creating the fear, I think Crichton is tapping into something that is already there. He's building upon previous dramas and scenes we've all seen before at the movies which have frightened us - if he is not tapping into fears we have in the real world. I remember being frightened by the movie 'War of the Worlds'. . . it frightened me even more the second time I watched it. I wanted to be afraid. Perhaps it was some kind of therapy.<br /><br />The story definitely has it's moments. When the main character finally connects with his wife (or ex-wife - can't remember) - it felt very real to me. It was a very powerful scene - it was a very moving part of the story. Perhaps just for this, the book deserves 5 stars. As a work of literature I suspect this particular story struggles to earn 3 stars. I have felt this 'connection' or whatever before (no laughing at me, now). It's seems in these movies and stories with alien intelligences or with our machines turning against us, there's something there that can re-affirm our humanity. The story, 'I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream' did this too? - been a long time since I've read the story. The most effective I've seen this done on screen is in an Outer Limits episode, 'The Human Operators' - just occurred to me writing this review the sly possible double-meaning in the episodes title.<br /><br />Thinking back about the story (and thinking about things like the setting for some of the action scenes) and reading some of the plot synopsis's, this reaffirms my opinion 'Prey' was written with the big screen in mind. I imagine this story will be made into a block buster one day. . . 'Prey'n 'Prey' was written with the big screen in mind. I imagine this story will be made into a block buster one day. . . 'Prey'

B0021L8V0M|3.0|For some reason, I didn't like this movie as well as I thought I would. The character of Salt changes her personality and looks three times, and I couldn't tell what she was supposed to be, because the movie is pretty confusing. In the beginning, she seems like a damsel in distress, and then later she turns into an action star. While interrogating a Russian defector, he mentions that Evelyn Salt is a Russian spy. The CIA believe it to be true, so she escapes and tries to find her husband to make sure he's safe. During the Vice President's funeral, the Russian President will be assassinated unless Salt can stop it. If you like action movies, you might like SALT!!!

Bought Horses vinyl practically the minute it came out, have all her good albums, read her work, saw her art, enthusiastically attended two out of three of concerts.  Loved Robert Mapplethorpe's flower photography, and really enjoyed Patricia Morrisoe's biography \\"Mapplethorpe.\\"<br /><br />That said, this book felt overly-reverent and all too serious to be a tale of two kids with New York City as their playground.  Tell me, where is the fun?  Where is the humor?  Damn, if I could find any.

B0002O7XWC|5.0|Dennis Hopper's recent passing was the final straw in a decades-old interest in seeing this film. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was blown away by this film. We all know the story - a couple of hippie bikers ride out on a west-to-east cross-country tour to retire in Florida after a lucrative drug deal. Along the way, they run into about every permutation of hippie life in the 1960s - commune livers, idealist back-to-earthers, heavy druggers, free-lovers and the like. And they also run into a not-so-nice slice of \\"regular\\" America as well. Racists, hippy-haters, long-hair loathers, corrupt cops, prostitutes and swamp dwellers round out what passes for normal in the movie's vision of America.<br /><br />What amazed me about the film is that it worked as an insightful allegory of the path of the hippy movement - while the hippy movement was in full swing. The film was shot in early 1968 - before the assassinations of MLK and Bobby, the Chicago riots and the election of Richard Nixon had soured the counterculture. So it was wild to see the film suggest the fatuity of the movement, its self-contradictions (back to Nature + smoke/drink/pill-pop your brains out) and its eventual rejection by society at large.<br /><br />Great performances by the stars. Peter Fonda was the suave and  mellow side of the youth culture. Decked in a leather jacket emblazoned with an American flag, he was the naïve intellectual, trying everything and finding everything to be interesting and acceptable. Dennis Hopper was the movement's unthinking, manic side - just looking for the next high, the next lay, the next thrill. Jack Nicholson was the film's tragic, realistic voice. With one world in the straight world and one in the wild world of Fonda and Hopper, he was able to see dangers that the other two were oblivious to.<br /><br />The 35th anniversary edition is one of the very few movies whose \\"making of\\" segments were worth watching. Using interviews with Fonda, Hopper and others, it tells the story of the disarray of filming the movie and the struggle to get it on screen. Hopper's original cut came in at a mind-bending 3-1/2 hours long. Luckily, wiser hands wrested editorial control from him and gave us the masterpiece we have now.<br /><br />\\"Easy Rider\\" - a great film, a fine period piece and an extraordinary commentary on a lost generation of seekers and dreamers.array of filming the movie and the struggle to get it on screen.

B0000C23DO|5.0|This represents the best of the greatest band ever. Now if I was just getting into the dead this is where I would recommend starting because live dead is where its truly at but that may be more difficult for beginners to get into. This collection is the best there is when compared to other studio dead best of collections. If I could only own one cd this may be the one simply for the variety of songs and the best songs ever by the best band ever.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|Every time a band makes a new album it is like having a new child and therefore must be evaluated as such (different). This album is amazing. I understand that some people may think that the Black Keys have strayed from their roots because of the different energy that this album vibes but, almost every track moves me. The track \\"Unknown Brother\\" is in its own right a legendary ballad. ROCK ON BLACK KEYS!!!
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Every song on this album is wonderful and brilliant.  The music and the lyrics burst with emotion and musical genius like I have not heard in a very long time.  The next step is for me to figure out a way to see them live.
0393072231|5.0|Michael Lewis would probably be a lot richer if he had continued working on Wall Street but we would have missed out on his exceptional talents as an author. I suspect he is also happier person as an author than a bond salesman. The Big Short is an all around fantastic book and will satisfy most readers. It is entertaining, well written and even suspenseful. Lewis tells the story of various characters, who although not well known, nevertheless played a substantial role in the housing bust. Lewis creates suspense and urges the reader to continue reading to find out what happens to these interesting  characters.     What makes The Big Short  a solid 5 star book is not just that it was pleasant to read. I have read several books on the financial crisis and the housing collapse, but none compare to the Big Short in clarity. Readers will gain deep understanding about what led to the 2008 recession. Financial instruments like CDOs, Credit Default Swaps, Alt-A bonds are explained clearly without boring the reader. After all, these exotic financial instruments and the people who invented them played a major role in the economic downturn.  Lewis does not merely explain macroeconomic factors but gives you a picture of what was going on years before that led to the collapse. And he does all this while entertaining you! There is not much more a reader can ask for. This is an exceptional book and I highly recommend it.
B00026ZG10|3.0|The movie is about a husband who is secretly a spy in a clark kent kinda way with his wife and teenage daughter. They have no idea that he is a superhero who can combat crime at a moments notice. Unfortunately his family life suffers, it is humdrum and completely the opposite to who he is when in his role as another James Bond, differing by having brute strength and loyalty to his little homemaker wife. A spin on that agent image, normally the cool cat with all the material comforts, not Harry. He is just a boring husband and pretty absent dad to his daughter. They love him but their life lacks sparkle and excitement. His wife does something to change Harry's demeanor and he is obsessed in his desire to capture back his wife's happiness in life and their marriage. They end up finding out about each other even if it is somewhat unbelievable. They gain adventure together and put imagination and fun in their marriage and family. The things I like about this film, I think being a spy would be a thrilling kind of life, the travel and all the neat inventions that are used in gaining access to information, and the style and polish that are a part of this role, at least how it is seen in films. The creative way Harry involves his wife in a pretend adventure that goes over the top into real life danger, the meeting at a swanky upscale hotel with a hot dance played out by Jamie Lee with comedy, and the ability to be in love with another and bring back color into a family that had lost its ability to shine and connect.
B003UYV08E|2.0|this movie without a doubt was a huge dissapointment.I heard a rumor before the movie even came out to theatres that it was suppose to be as good as a sequel like the the dark knight was to batman begins.That was a lie Iron man 2 starts out good showing what has progressed since the first movie and entices us with an awesome battle at a race track with whiplash but falls flat after that.The movie should have been called tony stark instead of iron man 2 because he was iron man about only 3 times or 4x in the movie. The first iron man is better and has moaction than the sequel which is ridiculous.But  the acting overall was good and scarlett johansen fight at the last 15 minutes in the movie was very well choregraphed and executed. A 2 star sequel could have been more but didnt accomplish what the film the dark knight directed by Christopher nolan did.

B0036T31YY|4.0|I stumbled on this one on another online movie site and based on the 4 out of 5 stars, figured I had nothing to lose but time. Turns out, it's a really good movie. Very dark Twilight Zone-esque sort of plot with mind bending twists and turns that are sure to leave you asking questions. As soon as you think you know what is happening, the plot takes another sharp turn. If you liked the original Twilight Zone, you'll definitely enjoy this one.
030726999X|2.0|What a let down! Take everything bad about the first two books (which in the end I loved) and crank it up to 11. Yes, the first two books seemed to plod along slowly sometimes. Both of them took a couple of hundred pages to get going, but once they did you were in for quite a ride. Hornet's nest picks right up where Fire left off... literally minutes later. The problem is it never really gets going. Instead of another mystery/thriller we're dragged along as Blomkvist and the police uncover the secret history of The Section - a history that is already laid out for the reader in the first 100 pages. Larsson keeps us clued in from the beginning, which isn't a good thing.  There are no real surprises and the \\"climax\\" ends up being nothing but another rehash of everything we already know.
0062515675|3.0|Although there are many many better books on this subject, and many are quoted in this one, I think Robin Sharma has done a good job creating a sort of \\"cliffs notes\\" to what it takes to begin to become self-aware and self-directed.  If you have never been introduced to these topics before, this is a simple (if cheesy) and easy to read introduction.      This book is not meant for anyone who has already delved deep into the subject of self mastery - you will find it simplistic and clichéd.
1416562605|4.0|I really enjoyed \\"The White Tiger.\\"  For me it was very reminiscent of the film, \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" in that it showed a side of India that many westerners to not get to see, as well as the efforts of various people to escape from livesof extreme poverty and violence.  While both \\"The White Tiger\\" and \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" showed extremes of both bleakness and humor, I found \\"The White Tiger\\" to be the more \\"realistic\\" and, ultimately, the more satisfying work of art, in that it does not have the artificial \\"feel good\\" quality of the film.  (And, BTW, I LOVE \\"Slumdog Millionaire.\\")
0385504225|1.0|One of the worst books I have ever read, and that's saying a lot.  DVC and A&D were pretty good books for their genre, but the utter stupidity of this one just blew me away.  What a waste of time and money!  It dragged on forever ... there were moments I wanted to literally pull my hair out because the scene just dragged on and on, with no real purpose.  This will certainly be the last book I read by Dan Brown.
B003VB5D84|1.0|First let me say that I paid $12.50 to see this in the theater for a July 27th, one show only theatrical release. I hope that $12.50 will save some of you some money because this is dreadfull, at least the thirty or so minutes I could endure. I had to leave before I was completely mind-numbed. I admire what Mr. Clapton is doing here and he deserves better performances than what he got. I am not reviewing his intentions but the product.  Let me start with Jimmy Vaughan. Jimmy is hanging around with these guitar players by virtue of his brother having been a very good guitar player. Jimmy is NOT a very good guitar player, he might make a mediocre garage band guitar player someday with practice but that day isn't today and he has no business on the stage with Robert Cray,(in fact I believe I saw Robert Cray chuckle at some of Jimmy's \\"licks\\") he is an even worse singer and is so completely out of touch with the guitar and it's nuances that he probably should not be allowed to own a guitar. Was that capo on the third fret so you could play the I-IV-V progression in G without having to learn barre chords or was it to let you play open string single note solos, either way it clearly illustrated your shortcomings as a guitarist. I will however commend EC for letting you hang with the big boys though, very charitable.  Next: ZZ Top: Guys, you could have phoned that performance in, Billy and Dusty usually put on a good show and Billy Gibbons always has some catchy licks and riffs up his sleeve, not this time. It was a flat and frankly boring performance. Nice jackets though!  Doyle Bramhall: When Hendrix stood against his amp and coaxed some feedback it was new, When Pete Townsend did it, it was exciting. When every other guitarist that ever watched the movie \\"Montery Pop\\" did it, it was noise. It is still noise. We are underwhelmed. Ever wonder why there aren't schools for guitar feedback? Because it is noise, no one likes it except the self centered ego driven \\"guitarists\\"that are making the noise. Want to break new ground, try something beyond a I-IV-V progression. Anyone can do loud. Unfortunately I didn't stay for Earl Klugh, I hope you did Doyle because you are the one who finally pushed me over the edge. I guess I just don't get you, I don't understand the hype.  I also didn't stay for Jeff Beck, a guitarist I truly do admire. I did notice that a good number of the really virtuoso guitarists were not in attendance this year or at least not in the film and that's where the money is to be made or lost. There is a lot more to guitar than the blues. I am certain that the concert must have gotten better, it would almost have to, but I just couldn't watch and listen any longer, it was that bad and it went on for a long time.  Clapton had said this would be the last \\"Crossroads\\" but then changed his mind after his closing jam with Stevie Winwood. Eric, with all due respect, it will be MY last.

B00003CX8N|5.0|Name this tale a story of long-distance correspondence that develops into a loving friendship, in the days before email messages, jpg images or the World Wide Web. Or name it a story of love restrained by the virtues of honesty, loyalty and well-considered passion.<br /><br />Anne Bancroft, playing the role of real-life, New York City author Helene Hanff, does the character true justice; for Hanff was no genteel, flirtatious lady. In fact, many times as I watched this film, I wanted to scream out loud, \\"Be softer! The man to whom you're writing is a man constrained by polite convention! Better, though, that Bancroft played the woman Hanff was: a sometimes coarse, but always intelligent and warmhearted woman.<br /><br />I've oftentimes considered Anthony Hopkins to be a Richard Burton wannabe, not in the sense of Burton's explosive display of rage on the screen, but in the way Hopkins sometimes tries too hard to seem the epitome of the \\"Great British Actor.\\" But over time I've come to respect Hopkins ability to convey the heat that runs through a character who is trapped within himself. In this sense, Hopkins seems perfect for the role of Frank Dole, London bookseller. The viewer understands that Hanff and Dole fall in love with each other -- their mutual taste in books being the the artery of conveyance -- but Frank is a loyal and faithful married man. The tension thus created is delicious.<br /><br />Add to the actors' superior capabilities the film's post-WWII setting, and the result is one of lushness.<br /><br />This story stays with me, as do the tears that it elicited.
1569382603|5.0|Following his groundbreaking book, Fingerprints of the Gods, Graham Hancock reinforces his persuasive evidence for the existence of a Lost Civilization that predates what are conventionally considered the first great civilizations. (Also recommended is Hancock's book, Heaven's Mirror, which elaborates the subject with photos and fascinating text).  Pointing to the sudden appearance of advanced cultures in widely dispersed locations around the globe, which shared an obsession with astronomical knowledge, megalithic architecture and cultural/religious similarities, Hancock speculates that these cultures may share an earlier, common ancestry.  While Hancock states that the attribution of unexplained achievements by \\"primitive\\" cultures to alien visitors \\"doesn't work for me,\\" he builds an impressive mountain of evidence that is ignored by orthodox \\"paleo-sciences\\" of all kinds.  He does not propose his own answers beyond comments identified as conjecture, but the whole program is aimed at positing the existence of a lost, earlier civilization, and insisting that further research is justified and necessary if we are to know the truth.<br /><br />  The photography, by Hancock's wife, Santha Faiia, is often stunning and the sound track adds to the mood of mystery and wonder.<br /><br />  I highly recommend this program to anyone with an open mind and curiosity over why these early civilizations suddenly appeared, with technological and astronomical sophistication lacking any evidence of preceding evolution and development.<br /><br />  After viewing this program, if you haven't already done so, read \\"Fingerprints of the Gods.\\"  It's teriffic!
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This video will change the way you look at food. It will also alert you to how we are being taken advantage of by the large food producers. They look at us just about the same way they look at a beef cow. The ominous revelation of one multi-national company taking control of all the seeds in the world and crushing anyone who stands in their way is breath-taking. The callous disregard of small children dying of e-coli in favor of relaxed inspections and regulations for the sake of profits is painfully shown through the eyes of a conservative Republican mother turned food safety activist. All it took for her was the death of her two-year old son to learn the hidden story.    Although some have accused the film makers of left-leaning bias, an independent study of the facts will confirm their even-handed treatment of the subject.    Wake up and tell others.

B002ZG980U|4.0|I've loved every Christopher Nolan movie I've ever seen from Memento to The Dark Knight but Inception left me a bit unsatisfied. My main issue is the same issue that many people had with the Matrix movies in that there are no well defined rules under which the movie operates. I will attempt as best I can to avoid any spoilers but it's hard when talking about the mechanics of the movie.<br /><br />As one might tell from the previews and articles on Inception it's about delving into dreams. Using technology and drugs Leonardo DiCaprio and his crew are able to inject themselves into peoples dreams in order to extract information for things like industrial espionage. In order to accomplish this they use an architect to construct the logistics of the dream in a way to best accomplish their task. Death in a dream wakes the dreamer. Also, there is a severe time dilation since a dream moves as fast as the human mind rather than as fast as the real world so minutes of sleep can produce hours of dreams. The plot centers around DiCaprio attempting to produce an inception. An inception is the implantation of an idea into a subject's brain while convincing them that it is their own idea. Apparently this is a very difficult task and requires a three level dream within a dream within a dream as well as the use of heavy sedatives. Having a three layer dream will produce an even greater level of time dilation and I as best as I can remember DiCaprio said that as far as the dreamers were concerned this process would take what appears to them to be ten years despite sleeping only around ten hours. This time dilation was apparently important enough that Ellen Page repeated it for emphasis and the thought of this being a ten year operation was pretty intriguing. So where are the problems?<br /><br />Again, I'm trying to avoid spoiler but I will reveal some smaller plot points to make my argument. The target of the inception will be a wealthy heir played by Cillian Murphy who played The Scarecrow in the Batman movies. Things immediately go wonky when it becomes obvious that Murphy's character has been trained to resist invasions into his mind and he immediately launches a counter attack by his sub conscious represented by armed assailants. The next problem is that DiCaprio's group used a sedative that's so powerful that if someone is killed in the dream rather than wake they will descend into a severely time dilated abyss where their mind will be trapped for decades likely driving them insane. I would assume the movie is taking place in Murphy's dream which I guess would give him an edge. Murphy seemed only capable of fighting them subconsciously and didn't even recognize the armed assailants as representatives of his own psyche. What I couldn't figure out was since the attackers were his subconscious everything must be representational rather than real. What did a bullet through the chest represent? Was it a successful domination of will? If someone is shot but lingers does that mean that the two are locked in some kind of mental battle of wills. From my experience if I'm shot in dream I could be perfectly fine in a moment but in this movie wounds seem to be as permanent as an injury in the real world. In fact, besides the occasional tilting of the world and loss of gravity at one point there didn't seem to be much difference between the dream world and the real world. I have no idea whether Cillian Murphy's sub conscious guards were horrible shots or if this was part of a dream. It seems hard to believe that several people opening up with heavy automatic weapons on a stationary van could miss with every bullet. The last big issue was that this so called time dilation seemed only to occur at times where it was convenient to the plot. Not only did the operation not take a purported ten years I would estimate that start to finish it took maybe two to four hours a most which means it was actually less time than the ten hours that they had Cillian Murphy available. Yet at one particular important plot point an event that would have taken only a few seconds allowed them I would estimate 45 minutes or so of apparent time. There was no consistency. Last but not least was how relentless the action was once things kicked up and there was this ever present heavy musical score.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan has had such a consistent track record of great movies that even a good movie like Inception felt disappointing. The acting and casting are fantastic, the special effects are brilliant and there are tons of plot threads with powerful emotional impacts but I just couldn't get past the fact that the general plot felt lazy.phy available.

B000008IAI|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite Wings albums...I've been looking for this on CD for years and luckily I found a used copy in excellent condition on Amazon.com.  This double album has some of Wings' greatest hits along with a few obscure cuts...they also sprinkle in some classic Beatles stuff for good measure.  Not withstanding the great song selection, this is one of the best live albums ever recorded...the sound quality is amazing and the songs are in some cases better than the original studio cuts.  A great album for any die hard Paul McCartney fan...highly recommend.

Although he learned the art of saying \\"Om\\" and became the epitome of Braham, he was not happy and his curiosity was not satisfied. In order to find his true self, he decided to join Samanas. He became a business man, learned art of sex, became a rich man, lost everything, and became a ferry man. He finally understood that he knows that money is not important from the beginning, but in order to understand it, he has to be a rich man and a business man to experience such nauseated life. For me, Siddhartha is more sacred than Gotama the Buddha.
0894803123|5.0|This is a great little ice cream book. I saw a lot of criticism that they use raw eggs in their ice cream recipe but that is how most ice cream is made. I wouldn't recommend using whole eggs because they can be easily contaminated but buy that egg that is in the little milk carton and use that instead. I think it is called Egg beaters. Those are goign to be free of contaminants and the ice cream will taste fab! The recipes are great starting places and I pretty much just use the basic recipe not and do my own thing. Strawberry is my favorite though. It is also a good little book to tell you the history of Ben and Jerry's. An interesting read.
B0019HQIFE|5.0|I recently bought this blu ray concert. He's the newest guitar hero, the John Mayer performance in this concert live in LA is absolutely incredible. I have followed John Mayer from his musical beginnings. I can recommend especially the first piece, where he plays acoustic guitar with great talent and personality. Another excellent piece is Out of my mind, where he demonstrates a great mastery of the electric guitar. Others especials songs are: gravity, vultures, etc. This concert is simply spectacular, all the songs show something special that we liked. So don't hesitate to buy this spectacular concert, the production quality and audio are awesome, you will not regret.

B003OF3R0S|4.0|On previous a7x albums, I found the songs to be fun. Bordering on party rock. For obvious reasons, the new record is very somber. The sound is much fuller. Not a knock on The Rev but Portnoy has a much more organic style whereas The Rev was more mechanical and I tend to think he used triggers. Portnoy does not appear to. With that said, a7x is now a completely different band. There are fewer hard rock/metal songs and many more orchestra backed ballads or slow jams. The guitar solos are subdued to a degree as the focus seems to be less on how great Synyster Gates is and more on how great a song writer The Rev was. Nobody sounds like a7x. that says something in this day and age of copycats and spoon fed pop.     This record was necessary and it is a total success for the band. The songs keep getting bigger and bigger with each record and to me, that is a good thing. Matt shadows uses many different voices on the new record as well. Obviously he has to take up the slack left by the Rev and I think they should have done this from the start. Again, not to knock the Rev but the high pitch screams are gone and the songs are better for it. Replaced is a deep death growl. Matt sounds like Randy Blythe on \\"Gods Hates Us\\". \\"Fiction\\" is the one song that just grabs you. So sad yet hopeful at the same time (seems like it is just a C and F chord). It is a beautiful song you can see played in a chamber hall with a huge orchestra.     Nightmare is very much a rebirth of the band. It is like a letter to the fans stating they are OK and will make it through. Yet is a fitting tribute to a fallen band member. I think this is the beginning of great things to come from the band and I hope they continue in this direction. Unlike many of today's albums, the new a7x is great for repeat listens. There is depth and much to take from each song and eveytime I hear them, new sounds are revealed. Great job guys- arguably a top 5 record of the year so far.
B003LAH7MU|2.0|Contains the worst rendition of Roxanne I have ever heard.  The orchestra helps enhance a couple of the songs, but not sure this was worth the effort of a whole new CD.
B000002UB2|4.0|EMI/Capitol Records, the same label that shortchanged the Beatles, making millions around the world on the backs of the Fab Four, and paying them (taxable) pennies on the Pound. Such was the depth of the penny pinching stinginess that the band put their trust on the charlatan \\"Magic Alex\\", who in the end, cost The Beatles 300,000 Pounds (about $3Million Pounds today) - to build them a brand new state of the art 72 track recording studio. It is little wonder then, that albums such as \\"Let It Be' brim with anger, insecurity and defeat - leading a short time to \\"Abbey Road\\", a more polished effort and in a way (and forgive me fans): sterile. This is not to take away from the music itself, but by then they were no longer a band - McCartney attempting to take over the group via a coup d'Etat,and  shortchanging his band members by secretly buying a larger share of the music publisher that owned their songs, and brutally repressing any input by George (though in the case of Ringo, it is perfectly understandable). Capitol Records has milked the Fab Four legacy with their inept and overall stupid compilation releases, which only made people such as Allen Klein exponentially rich, while starving the band of their dues. If you must have this album, go for the 2009 remaster, not for the rehash/retread of the 1995 release.
B003A4IFGY|1.0|Except for one song this album does not rock.  A sleepy, drifty, bluesy put you to sleep album.  If you want an album by this artist that really rocks this is not it.  Don't listen to this in a long drive or you will end up on the side of the road asleep.

B003HE2B6C|4.0|Wow, Taylor Hansen has really grown up! First earlier with \\"Tinted Windows\\", which I think was in the car CD player for atleast two months straight, and now with this very smooth Hansen disc, \\"Shout It Out\\". The mood of the music is way cool and soothing. The bluesy, jazzy feel captures a vibe never before heard from these brothers. But it's the ballads from Taylor that have you putting the \\"repeat\\" button on. He is a vocal genius, and haunting stylist. I am currently waiting for Bret Michaels newest in the mail, and until then (maybe even after), I'll have Shout It Out in its rightful place (unless I get that Tinted Windows urge again). Listen to the music!!
032147404X|3.0|This book can be quite useful as a learning tool for budding photographers.  It is frustrating to read, however, mainly due to the countless time-wasting \\"gotchas\\".  I was immediately annoyed to learn that he lied about the term \\"tack sharp\\" in the opening chapter.  He said: \\"TACK stands for Technically Accurate Cibachrome Kelvin, and SHARP stands for Shutter Hyperfocal At Refracted Polarization\\".  Now this may seem like technical terms, but it was actually all made up.  There are countless, plainly stupid gotchas like this all over the book.  Half the time you spend reading this book will be wasted on these not-so-funny, lame, jokes.      I also do not like the tone of the book.  For example, the author simply tells you to shoot landscape only in around sunrise and sunset.  (He then proceed to tell a lame joke about Joe McNally killing a person who dared to break this rule with a tripod).  This may be the norm in professional circle, but I think a beginning photographer may want to at least explore during day time.  In other books, the author generally patiently explains the different results from different lighting condition.  While they tend to urge the reader to shoot during twilight, they also give helpful tips on what to do should you want to shoot in broad daylight.      This book is a time waster, go buy Understanding Exposure and The Photographer's Eye. Both books are awesome and they do not waste your time with senseless jokes.
B003J27WFW|5.0|I can't really say much more than the other reviewers who have contributed so much awesome detail. I think this documentary was awesome, specifically because it focuses on the lives of artists. As fans, our heads are already in the music. Although, it's a treat to see the nuggets of Rush's performance and studio footage from their beginnings to their current efforts.    The part that really drew me in was honest commentary from Geddy, Alex, and Neil about the keyboard-heavy albums (Signals - Hold Your Fire) . Often regarded the underdog in the band (not sure why?), it's obvious that the keyboard-heavy era for Rush may not have been easy for Alex, even though Geddy remembers it with fondness, and Neil...well - he was pretty diplomatic about it, saying that you have to be careful not to go to far in any direction.    One of the things that originally drew me to Rush were the keyboards. Back in '89, a high school friend introduced me to Rush by letting me borrow A Show of Hands and Presto. I was blown away by the amount of well-composed synthwork and textures, and further amazed by the fact that these guys somehow coordinated this with playing guitar, bass, and drums. I would literally sit in my room for hours listening to those albums (on cassette...), and learning the keyboard parts and trying to reproduce the sounds as I programmed my synth. Yea, I was hoping to get into a Rush cover band - I was young and naive.    When I went to college, I'd started accumulating a little Rush collection both on vinyl and cassettes. I had Moving Pictures and Signals on vinyl. My eyes were opening even more to the awesomeness of Rush. Then a friend let me borrow Hemispheres. That is an album where you lay back and listen, and you need to wear headphones to catch the details. I think I listened to it straight through 5x in one weekend.    Ok back to the documentary...it was even more fascinating to hear from Rush's management and production team. They confirmed my sentiments about the direction Rush had taken with the keyboard-heavy sound. By Roll The Bones, I really felt like a lot of their songwriting was watered down and borderlining on a smooth-jazzy slightly rock/funky sound, and the albums where sounding thinner. Gone was the fat sound of previous albums. I felt sort of vindicated when producer Rupert Hine shared those sentiments, saying Rush's recordings needed more \\"balls\\". Wake-up call.    I really didn't hear the restoration of the girthier sound until Vapor Trails. They said it happened on Counterparts, but I didn't hear it. I still heard Neil's cracky, thinly mixed drums. I don't know if that's a producer thing or if Neil is just adamant about having a cracky thin drum sound with loads of reverb. The drums have to slam. The drums are make-or-break when it comes to a fatter sound.     In more recent albums, Rush has nixed the keys and replaced them with more layering and background vocals. I have to admit, I am bummed about that. It's all about finding a balance. I felt like they had that balance on Signals. It was a meaty sounding album with a tasteful amount of synthwork - just enough to say, hey, we're in the 80's now.    Anyway, it's possible I could write a book about Rush's career, however Beyond The Lighted Stage is definitely the best venue for a band's biography that I've ever seen.    The really cool thing about Beyond the Lighted Stage was that it made me passionate about listening to Rush again. I'd burnt myself out listening to them.I hadn't picked up a Rush vinyl, cd, or cassette in over a decade. Now, I'm building a Rush mix for my iPod, and I am psyched. Listening to Rush really gave me a keen ear for detail in music, not to mention their music has stretched me as a musician. Knowing more about their lives makes all of that a little more personal.    Even if you're not a Rush fan, get BTLS if you're a musician and want to immerse yourself in the journey of a rock band who has been around for over 30 years, and still haven't sold out.

1423121708|5.0|Greek mythology has moved to the America's largest cities in the world, creating all new heroes, monsters and adventures in the heart of the country.  Percy Jackson is just one of those new heroes, a half-blood (half human half god), trying to make his way in the world that he soon finds out is not as normal as he thought.    Percy is the modern Hercules, first discovering he is half god after being forced to attend the Half-Blood summer camp when it is too dangerous for him to live in the outside world.  Gods exist, and the famous Mount Olympus has taken station right in Percy's backyard: the Empire State Building.  Percy quickly discovers he is meant for greatness, forced onto a quest to save the world with Athena's daughter Annabeth, and the comical satyr, Grover.  Zeus's famous lightning bolt has been stolen and Percy and his friends must get it back, otherwise the gods will be forced to fight amongst themselves creating a World War III.  Thus he travels cross-country, encountering various monsters and famous American monuments, to get to Los Angeles where the entrance to the Underworld currently resides.    I enjoyed seeing every new mythological creature or Greek god that showed up, and how they were portrayed in our current modern world.  Ares, god of war, is a biker while Medusa who turns anyone who looks at her into stone is a sculptor.  Though the situations are dangerous they are also comical, especially if you know the lore behind the creatures.  Percy continues to outsmart those around him, but still has faults (such as not seeing what is really going on until it is almost too late).  Percy and his friends are a good trio, and their interactions are fun to read.    One of the main reasons I hesitated picking up The Lightning Thief, was the huge hype over how wonderful it was.  I was worried I would be painfully disappointed, especially since I am a huge Greek mythology enthusiast, and I just wasn't sure this book was going to meet my expectations.  Letme cut to the chase and say I LOVED this book!  I can't wait to get the next one.

This disc has a printed graphic on one side, handy so that you may easily distinguish this silvery disc from other silvery discs you may own and the other side is print free, making it readable by the previously mentioned CD player.    Once inserted into the CD player the disc will produce music as long as the power is plugged in, turned on and the the \\"play\\" button pressed (it may be labeled with a rectangle on your device, some sort of device will also be necessary to translate the electrical impulses from the CD player into sound however.

Some people will complain that they are able to detect a loss of audio fidelity due to the digitization process but this reviewer either does not have speakers up to this task or his ears are of inferior workmanship (I attempted to contact customer support on this issue but apparently God is out playing golf or something).

The stories contained within this title are:    A Scandal in Bohemia  The Red-Headed League  A Case of Identity  The Boscombe Valley Mystery  The Five Orange Pips  The Man with the Twisted Lip  The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle  The Adventure of the Speckled Band  The Adventure of the Engineer's Thumb  The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor  The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet  The Adventure of the Copper Beeches      This Kindle freebie does NOT include \\"The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes\\", \\"The Return of Sherlock Holmes\\", \\"His Last Bow\\", \\"The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes\\", or the novels, i.e. \\"A Study in Scarlet\\", \\"The Sign of Four\\", \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\", and \\"The Valley of Fear\\".    It is an excellent \\"purchase\\" for readers who would like to enjoy reading about the intrepid Holmes and Watson on their adventures. The formatting is okay, i.e. not excellent but not overly annoying either. As is the case with many other Kindle titles, the Table of Contents is not one which is reader-friendly - one cannot simply click on a particular story to get to it, but has to manually scroll through. I hope this is addressed as more books become available as Kindle titles. On the whole, I have little to complain about, except for the lamentable lack of illustrations. To those who love Sherlock Holmes, I would recommend getting not just the complete stories and if you don't mind a truly bulky (yet beautiful set), I would suggest the annotated set by Leslie S. Klinger,[[ASIN:0393059162 The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes: The Complete Short Stories (2 Vol. Set)]] and [[ASIN:0393065944 The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes, Volume 3: The Novels (A Study in Scarlet, The Sign of Four, The Hound of the Baskervilles, The Valley of Fear) (non-slipcased edition)]].
B0019NG73G|4.0|While I consider this to be one of the finest Civil War movies made, there is a singular opportunity to make it even better. If Ted Turner and group would hire the special effects groups that did say, the Lord of the Rings, and show Picket's charge as it was with the full number of soldiers participating crossing the field and being slaughtered as they truly were, with more realism, with bodies and parts stacking up as they came on, showing an unrelenting view of the battle as it was, and then adding to the film at the end, a small vignette of the reunion (as described in Ken Burns Civil War) where the surviving soldiers in reenacting the charge tearfully throw down their arms and rush out to hug each other, then this could possibly be the one of the best anti-war movies ever made. Carnage is not glorious, and until people see war for what it is, we can never be free of it. And where else to bring it home, to show it, then with Americans against Americans in what is considered one of histories greatest battles.
B000002J0P|5.0|Will there ever be another year like 1969? This album must be embedded in the mind of anyone over 40 years old, but just as fresh today as then. Woodstock brought Crosby, Stills and Nash to a nationwide audience, but they earned their place in the heart with music and lyrics that stayed with you somehow. Have long discarded the cassette, sold off the vinyl to a used record store (bad decision to get rid of all the old LP's) and realized we just couldn't NOT have this album on hand. The remastered \\"older\\" version (without the bonus tracks) was done just beautifully....clear sound (maybe even better?) the liner notes include the WORDS and you can just listen, enjoy and let the good memories of this time come back...it was a year of love and hope / we could use another one.

B000BNI90O|5.0|Howard Shore's Lord of the Rings sountracks are easily the best movie soundtracks since Star Wars (I mean the original trilogy). This is a masterpiece. It combines beautiful, heart-rendering songs (particularly any of the Elves' themes) with great action/adventure scores (the Fellowship theme). The soundtrack has such emotional power that, even without seeing the scenes in the movie, you can just feel what's going to happen.    The Fellowship of the Ring of course defines many of the musical themes used throughout the trilogy (particularly the epic Fellowship theme). Oddly enough, while it lacks the epic scale of ROTK and gentleness of TT, I find that this one is the best of the three for most occasions, whether reading or walking to the subway. There's a great variety of music just in this one movie.     A note: this special edition set is expensive but definitely worth your money. This is the COMPLETE soundtrack from the movie. It has many times the number of tracks and runs at over 3 hours (that's twice as long as most movies today!). Each set also includes a high-quality, DVD version of the tracks.    This soundtrack (and the rest of the trilogy) is destined to become a classic. I know Tolkien would be proud. My only question is whether Howard Shore will produce the Hobbit soundtrack...

B003IWRE3I|2.0|The movie would have been much better if they would have actually gave you a story line or tell what had happened. They didn't really tell you anything. Charlize Theron was in the movie for maybe a total of ten minutes and they never said what happened to her or why she apparently went crazy. Viggo Mortensen is a very good actor, I assumed that he died of some sort of aftermath of an N.B.C. attack. I believe that the situation's and people that he and the boy encountered would be realistic. But that's the only part I could actually give the movie credit for. I feel they could have done much more.

B000FGGE7C|3.0|Still waiting for the UnRated version on BluRay... it's been out on DVD since it's original release.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I really like this show. I wish I actually watched it when it was popular. I started about 8 years too late. Oh well, better late than never. I watched it with some friends and had to get it. This show is funny, and witty. The characters are great you will love pretty much every character, they have their own \\"thing\\" about them that sets them apart yet they all mesh well together. Anyway, the set came in really fast, ALL the DVDs seem to be in excellent condition just by looking at them. I have watched about half of the episodes just to see if there are any scratches or anything and they work excellent, just as described. Of course I didn't really doubt the seller, I just needed an excuse to watch all the episodes consecutively like a couch potato. I haven't gotten to the special features yet but am excited to.
B0032VYHY4|3.0|I suggest renting this movie,not buying it. It's a B rated movie and not the best story line.
B00005J6UP|5.0|I have loved this movie for the longest time. I remember watching it as a kid and I always watch it when I get the chance. However, VHS became out of style and ours broke. So I never bought the DVD and secretly hoped I would get it as a gift but I decided to buy it. Great 80s movie, funny, adventurous. Anyway, the movie came in really fast. I ordered three movies at the same time from different sellers and this one actually came first but they were all pretty fast. I received this movie just as described and even though its used it looks as though its never been used.

0307454541|4.0|When I began reading the first of this trilogy by Stieg Larrson I was anticipating a non-stop, jam-packed action story filled with intrigue, suspense and thrills. About half-way through I realized that this would not be the case. Though deceptively slow paced, Larsson pieced together a story that was hard to put down even without the Dan Brown-esque thrills.<br /><br />The strength of the story is without a doubt the characters. Larsson spends a great deal of time introducing the reader to all the major players in his story. The characters are often quirky and one gets the impression from the beginning that all of the have something to hide. It is easy to like the main characters of Blomkvist and Salander from very early on.<br /><br />There were two things about this story that were somewhat annoying. First, Larsson tends to be unnecessarily repetitive about certain details. I found myself wishing he had given the reader more credit in remember key details. The second thing had to do with the ending of the book. I don't want to give too much away, but there is a scene towards the end that is perhaps one of the most suspenseful of the entire story and it gets downplayed in the overall narrative. I'm not sure what the author was attempting to accomplish with this section of the book, but it seemed out of place with the rest of the narrative.<br /><br />Regarding the language, please note that this was originally written in Swedish and later translated to English. At times it is glaringly obvious that the book is a translation, but overall it does not affect the readers flow.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a wonderful, gripping story about several individuals. It is not the Steve Berry or Dan Brown type suspense story that it is sometimes billed as being. I look forward to diving into the other two books in this series in the hopes that they focus more on plot than on the characters.
B0037QGS0A|5.0|This movie is so sexy. Amanda is so beautiful. She doesn't need any line. Her eyes alone can speak for her!  The performance from Julianne Moore and Liam Neeson are great. I kind of disappointed with the ending but I will give 5 stars to any movie with girls making out.    I like this movie. The set is also beautiful. The story is easy to understand and entertaining.
0312382464|5.0|She is a genius author. This is the second of the Welsh Trilogy. The Welsh saga takes a passenger seat to the wonderful tale of Simon De Montfort. This is just a stunning read. Her research is top notch, her development of the characters will stir you,anger you, and break your heart.
B002WY65VU|5.0|Some reviewers have referred to \\"Zombieland\\" as America's answer to the 2004 \\"Shaun of the Dead,\\" a brilliant UK horror comedy set in the post-apocalyptic world. Certainly these two films parody the same genre and it is not surprising that both share some similarities including a simple story about a group of characters desperate to survive, and outrageous (often violent) jokes with lots of gores. But one unique thing about \\"Zombieland\\" is, while it definitely belongs to the ever-growing genre of zombie movies, the film works as a road movie and even a romance too, thank to the well-written main characters.    The story follows the four characters travelling in the zombie-infested USA: \\"Columbus\\" (Jesse Eisenberg), \\"Tallahassee\\" (Woody Harrelson), \\"Wichita\\" (Emma Stone), and her sister \\"Little Rock\\" (Abigail Breslin). A shy college student \\"Columbus\\" is on his way to go back to his home in Columbus, Ohio, when he meets a zombie-hunter \\"Tallahassee\\" going on a quest for Twinkies. They and the con-sisters \\"Wichita\\" and \\"Little Rock\\" team up and travel to a LA amusement park \\"Pacific Playland\\" because, as in some other zombie movies, rumor has it that there are no zombies there.     One of the greatest assets of \\"Zombieland\\" is the four central characters portrayed by the talented players. First-time director Ruben Fleischer with writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick has successfully created interesting and likable characters you relate to. They are not just stock types waiting to be eaten, all bolstered by unanimously good acting from the cast. The filmmakers strike just the right balance between tension and humor, and believe me or not, things sometimes look very sweet even in the land of flesh-eating undeads, thanks to the two females.     As a comedy, the best bit comes in the hilarious Beverly Hills mansion sequence, where a star appears as a cameo, playing himself to tell us what he regrets most in his career. He appears briefly after the end credits, so please don't miss that part.     \\"Zombieland\\" is a fun roller coaster ride with thrills and laughs. It also comes with a nice camerawork (see the stylish slow motion images in the opening, for example). Enjoy it.
B001993Y2C|1.0|As much as I would have liked to enjoy the show on Blu-Ray, it was overshadowed by the fact that it was impossible to remove a Blu-Ray disc from the cardboard packaging without getting fingerprints on the discs.<br /><br />This is by far the worse packaging I have ever encountered for Blu-Ray releases.<br /><br />To add insult to injury, some of the episodes did not play correctly at all. They would stop working and then skip ahead.<br /><br />The blame must go to the manufacturer. I am aware of a new Blu-Ray version of Battlestar Gallactica: The Complete Series is now available, and from what I can tell it is packaged correctly with hard plastic instead of cardboard and should be easier to remove to play.<br /><br />I was very happy that Amazon gave me a refund after all the aggravation I went through.<br /><br />I strongly recommend that you buy the new Blu-Ray version of Battlestar Gallactica: The Complete Series, and skip this one; it's not worth it.
B000F1IQNC|5.0|This movie is destined to become a classic. It is clever, delightful, poignant and visually stunning. Every time I watch it I find something new that I had missed in my previous viewings. It simply has everything -  including a spoonful of quirkiness.     Mary Poppins (which never was my cup of tea) needs to move over; she has met her match with Nanny McPhee.

0971407614|5.0|I learned many useful things from this book. For me it was especially good in making me enter more in the fitness mentality. The chapter on motivation is a masterpiece and convincing, with facts presented to support what he says.  I tried the exercises I was pleasantly surprised: they can really bring your muscles to failure.  The chapter on nutrition has a few not exact things: potatoes that he advise, are not good for a healthy diet. They go together with the bad guys: sugar, bread, white rice that have high glycemic index.  If I could suggest a very beautiful book on nutrition: [[ASIN:0743266420 Eat, Drink, and Be Healthy: The Harvard Medical School Guide to Healthy Eating]]. With this book I completely changed the way I eat.
B000FC2L1Y|4.0|Good writing, seemed far-fetched at times, and at other times I wanted the story to just on with it, but still a good book.
B002ZG977Y|2.0|This movie was basically a hacked up version of the 1980 classic with overdone CGI imagery. The CGI looked too cartoony. Many scenes seemed rushed. No style in them at all.   Such as the stygian witches scene.   They get their answers some weak dialogue and that's it.  I liked in the original how the witch raises her first and screams \\"A Titan against a Titan!\\"   It had emotion and gust.  The acting in this movie was weak and drab.  Movies like this rely too much on special effects.   Medusa looked too cartoony and did not have the creep factor like the original.  The kraken looked too generic and had no unique qualities to it. Also looked cartoony.  Sam Worthington reprises his role as the tough guy who grunts lines and that's it.  Like the movie, no style, no innovation, no emotion.  In sum, this movie was basically an overdone CGI blah-fest.  The design and effect for Hades was the only reason I gave this 2 stars instead of one.  Hades was the only character where the CGI worked and looked effective.
0312370849|2.0|Like several other reviewers I was intrigued by Sarah's story.  If de Rosney had stuck with Sarah and explored her life and developed her character fully this could have been a great book.  Unfortunately, the story alternated from Sarah's story to the totally unbelievable Julia Jarmond character.  It was painful to read the chapters told from her perspective.     * MILD SPOILER ALERT* The last hundred pages or so were particularly tedious.  The constant mention of \\"the child\\", or the \\"baby\\" leading up to the eventual \\"surprise\\" was just insulting and could have been written by a seventh grader.  By the time I was through I wanted to throw this book across the room.

1597801585|4.0|Pros: The Windup Girl is an extremely entertaining read. It has a little bit of everything including action, suspense, romance, spirituality, and politics. Paolo Bacigalupi had me questioning my own morals on life, then the next chapter had my heart racing with intense action scenes.     Cons: It takes a while to get to the really good stuff. There's also a lack of connection between the reader and the characters. This book seems very much like an introduction to a greater idea the author has, and he is only using characters as models to build up to this greater purpose of the world he is creating.    Other thoughts: I think the 5 star wow factor was lost on me for this book due to my lack of understanding of economics and genetics. Whether there is a deeper meaning in this book or not, it is still a highly entertaining read that I would recommend to everyone, not just science fiction fans. The author has a lot of possibilities in the world he has created and I hope he does make a sequel.      Also as a caution, this is definitely a Mature rated book.      There's a short story Paolo Bacigalupi has written that uses the same world and concepts that are in this book. It is available for free at [...]

B002W5UVSM|4.0|Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole is a hard book to describe.  It follows the antics and adventures of one Ignatius J. Reilly.  I saw this book described as a \\"tragicomic\\" and I think that label fits well.  I found the book to be entertaining with a few laugh out loud moments.  However, most of the humor tends to be dark.  This novel is also a colorful look into the world of New Orleans.    Our hero is an overweight, overbearing, intelligent, lazy, philosopher-slob named Ignatius J. Reilly.  He lives with his mother who caters to his every whim.  She eventually forces him to get a job and this novel follows him and those he leaves in his wake during his employment escapades.      More often than not I found Ignatius to be obnoxious in his endeavors to change the world.  He is highly intelligent but has no people skills.  In the end, I had changed my opinion a few times as the story came full circle.  Most of the characters were cartoonish to me.  There are many characters in this book but they all play a part eventually.      There is a lot say about this book and there are many layers to it.  It's part funny and part vulgar, it's funny and sad, it's about people and life in New Orleans.  I'm no expert but I'd say that Toole is a master when it comes to dialogue.  I'm sure I didn't get all the themes and undercurrents but it was a great read and a wonderful book for discussion.
B003L20ICE|1.0|Not only does Hollywood have no more new ideas, but the ones they come up with are just trash!    I cannot believe that anyone would really like this movie, and I must not be alone because it was not released to the masses!  This is border line brain washing. It is clearly another thread to push these values on America. To try to show it is okay and acceptable because we made a movie about it.     I wish I could give it zero stars.     This is truly gutter trash!
030745455X|4.0|I was hesitant at first as to whether I would enjoy this book that had been translated from Swedish into English.  Boy was I ever wrong!  I read the book in just a day and looked eagerly for the next two books that were promised to be available by Amazon.  I read them,too,and they were even  better! The author did a great job!  What a tragedy that he died after writing the third book, at the age of 50+ years.
0143118420|5.0|I have read a variety of intensely negative reviews here on this site and--although I value the opinions of others--I think they are misdirected. Let's not judge whether the facts of her life are true or not true. For one thing, I think every experience she records seems authentic and true-to-life. She worked in Public Relations; so I'm sure she has learned to be good with people and I don't find it hard to believe that she has developed international relationships. I am really enjoying this book, and I think it is enlightening without having to be a tedious read. Is this brainless literature? I don't think so. On the contrary, I think Elizabeth Gilbert has mastered her strong wit enough to provide some substantial literature. I'm sure many would argue, but I know brainless literature (Stephenie Meyer), and this is not it. It is obvious that there are stronger, more prepared writers out there, but Elizabeth Gilbert's confidence and directness in her written work is good enough for me. I have been on retreats with strangers for a mere week and I have managed to meet some interesting characters. It is very likely that Liz has met and related with the people she affectionately regards to in her book, since she was in a Meditation Retreat for a few months. These events in her life are very, very likely. Has she probably over-emphasized and exaggerated some scenarios and events? Probably; but that, my friends (as an effective writer), is her job. I trust her enough to let her shine a bit of light on my own life and help me try to find some meaning. Instead of criticizing her work, I think readers should exercise some compassion, understanding, and awareness. These philosiphies she so strongly embraces are true (read it in any book) and are highly effective to those wishing to find spiritual fulfillment. If you're just going to judge, I say you acknowledge the meaning behind her newfound knowledge instead of bashing her prose and the credibility of her work.
B001KVZ6G6|4.0|I had not seen this movie before we watched it as a whole family.  It's a very beautiful story but it does contain peril.  Hours after watching this movie my daughter had a nightmare that her mother died and it really bothered her.  Otherwise the movie is amazing and the 4 disc set is really cool too!
0547260695|4.0|I bought this book as sort of treat to myself & my son, who is only five months old, since it was on sale at a closing book store. I worried that it wouldn't live up to the price tag, but decided that since it was unabridged, it was worth it simply as an over-sized edition of The Little Prince.<br /><br />However, the pop up illustrations really are worth the price of admission, & more! They are the original illustrations, brought to life beautifully. Some are more impressive than others, & a few have flimsy pieces or points that I worry might not hold up over the years. Also, there are a few that are not pop-ups, which also detracted slightly from my rating. At the end, there are many pages of pure text, which is quite dull after experiencing all the amazing pop-ups.<br /><br />The text is sharp & easy to read, & well-oriented around the illustrations. The binding is pretty sturdy, as is the cover. Definitely a beautiful book to read with your children, & for them to one day read to their own.
0767817478|1.0|The movie wasn't bad. But, it really didn't have the Godzilla feel to it! It didn't have the Toho effects in it that we all have got to know! The Godzilla franchise should stay Japanese! And Mathew Brodericks acting in this is less convincing! Us Americans should keep hands off!!
141694737X|4.0|My son is only five months old, but already loves to 'help' lift the flaps in this adorable book. The text is nice & large, & the pictures are bright & simple for little ones. The flaps are interesting & varied, but are not as durable as they should be. Also, I felt that the name of the animals should be included somewhere, so there's a connection between revealing them & saying their names.
0470876417|5.0|Finally a book that gets real about innovation and talks less about why it's important (we all know that) and gets into the nuts and bolts of how to do it: a mix of strategic thinking and cultural shift. This book will help you break out of traditional thought patterns that are getting in the way of fresh thinking. In addition, it practices what it preaches. The method for creating the book was as innovative as the content itself, involving hundreds of people in a mass-collaboration effort. The book is also beautifully designed and a joy to read. Ifnyounare serious about innovation, you must have it on your shelf.
0981951244|2.0|I'm embarrassed that I bought this book based on the other reviews. First note the book dimensions 7.3 x 5.3 x 0.7 inches. They made the book small to hide the lack of content. The first page has a place to add a name \\"This book is given to ________ because I care about you and your greater success\\". The last thing he writes on the last page is: \\"Write down five people you will give a copy of this book to\\" and then space for five names. Yes. it is that kind of book. In between the suggestions to buy more copies of the book is treacle borrowed from other \\"success\\" books. I don't think there is an original thought in the entire book. It all comes down to pay attention to what you are doing and make sure it furthers your goals. He didn't succeed in writing a very good book. Perhaps he will succeed in selling it. \\"Who Moved the Cheese\\" sold a lot of copies.
B003FXXNBW|5.0|I have seen the first,it was a really good movie...Then the second movie came out, starring Scott Adkins,and Michael Jai White,purchased it and was totally satisfied and just blown away by it,and I'll tell you it was better than the first..then Undisputed 3 was released,I rented it first,I was so into this movie I came to Amazon to find it and purchase this movie,(and for a great price too)I have watched it several times since then and I will tell you its just as awesome as the first time.....YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED,THIS IS AN AWESOME MOVIE IF YOU LIKE MARTIAL ARTS TYPE MOVIES.Scott Adkins is one of the best Martial Artist out there,he also starred in Wolverine as weapon XI and the fight seen in that movie,( they are atop the Nuclear smoke stack)and you can almost tell just by the way he moves it was Scott Adkins,I have never seen anyone else with his style....JUST AWESOME!!!!
B001MYIXAC|5.0|... and definitely the best vampire movie I have ever seen.  I had chosen that caption before noting the Washington Examiner's comment on the DVD cover: \\"Best. Vampire movie. Ever.\\"  No argument from me.  It's been about 60 hours since I caught it on cable, and I'm still in awestruck mode.  Rarely does a film leave the viewer with such an impact, pondering its ramifications, for days to follow.  It was scarcely 24 hours before I was here on Amazon ordering my own copy, because I am sure it will take many viewings to pick up on all the nuances. It's not only a must-see; it's a must-see again.    It is important to note that Eli is not a sanitized, sugar-coated vampire as in The Little Vampire or Twilight.  For all her frail-looking frame, she is the original blood-sucking, wall-crawling, dismembering horror of the Bram Stoker genre.  The gore is not the sensationalized or sadistic fare we are used to today; it is coldly mechanical.  Not evil, per se; she kills out of necessity, matter-of-factly, because she needs to in order to survive.  Being forever twelve, not just an old vampire in a young body, adds a particularly eerie touch.  The honest, endearing smiles from a blood-splattered face are terminally creepy. To portray such multiple orders of monstrosity, while retaining much of her humanity, her need -- that she has all but given up hope for -- to be loved, or at least liked, takes a special actor.  Lina Leandersson upholds these dichotomies with aplomb.  It is safe to say that Kirsten Dunst's honor as the the archetypal child vampire has been usurped.    But this is not just a horror film; it integrates that horror with outstanding beauty.  Just as A Clockwork Orange accomplishes the seemingly impossible of provoking sympathy for murderer-rapist Alex, Let the Right One In provokes sympathy for the little girl who desanguinates a man and coldly snaps his neck.  The viewer's notions of good and evil, right and wrong, are desperately challenged.  The plot is interwoven with complex morality tangles that don't untangle easily. [Plot spoiler for remainder of paragraph!]  I knew the film would be richly complex when, behind the little stone building, Oskar embraces Eli after she vomits up the candy she had tried to eat because he had bought it for her, and in their conversation she asks, \\"If I weren't a girl, would you still like me?\\"  As for her reaction when he cuts his hand to make a blood-bond with her, you'll have to watch that for yourself.    There have been several complaints about the poor subtitling in the DVD release.  I am certain that this is release I saw on cable, because it showed the same DVD cover.  Now, my Swedish leaves a lot to be desired, but the bits that I could understand matched the subtitles almost exactly.  Being aware that in other films, very notably My Life as a Dog, there were a couple places where the subtitles were a pale comparison to the Swedish dialog, I can see where this could be a disappointment to those who had seen the theatrical release.  Nevertheless, since it was the DVD version that mesmerized me to this extent, I would advise no one to skip the DVD offering for this reason.  It's plenty good enough as is, far better than most.    Let the Right One In, in a flash, jumped to a high position on my list of all-time favorite films.
0786868724|5.0|I absolutely love this book. As a former student/congregant of Rabbi Lewis, everything Mitch portrays about Reb is so true and accurate. I also loved reading about Henry's story. It was extremely inspirational to learn about both of these men. I recommend this book to anyone.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This one grabs you and won't let you go. A very quick read that can be enjoyed by a diverse range of ages.
B003OF3R0S|4.0|Everyone knows the story -- Avenged Sevenfold has been mourning the loss of their talented drummer, The Rev, since 2009 came to a close and have used the tragedy to help fuel the fire that went into making their fifth studio album, Nightmare.  And while it is beyond words to express sympathy for such a loss, it is admirable that the band stuck together to record and release this album.  In doing so, A7X has devoted the ultimate tribute to a fallen soldier, whom the fans and music industry alike have grown to love.  In the wake of such tragedy, we endure our \\"Nightmare\\"...<br /><br />The title track is instantly recognizable as classic A7X -- grinding and complimentary guitar work, pulse-pounding drums, and powerful vocals.  \\"Nightmare\\" is the band's strongest single since \\"Bat Country\\" and may be a catalyst to help bring back the attention of any old school fan led astray by the more mainstream self-titled album.  \\"Welcome To The Family\\" is instantly catchy; you won't need repeat listens to get into this one and it'll be stuck in your head for days.  \\"Danger Line\\" is slightly reminiscent of the band's self-titled album work -- formula-driven and poppy -- not the best, not the worst.  \\"Buried Alive\\" is a solid epic track that begins with a Black-era Metallica tempo, before shifting into a heavier grind, actually reminiscent of an older Metallica vibe.  You'll be listening to this one loudly and often.<br /><br />\\"Natural Born Killer\\" is the juicy nugget that I'd hoped to hear -- it's heavy with a melodic chorus and the bridge/guitar solo in the middle of the track is nothing short of brilliant.  This may not be the absolute highlight of the album, but it is easily top 3 material and will cement itself within any fan's A7X career highlight list.  The album then moves into \\"So Far Away,\\" a ballad that will evoke thoughts of City of Evil and more specifically, \\"Seize The Day.\\"  This track, along with \\"Victim,\\" both remind me of the formula for the City of Evil track, each of which reprise and exit gracefully with strong emotion and lyrics.  \\"Victim,\\" as odd as it may sound, begins and ends with female vocals that for some reason, remind me of \\"Great Gig In The Sky,\\" from Pink Floyd's Dark Side Of The Moon.  Maybe it's just me...<br /><br />Sandwiched in between the two aforementioned ballads is \\"God Hates Us.\\"  All I can say is WOW...what a magnificent track!  If you've heard the rumors that this is the heaviest thing they've done, well...I wouldn't go that far, but it is certainly the heaviest song they've recorded since Waking The Fallen.  A7X channels a sound similar to that of Pantera's Far Beyond Driven years, with thrashing guitars and deep growling/screaming from Shadows.  I guess if I'd have to pick a favorite, it would be this one; so much emotion is put into this song, as the band expresses their anger for the loss of their comrade.<br /><br />The album winds down with a couple slower tracks, \\"Tonight The World Dies\\" and \\"Fiction,\\" the latter of which was the last song written by The Rev.  Originally written as \\"Death,\\" the title was changed in his honor.  What makes this song so eerie is the fact that it is the only one in which The Rev actually appears as vocalist, trading lines with Shadows as if he had foreseen the future tragedy that would eventually have him.  It is easily the most challenging song to get through, not only because of The Rev's appearance, but also because it truly is a bizarre (yet beautiful) track.  There are no guitars, but instead keyboards that serve substitute as musical elements.  Those of you who are familiar with The Rev's side project, Pinkly Smooth, will find the song's texture familiar in tone.<br /><br />The final track, \\"Save Me,\\" is an epic track that nearly breaks the 11-minute mark, but with abounding solo work and heartfelt vocals, who can tell?  Overall, Nightmare is slightly and understandably somber in tone, but does find a nice dynamic balance to help offer up their most complete album since City of Evil (and to some, Waking The Fallen).  Nightmare was designed to be played from start to finish, to honor one of the greatest drummer's of our time and possibly of all-time.  Mike Portnoy's work helps bring out the complexities of The Rev's percussion orchestration, but it is truly difficult to accept the fact that after this point in time, if the band chooses to remain together as A7X, they will be forced to press on without the aid of The Rev.<br /><br />R.I.P. James \\"The Rev\\" Sullivan (1981-2009)<br /><br />Highlights:  Nightmare, Welcome To The Family, Buried Alive, Natural Born Killer, God Hates Us, Fiction (solely for the inclusion of The Rev), Waking The Fallen).

0307454541|4.0|It is a mystery, and a thriller at times, and a detective book - but it's also a political and economic commentary, has one of the more original and daring heroines of the genre, and is invigorating in its details. Both Blomkvist and Salander are engaging protagonists, for very different reasons. Things happen to them that will make you upset and angry, especially Salander, whose side story holds you enthralled and revolted at the same time, as does the truth about Harriet - but there's nothing gratuitous here, or unnecessarily included or described: it's all relevant.

B0010SEN18|3.0|This review is based on the kindle app for the ipad.     The content of the book is great but buy the print version. The ipad version is the same price (which doesn't seem right since there are no printing, warehousing, delivery etc... costs) but regardless of this the formatting is HORRIBLE on the kindle version.    There are borders around blocks of text, the title for a picture is on a different page - it just doesn't look that great.     Stick with the paper copy and Amazon need to fix the kindle version of this book
B003J27WFW|5.0|I just picked this up a few weeks ago after EAGERLY anticipating it's format  to DVD. I didn't see this on the big screen, due to the fact that is wasn't showing near my home(about 2 1/2 hrs. away by car), so I was really looking forward to seeing this documentary about my favorite band of all time, Rush.    WOW!! This is such an eye-opening view into the 40 yr. phenomenon known as RUSH. It takes us back to the very beginning of the band with some videos and pictures NEVER before seen. Even I, who's been a Rush fan since 1981, learned some things about them that I didn't know. And to hear some other monsters of rock(and Jack Black who is so funny and honest here) review what they think of them with such high praise for the music and musicianship. Which justifies what I've been saying for years...that these guys, Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson, and Neil Peart, are pure genius in what they've done since their inception way back in the late 60's/early 70's.     This DVD goes through all of their breakthrough albums in their vast discography of prog rock immortality. I HIGHLY recommend this documentary DVD, Rush - Beyond the Lighted Stage...even if you're not a Rush fan. You just gotta give it up to these guys. Long live RUSH!!!
B000SMWUPS|4.0|I bought this to put on my Graco Ipo umbrella stroller and it fits great. It attached easily with 2 velcros and stays on tight. It does tip forward and backward a bit though so an open cup would probably spill. Made of good quality fabric and holds quite a bit. I do have to undo one of the velcros to fold up the stroller, but that's no big deal. Happy to have a place to put my drink while we stroll!

1932100660|5.0|Dr. Campbell has done a magnificent job documenting his findings. It's irrefutable--animal products in the diet are risky for your health; you can eat just as well with a predominantly vegetable diet. Whole foods versus supplements? No contest--whole foods win. This book forwards a recommendation for a non-obsessive change to a whole approach to nutrition. The benefits: reduced/no heart disease, diabetes, MS, cancer, macular degeneration, osteoporosis. Hey what else is there!    Have I followed the recommendations? Yes, and it was easy. I've become a \\"flexitarian\\" (I still eat a little meat occasionally). I'm an old man (68), and I really want to stay healthy; since I already love whole vegetables, fruit, and grains, why not go for it!    Unfortunately, none of my friends or family were as excited about this as I. I can't live for them! If the book looks daunting, just read the first section on cancer, just that section. If you don't get pulled in, then best wishes.    Campbell only becomes preachy at the very end of the book. But hey! I can take it; the first part overwhelmingly makes up for it. I'll get back with you in ten years and let you know how I've been doing. For some dimension, see also \\"The Omnivore's Dilemma,\\" and \\"Food Rules,\\" both by Michael Pollan. Great books. Related info, but not the same.    I also realized that there is something about this in the Bible. See Daniel: the story of Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-Nego, as they opt for vegetables rather than rich delicacies in the King's court.

B003EYVXXW|5.0|1500 years later, the story of Hypatia continues to rouse furious controversy. I recently came across a religious blog decrying AGORA which began: \\"I have not actually seen the movie, and have no intention of doing so...All I know about it is what I have read in an article in the New York Times...\\"and then proceeded to \\"debunk\\" the movie. Thus making precisely the point that Amenábar is making in AGORA, about the pernicious nature of dogma. Bow down before my holy book, or die!    This is a magnificent movie, perhaps the best film ever made about the Ancient World, and visually one of the most beautiful films you'll ever seen. The soundtrack is as haunting as the visuals; the scene in which Orestes plays the pipes before a crowd of theater-goers in an attempt to woo Hyapatia could have become kitsch in lesser hands, but Amenábar imbues the moment with an unforgettable poignancy. This is also one of the scenes in which the camera rises high above the earth, establishing a cosmic viewpoint that informs the whole movie. There is true genius in the making of AGORA.

B002XUL6QW|5.0|This Criterion BluRay is simply ravishing in every detail:  image and sound perfectly restored allowing us to experience this film as no other edition ever has.  Utterly gorgeous.  \\"Lola Montes\\" is one of my favorite films - although using the word \\"favorite\\" seems a bit reductive for such a beautiful work of art.  It is a grand and kaleidoscopic refraction of a life.  A note about running times - one of the Amazon reviews again cites the legend of a \\"director's cut\\" that had a 140 minute running time.  This is just a myth, not supported by any contemporary accounts of the film - apparently just a factual error made once by some critic or author - and now repeated and fostered in error (even Pauline Kael in her writings repeated it!).   NYC's Film Forum tried to lay this myth to rest when they screened the restored version - but apparently to no avail as it keeps popping up.  As noted on the Turner Classic movie site:  \\"With the director's version unavailable for years a rumor quickly spread that the original was 140 minutes long (it was actually 113 minutes in France and 116 minutes in Germany)\\".   Rest assured that the Criterion Edition is indeed the fully restored version representing the director's intentions.

0515141429|5.0|Child refreshes with his character the rarefied atmosphere of PI's, seems credible, with power of deduction (although miles behind Mr. Holmes) and full of action, Mr. Reacher knowledge of weapons is laudable and the plot keeps suspense and emotion. For being the first of his novels I think its a great achievement that explains the awards and recognition already granted.  Blues singers of the past, southern ambiance and gorgeous police female companion (sensual, intelligent and full of desire) loks like the perfect companion for him but his fate (greek´s ancient manners) is to suffer solitude and resignation makes the writing not only in solid grays but touches of color here and there. Splendid!  The villians are loaded with lots of perversion and you are against them beyond common sense.  For me was a wonderful \\"escape literature\\" for this summer, eager to read the second and third and fourth and...  hope you enjoy the same!
0451196716|3.0|In some weird dystopian future 100 teenage boys volunteer to walk a death march across America in search of the \\"Ultimate Prize\\" for the sole survivor - you see, if you can't walk anymore, you're shot. Thus begins an epic 200+ mile walk in which the endurance of the human body and spirit is pushed to its limits.<br /><br />King does a good job of keeping the story moving despite not much variation in what's happening over nearly 300 pages: they walk, someone falls, is shot, they walk, someone falls, is shot, etc, repeat. The cast of characters is built up and then brought down. We slowly see the characters start to crack up psychologically and then physically, then turn on one another. It's fascinating for a while.<br /><br />King also doesn't give much away about the world this takes place in - it's recogisable except there is talk of a \\"Change\\", of \\"Squads\\", and the mysterious \\"Major\\" who runs the annual (!) Long Walk. The Walk is spectator sport at its bloodiest.<br />We are also kept guessing as to the reward for the winner - a prize is mentioned but walkers talk about how they just shoot the winner instead. The ending is masterfully written to keep the reader guessing as to what really happened.<br /><br />But even if this is one of King's shortest (by his standards), I still think the book was overlong.  It's an interesting story that gets a bit long in the tooth due to the slow depletion of the 100 boys and could've been as effective at half the length.<br /><br />Despite the feeling that it dragged a bit for me, I was definitely impressed with the way King portrayed psychological disintegration so well, as well as the subtletly in which he kept the boys' motives for taking part in the race somewhat ambiguous (\\"volunteer\\" is a term used loosely as you find out - or is it? Are they all mad or not?). One of King's most interesting works and better than some of his more well known books, a definite book to check out if you're a fan or would like to read King without the supernatural horror he's famous for.s famous for.

Actually, in all honesty, I think this album is better than \\"Falling Into You\\". \\"Us\\", \\"Miles To Go Before I Sleep\\", \\"Tell Him\\", and \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" are the highlights of the album.

0618918248|5.0|As a physicist and a long-time apostate, I was not a very difficult target to convince.  With this book, I moved from \\"I believe that there is no God but I don't know how I can reject this weird hypothesis\\" to \\"I'm almost completely certain that there is no Creator and I have good reasons for that\\". The book is remarkable in its argumentation and its clarity.  It will certainly be more useful to atheists (so that they can argue constructively) than convincing for believers (they usually hold the view that logical evidence is irrelevant in matters of faith).  The godless morale chapter is really interesting for non-philosophers.      The strong stand against religions, although quite motivated, is probably too much, as it diverts from the very aim of the book: establish on logical grounds that there is almost certainly no God.  (Furthermore, it may lead to a rejection of the whole work by religion-friendly non believers.)
0307474712|4.0|Emma Morley and Dexter Mayhew start out as hopeful college graduates envisioning what their future lives will hold for them.  Emma is a self-deprecating beauty bent on changing the world, even if it is only \\"the bit around you\\".  Dexter is disatrously handsome, and unaccountably lucky, stumbling through post-graduation years by seeming to celebrate an endless party.  Despite their differences, they become great friends, communicating first through post cards, and later, through infrequent get togethers and talks on the phone.    I found the story to be deeply touching, and often very sad.  There is quite a lot of dialogue in this book, and Nicholls carries it off beautifully.  I thought the charaterizations were fairly realistic, and I especially liked the portions of the story from Dexter's point of view where we can see that he does, in fact, have feelings for Emma.  The missed chances, and his inability to communicate lend the story a sense of the bittersweet.    The story spans two decades, and one of the joys of reading the book is that you get to see the evolution of the characters and how life changes them.  They grow up, experience heartbreak.  They stumble and fall, learn to love, and all the while, you're rooting for them to figure it out, to get it right.  Definitely worth reading.  4.5/5
B001C4AFOY|4.0|Presenting an unusual view of the young Victoria's ascent to the throne, the acting, costumes and sets of Young Victoria are stellar.  Some of the brightest stars of the British screen--Jim Broadbent, Harriet Walter, Miranda Richardson, are magnificent in their roles as members of Victoria's infighting family.  Mark Strong is a fabulously menacing Sir John Conroy and Paul Bettany gives Lord Melbourne some real depth.  Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend are most convincing as Vicky and Al and one of the best scenes in the movie is when Prince Albert puts Lord Melbourne in his place.  The expression on Paul Bettany's face is priceless.<br /><br />The soundtrack is standout as well, featuring lush and gorgeous arrangements of music the characters would have actually listened to.<br /><br />The writing, not so much, though finding the story to tell during this era would be extremely difficult.  The admirable Julian Fellowes is due a lot of credit for being able to incorporate so very many details into his screenplay.  I have three complaints about this film.  While I was totally on board with the presentation of Victoria's marriage as a safe haven, and the pressure Albert would have felt from his family to promote their interests over England's, the moviemakers invented things in order to make points about V and A's relationship.  Since there was plenty of real drama without inventing anything, the movie lost me there.  Fortunately, it was near the end, and I'd greatly enjoyed the movie up to that point.  A second complaint is that the movie ended with a whimper instead of a bang.  It kind of drifted off with some on-screen facts about Victoria's reign (let me quibble and say that while the movie said they reigned together, Albert was Victoria's consort, never King Albert) which leads to my third complaint--that there was way too much on screen exposition.  Minor complaints for a splendid movie.<br /><br />For a change, the special features were fascinating and contained some delightful tidbits of information.<br />Well worth seeing and having in one's collection.f information.

0385339682|4.0|I find what distinguishes the best authors from the ordinary is character development.   Along with interpersonal dynamics, this book demonstrates it well.   The characterization of the Mississippi town and its denizens is very well-wrought.            On the down side, the plot is nothing special.  And I am tired of  women throwing themselves at the hero.   Does he always have to be a Sam Spade playboy?    Is it too cynical to think that with the narrator screwing the murdered woman's sister a couple of times the author is just covering all his bases?
B002VPE1AW|3.0|The special effects are every bit of everything you've heard about.  Fantastic.  Pretty sure 3-D effects would make me sick if I had seen AVATAR in that format.<br /><br />As for the plot:  Think DANCES WITH WOLVES in outerspace and you've just about got it.
B002XW1CNM|5.0|We received this in excellent condition and were planning to listen to this while we were on a 7 / 14hr road trip.  It was the most fun and fast trip we've had so far to this particular destination.  We laughed because we had some of the names pronounced incorrectly and particularly enjoyed the narrators different voices for different characters.  We actually already had the book so my son would follow along as the cd was rolling.  It was wonderful!!

B000001IQH|5.0|Most punk bands would be lucky to have one song the caliber of every song on this album.  The band continually knocks them out of the park, a feat that they haven't been able to replicate since- truly lighting-in-a-bottle.  The album is so good that just about anyone should be able to get into this CD.  I am happy to own the more diverse \\"Life Won't Wait\\" but I can't deny the sheer wall to wall quality that \\"And out comes the wolves\\" embodies.  I dare say that its better than contemporary albums like the other \\"punk revival\\" landmarks like the Offspring's \\"Smash\\" and Greed Day's \\"Dookie\\" (typo? no).  If it doesn't still sound 'fresh' its still a vibrant and thoroughly enjoyable album.

B000I2J6K0|5.0|I got this DVD at 30 weeks when I realized how little time I had left to get in decent shape before baby. I would say I was in fairly good shape considering my lack of regular exercise. My first few days pushed me pretty hard and I definitely felt it the next day. I took her recommended shortcuts but tried to keep up the best I could. I'm on my second week now (using the DVD 5-6 days a week) and I can feel that I'm stronger and can stay with her pretty well.    Personally, I prefer working out with someone so I do the partner workout as often as I can-- about 3 days a week. My husband's a very good sport and that extra push/encouragement adds a lot to the workout. I can tell he enjoys it in his own way too. ;)    Admittedly, the production quality isn't the best, but it doesn't bother me any. I appreciate her water reminders and her sensitivity to the pregnant bladder. The lack of extra equipment is a plus as well.
0307594777|5.0|Although the book was a bit slow in the beginning, it held me captive throughout the rest of the story.  Well written and imaginative, he tied up the loose ends beautifully and skillfully.  I bought all three books and can't wait to start the second one.  Too sad to think that Larsson is no longer with us.

B000N6U0EC|5.0|This is such a beautiful true story, Will Smith does a Terrific job. I totally recommend it.
B002SAUCBC|4.0|This is sort of science fiction, but not really. It is really psycho-horror. Its about an alternate socialist or communist or fascist america, where people march to their deaths in a contest. Very strange book, the horror is they are all young boys and they walk until they can't then they are shot or whatever. They walk to death, in a race of endurance. But there is not SF reason for this, or supernatural reason. Just a political one.<br /><br />The characters are all generally good. There are some things I had trouble getting over, such as the idea they didn't all start off terrified. I mean, if you know it is a march to the death, you should be terrified, they all start off too happy. Also, the whole point of the thing was somewhat shaky.<br /><br />This was one of his very first novels he wrote, I've heard his very first. So, from that angle, its quite good.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|This is definitely one of my top 10 favorite movies. Never gets old. Wouldn't recommend it for young kids, though. There is a LOT of blood. Still, this is a great movie. Good acting for its time, good suspense, good plot, good evrything.

0788861948|5.0|Not much to say - if you are a Gray's Anatomy fan, then you love it. If you are not, and you watch it, you will become one. I just took one season out of the library when I was living in Spain to help me practice my Spanish (I needed something with good English and Spanish subtitles), and I fell in love with it! Since then I've watched and bought all the seasons.
0307463745|5.0|I approached this with some skepticism but once I picked it up I couldn't put it down. I really have never heard 37 Signals or the Authors until now. But as a reader of Seth Godin's work and he highly recommended it, I decided to give it a real shot. The advice in this book is not something old, it is something many would say they know but they certainly don't do. I spent 17 years with PepsiCo and another 3 with Compaq and consulted for many Fortune 50 companies later and this is solid advice that the folks at the top do not want to hear.<br /><br />The book is constructed very simply, short but hard hitting advice from people who created a very successful company and learned along the way. In a section called Takedowns the advice in Planning is Guessing is worth the price of the book. Because planning is guessing and every big company in the world, including our illustrious US government, is spending millions trying to predict the future. These guys just dont tell you it's wrong they tell you what works.<br /><br />The Authors question why you 'must' grow your business? They challenge many so called principles in business and bring a real common sense approach that will work. Absolutely must read book. The CEO's will not read it of course but if you have a small business that is growing or you are in a new start up ... buy this book and take it to heart and you'll be much better for it.<br /><br />Great read, greater real world advice!
B003GEDLW6|5.0|I have been a huge fan of Pendulum since I first heard Slam as the title track in the PS3 game Motostorm. Their albums are great because they mix things up, while charting new territory for drum 'n bass. Immersion is without a doubt the most energetic, frenetic, and incredibly diverse electronic album I've heard this year, and that's saying a lot. I especially appreciate the inclusion of several great guests on the album, including Liam Howlett from Prodigy, but what took me completely by surprise was how much I really really love Self vs Self, featuring In Flames. That track could have really stuck out like a sore thumb, because there isn't a d'n'b beat to be found throughout, but the sound they crafted through the rest of the album invites exploration, and this track really bridges the gap between electronica and the energy inherent in more punk / hardcore acts.    Pendulum manage to create sonically what many fail at daily - melding diversity together into a beautiful, uniform whole.
B000068TPN|4.0|This was a great war movie and the actors did a great job. I really liked the performance of the rugged Sergeant-Major who scares the heck out of everyone. When he tells Moore that \\"Custer was a Wussy,\\" I couldn't stop laughing.    BTW: What the heck is going on with Mel Gibson lately?
B0015UKX7E|5.0|What a party!!!!!!!! Put your dancing shoes on to get ready for an out and out jam!!! Turn your speakers up and join the party! This dvd is simply awesome! Real music played by true musicians! It's really like being right there as Prince, Larry Graham, Lenny Kravitz and Maceo share their unrestrained on stage \\"jam session\\" with everyone! Don't buy it if you prefer lip synching or guitar smashing because this dvd includes true performers!!!! They are actually about real music....instumentally and vocally. Ol' school performances are extremely rare now a days. Therefore, this is definetly one for collectors! As a side comment, I must say that Prince, Morris Day and Jerome look the same as they did 16 years prior to this taping, in the 1984 'Purple Rain' movie! They look good!!!!!!!!
0525948023|5.0|If anybody is searching for inner peace this book may be able to help you. It has a lot of great ideas (regardless if they're original or not-- Tolle is a spirtual teacher, not a philosopher). Psychologists talk a lot about coping mechanisms to deal with the stresses of everyday life. This book is an abundance of coping mechanisms rolled into one. I'd also recommend the Power of Now. Take what you want from these books and reject what you don't want. Even if you only get one helpful insight form the book that is better than none. If you're like me you'll get a lot more than one helpful insight form this book and just perhaps a lot more inner peace. Amen to that!!!
B0029O08WA|4.0|I believe the music was wonderful, It was a bit darker and felt heavier than the first  Twilight soundtrack, but so was the movie. If you like the saga you definately will need to ad this.
B0021L8V1Q|2.0|I really enjoyed the first Iron Man.  (I liked the Dark Knight more, but eh what can ya do?)  I thought as a super hero origin story, the first Iron Man was surprisingly well done and it felt surprisingly relevant with current events.  However, Iron Man 2 was another matter.  The story was completely pointless.  If you were to skip this movie and go straight into the Avengers, I'm willing to bet you won't have missed a thing story wise.      Nothing of substance happens.  There was no real character development.  There was the extremely hokey and cheesy creation of a new element and Iron Man fought a bunch of robots. That's it.  The villain, who doesn't have a protective suit of armor, is able to withstand at least three encounters with the front of a car and a cement wall. Why? We don't know. Apparently he was from Krypton or there was something in the vodka!      Tony Stark falls as a person, his relationships are tested, blah blah blah..  The villain shows up at a race track because the script says so. There's no rhyme or reason to it. (Why did he pick that spot? How did he know Stark would take part in the race when it appeared even Stark did not know he was going to be taking part in said race?....)  Note to Hollywood: this wasn't good story telling!      Some people have defended the movie because it's a sequel or because of RDJ's performance.  The first excuse I don't buy. Seems like many comic book sequels are superior to the original.  Look at X-Men 2, Spider Man 2, The Dark Knight.  Those were great comic book sequels.  Iron Man 2 won't be in that list.  As for the second excuse, I kind of agree and if there was a bright spot in the film it was RDJ.  However, even he couldn't save this mess.    Long story short, this won't be going in my blu-ray collection and was a real disappointment. Here's hoping Marvel turns things around with Captain America and Thor.

B0037W68F4|5.0|The first time I heard MGMT was on Saturday Night Live. They played \\"Flash Delirium\\" and it sounded like complete noise to me. But something inside me took notice. They seemed intelligent, which is so painfully lacking in American music.<br /><br />Then, a friend played \\"Time To Pretend\\". It was pop magic. Then I heard the amazing groove of \\"Electric Feel\\" and the twisted satisfaction of \\"Kids\\" came after.<br /><br />So, I bought \\"Oracular Spectacular\\" with the expectation that the poppy stuff was all I would like. But how wrong I was! The album was a psychedelic masterpiece.<br /><br />But \\"Congratulations\\"? What were the chances I'd like that? I think I bought it simply because I had such warm feelings about \\"Oracular\\". And everyone was saying it was \\"textbook sophomore slump\\". Oh well, I'd give it a whirl. Well, a couple of whirls... hmmm... then a couple more.<br /><br />Now I'm so enamored with MGMT that I think they're worthy successors to Pink Floyd or Led Zeppelin. And while we're comparing, I'd say \\"Congratulations\\" is their \\"Tusk\\". It doesn't have a single, it's quirky and bizarre and I'm sometimes finding it hard to sleep because the songs on the album get stuck in my head and play over and over... including the amazing \\"Flash Delirium\\". \\"Congratulations\\" is simply beautiful, and I like that they made us work a little harder to appreciate the genius of this one. It's well worth it.
1439165645|5.0|I loved this book.  It's like 'Slumdog Millionaire' meets 'Ratatouille'.  That's actually a gross over-generalization, but it shares some of the best elements of both: the ambition to rise above one's circumstances, a struggle for expression through fine cuisine, and a warmth and humor in the telling, all set against the back drop of Bombay, London and France.<br /><br />The characters are rich and deeply drawn. The writing is beautiful and well-paced. The originality of the prose is startling.  It is told in the first person by Hassan Haji - the voice is humble, confident, and utterly believable. The author's use of language to portray the aromas, textures and tastes of the many ingredients and dishes he describes is more than convincing - it's like reading with your taste buds.<br /><br />It will make a great movie some day.  But the director will have a challenge on his hands trying to replicate the beauty of Morais' prose.
B002ZG997C|5.0|This movie is an allegory or parable of life and the religious urges of human beings thrown into relief with the politics and greed we aspire to pull ourselves up from and grow beyond. All religions from the history of humanity look for higher explanations, higher things. Those things alone are worth dedicating your life to. We walk through a wasteland and yearn for heaven. We feel guided by forces, sometimes only in retrospect. This is the allegory for our lives. The allegory for our minds so adapted to learn and grow and bestow our gifts on this world, whatever they might be. Huge themes of life and human spirit are coursing through the film at so many levels that they hit me straight in the heart, and a dam of emotions burst forth. I can't remember when I have seen a movie like it recently.<br /><br />  In my opinion, no movie library is complete without it. The themes in this movie are THE themes of life. the violence and other themes you would think kids should not see are completely de-fused, and nearly unnoticeable against the backdrop of the life, truth, and faith themes echoing from this film. I would give this film a chance for EVERYONE to see it for that reason. this is no simple super hero story --it suprised me very much.

B0021L8V0M|4.0|Angelina looks like a bag of bones in this movie, very skinny, unnaturally so. It is painful to look at her arms, and legs, she looks so weak. In light of that her physical prowess is hard to accept. She looked so much better in Mrs. Smith. She needs to gain about 10-15 pounds if we are to take her seriously as a action movie star.<br />The movie itself is typical action flick, fun, mindless entertainment, pure and simple.
B002ZG977Y|1.0|Staying true to most of the new action/adventure films today, this one is heavy on computer generated effects and lacking in character and plot development.  It lacks the charm and adventurous spirit of the original.  The characters are so devoid of warmth and emotion that the story leaves you not giving a damn whether the whole world gets destroyed or not.  Oh yeah, and what's with the recent movies like 300 and this one?  They, in a rather not-so-subtle manner, bash eastern philosophy and influence by putting it in an unfavorable light.  This movie makes the annoying weasle guy physically appear like an Indian Ascetic.  Why not make him look like a Greek if you're doing a movie that takes place in Ancient Greece you racist pricks?  If you haven't bought this movie, do yourself a favor and SAVE YOUR MONEY!  Stick to the original.  Two thumbs down and a brown log out my ass on this one.  Clash of the Titans remake, I DEFECATE ON YOU!
0545123283|5.0|The winter is over, and the werewolves are returning to their human forms... but obviously not all is easily wrapped up in \\"Linger,\\" the second silken urban fantasy about the werewolves of Mercy Falls. And fortunately, Maggie Stiefvater's combination of elegant prose and complex characters puts this head-and-shoulders above the other young adult stories about supernatural creatures.<br /><br />Sam has returned to his human form, and he and Grace are trying to settle back into the normal rhythms of HUMAN life -- getting a job, thinking about college, and fending off a police investigation into Olivia's disappearance. In the meantime, Isabel has been secretly feeding the still-lupine werewolves, which is only endangering them more because of her father's hatred for them.<br /><br />But the problems that Beck left the pack haven't vanished -- Cole is determined to lose his pain in his wolf form, until he inadvertently stumbles into Isabel's life, and she finds herself drawn to him. And Grace's happiness at having Sam back is overshadowed by a mysterious illness, which may draw her even closer to the world of the werewolves.<br /><br />Rather than stick to just one character, Stiefvater cycles through four different narrators in her story (Grace, Isabel, Cole and Sam), who offer different perspectives on everything that happens in the story. Isabel sounds pricklier and more sarcastic, Cole is all raw emotion, Grace is \\"normal\\" and Sam sort of straddles the fence between humanity and wolfiness. Given how many werewolf/vampire tales are first-person, it's nice to have some variation.<br /><br />Her prose has a bare, silvery elegance and a raw, restless quality, even when Grace is the one narrating; it's even more striking when one of the werewolves is doing it (\\"In the bright light of the moon, a flat, pale disc behind a tangle of leafless branches\\"). And the book is filled with the smells and sights of early springtime -- melting ice, the remnants of biting cold, warming sunlight and the first little crocus.<br /><br />While the first third of the book is a pretty steady, even affair, Grace's nightmare about turning into a wolf suddenly revs up the plot in a big way -- suddenly Grace's family hates Sam, Grace is horribly ill, and Sam is struggling to deal with Cole's unpredictable behavior (such as trying to turn into a wolf ON PURPOSE). And without revealing too much, Stiefvater opens the door wide for a third book that returns to the most powerful themes of the series.<br /><br />\\"Linger\\" is a solid sequel to Maggie Stiefvater's first werewolf book, and her exquisite prose and well-rounded characters put this head'n'shoulders above most urban fantasy.

B002ZG99G8|4.0|Jeffrey Dean Morgan is the leader of a Special Forces unit and much like Hannibal in \\"the A Team\\" (I definitely see why there are comparisons made), he has a heart of gold underneath a very tough exterior. Anyway, while saving a group of children, his unit is betrayed by \\"Max\\" (a super bad guy). Following the leads where they go.....including to a very sexy and very mysterious Zoe Saldana, Clay sets out to find the truth and soon even he realizes that everything is not as it seems, and that the puppeteer may be closer than he initially thought. I thought that this was a great action/adventure movie. There were good guys/bad guys, a team of kick butt soldiers (Rogue, Pooch, Jensen and Cougar), a little romance, a lot of fight scenes, and twists and turns (with the plot). I also had no idea that this story was based on a comic book so that was a bonus. So, for a weekend flick....if you don't want anything too deep and dark, this is the flick for you. Especially if you enjoy Jeffrey Morgan, who I think is a decent actor but who seems to die in every movie or TV show that I have seen him in (for example, Supernatural, Grey's Anatomy, and Watchmen). And don't fear, he doesn't die in this one. I wonder will there be a sequel?
B002ZG977Y|2.0|Having enjoyed the original back when it came out, I was keen to see the remake with potentially stunning graphics. I was quite disappointed with the CGI effects. The scorpion battle scenes were murky  and claustrophobic. The only bright spot, image-wise, was the Medusa battle; a glimpse of what the whole movie should have looked like. The Kraken - yawn. In summary - stick with the original, or avoid both altogether. Oh yeah, and how do you make Liam Neeson look like an 80's hair band outcast.

B002VPE1YS|5.0|I like the size of this camera pouch for my Kodak PlaySport. I can also carry an extra battery and SD card inside, though quickly stowing away all three items can be a little time consuming (no inside pockets to hold small items in place). My favorite aspect of the case is the padding.  I can carry it in my messy purse and never worry that I'll scratch the screen. I think this pouch could work for many small cameras with maybe room for extra AA batteries and a memory card. It's well constructed and protective, which is all you can ask for in a camera pouch.
B003HARV3Y|4.0|I liked this movie, I thought it was good and it kept me entertained. The only thing is that it doesn't follow the book that much. For instance,  Grover: He's not the one who's for the ladies and yet in the movie it's like he's upsessed...    The Pearls: Whhaatt? That's not even what happens in the book! At one part, but not all them...    Locations: They don't even come to Denver for Ares and Clarrise isn't mentioned in the book and neither is Hermes Cabin...    And also...in the book...their 12..not 17 But I can't argue with them casting Logan Lerman :)    Still, the book is defiantly the best! It's the way to go ;)
B002N1AEN2|1.0|X writes an OK song.    And that's it. ONE OK song over and over and over and over. This album is like one boring dull hum. At 1st you are hopeful at things like the easy beat and the male/female duet. But nothing ever changes or materializes. If you made a graph of this album, it would be a horizontal line. X = 0.  The whole band needs to lay off the Xanax.(must be what the X stands for) Worst vocal delivery ever!

B003A4IFDW|1.0|Bettye's \\"interpretations\\" of British rock looks great on paper--the song selection is outstanding--some of the most memorable upbeat rock 'n roll standards, virtually all true classics--all assembled here for a breath of new life with Bettye's great blues voice.  Then I listened to it.  The tunes are virtually unrecognizable, slow, almost dirge-like, with all of the warmth and strength of the originals completely sucked out.  Her voice didn't have the usual angst, the emotion was virtually non-existent, and the result torturous.  She sang like she wasn't well, but had to do it.  Several times I debated turning off the CD before it was over, and finally did so while she was butchering Nights in White Satin.  Bettye has a few great records, several average ones (the earlier ones, for the most part) and at least one clunker--\\"Interpretations\\"--this one was dead on arrival.

B0000264WN|5.0|By this point The Doors were already three albums strong and their unique sound was very firmly established. True Jim Morrison was becomming more and more personally unglued and that's more or less what the band became associated with from this point onward but musically the band was in need of something of a change. Whereas their sound was based largely on a relatively minimal quartet sound in which Ray Manzarak's organ and keyboard textures were the dominant sound element you could call this the the first (and only) album by what could be described as the \\"expanded Doors\\",in a similar fasion to what Talking Heads would do a decade later. The band was augmented by a horn section,a mandolin,a fiddle and conga drums aside from the usual Doors lineup. Not only that but The Doors had decided to change up from a psychedelic rock band with a strong jazzy flavor to a horn and percussion based jazz-rock band with heavy soul and funk elements thrown in. The sound actually suited the bands sound and Morrison's persona very well. The music here is not unlike what you might here on horn rock bands of the day such as Electric Flag,Chicago,Blood,Sweat Tears or a little later Edgar Winter's White Trash. Many of the songs such as \\"Tell All The People\\",\\"Shaman's Blues\\",\\"Runnin Blue\\" and \\"Wishful Sinful\\" have fare more elaborate arrangements than any of the Doors records had up until this point and Morrison's poetic revelries are expanded to the edge of their ability. \\"Easy Ride\\" and \\"Wild Child\\" kind of take on that more traditional rebellious,proto glam theatrical quality of older Doors records but again with the new elements taken hold. The title track is an absolutely incredible 8+ minute medley style journey through slower and uptempo jazz-funk,some boogie woogie type rhythms and bluesier elements. This album represents a very different musical situation. A different kind of Doors. And as you'll read in the reviews this isn't even up to the tastes of even some of the more devoted Doors fanatics. But in another way it may actually be one of their most defining records musically and actually brings out a good deal of their creative side. Not that creativity was ever a problem for this band but it did.ome of the more devoted Doors fanatics.

0465011047|5.0|Kang Chol-hwan's The Aquariums of Pyongyang takes the reader into one of North Korea's most infamous concentration camps, Yodok or No. 15. I always was aware that North Koreans suffered from political oppression and various hardships, but this book brings light to a very dark place. Kang details his family's background into Korea, which eventually links to their transportation to the Yodok camp. Starting the story from the eyes of a child exposes how disruptive and uncaring the government is towards the innocence of the convicts and their families. As we learn about the life (or rather lack-thereof) Kang was given in Yodak, we experience the horrific, desensitizing events that all the prisoners are forced to embrace. It seems unreal and I, myself would have short nightmares after a night's read.<br /><br />After his eventual release from prison, we are exposed to the corruption in the government. Almost any government worker can be bribed to turn their back or provide a service. It is eventually because of this corruption that Kang and his friend are able to escape North Korea. This book puts insight where it has been missing, and possibly, will inspire you to advocate a free North Korea.<br /><br />Afterthoughts... I wonder what happened to that elder woman that was picked up along the way to the camp? Maybe it's better not to know.<br /><br />The only negative feeling I have toward the book is how it uses labyrinthine wording (heh, I'm funny). It felt like I had to at least look up a word or two on every other page. The wording was precise, but I had never heard many of them before (or seen them used in the form they were used). After awhile I just simply ignored those words and the story flowed uninterrupted.<br /><br />I recommend this book to others.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Absolutely amazing I could not put it down, I would try to sleep and all I could do was think about the book and go read a considerable chunk of it before my body fell asleep against my will. Riveting, thrilling, deep, and it shows how deep corruption can go in he government and it unveils Salander's past and I must say that it is my favorite book I've read in at least a year.
B001QERPDO|4.0|After hearing their song \\"Breakeven\\" on the radio, I had to buy this CD.  It was not a disappointment.  However, it does have a few curse words in a couple songs I could do without. Also, the song \\"If You See Kay\\" is a crafty way of trying to be amusing I presume.  A band with this kind of talent does not need to adopt such lyrics to be successful, my opinion.

159448385X|5.0|This novel was truly fantastic. I haven't read \\"The Kite Runner\\", so I really didn't have any preconceived notions of the author. I will definitely be checking out \\"The Kite Runner\\" and any future work from him, though.    The book interweaves two stories, both about young women in Afghanistan, both in different times, but both with tumultuous lives. First is Mariam, a girl who lives with her single mother because her father doesn't want people to know he had a bastard daughter. He visits her once a week, but it soon dawns on Mariam that she is unloved by her dad. She decides to visit him for herself, and when she returns, all hell breaks lose.    Second is Laila, my personal favorite. Laila is even younger than Mariam, but more fiesty and seemingly more intelligent. She lives with both her parents, goes to school, has a semi-boyfriend, and has friends. Her two brothers are off fighting in the war, though, and she feels as if her mom doesn't take notice of her at all. This doesn't seem like much, but I can't go farther without revealing too much for a first-time reader.     Basically, all I can say is you need to read this book. It's easily attainable, so there's no excuse not to. It's a good amount of pages, but it flies by so quickly it's hard to believe you've read over 400 pages.     I, actually, wasn't really interested at first, but with all the rave reviews from... well, everyone, it was hard not to read it at some point, so I did.    READ IT! You will most certainly not regret it.

B003ODL004|5.0|Hans Zimmer did a great job with this score. The music feels like waves washing over you.

B003FLWHA2|5.0|My boys love these books - and rightfully so, as they speak to smart kids with senses of humor - few books hit the target as well as Jeff Kinney's 'Wimpy Kid' series.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the whole set; although I hesitate on the movie - should have been animated instead!
0307474712|4.0|I usually don't read books like this; I tend towards sci-fi, fantasy, mysteries or thrillers however this got such rave reviews on Entertainment Weekly that I thought I'd give it a shot. I'm glad I did, it was an enjoyable book and one I'd recommend.<br /><br />The beginning was slow, especially since I did not initially like the two protagonists. One was superficial and the other was self-righteous. But as the characters aged and matured, they turned into people that I did like, ones I would have been delighted to meet at a dinner party or wedding perhaps. The chemistry between them was palpable and very believable. I think the author has perfectly captured the idea that love is not a constant gushing like that from a spigot or hose. Instead it ebbs and flows, sometimes in spurts, sometimes not at all. By the middle of the book, I could not put it down, I wanted to know how these two friends' lives turn out and what becomes of their relationship.<br /><br />The ending. Well, it was not what I expected but reading books where you always know the ending gets boring. A worthy read, even if your interests don't normally lie in this kind of book.
B003ODL004|5.0|I just love Hans Zimmer! He composed music for many of the BIGGEST movies out there, Pirates of the C., Gladiator, The Last Samurai, Pearl Harbor, Rain Man, etc, etc, the list never ends. I think he is brilliant in catching the `mood` of the entire movie and make it even better with his music. Now, I just have to listen to his cd-s, and I see the movie right in front of my eyes, the music is so dramatic. Same for the Inception, dark and dramatic and very powerful music, I love it... :-)
B0009S4IHY|5.0|I'm not going to rehash the story , the other reviewers did that well enough. The only thing I'm going to say is that this is one of funniest movies I've ever seen and after 20 viewings it still cracks me up. Just avoid the dub it's awful, the sub is where its at.

0307588335|5.0|As a Lehmanite in the '80s, I remember a firm that took considerable risk but always within limits.  Dick had his office (as did Joe Gregory to whom I reported) on the trading floor and I sat a few stations away.  He daily walked the floor and usually had imprompto unpleasant interactions with random traders and sales staff.  We all loved to watch him on the floor.  He was personable (heading a conga line at the annual office party) and had deep thoughts and emotions such as his speach following the crash of '87.  Dick had and could always get Lehman through the cyclical bad patches in our business.      This book shows the bank I knew 20 years after my departure with magnification of what were faults in the Lehman culture.  Dick was always right and usually not open to others' thoughts.  Joe led a cabal.  You were either in his cabal or not important without regard to your success (or lack thereof).  It is clear that these faults became more deeply entenched in the decision process, blinding both Dick and Joe to real risks as they became more deeply insulated from the action on the floor.  Great book!

B003L7DK9M|1.0|This is the movie company redoing the TMNT movie from 2007. When I purchased it, I thought it was a straight-to-DVD sequel of the TMNT movie since the TMNT movie ended with a cliffhanger. I opened my package and it is the exact same DVD as the 2007 DVD. So, go to the toolbar at the top. Under Movies and TV, search for \\"TMNT.\\" You should see a different DVD released in 2007, NOT 2010. It should also be much cheaper. So, whatever you do, do NOT purchase this item because you will be wasting your money. IT IS NOT A STRAIGHT-TO-DVD SEQUEL. IT IS A REMAKE OF THE 2007 MOVIE JUST RERELEASED IN 2010!

B001GCUO5M|1.0|I'm not sure why I'm bothering to review this movie. but I just saw it and I thought it was so awful I had to express my disgust. Basically what we have here is a movie that throws in everything but the kitchen sink (Nazi death camps, Cold War brainwashing, mind-altering drugs, hallucinations, dreams, evil doctors, a government investigator held captive and trying to escape, an assortment of lunatics, etc.) and then tries to redeem itself with a dreary twist that deconstructs everything that preceded it. Is that really worth two hours of anybody's life? To boot, the \\"twist\\" is totally unfair as the only \\"hints\\" earlier in the movie are an anagram (which goes back at least to \\"Rosemary's Baby\\") and a reinterpreation of an obscure line of dialogue (which goes back to \\"The Conversation,\\" where at least the line is repeated several times). This one is what you might call an unfair mystery, since we actually see one movie and then find out what we saw wasn't real (like one of those old movies where everything turns out to be a dream). The problem is compounded by an overwhelming and corny musical score and some truly dreadful \\"acting\\" by Leonardo diCaprio, whose technique consists of knitting his brows, looking serious, and affecting a hopelessly hokey \\"New England accent\\" (\\"I'm a cawp, a mahshal\\"). When he 'emotes' he also manages to look really stupid. How on earth did this guy become a star?  He can't act his way out of a paper bag. As for Max von Sydow and Ben Kingsley, they seem to be doing self-parody here. They need a new act. The film is loaded with idiotic lines like, \\"He's here. Laeddis. I can feel him!\\" By the way, the name is spelled this way because it's part of the immortal anagram. (Gimme a break!) The rest of the actors seem to be having a hard time keeping a straight face through the absurdities they are forced to utter. Some viewers seem to think this movie is about personal identity or something. It's not. It's about a poor screenwriter and a frankly over-the-hill director playing silly mind games with their audience.
0143034901|2.0|I don't think this book lived up to its potential. Considering the detailed descriptions of the streets and neighborhoods of Barcelona, plus the explicit mention of Victor Hugo (who masterfully wrote of Paris in The Hunchback of Notre Dame as if the city itself were a character in the novel), I kept waiting to feel immersed in Barcelona - but it never happened. The author seems to try too hard in his efforts to paint the image of a city full of mystery; shadows are mentioned excessively, even for a book with the word \\"shadow\\" in its title.<br /><br />The book seems to have been written for an audience that prides itself in being well-read. A reader who understands all the literary references will feel smart for recognizing names and titles. At times, the book seems to speak specifically to readers who secretly want to be published authors themselves.<br /><br />I wasn't fond of the manner in which the story's mysteries unfolded. The main character, Daniel, repeatedly found no shortage of strangers who were willing to reveal to him everything they knew about third parties, even though they knew nothing about Daniel or his motivations for poking around other people's business.<br /><br />I did enjoy the character of Fermin Romero de Torres, who was, in my opinion, the most developed and most interesting character. There was humor in his description as well as in his dialogue. If this book were a movie, he would have stolen every scene he was in.<br /><br />The story itself was not uninteresting, but it stopped short of being intriguing or riveting. There is so much foreshadowing and dropping of hints that I was rarely surprised when a revelation was made. On page 56, I made a prediction that came true on page 421. It wasn't until 2/3 of the way through the book that I finally read something that made me want to read more to find out what happened next. About 40 pages after that, the melodramatic stage that had been set finally seemed justified. After 400+ pages of storytelling, the last 40 pages were the best.were the best.
B003R7L1CE|4.0|This is a good book, but first the problems. I bought the Kindle version for my iPod and some of it doesn't come out very well. Mostly it's still quite readable but when I got to the tables at the back I found they were scrambled and I couldn't make heads or tails of them. However, after playing around for a while I eventually discovered that if I turned the iPod to the horizontal position and reduced the type size to the minimum the tables became legible. This is something Kindle should tell us about as I'm sure there are many people who will waste a lot of time trying to figure it out - if they ever do! Also, as other reviewers have pointed out, this book is marred by numerous basic spelling and grammatical errors. It seems that no one bothered to check the Kindle version which is a foolish way to save money as selling defective products is a sure way to lose customers.   As for the book itself, I think it's excellent. The main message of the book is that you don't need to go to a gym to get in shape. You can just use your own body most of the time and when equipment is needed you can use household furniture and objects. This is good news for those of us who believe that the only correct way to get in shape is to pump iron, preferably at a gym and under supervision. Although this book is aimed at would-be Swarzeneggers (see the picture of the author on the cover!) Mark Lauren shows how these exercises can be adapted to people of any fitness level. And you don't have to invest a lot of time; Mark recommends just 20 to 30 minutes a day, four days a week which is possible for even very busy people - especially as you don't need to go anywhere or do any preparation. However, if you seriously want to build muscle and trim down, you'll have to put in a lot of effort during your practice time (and as well watch your diet).  For those who are not so young or fit, I'd recommend taking a very gradual approach, focusing on form and only going to about 70 percent of your capacity for the first few weeks or months. It may also be better to do two or three short sessions a day instead of a 20 or 30-minute block. Going harder will only result in some very sore muscles and possibly injury causing permanent damage. This will not only discourage you, but will also result in slower progress as you'll have to take long breaks to recover.  If you want to get fit, get this book and just do it! No excuses. Well done, Mark.
B002VPE1YS|3.0|I like the quilted padding of this case, the drawstring closure that locks shut, and the fact that I can hang it on a pack, my belt, or whatever. It's a bit long and deep for some items; look at the measurements and think about what you want to carry before you select such a case. Oh, and it's washable, a benefit in my book. It should be possible to open the bag with one hand, but it may not be easy to remove a camera or mobile phone with one hand, so try it out and plan accordingly. It's a neatly made item and perfect for many uses, and I expect that it will be serving me longer than some of the item's I'll carry it in.
B002ZG997C|5.0|One Word: POWERFUL.  My huband and I loved the movie and highly recommend it. (Yesterday was our first time using the \\"Redbox\\" rental system (outside of Walgreens.)  We watched this movie twice for $1.07! (tax included!)  Almost bought it for $18.00, too.     It was deep and the acting superb.    We agree...you will need to watch it twice to catch a lot of small things that you will likely miss the first time.    I don't want to give it away, so I will make just a couple of comments.    When asked what was different back \\"then\\", Washington remarked, \\"we threw things away that people kill each other to get now.\\" (i.e. WATER, chapstick, hand wipes??!)  I believe it. The excesses of \\"yesterday\\" are beginning to catch up with us...even today.    Totally believeable that 40 years from now, the minority of this country will NOT know how to read. The ones who can will be the powerful, the ones who can't...    It's hard to comment much more based on the fact that I don't want to give any more away but the bottom line is:  This film is well-worth watching and confirms what Believers already know...despite being in the world, we are not OF it and we ultimately have the victory!
1402756399|5.0|This is a short and simple review as other reviewers have aptly described in detail all this book has to offer. When I received it, I rediscovered the joy you had when you were a child of opening up a book that you just knew you were going to treasure - the Origin itself, the illustrations (both drawings & pictures), the excerpts from Darwin's other writings and from the captain of the Beagle - all add to the experience. I thoroughly enjoyed getting lost in it this morning when it arrived as my delight grew as I turned it page by page. I bought it for me, but also with the intent to take it into the classroom to share with my students. This will arouse much more interest among them than a copy of just the Origin itself. Perusing the many illustrations can't help but draw you into reading the captions then some of Darwin's nearby words. Oh, I have no pretensions that the students will read it in it's entirely, but some of them will read some of it and seeing its gorgeous, rich treatment cannot but help them to respect the importance of Darwin's work. It is an expense but well worth Amazon's discounted price!    For those students who might be put off from a large, heavy book, I purchased Daniel Loxton's [[ASIN:1554534305 Evolution: How We and All Living Things Came to Be]] which condenses the up-to-date scientific knowledge on evolution into one to two page bits by topic again heavy with illustrations but in very simple text.    As to how I intend to get it into my students' hands? I intend to build one of my evolution labs such that the students will need to move station by station and will put these books (and maybe a couple of questions to make sure they open them) at one station. The rest of the time I will keep it on display at the front of the room available for checkout during down time and free reading periods.  I will try to remember to let you know how it goes.

B000GWE44U|5.0|The Shining is a classic horror movie that actually caused me to lose some sleep when I first saw it back in the '80s. I'm glad that it is available \\"On-Demand\\" so my son and daughter (now that they are old enough) could see this with us.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall put in great performances as \\"Jack\\" and \\"Wendy\\", respectively, and young Danny Lloyd plays a very creepy Danny\Tony. This is an adaptation of Stephen King's novel by the same name, while it is not as accurate as the later TV movie, it is every bit as creepy and even somewhat more disturbing.<br /><br />Even though this is an older movie and book, there will be no plot spoilers from me: The story centers around a family (Jack, Wendy, and Danny) who take on the winter upkeep of a mountain hotel in the \\"off season\\". Jack is hoping to use the time to write a novel, while Wendy and Danny are left to their own devices. Like many King stories, the location and history (both explained very early) of the hotel are key plot elements. Nicholson's portrayal of a man slowly going insane is truly brilliant and some of the lines are very memorable.<br /><br />Many of the scenes are often spoofed on popular modern shows, which is why we wanted our teens to see it. I should note that there are a lot of disturbing and gory images all throughout this movie, including some full frontal nudity that I honestly hadn't remembered was in it (likely because I first saw this on \\"Network\\" TV). While not a traditional family movie, there are obviously some scenes that can be somewhat awkward.<br /><br />Even with all of that, this is still a fantastic movie that has become part of our popular culture.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
0312370849|5.0|The early chapters of Sarah's Key were painful to read. In the beginning, the novel alternates chapters between 10-year old Sarah's life and modern day Julia.  Sarah's story centers around when she, her mother, and her father are taken as part of the round up of all Jews to Nazi camps with Auschwitz as the final destination while her younger brother is left behind to face an equally awful fate. Modern-day Julia is an American journalist who is living in Paris and is given the assignment of writing an article for the 60th anniversary of what has become known as Rafle du Vel' d'Hiv, the roundup and murder of Parisian Jews in 1942. It was painful to read Sarah's chapters because they were so well written that you could imagine this travesty while also questioning how something so horrific could have been caused by human choices and abuse of power. Sarah's chapers were so painful to read that I was relieved when the two parallel stories melded together and the rest of Sarah's story was told through Julia. While heart wrenching, I gained insight into a horrific event that I knew little about.

Lisbeth, with all her virtues and faults, is an unusual heroine for the times, and I found her intriguing, intelligent, thoughtful and courageous.

B001KZVQJI|5.0|One of the most compelling and engaging platonic love stories to illuminate the resplendent plane. What could be more archetypically heroic than the two protagonists atop the Empire State willing to sacrifice his/her life for the other?<br /><br />On another level, Mr. Jackson renders a rather cynical (albeit accurate) view of humanity; greedy, perfidious, and brutal.<br /><br />The film amalgamates action, sci-fi, horror, and romance masterfully...quite an accomplishment. Jackson had been ruminating on this story (the 1933 version being his favorite film) for most of his life, and it shows.<br /><br />An imperfect masterpiece that dwarfs the 1933 classic. Truncate the first 40 minutes and the excess in the insect pit...perfect.

B003OF3R0S|4.0|As much as I love Avenged Sevenfold, I can only honestly give this album 3 stars, for as that it is a satisfactory purchase, but it doesn't compare to all of their previous releases. I can almost sense that part of this has to do with the rev being absent, He was such a creative mind, a true musician and an incredibly talented songwriter.<br /><br />The album delivers really well up until the seventh track, \\"God Hates Us All\\", after that the album has a substantial lost of dynamics and hooks that were so predominant in A7X.<br /><br />I see \\"Nightmare\\" as a natural regression in their style and performance. Some of these songs remind me of their early stuff, aggressive and fast paced with heavy (and obvious) influences from Metallica and Guns and Roses. Listen to \\"Buried Alive\\" and \\"So Far Away\\" and you'll see what I'm saying.<br /><br />Overall, if you are a hardcore fan, you must get this album, like I said before, it is worth the cash and time. If not don't expect another City of Evil.<br /><br />Respect to el Reverendo Ptolomeo Plagas.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|The sound quality of these headphones is unbelievable. I was floored when I first heard them. The depth of bass I can achieve - while at the same time having crystal clear highs - is epic, to say the least.<br /><br />These headphones are also remarkably comfortable. I haven't worn them for an extended period of time yet, but I can imagine being able to wear them for hours. They're very light and easy on the ears.<br /><br />My one beef about these headphones is the cord. My old headphones had a spiral cord, so it wasn't nearly as long but still extended when I needed it to. These have a straight cord, which is a little cumbersome given the purpose for which I use these headphones. However, this is almost a non-issue - these headphones still deserve a solid 5 stars, and I can probably find a way to remedy the issue of the cord length (bundle up the excess cord with an elastic or something).<br /><br />I would highly recommend these to anyone who needs a pair of really good headphones for a relatively low price.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|The terminator series makes a great blu-ray dvd.  Sounds and picture are an obvious improvement.
0679746323|5.0|Well written and meticulously researched, it is a fascinating history of both Mao and China during Mao's rule. It will certainly challenge any glorified images of Mao that one might harbor. This book has been accused of being too \\"one-sided\\", personalized, and \\"extreme\\". However, there is a great body of historical information that supports this history and view of Mao. The book is not extreme - Mao was extreme, in his narcissism and cruelty. Although he liked to portray himself as a Marx or Trotsky, in reality he was a Stalin.

B001PU8N0I|5.0|If you are a fan of BBC period flicks, this is one you should add to your collection. Little Dorrit is a lovable character who you root for the entire movie. It is a bit long but well worth the effort. The characters are well-developed and the mystery keeps you guessing.
B003OF3R0S|5.0|I have only one word to describe this album....BREATHTAKING! From \\"Nightmare\\" to \\"Natural Born Killer\\" I was amazed then I heard \\"So Far Away\\" and couldnt believe that it had pushed me even further. They rounded out the whole album just beautifully. I am a life long A7X fan and have not been dissapointed by any album thus far and am glad to say that will continue. Respect to \\"the REV\\" I am just glad I had the oppurtunity to see them when they were up and coming and just last year after the release of the self titled album. Cant wait to see them again this August I recommend the live shows for anyone who hasnt seen them, you won't be dissapointed. I hope they can continue to make music.....together.....foREVer!
B003C1QIO6|4.0|Jack Johnson lost his father and his will to write before a sudden flood of songs emerged for the creation of \\"To The Sea,\\" dedicated to his father's memory. While the songs rarely stray far from Jack's usual sunny surfer sound, there are a few moments where the grown-up lost-boy lets his emotions free in the lyrics. The result is my favorite Jack Johnson CD to date.<br /><br />Both \\"To The Sea\\" and \\"Only The Ocean\\" have the emotional tug to them that has sometimes been absent from Jack's easy-going music. He was exploring relationships more on 2008's \\"Sleep Through The Static;\\" this time he's hitting the notes even better. And yet, his music, guitar playing and style are as smooth as always.<br /><br />I am also enjoying his maturing lyrics outside the relationships. There's a certain Kinksian quality to \\"No Good With Faces\\" and \\"Pictures of People Taking Pictures,\\" which ups the ante. \\"Red Wine, Mistakes and Mythology\\" is standard Jack Johnson, with a fun feel to it, with the clever wordplay and the sing-song feel of his best work. As always, Johnson sets a mood and runs with it through \\"To The Sea,\\" and ultimately it's a satisfying one.
B003ITZBVS|5.0|Been a fan of Batman for decades. I've seen the movie and putting aside the Jokers  voice, it was excellent. The plot certainly is very good coupled with the emotions   we all know and love about the Bat, makes for a wonderful viewing experience
B001OQCV2E|1.0|I labored through the disaster film \\"2012\\" last night and I was deeply diisappointed. Not only does this flick have a silly and totally unbelievable storyline, but it runs 2 hours and 38 minutes (should have been no more than 90 minutes) long. Though it does have some excellent special effects, the action scenes are ridiculously funny. I'm sure the producers didn't plan it that way. However, if you just want to see a visual, mindless popcorn pooper, this one is for you.
B0019CSXAM|1.0|I think the show is great, but i want to make sure that whoever buys this season, or any purchase at all, does not purchase from the company \\"youikethat\\".<br /><br />i purchased season 3 and 4 from youlikethat, and when i received my packages, i noticed that season 3 had only disc 1 and 2 but no disc 3. i notified amazon who said i would have to return the season and wait 4 weeks for my money back, then repurchase with a different company. i left a negative feedback for youlikethat and they promptly emailed saying they would fix the error. they asked for my info said it would be shipped, then completely stopped any communication- it has been over three weeks with no contact.<br /><br />they have NO problem recieving a purchasers money and giving them a defective product, then apologize and sweet talk the buyer. once the buyer removes the contact, they skip town.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY FROM YOULIKETHAT, THEY STEAL YOUR MONEY AND GIVE FAULTY PRODUCTS.
B00008BXJF|5.0|This is as good a record as you'd get for ANY band in rock, metal, or any other genre you'd like to add. As innovative and musically brilliant as anything you'd hear, if you are reading this review. Not much to add, but this is one of those records that I could listen any time, any day, on and on...
B003HFFVDQ|5.0|This year has been a huge year for any electronic music lover.All the big names have dropped albums this year and they have all been sweet.The crystal method did a great job with divided by night.The prodigy nailed it out of the park with invaders.And the The chemical brothers just hit a grand slam wit this album.Like others have said they did thisone pretty much on there own and it couldnt sound better.This is some of the best work i have ever heard.The compression on the album is outstanding and my favorite tracks are swoon and dissolve.I recommend this to any fan a great album that these guys should be very proud of.
B0031RAOW8|3.0|Warning: This review is a spoiler fest, so please do not read it if you're yet to watch the film.<br /><br />This is a very emotional movie, it WILL break your heart. Based on a true Japanese story. Hachi is an Akita dog who is brought up by a caring music teacher. After forming a very close bond with his dog, the owner dies and we are made to endure the most depressing 30 minutes in the history of cinema. For the next 9 years, Hachi waits outside the train station for his master to return. Until he passes too.<br /><br />The reason I need to include spoilers is because I must express my frustration with this film. I cannot understand how the owner's family didn't make an effort to let the dog realize his master was dead. He should have been allowed to interact with the dead body. Dogs understand death by experience, they need to smell and see the body and experience it to mourn and find closure.<br /><br />What we had in this movie is animal torture and not for one moment do I believe this was inevitable and normal.<br /><br />I understand that this is what happened in the real story that the film is based on. In that case the story doesn't deserve a movie.<br /><br />Unfortunately in today's world we are made to be tough, objective, a bit heartless and detach ourselves from our personal memories and feelings. This movie educates us to be loyal to our feelings and memories. In that respect, I applaud the film. Of course it's no secret that this particular breed has been domesticated for their companionship and loyalty. Come a long way from wolves.<br /><br />But about how so much of this dog's life was needlessly and painfully wasted on an illusion, I am very upset, and it does not make for great viewing. There is no message, there is just tears.
1595141715|5.0|The following is the review I posted to my school library blog for students:    This weekend, I read one of the best books I've had the pleasure of reading, and I just have to share.  To be honest, the book didn't impact me as much as it might have had I read it in high school, or even college, but  Th1rteen R3asons Why, by Jay Asher, should be on the recommended reading list for every high school student, and their parents, because it really makes you think about how the things you do impact other people.  In honor of the title, I have come up with my own Th1rteen R3asons Why I think you should read this book:    1.  Every single high school student will see themselves in one of the two main characters in some way.    2.  It's real and honest about the trauma of being a teenager, which is rare in a book written by an adult.    3.  It shows how people can become so wrapped up in their own lives that they fail to see warning signals from others.    4.  Just like in real life, there is no neat, happy ending.    5.  It emphasizes the need to treat other people the way you want to be treated.    6.  The book highlights how easy it could be to slip through the cracks if you don't have the courage to ask for help.    7.  No one wants to wake up one day to find out they are on the list.    8.  It illustrates the need to speak up and tell people how you really feel, because if you wait too long, it might be too late.    9.  The book reminds us all that no matter how bad you might feel about yourself, there is probably someone out there you don't even know about who thinks you're wonderful.    10.  Everyone makes mistakes, but this story reminds us all how not admitting those mistakes can have a profound impact on many lives.    11.  It reminds us to choose our friends carefully.    12.  It's not the fact that one of the main characters is dead that counts, but the reasons why.    13.  What the book is really trying to say is that no matter how bad it gets, life is always worth it.    This book is now in our collection and at the public library.  Reserve your copy now, the holds list is filling up fast!
B0001AVZA8|1.0|When I got the DVD it would not play on my DVD player because it was set up for a region 2 or 5 instead of 1 for the USA.  When I complained a full refund of $6.37 was offered if I would send the item back.  Thinking that buying the envelope and postage would probably be more then the refund I decided not to bother or to purchase any other DVDs from this company.
0307454541|3.0|i have to admit that this book was difficult to get through.  the names of all the cities confused me... and i had a hard time keeping track of who was who in the vanger family... i wish the character of lisbeth salander was more of the main story line... i found her very intriguing...
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This is the first drama/musical that hooked me from the beginning. Grasp your emotions because they will twist and wind around every scene- happy, sad, lust.
B002MTTZ5I|5.0|This album is not for everyone, but it certainly IS for me.  Steel Panther manages to raise the word \\"profane\\" to a brand-new level by poking fun at the excesses of the greatest decade, and the greatest music scene.    In a nod to realism to the 80's L.A. glam metal scene, the lyrics have been simulated to be  written by a rocker with a single-digit IQ or a hormone-crazed thirteen year old. While the history of rock includes strong innuendo in all genres, Feel the Steel casts that off and gets right to the point (which I think is absolutely hilarious).  What cannot be overstated is that these guys are FANTASTIC players.  The music is solid and it ROCKS.  They obviously had fun writing and recording the album, which is produced as well as any of the top sellers of the 80's.    There are a number of bad reviews from people who don't get it.  As I said, It's not for everyone.  But as an erstwhile metal player myself and a refugee of the Kurt Cobain wars, this album makes me happy.
B0013LKZWS|5.0|I've loved Sara's work ever since I wore out my copy of Careful Confessions. My sisters live in Irvine, where Sara often played before she became famous, and they loved her work. They sent me a copy of her CD and I just could NOT stop playing it.  Gravity is my absolute favorite song; it hits me in the heart every single time I hear it (and, trust me, I've listened to it a LOT!), but every song on this album is truly wonderful. There's not a dud among them.<br /><br />However, I'm wondering if anyone knows if the acoustic songs on the second disk are the same as the ones on [[ASIN:B000CAK7FG Careful Confessions]]?  If so, you're in for a rare treat. As much as I love Sara's work, after cutting my teeth on the simple, pared-down versions of her songs, the orchestrations on Little Voice don't seem to improve much.  In the acoustic versions on [[ASIN:B000CAK7FG Careful Confessions]], the beauty of her songwriting and the strength of her voice are truly highlighted.
B003L5LEYW|5.0|I have been listening to this CD every day since my boyfriend bought it. I stole it and won't give it back to him. But I can't help it; it's good, I can't get enough of them!
B000EAT246|4.0|This movie might not have gotten good reviews from the so-called  expert critics, but it's a good one, and a good addition to our film library.
0446691437|1.0|There is nothing remotely creative about this book. It's a small book, too, a quick read, but not worth the time or money.
B003F3NDOO|5.0|I watched this from epidose 1 and loved it.  The show seemed to start in one place and ended up going into a much better direction.  The first 2 or 3 episodes are good but as the season continues the characters get funnier and funnier.  They turn into people that you care about and want to see what the writers can come up with next.  Travis (the son) is great and he and Courtney (Jules) are wonderful together.  Actually they all are wonderful together and feed off one another very well. They really seem like that close extended friend family we all have or want.
B00186DV1U|4.0|SPOILER ALERT!!  Ending SPOILER ALERT!!    The following might mess up the ending for you a bit but if you already watched the movie or when you've finished the movie, please read.    At the end of the movie, please take note of few obviously weird things:    1. He got shot in the chest and said he broke his ribs....what?  2. He got shot and was still able to fight the bad guy.....shot in the chest mind you?  3. He walks home, even though shot in the chest, with just a few scratches. No hospital attention or anything. However, he most likely did went to a hospital but there was a major cutscene between the time when he walked down the elevator after killing the bad guy and ending up at the airport, which gives this assumption.    I feel this movie is Eastwood's way of further glorifying himself in a sense, this is my personal opinion.  I bet a few people are going to give the excuse of \\"cause he's Clint Eastwood, he can survive anything!\\" Nice try guys....    Some of you guys might also try to explain him surviving the shot by saying he had a bullet proof vest on HOWEVER the movie never showed him putting it on or having it after getting shot....therefore........
B00005JKGK|5.0|I enjoyed this movie very much.  I like that it shows us a different situation for each younger woman, and tells us of the history of their mothers.  I really felt what the women were feeling.
038572179X|3.0|An occasionally tediously introspective blend of *Cold Mountain*-meets-*Crime and Punishment*. A few reasonably-hard-to-see twists; sympathetic characters, good writing. Worth reading once.
0735619670|5.0|I was told this was a classic, must read for every programmer. I found that it is a classic, must-read that no programmer should be without.
B003PGNBO8|5.0|This show's premise had me interested before the first episode aired. First viewing did not disappoint and the plot just kept getting more complex and intriguing as the series progressed.  With an unexplainable hiatus in the middle of the first season, it's return in March had me uncharacteristically (for a television event) jubilant. Not a single episode disappointed.     ABC needs to give this show a chance. Even MASH did not find it's audience in the first season. And they did not have to contend with split seasons and advertisers not counting viewers who watch recorded episodes.     This is a show that has to be watched from the beginning and in order. I look forward to being able to watch it again for things that I've missed and the fine acting and production values.
B003PGNBO8|5.0|hands down best series to buy... watching this whole dvd makes the whole thing make sense, but one things missing.... wheres season 2?
B002RV01Q8|5.0|I like that the CD and the DVD have a few different songs, because there are more total songs.  All of the videos are 4:3 wide-screen or 4:3 full-screen, but the quality is fine.  The only minor issue for me is that there is a song or two on the CD with lead guitar.  I prefer the softer songs.
0618918248|5.0|The God Delusion is a great, informative book. I have been an atheist for a few years, and I thank Richard Dawkins for giving me the tools to discover how to express my views on atheism and religion.
B002VPE1B6|2.0|People are you serious over 2.7 billion worldwide? My hope for good cinema taste is dead. Awesome special effects, terrible acting, terrible plot terrible story. DId anyone else feel like they were watching Ferngully? Cause I did I was waiting for Batty to start rapping. The most overhyped movie I have probably ever seen. I cant believe so many fell for it. Wasnt the worst movie ever but far from the best.
B0000AQS0F|2.0|People rave about Firefly - it's almost like it's formed its own religion. But personally, I don't understand it. The story is mediocre, the camera work leaves a lot to be desired, and the acting was nowhere near the actors' ability.    The first episode is available on Hulu right now. I would suggest watching it before buying to decide whether you'll actually like it.    I don't expect many people who are actually looking for good information to actually see this, though... I'm sure tons of Firefly fans will have ranked this as unhelpful first...
B002VPE1Z2|5.0|This Amazon Basics case is a perfect fit for my 4.3 inch GPS.  However, it looks as if a 5 inch would fit also.  The padding around the main compartment is more than adequate for a soft side case.  The Velcro closure for the flap is definitely up to the job of keeping a GPS or small camera secure.  There is also a small zippered compartment on the front that zips shut and is not padded.  The case may be easily attached to a belt with the Velcro fastened belt loop.  All in all, a good value.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|Avatar was aesome and captivating the movie had my attention the entire movie never got boring or tiring  graphics were way cool.
0385523904|5.0|I picked this up after I heard news of it winning a prize from the BBC.  It's really worth the hype the news coverage generates, great read.  Real hard work by the author shows through, real like stories woven into a great read.  Last time I read a book like this, as good as this was the Long Walk back at the turn of the decade.    Thanks for a great read!    Rob
B00009Z574|4.0|The only thing that kills Tormado is Rick Wakeman's excruciating and glitzy keyboards.  If this album were recorded with other, more ear friendly keyboard sounds, then this album would have gotten five stars (from me at least).  There is a lot of treasure buried somewhere in this album, you just have to take the time to find it.
B003ELOQD4|3.0|The other reviews are correct.  It seems as if the editors weren't even listening to/feeling the story.  Too many unnecessary cuts, dissolves, etc.  I'll leave the video comments to other reviews.    My major disappointment is with the audio engineering.  I was very excited to hear this in high-def Bluray format, but the sound mixing is just horrible.  Bono's vocals are cemented to the center channel with no feel of depth and width. The surrounds don't offer much in terms of ambiance.  Made a direct comparison to Madonna's Stick n Sweet Tour on BD, and the two discs are worlds apart.  Too bad.
B00005AQE8|5.0|THIS is gonna be  short and to the point,I have this blazing album from it's release, and it is still new to me!!. A double disc set consisting of great rhythms and 2PAC at his most expressive ever!!. He was at his very best here. With no fillers,you just put it in your disc player and prepare yourself for an epic!!, highly recomended,it surely won't dissapoint. THIS IS PERHAPS THE ONLY GANGSTA RAP ALBUM YOU WILL EVER NEED!!!.
0439023483|4.0|Once I got past the book being told in present tense and that all the dialogue is followed by 'says' (it read awkwardly for the longest), the story pulled me in. I felt the characters' pain, winced at the dystopian world, and never wanted the story to stop.     Then, I got to the end and begged it to stop. Once the game is over, the story should have ended. The rest of the book is boring. Yes, there were lots of loose ends to tie up, but I was done by then. Done enough that I've haven't been interested in reading either of the sequels, so I can't comment on them.     No matter if you're a Young Adult or an old adult, you'll probably enjoy this book.

B003L45JLW|5.0|I was very excited to receive this BD.  I have been waiting for mainstream artists to start releasing music in hi-def audio.  On a decent system, CDs sound flat... and MP3's?  forget it!    This BD does not disappoint.  The aural imaging is beautiful. The 2-channel soundtrack is okay, but the magic happens in 5.1 DTS-Master HD audio!  You get lost in the music, and catch yourself smiling. You can preview the tracks at Tom Petty's website.     I hope that audio recording execs are listening!  This stuff is good... please release more of it and watch as people start catching on.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|Outstanding adaptation of Queen Victoria's early years beautifully played by Emily Blunt.  A rare look into Victorian life, palace intrigue plus an exquisite love story.  Highly recommended.  One of my all-time favorite movies.
B0060ANOXY|2.0|This gets two stars for \\"What God Wants\\" Parts I & II, two really good songs from an otherwise horrible record. Frankly I don't understand all the positive reviews nor do I understand how anyone could put this in the same league as\\"The Wall\\" or \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\". It's not even as good as \\"The Final Cut\\" and \\"The Final Cut\\" sucks. \\"Perfect Sense\\" is Waters' worst song ever. The sheer awfulness of \\"Watching TV\\", his laughable duet with Don Henley, reminds me of \\"You Got the Touch\\" from \\"Boogie Nights\\". And the vicious attack on Andrew Lloyd Webber in \\"It's A Miracle\\" -who even knows what that's about?<br /><br />I can respect \\"Radio KAOS\\" even if it sounds like a bad attempt at a Duran Duran record with a concept stolen from \\"The Who Sell Out\\". At least Waters was trying to do something different. Here he's just recycling old themes with non-melodies while sprinkling in sound effects and samples from old songs in a feeble attempt to show he was Pink Floyd. He wasn't and that's why everybody heads for the beer stand at his live shows as soon as he starts playing his solo stuff. I'm glad he finally made the decision to ditch it altogether in favor of lipsynching to \\"The Wall\\" alongside big inflatable puppets and cardboard bricks.<br /><br /> \\"So he picks up a stone that looks like a bone\\".  Roger Waters lyrical genius - my ass!
B003OF3R0S|5.0|I decided to buy this album for the drummer Jimmy \\"THE REV\\" and because I still liked the sound of City of Evil.. But this album seems rather darker then the others.. I guess I liked the Conor oberst esque song \\"Dear God\\".
B002RAREAK|2.0|I used to like usher. I am almost 40 and married with children. I guess maybe it just does not appeal to me anymore. I do like the song ( omg ) but the rest of the cd I did not like at all. I am going to give it to my 18 year old daughter. It's probably more her pace.
030745455X|3.0|After recently reading \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,\\" I was so intrigued by its storyline and characters that I immediately picked up the next book in the trilogy. Overall, I liked it very much and it certainly kept me turning pages for hours on end! As with the first book in the trilogy, the story is very slow to get started. Once it did get going (after Part I and well into Part II), it definitely held my attention. Again, Larsson fills this crime novel with excellent plot twists (a couple of which were a total surprise to me) and many suspenseful sequences of events, leading up to a very thrilling conclusion.<br /><br />For those of you who have read \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\": if the character of Lisbeth Salander at all piqued your interest, then read \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\"--it is ultimately her story this time around, and Larsson further develops her history and character.<br /><br />If you did enjoy the first book in the trilogy, you should be aware that this second book treats the plot development much differently, as most of it is written much more along the lines of a police procedural crime novel. I actually preferred the storyline of the first book; it seemed a more inventive to me.<br /><br />I ended up giving the book 3.5 (I would give a half star in my rating if Amazon allowed that!) stars instead of four because while I was thoroughly entertained by this book, as I said, I preferred the first book a bit more. Also, I felt it was unnecessary for the author to continually refer to the events that Mikael and Lisbeth went through in the first book, since most readers probably read Book 1 in the trilogy first. If you're a fan of police procedural crime fiction and are itching to discover the secrets of Lisbeth's past, then read Book 2--you won't be disappointed.
0143118420|4.0|This is less of a review of what the book is than what the book is not. I've read so many criticisms of the book, that she's self indulgent, she destroyed her marriage, she's narcissistic,blah, blah, blah, Frankly I don't think she'd disagree on many of these points. However the book isn't subtitled,\\" a guide to giving personal peace and inner wisdom\\". It's one womans journey of self actualization complete with warts and all. Who cares why her marriage failed? To me that's their business and a different book. What she's telling is what comes after. How this woman got back to her own true self. Or at least found the path. I thought it funny, touching, and real along the way. If you're looking for a guide to inner peace , look in the self help section. If you're looking for a readable,relatable,voice with some cool observations along the way, check it out.
B003GIRCFE|5.0|Stevenson draws you deeper and deeper into this chilling tale of a frightening addiction. Dr. Jekyll is a man exploring the soul, who discovers something hidden inside himself. This book weaves artfully around the always horrific subject of the evil within us all. Stevenson's beautiful language and imagery envelopes us in his mind, holding us frozen until the very last page. This story is as magnifcant as it is eerie. I loved this book. READ IT.<br />Afterward, you may not want to look too closely into the mirror...
B003PGNBO8|5.0|Best show that was canceled. They didn't even give it a chance. I bet it will do great this fall! Bring it back!
B003HARV3Y|2.0|My irritation with this movie came from the fact that the book had real potential for becoming the next great teen adventure series. I read the books a few years ago, and I knew the series' dynamic characters, winding storyline, and breathtaking imagery would make an amazing movie. Of course, when I heard the movie was in the works I was very excited.    But then I saw the movie, and was horribly disappointed.     I did not expect the movie to stick to the events and details of the book with extreme precision, but I didn't expect such a complete disregard for the original story either. Some differences are easy to tolerate (such as the change in the character's ages, or the actors' differing physical appearance from their counterparts in the novels) but most of the changes were too great to bear. All of a sudden, Percy has escaped camp with Annabeth and Grover on a personal mission to gather three pearls that will allow him to enter the underworld long enough to explain to Hades that he is not the lightning thief and then escape unscathed. Virtually every aspect of Percy's original journey is either omitted or reworked to fit the new story line.     The only detail I liked was the definitive final battle with Luke through the New York skyline (which was also not part of the original story) because Luke's defeat meant that there will most likely not be a sequel to this terrible film.[[ASIN:B003HARV3Y Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief]][[ASIN:B002ZG98J6 Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief [Blu-ray]]]
0143034901|5.0|I've had this book on my \\"to read\\" list for years, and finally decided to crack it open this week. A few short days later I'm the richer for the experience and sad that I hadn't read it sooner!  I found this story captivating on so many levels - characters, back-stories, and real history were all wound around a compelling plot, love story, and an exploration of how literature can literally move and shape our lives.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is the first and only Amazon review I have done, but I felt compelled bc this work out is terrific.  After my third baby, my weight loss plateaued and I just could not get the last 10 pounds to budge, even when I was really watching what I was eating.  The problem was that I was not doing enough exercise.  Being a working mother of 3 small children, I needed something short but intense and effective.  This is it!  I have been doing \\"the shred\\" for 5 weeks and I have lost 7 pounds.  I have been watching what I eat, but not starving myself by any means.  Not only have I lost weight, but my muscle tone and general definition have noticeably increased - I have been getting compliments from everyone.  It is so so so nice to feel like myself again.  Yes, at moments you will hate Jillian, but if you stick to it, it really works.  I do the work out 3-4 times per week and I'm currently on Level 2.  My goal is to work up to Level 3 in a couple of weeks and stay there for at least a month.  No matter what, I think it will always be a great work out to come back to. Definitely recommend you give it a try!!!
B001ANUXUI|5.0|I'm a musician and a writer. This may be worthy of mention as I share my review about this album. One word sums this album up for me: perfection. After decades of listening to rock, from Elvis, through the blues-based, the progressive and operatic rock, the punk, the heavy metal, to some of the darkest music (and I do like it all) I have found only a few albums that have reached perfection. Just an absolute perfect output of aesthetics from the first to the last note. Works that will completely capture the emotion that rock n' roll is after: the emotion behind FREEDOM. This album captures it. And I consider it one of only eight (not ten, not fifty or twenty five, there's no perfect numbers), eight masterpieces in rock.  so you just gotta have this one. Enjoy.
B003ES5JDS|5.0|I never read the original comic story so I don't know how it went... but this movie was freakin' awesome! Charaters seem spot on as well... A Batman obsessed with his mission, a Nightwing that remembers he moved on b/c he was tired of batman's crap and a joker that's just crazy as hell. I love how DC has started making their movies darker and less dependent on the 90's animated series. The movie starts with Joker beating robin with a tire iron, later kills another crime bosses 8 guards like it's nothing, and later has the joker pouring gasoline over a rival crime boss trying to set them ablaze to get the attention of the title characters... That's how I like my joker, bat-snot crazy with a smile. Another scene a gangster is about to light up a rival mobster with a molotov cocktail and the red hood shoots the bottle setting the would be killer ablaze.     The voice actors did a great job. The story was awesome, dark, and seriously action packed. And they packed more characters in than I was expecting to see. DC has been slowly stepping up their game lately ever since Marvel merged with Disney.    *People need to stop reviewing this movie poorly because they didn't use the original voice actors. Hamill has not voiced Joker (except in the game Arkham Asylum) since like 2003... deal with it.  *People also need to stop reviewing this movie lower because the FREE digital copy they got doesn't work with their Macs. Boo-Hoo, you didn't pay for it so there's not a reason for it to effect your review.    This movie was so good I was tempted to watch it again right away but it was my friends and he had to go after the movie :( I will DEFINITELY be grabbing this movie up.
0470477237|5.0|\\"It's all about the economy, stupid.  No, it's all about a people-driven economy, stupid.\\"  This statement is incredibly powerful and was the opening and closing statement of Eric Qualman's book, Socialnomics.  In it, Qualman explores how we, the consumers, are finally given the power we deserve to expose the best companies from the worst.  No longer can these corporate giants hide behind closed doors as we have to put up with bad service, products, and experiences.  Our voice is heard through the crowd, and they know it, as we are now influencers, brand ambassadors and ultimately their bread and butter.  Companies now have the responsibility to share ownership of their brands with their consumers, or be left with bad reputations that will ultimately close their business.     Socialnomics is a walkthrough of the last 10 years or so, which is respectively the entire social media age.  If Gary Vaynerchuk's book, Crush It is the intro to social, then Socialnomics is the text book for the advanced social guru.  There are so many examples from the copyright infringement episode of the music industry to the adoption of widespread internet TV.  Traditional advertising will be phased out into incentives on social channels.   I have experienced this phasing with the news as I no longer look for it, it comes to me.  Many of the concepts explained in this book I have been stressing since the start of my own journey through this ever changing, dynamic social environment.    I highly recommend reading this book as it has been an eye-opener into the complexities of the Social Media space.  It will give you a clearer understanding of how and why we should be embracing the social space and what's to come.  In chapter 5, Qualman talks about how the social influence of your friends directly impacts the decisions you make as a consumer.  This illustrates that you are more influenced by friends through social mediums than by how Google ranks brands and products in search results.  Wordof mouth grows to World of Mouth and creates a collective intelligence that will benefit mankind--and marketers--for years to come.

B00008OE4W|4.0|The movie Sneakers was a great movie of the 90s. These group of guys are paid to test possible inadequacies in their security systems in order to help these businesses ramp up their security. It's very high tech meet civil liberties. It's a timeless movie.
B003ES5JE2|5.0|Batman: Under the Red Hood is by far the best animated movie that DC or Marvel has put out in years. I'd go as far as to say that it's the best animated movie that's been made. All other animated movies that have come out recently were always lack luster or you were never completely satisfied. With \\"Under the Red Hood\\", You definitely got your money's worth. The voice acting (And you've got to give it up to Andrea Romano for once again putting together an excellent cast) was superb. Big ups to Jensen Ackles as the Red Hood. Probably did the best job of the cast. Not to take away from any of the other voice actors who did fine jobs themselves. Notably John Dimaggio as the Joker who I thought made the Joker his own with his portrayal. Bruce Greenwood as the Batman was also dead on. Neil Patrick Harris did a pretty good job as Nightwing though he slipped up with the voice once or twice and seemed to use his regular speaking voice. He didn't have a very large role in the feature so it wasn't anything that took away from the movie. Wade Williams also did the Black Mask justice. His character was written a little over the top but Williams captured it very well. I think the fact Judd Winnick (the original writer of Under the Hood) writing the feature is definitely what made it as good as it was. He stayed very true to his original story but the changes he made to the original story still worked out very well. Not only did he take the 2 volumes that comprised the \\"Under the Hood\\" arc and combine them for the movie, he was also able to connect the events of \\"A Death in the Family\\" (Possible *SPOILER*) which is where Jason Todd meets his ultimate demise at the hands of the Joker. End of the day, Batman: Under the Red Hood was an excellent movie that you shouldn't miss. It does not disappoint.

B0039ZF89G|3.0|IF {and it's a very big IF} you had been in your early twenties in 1972 then it was very likely (like me) you had been broke. I got some balance of my three-figure salary and bought the double album. I liked everything about the album ....nostalgia kind of black and white LP cover....and the best songs are Tumbling Dice (superb Charlie Watts drum ending) and Sweet Virginia ... AND it was the right time...Beatles had just splat....If you had this on the record player then you'd also be ready to turn on Santana Abraxas...and John Lennon's Imagine...and Elton John...and Dylan's New Morning.... for many, the world was new in 1972. Buy this super deluxe edition, people, fore keepsake... if you can spare a bit out of your pension funds...
B002UXRGLG|5.0|I had heard that David Attenborough's narration of Life outdid Oprah's U.S. version and Oh how spot on that is. He gets you so hooked on the show that I watched the whole season in 2 days! And now I put it on just to listen to while doing dishes, laundry or any other chores, it's interesting and educational... makes for great background sound. I recommend it to everyone.
B0006DKA2Y|5.0|Great short read for everyone. We all could use a look at what is truly important!
B000XRG9IW|4.0|IN THE FUTURE does not push the boundaries. Of anything. But let's face it, few albums do that anymore. This album is a big step up from Black Mountain's debut album, even though their first wasn't precisely bad, just a bit...bland for my tastes. On this one every song but one feels very well thought out, like there was purpose behind it. The lyrics are actually quite good, something I actually pay attention to. It's nice when the words to a song challenge you to think. Too often these days a catchy melody is as far as artists take song writing. During the more epic instrumental moments on this album I could hear what I likened to Godspeed You! Black Emperor or Mogwai -- you know, bands that can be viscerally overpowering but emotionally understated.<br /><br />Take my favorite song on this album, \\"Tyrants.\\" \\"Bastard, you won't be forgiven/And no, you have not won/Tyrant, you're the plague of existence/Tyrant, you're the king of the damned\\" The song just barely passes the 8-minute mark, and the lyrics are pretty sparse. The song starts out slow, builds to a four minute instrumental breakdown, and then ends quietly, with words sung in barely more than a whisper. I listened to \\"Tyrants\\" on max volume on my Zune, and towards the climax, I started to get those involuntary tears, the ones that aren't from being so connected to words or feelings, but from the sheer power of the sound these people are creating. THIS...is what music can be. And when all that's left in the song in an acoustic guitar a one man channeling Neil Young, you realize that Black Mountain has somehow sucker punched you right in the heart.<br /><br />Speaking of channeling Neil Young, the beautiful song \\"Stay Free\\" sounds like it could be an unreleased Young song. \\"We're fire in the sky/Oh, the death at your door/Oh, stay free\\" A heartbreakingly sad song, and beautifully executed.<br /><br />I think what I love most about Black Mountain, and this album in particular, is that they really don't seem to care about what people think of them. They'd just as soon have a ten minute instrumental break in the midst of a song (\\"Bright Lights\\") as put words in there, and to me that makes them unique. They don't seem to pander. A couple people I have loaned this album out to told me they thought it was a bit boring. Maybe that is what the majority or people would think, but to me you get from this album exactly how much you are willing to put into listening to it carefully. It rewards attention to detail, so it will not be for everyone (I know sometimes I want to just listen to something I can ignore, if that makes sense).<br /><br />One last pro about this album. Most of the songs are sung by a male vocalist, with a fairly distinctive voice and style. A couple are duets, or on-again off-agains, and one, \\"Queens Will Play\\" is sung entirely by a female. And I have to say, she has an amazing voice. That shaky, stilted style that really conveys emotion well. And when the guitar, drums and bass really kick in about halfway through, it's effect is palpable.<br /><br />Really I have only two complaints about this album. The first is that the lengthiest song among them, \\"Bright Lights,\\" is nearly 17 minutes long. Now I have nothing against long songs, I think they can be very cool. But with this one, aside from the rather annoying lyrics of \\"Bright light/bright light/bright light/bright light\\" x20 (and then again later in the song), the transitions within the song are very unpolished. It sounds more like 5 ideas for separate songs that never quite made it, so they tried connecting them all, and it ends up sounding kinda lame. This song is way longer than it should be, but then the song \\"Wild Wind,\\" another slow and very beautiful song, is under 2 minutes. And this is the second complaint I have. Now I understand sometimes this is just the way songs are. If they were to go on too long they'd get repetitive and boring...but still. The song seemed to have so much potential, but as soon as it gets going it's just about over...<br /><br />I really can't say any more. I would recommend to anyone looking to buy this album just to head on over to YouTube and listen to \\"Tyrants,\\" \\"Wucan,\\" or \\"Queens Will Play.\\" If you don't like those you probably won't like this album....    I really can't say any more. I would recommend to anyone looking to buy this album just to head on over to YouTube and listen to \\"Tyrants,\\" \\"Wucan,\\" or \\"Queens Will Play.\\" If you don't like those you probably won't like this album.

B002VKB0M4|4.0|3.8 stars<br /><br />Paris is my favorite city, with SF and Berlin close seconds. After about 20 visits over the last 40 years and some brief spells living there, I love any chance to be in Paree, even if just in spirit, so Parisian films delight and intoxicate with memories and the promise of another visite. Paris the movie offers some nice moments and some good acting, and is a fine film...but as a Parisian classic I can't really rank it up there with Amelie, Breathless, Le Dernier Metro, Day Of The Jackal, Diva, Les Ripoux, and a few others.<br /><br />The highlights include the acting of Binoche and Lucchini, a good script, and of course some fine shots of the town. But despite the realer than usual feel, something didn't quite click for me here. Many might call this episodic flick Altmanesque, and I'd agree, for better and for worse. It's got his multiple storylines, one or three characters too many to get much involved with any of them, and an ending that's a little too forced and tidy, even though nothing is resolved. Which is fine, but I wasn't left with the same feeling of wonder I get when watching any of the other mentioned films, or the same longing to jump on a plane that instant and walk the town for 12 hours day after day.<br /><br />I speak decent French and the subtitles are actually more accurate than usual, though the language is actually nowhere near as idiomatic as one might expect...which is one of my qualms here. It sets out to be a panoply of Paris viewpoints, but there's less local feel than you might expect for each arrondissement and the very different vibes each place has, except perhaps the Pavillon des Viandes...they got that right!<br /><br />The stories are interesting but never really gripped me, and there was more angst and less amused Gallic shrug than I've encountered in the town and France in general. I can't quite put my finger on it, but the happy slyness I love in so many Parisians one meets during non-tourist season (go in late fall, winter, and early spring!) seems rather absent. But perhaps that's a function of the town being, as is said here, for rich people now. It can't be getting any cheaper to live there, no doubt. It's the working class Paris I was looking forward to seeing more of here, but it all felt like a movie in the end.<br /><br />A good movie, well shot and acted, no doubt...but without the magic of so many other Paris films that seem more suffused with the City of Light's glow, both inside and out.g!) seems rather absent.

B0025KVLTW|5.0|If you already have the album and were wondering whether the remastering was worth the purchase, let me say that it is.  The sound in greatly improved and it is like a new listening experience.  Much more detail is present to the music and I heard things that I never heard before--trumpet notes I never noticed, percussion parts such as maraccas that were lost in the mix are now present and alive.  I must say that I haven't enjoyed all the remasters, but this album definitely benefits.  The packaging is also very nice and they finally included the booklet that came with the original album---as it should have always been.  In addition to the comic that tells the story from the movie, there are many other interesting notes about the album.     As far as the album itself, it is fantastic.  In a sense it represented a step back from the concept album that was  Sgt Pepper, but the music continues in the wildly experimental psychedelic vain.  It actually harks back to earlier Beatle albums in its structure in that side one is songs from a film and side two is comprised of additional tracks--just like \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" and \\"Help!\\"      Though the songs lack the concept and cohesion of Sgt Pepper because of how it was put together, song for song, I think this is the better album.  It sounds almost like a greatest hits album, especially since side two is basically the singles from 1967 that were collected together to complete the album.  Some of these were double A sides, so there is barely anything weak sounding.  In the remastering,  The title track is electric and alive like never before--also \\"I am the Walrus\\" is mind blowing.  \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\", \\"Fool on the Hill\\", \\"I am the Walrus\\", \\"Hello Goodbye\\", \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\", \\"Penny Lane\\", \\"All You Need is Love\\" makes 7 hit songs on one album.  That alone should make this one of the best albums ever.  Of the other four selections,  \\"Baby, You're a Rich Man\\" and \\"Your Mother Should Know\\" are good songs and pleasant to listen to, but lack the polish of the others in that they both fall short lyrically.  \\"Mother\\" doesn't go anywhere lyrically and seems more like an idea for a song than a finished product.  \\"Baby\\" has an inane line about keeping your money in a zoo!, but is otherwise very good.  I wish John had spent a few more minutes on that.  It is interesting to note that the melody for the verse of this song was ripped off in the Jackie DeShannon hit \\"Put a Little Love in Your Heart.\\" Blue Jay Way is deary but atmospheric, conjuring a feeling of brooding and full of dread.  I don't listen to it very much, but curiously my 15 year old son loves it.  \\"Flying\\" is simply filler from the movie.    I am glad that this American Album was left in the Beatles cannon, since it is one of the few American albums that was superior to its British counterpart, which was just the film songs on an EP.  Though this is off topic, I also prefer \\"Meet the Beatles' to \\"With the Beatles\\" because it includes \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" and \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\"  and a lot of the cover songs were left off, making it a stronger collection of songs and much more Lennon/McCartney.  I also prefer the trio of American albums \\"Rubber Soul\\"  \\"Yesterday, and Today\\" and \\"Revolver.\\"  By shaving songs off other albums and creating the third, Capitol gave each one a unique flavor not present in the British counter parts.  Rubber Soul is much more folky, because the more rocky songs \\"Drive My Car\\" \\"Nowhere Man\\" and \\"If I needed Someone\\" are left off and a couple of folky songs left over from Help are included.  Like-wise a few rocky songs from Revolver are left off--\\"And Your Bird can Sing\\", \\"She Said She Said\\". Capitol took these songs and a couple of singles-\\"Day Tripper\\", \\"We Can Work it Out\\" to create the third album.  As a result, \\"Revolver\\" sounds much more progressive and psychedelic, Rubber Soul more folky and the newly formed third album, sounds like a fantastic collection of mid-sixties rock (aside from the ballad \\"Yesterday\\").  I am sure some of this preference comes from the fact that I am American and this is how I first experienced the Beatles. Otherwise, I am perfectly satisfied that the British catalog has more artistic integrity and is overall much stronger.      I am glad to have this fabulous album in this form to listen to, and whenever I run across someone who doesn't understand what the fuss about the Beatles was, this is one I want to play for them.  It is a classic and any serious music fan should have it.
B001OQCV2E|4.0|Before I begin my review, I must introduce myself as an optimist and a very emotional, sentimental person who usually prefers happy endings. I cry at episodes of cartoon shows, and I tend to become very emotionally invested in anything I watch or read. Despite this, I have a soft spot for disaster movies, the more over the top the better. I went into this movie already having enjoyed Independence Day and The Day After Tomorrow, but unsure how I would receive this. The trailer wowed me, but I was unsure if I could handle a film of this magnitude.    The title of my review ought to speak for itself: far too many come into this film expecting something that is obviously not part of the Roland Emmerich-disaster-film package deal. You ought to know by now that this is Hollywood: there will be contrived coincidences, bogus science and one-in-a-million-chance events happening every time they need to for the purpose of the story. I pity those who snookered themselves into expecting anything less, and do sincerely hope they find the perfectly realistic, even-tempered and dead-serious film about global apocalypse they seemed to have come looking for, even if it hasn't been made yet.    I'll begin with the story: It's an adequate vehicle to carry what we all came to see: the world as we know it coming to an end. As I said, I tend to be sentimental, so I teared up at parts, but most probably will not. The characters are, at least, an interesting array of players and most of the ones that we intimately get to know throughout the film will survive through to the end (I'm also not big on character death, so this was fortunate for me). In addition, Emmerich, fortunately, must have heard the legendary Alfred Hitchcock proclaim that even when you're writing drama and suspense, one must, while winding up the viewer tighter and tighter, let them a little loose with a joke otherwise you'll wind them too tight. Now, this is paraphrased, but my point is is that I appreciated the sporadic,but generally well-placed use of the occasional one-liner to let a little tension out. The pacing of the movie left a little to be desired, as while the film got to the action quickly and delivered relentless one-two punches of scenes of destruction and the \\"ark\\" scenes were good, the epilogue was far too short, and I ended up wanting a little more exposition on the future of mankind.    The science, or lack thereof, behind the movie: Who cares? It's a film. I happen to be a big fan of science, but one should never let it get in the way of a fun story. Moving on.    The special effects: Generally, they're well done but can be rather overwhelming. Although, I suppose that was to be expected. Most of the best scenes of destruction were in the trailers, so if you've seen those, you've probably seen most of them. Still, don't let that discourage you: it really is how the scenes are framed that provide much of their impact. It is a decent example of stunning visuals supplemented by the writing behind it. The scenes that existed were stunning, but I couldn't help being hungry for a bit more.    The score: I'm a bit of a music geek, so I tend to comment on a film's score as one of my first reactions to seeing it. At all times, the score was appropriate and adequately written, but rarely provided anything exceptional or out of the ordinary for a film score of this variety. It earns a passing grade, certainly, as it does what any film score is meant to do: to elevate the emotions behind the visuals and the writing.    To sum up, any viewer coming into this film really ought to know what to and what not to expect. If you know what to expect, and what you're expecting is what you're hoping to see, you will not be disappointed.
B000068FUS|5.0|Drive-By Truckers hail from the dirty south of Athens, Georgia. The area has been known for being laughed at and unfairly treated as a place full of barefoot, backwater hicks with little intelligence and a hatred of people that aren't connected to them. Drive-By Truckers destroys all the stereotypes with this one record alone. A smart, harsh, and demanding listen, Southern Rock Opera both mocks and loves the South on every level possible. To begin with, the album destroys the myth of Lynyrd Skynyrd's hatred of Neil Young (the band were actually going to record Neil Young's Powderfinger, but never got to due to the plane crash). Along with the loose concept of Skynyrd's life, there are powerful odes to southern living, with concepts such as George Wallace burning in hell (Wallace), lonely love on Highway 72 (This Highway's Mean), a recollection of how rock and roll saved a young kid's life (Let There Be Rock), and several songs about friends who are no longer living (Plastic Flowers On The Highway, Dead Drunk & Naked).<br /><br />Patterson Hood, the singer of the band, sings with a deep southern drawl, and is very convincing at destroying these so-called myths and legends. The unsung hero of this band, of course, is Mike Cooley, who provides some of the best ballads the band has penned to date, such as Zip City, 72, and the concert showcase, Women Without Whiskey. Another disregarded hero is Rob Malone, who has a powerful voice not unlike Berry Oakley of the Allman Brothers. He really brings Satan to life in the rocking Wallace, and the grooving Cassie's Brother.<br /><br />This is a powerful rock and roll album and a statement to the world to forget all the evil superstitious nonsense and stereotypes of the South. DBT shows that the South ain't a bad place to live, as long as you man up and take some pain with the pleasure.

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I watched each every brilliabnt episode of HBO's The Pacific and found on more than one occasion tears were streaming down my face by the end of the one hour. The series was an astounding study of the war in the Pacific theatre, but more a profoundly moving work on the loss of innocence of the young men who fought there in the mud and rain so bravely. The performance of Jos Mazzola (the kid in Jurassic Park) was superb and I am amazed he was snubbed for an Emmy nomination. One could see the innocence and small town boy becoming a hardened killer as the light in his eyes slowly goes out. His breakdown in the woods with father tore my heart out because what his father had dreaded had come to pass...his son had given up a part of his soul. Rami Malick was brilliant as \\"Snafu\\" the cocky soldier who becomes Mazzola's best friend, and even when they seem to hate one another there is never any doubt they have one another's backs, and there time will be forever remebered. War buddies...they shared something we will never understand. When Snafu leaves and cannot wake his friend to say goodbye we understand it is because he does not how to say it, how can they have shared the depths of hell they have shared and then part ways?? Better to say nothing. Just a brilliant bit of television from the masters of the art form, HBO. A stunning achievement.
1401219268|5.0|Alan Moore, probably the best comic book writer of his generation, has just completed a run on Swamp Thing, a run that probably happened to be one of the lesser-known titles at the time. Pushing the envelope with what was possible in sequential storytelling, he helped bring a smorgasbord of mature themes into the fold, in an effort to produce smarter and more sophisticated comics. But that was just only the beginning of a decade of innovation and pizzazz for the comics industry. Watchmen wasn't the only big thing out of that era.<br /><br />But it was probably the biggest giant at that time, a monolith of twelve extra-sized comic book issues, complete with prose pieces at the end of every issue save the last.  Every page holds an average of 6-7 panels, every one of which packed to the gills with immense detail and excellent facial expressions, and these are panels with an average of three dialogue elements and no less. The prose pieces read like something from a novel, something to be expected from a short story. These issues were, in every sense of the word, great value for money at a time where comics were lower priced than in recent years.<br /><br />So if anyone has any doubt about Watchmen's appeal, let it be clear: Watchmen is a masterpiece of comic book storytelling. The characters have a sense of lovability, largely due to Alan's excellent knack for creating realistic dialogue. Rorschach's hard-boiled journal is one of the highlights of the entire book, as are the Black Freighter sequences. All of Alan's dialogue fabrication skills come to bear in every section of the book in fact, especially the prose pieces.<br /><br />It is hard to include prose pieces in comics because no one ever reads comics for beautiful prose. Alan took a huge, bold step in that direction by providing much of the back-story in them. But, boy, did they ever work. The excerpts from Hollis Mason's (the first Nite Owl) book are an example of prose done in exactly the same voice and mentality one would expect from the character and not something that would come from the writer itself. These pieces hold much of the struggles and nuances of superhero life, legacy, death and super-villains included. While much of the material today covers these issues in one way or another, it seemed Watchmen did it first. And if it didn't, arguments could be presented that it did those themes like no other work since. Some claimed that these prose pieces, along with the prolonged extra sequences, were dragging the book down. Wrong. It reads exactly like a graphic novel should read.<br /><br />The doomsday clock ticks ever closer to nuclear war and Richard Nixon is worried. No one really knows what will happen. But when the ending comes like a freight train, a reread seems inevitable. Simply put, this is the book to read if you are a comic book fan wanting a feast, or someone who just happened to hate comics.
B003ITZBVI|4.0|This review originally appeared on [...].    I'll admit that when Warner Bros. announced Batman: Under the Red Hood  as their eighth direct-to-DVD feature, I was a little disappointed. The story of how Jason Todd returned from the dead seemed a bit too convoluted and complicated for a seventy minute movie, and there were easily a dozen other comic storylines I'd like to have seen adapted for film first. After the brilliant Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths, Warner had a lot to live up to with their next title, no matter what it was. Though Under the Red Hood doesn't quite live up to the high standard of Crisis on Two Earths, it's actually pretty enjoyable, and is one of the more action-packed animated movies DC and Warner have released.    Way back in the glory days of 1988, fans voted for the Joker to kill Jason Todd, the then current Robin, by calling into a 900 number DC created to give readers a say in what happened during the monumental \\"A Death in the Family\\" storyline. Batman was of course devastated, and since that day has had a Robin suit hanging in the Batcave in memoriam. In 2005, Todd was resurrected by time shockwaves created as the result of Superboy-Prime punching the walls of his inter-dimensional home. Jason returned to Gotham a changed man, obsessed with finding out how Batman could possibly have let the Joker live after what he did. Taking up the moniker of one of Batman's first villains, the Red Hood, who would later go on to become the Joker, Todd brought a war to Gotham in the hopes of drawing out the Joker so he could finally finish him off for good. Even though that's just the extremely short version, it's still a bit... complicated. Trying to condense years of continuity into just over an hour could have resulted in one messy movie. Surprisingly, Winick does a great job adapting his own comic script into a film that though a bit heavy on continuity, is easy to follow.    The first step in making Under the Red Hood`s story more accessibleto the general non-comic reading public is ditching the whole Superboy-Prime time punch angle, and instead opting for a more traditional (at least in the Batman universe) resurrection courtesy of Ra's Al Ghul's Lazarus pit. You see, the Joker still kills Jason Todd, though the violence is awkwardly toned. Joker mercilessly beats Todd with a crowbar, yet there's nothing wrong with his face save a few scratches. I'm not asking for gallons of blood pouring from gashes across the boy's face, but this strange double-standard the DC animated features have with portraying violence continues here to odd effect. It actually takes you out of the moment for a second, but you're reeled back in the moment a bomb goes off, blowing the building up, and leaving Todd dead and buried in the smoldering ruins. Flash forward a few years, and suddenly a new Red Hood is popping up in Gotham, challenging current big crime boss Black Mask for territory. None too happy with gang violence of any kind, Batman teams with Nightwing to investigate this new Red Hood. As the mystery deepens, Batman's findings lead him down a path that leads to only one answer: the Red Hood is Jason Todd. The final act brings the Joker, Batman, and Todd together again in an appropriately intense conflict, and it does a great job bringing everything that has happened full circle.    The characters are brought to life wonderfully by one of the best ensemble casts Andrea Romano has ever put together. Bruce Greenwood's Batman is intense and driven, but he's also introspective and mournful. Greenwood's able to bring the father figure in Batman out with ease, and though we don't get to see much of Bruce Wayne in this movie, Greenwood's able to present the duality of the character very well. Jensen Ackles does solid work as Jason Todd. It's got to be tough trying to emote when your character spends 90% of the film behind a full face mask, but Ackles somehow finds a way to get all of Todd's rage, passion, and regret throughto the viewer. I'd love to spend more time talking about Neil Patrick Harris' Nightwing, but he's in and out of the movie so fast, you don't ever get a chance to enjoy him. That said, he steals every second of the brief amount of screen time he's given. Jason Issac's Ra's Al Ghul is appropriately regal, but as good as everyone else is, John DiMaggio really brings it. I love Mark Hamill's Joker. For the rest of time, his will be the voice that I hear when I'm reading the Joker's dialogue in a comic book. In this film though, DiMaggio is able to make the Joker his own, and he's darker and more twisted than ever before in an animated story. You really believe that DiMaggio's Joker would kill, which was always a trait missing from other voice actors. Even Hamill at his psychotic best never made me believe for one second the Joker was going to kill someone, and that's a testament to both DiMaggio's performance and Romano's direction.    What really stands out in this picture though, are the incredible action sequences. Since Todd was trained by Batman, he's got virtually the same skill set, which makes for some pretty intense fights that feel like they belong in a Bourne movie. And that's a good thing. Too often, Batman's enemies are either untrained crazed thugs or madmen more focused on killing then they are technique. When going up against one another, Red Hood and Batman are almost equally matched, and by the third counter attack, you've really lost track of who's actually winning the fight. The animation in these sequences is spot on, never moving too fast for you to see what's happening, while at the same time showcasing rapid-fire moves that would make real fight choreographers jealous. None of the characters in this movie actually have any real superpowers, and it's refreshing to see an honest approach to hand-to-hand combat rather than the \\"I punch you really hard, you punch me really hard\\" combat theory that so many more powerful heroes subscribe to.    Now, like Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths, Under the Red Hood also comes with a \\"DC Showcase,\\" this time for Jonah Hex. Try not to think about the live-action movie that was in and out of movie theaters in the blink of an eye. This short manages to be faithful to the core of the character, well-acted, and expertly animated. Tom Jane stars as Jonah, who rides into town looking for a man with a bounty on his head. It appears something unpleasant may have happened to this outlaw before Hex captured him, but Hex always gets his man. A few quick action sequences and one eye for an eye later, it's all over. The only thing wrong with the short is, well, it's too short. Just like the Spectre's story on the previous DVD, I was left wanting more immediately. Now that the \\"DC Showcase\\" is going to be a regular part of the package, I look forward to them almost as much as the feature.    Even though I still think Crisis on Two Earths is the current front-runner for best direct-to-DVD DC Comics feature by Warner Bros., Under the Red Hood is still highly watchable. The creative team does a great job adapting the comic storyline, and the action, intensity, and acting will have you enthralled until the very end. Combined with another solid effort in the Jonah Hex-starring short, this is a package that's hard to resist. I just hope Superman/Batman: Apocalypse can live up to the new standard set by these last two films.
0307454541|1.0|I've read a lot of books and this is the first review I have written. I am having a hard time getting through this and may not even finish it. Why are people raving about this? I just don't get it. It isn't the waste of money, it is more the waste of my time trying to read it. I don't want to miss out on a great book, am I missing something?
B001GCUO5W|4.0|Shutter Island is not a film I expected to like. A psychological thriller with touches of horror and jump scares? Boring. And it would be too in the hands of literally anybody else. Instead, we have Scorsese making moods like it's nobody's business & creating atmosphere while still balancing those pesky things called plots and characters. Leo makes good use of the accent and brings some humanity to an otherwise messed up man.<br /><br />Granted, one could only come to this conclusion after the end of the movie since the movie lives or dies by its 3rd act. Personally, I think they did a great job with it. It's unrealistic as all get out, but Scorsese sells you on it, and rest assured if you go back through the movie, it still mostly holds up with the twist. But here's the thing, without the twist, it would be a fairly generic and boring film, even if everything else was the same. The ending and the reveals/twists bring a quiet intensity to the proceedings which lead to some good emotional and dramatic moments, and somehow makes the rest of the film worth it.<br /><br />Overall, if you like a good Scorsese mood piece, then by all means watch this movie. It's not a brilliant movie, and we could debate the warrant of that ending all day long, but in the end, Shutter Island is pretty entertaining.
B003J27WFW|5.0|Since the end of my high school days (start of the '80s) I have been an intense Rush fan, but never have I been able to see the inner workings, hinges, and springs of one of rock's greatest bands.  Everything is impeccably covered in great depth, from the earliest of the earliest days, all the way to today. Every phase and period is covered, and all of it by one-on-one interviews and discussions with each Alex, Geddy, and Niel. By the end of the documentary I was absolutely bowled over to feel that I had actually met them. The film producers definitely succeeded at making them intimate and accessible.    I now can see that these three are the truest of friends. They are not just far off towering icons - they're very real, and genuine men. Rock has been much more than blessed to have witnessed this phenom for more than four decades, and to get this close them is totally awesome. This may sound odd, but for years I've admired the \\"Starman\\" logo used by the band, but now the anonymous side of him has turned around. There is no part of Rush hidden now. Every Rush fan will cherish this film. No questions about it, it's a must have!
B003IODNJA|5.0|First of all, I love this album. To me this is the best mid-80s synth-pop album ever made. I have collected many of the original 12\\" singles, remixes and what not. This reissue was long overdue and is packaged wonderfully - with great liner notes and artwork. Received it from Amazon.co.uk last week.    What does this reissue include:    - The original (CD) album and the LP versions that were replaced on (most of) the CD issues. Nice inclusions include the mostly instrumental 3:09 version of \\"Jewel\\" (for those that get nervous listening to the vocal version of this song (I do) this could be a nice replacement for the CD version of \\"Jewel\\" in a playlist). Also included is the \\"First Cut\\" version of \\"Dr Mabuse\\", basically faded out at 5:00 and the standalone version of \\"Strength to Dream\\", which, though nice to have, does not hold its own to the version that was included in the 10:41 Dr. Mabuse album version.     - A selection of remixes and additional versions. Highlights include:    \\"Do Well\\", the 20-minute cassette version of Duel (in the 80s ZTT used the cassette format to create longer versions of their singles - Frankie Goes To Hollywood had some great ones too). Ultimately \\"Do Well\\" is not so much a giant remix as it is individual songs played consecutively. It includes the regular album version of Duel, a slightly altered full-length \\"Jewel\\", and a mashup of \\"Duel\\" and \\"Jewel\\" called \\"Bejewelled\\" (basically starts as \\"Jewel\\", switches to \\"Duel\\" for the chorus, then back to \\"Jewel\\" etc.). It also includes an instrumental passage called \\"Wonder\\" and a small excerpt from Duel called \\"The First Cut\\". Ultimately worth having, but due to its makeup of individual songs that are mostly represented in the same versions somewhere else, not as satisying (at least to me).    \\"Die Tausend Augen des Mabuse\\". This is one of the 12\\" versions ZTT released of this classic track. This version basically takes the 5:00 First Cut version (Disc 1, Track 14) and smears it out over 10minutes. Please note that the \\"Strength To Dream\\" end-sequence of the original 10:41 version (Disc 1, Track 9) does not feature in this mix.    \\"Sorry For Laughing\\" - Great 12\\" - didn't know it even existed    \\"P:Machinery (Goodnight 32 Mix)\\" - alternative single mix - sounds great    \\"Chase\\" (Goodnight Mix) - alternative mix, which I actually like better than the album version    \\"Echo of Frozen Faces\\" - longer version of \\"Frozen Faces\\", basically an added 6 minutes of instrumental passage before going into the \\"regular\\" Frozen Faces    \\"P:Machinery (Polish) - the original 12\\". While I like it, the synthesizer sequence at the end of the \\"chorus\\" is repeated for about 2 minutes at the end of the song, which is a little too much for me to take. I created a \\"fade\\" version using editing software cutting it to 7:42 in length, but hey, everyone likes things differently.    The \\"Testament\\", and \\"Thought\\" tracks are not so much actual songs as they are (instrumental) interludes      What this re-issue does not include:    Disc 2 only contains a selection of Propaganda's 1984-1985 output. Most of the \\"missing\\" versions can be found on the [[ASIN:B000B5KRAC Outside World]] release from Propaganda issued a few years back. This 2 CD reissue does not include:    \\"Das Testament des Mabuse (13th Life Mix)\\", 6:35. Another 12\\" of Dr. Mabuse, pretty similar to the \\"Tausend Augen\\" version, again no \\"Strength to Dream\\" sequence included  \\"Duel (Bitter Sweet)\\" - the original 7:38 12\\" Version of Duel - Great Mix  \\"P:Machinery (Beta Mix)\\" - the fantastic 9:33 alternative 12\\" Mix - quite different from the Polish mix on this release  \\"Frozen Faces (12\\" version)- this is the 5:30 version, different than the 10:20 \\"Echo of Frozen Faces\\"  \\"Jewel (Cut Rough)\\", basically Jewel with a-cappella intro. This version is included as part of \\"Do Well\\" on this release, but not as a standalone track  \\"Complete Machinery\\", 10:56. An odd one. \\"Complete Machinery\\", similar to \\"Do Well\\" was the cassette version of P:Machinery, but only two \\"parts\\" are included on \\"Outside World\\" as part of \\"Complete Machinery\\": an instrumental remix of \\"P:Machinery (Goodnight 32 Mix)\\", which sounds great and \\"Frozen Faces\\" - the 5:30 12\\" version.  \\"Das Testament des Mabuse (DJ Promo Version)\\", 9:57. The third 12\\" of Dr. Mabuse. This one is the closest to the album version and does include the \\"Strength To Dream\\" sequence. The outtro is a little shorter and different instruments are being brought to the front throughout the song compared to the album version. The 10:41 album version does remain the definitive \\"Dr Mabuse\\" in my book however.    Other 1984-1985 tracks not on this release include \\"Lied\\" a short remix of \\"Chase\\", \\"The Lesson\\" a short (pointless) remix of Dr. Mabuse, and \\"Femme Fatale\\", a Lou Reed cover that seems completely out of place. All three of these are on \\"Outside World\\" as well.    90% of the \\"Wishful Thinking\\" remix album released in 1985 is not on this release either, but these remixes, while nice for completists are easily trumped by the 12\\" versions of each of the tracks    Hope this helps \\"shine a little light\\" on Propaganda circa 1984-1985. This is all great classic stuff!
B002VPE1AW|5.0|DVD was in excellent condition.  Sender shipped it in a timely manner.  What I received represented exactly what the seller stated.  I am highly satisfied.  I would purchase from this seller again.
B002VECLVO|5.0|The movie was not only aesthetically pleasing, but it also had great acting and a strong plot. I was happy to finally see a story about a gay man that didn't involve AIDS or promiscuity. This was a real story of a real man dealing with the loss of a loved one. It was nice to see the lack of stereotypical and cliché elements that plague most gay themed movies. Colin Firth was amazing. Even Julianne Moore who was in it for a few minutes, was great. This movie goes into my top films category. Good Work!
0891419063|5.0|This classic is the definitive work on the war in the Pacific and the culture of the United States Marines in World War II.  Sledge gives a deeply human account of warfare as seen by the grunt on the front lines of battle.<br /><br />From the oppressive tropical heat and thirst of Peleliu to the cold, wet, slimy mud of Okinawa, Sledge takes the reader on a journey with the First Marine Division - The Old Breed - through the depths of depravity and the unspeakable horrors of war as fought by rules established by the Japanese.<br /><br />Heroic acts of bravery were rampant and ordinary as young Marines fought to survive the dreadful brutality and mindless killing that were their daily companions.  Few emerged unscathed from the ferocious battles that cost too many their lives and many others their souls.<br /><br />Sledge was one of the fortunate ones who returned home and eventually exorcised his own demons through the telling of his story.  This book is a page-turner that will both inform and delight those with even a passing interest in World War II.<br /><br />John E. Nevola<br />Author of The Last Jump - A Novel of World War II
0375826742|3.0|Brisingr is diametrically opposed in style and structure to Eragon and Eldest.  Whereas the first two books were full of action and amazing revelations, the third book meanders through the first 600 pages.  It isn't until the last 150 pages or so that we get the \\"big reveal\\" and the meat of the action.  And while the core of Paolini's series is intriguing, I couldn't help taking issue with this latest book.    The maturity in the writing shows.  Eragon exhibits clear examples of a high schooler's efforts.  Eldest showed quite a bit of improvement over Eragon.  So it was refreshing to see the progression of his writing in Brisingr.  But where Brisingr succeeds in writing style, it fails in terms of structure.    The book begins with a dramatic rescue and there are plenty of skirmishes between the Varden and the Empire's soldiers.  But still the book's first 600 pages seem to drag.  Those pages emanate a feeling of inactivity; there are many long conversations and descriptions that are completely unnecessary.    The narrative meanders, and several times I was tempted to give the book up.  But going by the previous two books, I knew Paolini would be saving something good for the end of this one and I wasn't disappointed.  The story has its share of big moments beginning at about page 600 (in the paperback) and continues to build from there.  The last 150 pages or so prove to be the saving grace of the book. I venture to say Paolini could have, in fact, most likely finished the series in three books if his editor had been a little more careful in removing so much of the extraneous \\"stuff\\" from the third installment.    As a whole, however, the series is a fine attempt and an enjoyable read. I'll certainly be on the lookout for the fourth book when it comes, and I hope Christopher Paolini's writing style and story structure continue to improve.  Based on his first three books, the prospect of this last hope is a promising one.
B001S2PT3M|5.0|when i saw season one of Dexter i never thought there could be anything better. Season 2 proves me wrong. this is season 1 times ten. I am only on disk 2 as i type this. i get to watch two episodes a day in Dialysis so i don't know how it will end, but i has to end in Dex's favor as there is a season 3 and 4 and i am sure they aren't doing any of it from the electric chair/injection table<br /><br />if you like dark humor this is the show for you. yeah, there is some blood and titties, but the humor is what keeps me coming back
0316017922|3.0|Book contains some interesting and provocative ideas, especially for educators and those concerned with education. His last chapter - about the KIPP schools - is a fascinating plea for American schools to infuse more rigor (and quantity) to the educational school year. As a main part of Gladwell's thesis is that how hard one works (and is willing to work) is endemic to one's likelihood of success, we set students up for failure by not expecting them to work as hard as other countries expect of their students. This is especially true in the two chapters devoted to debunking the myth that intelligence is the key to success. Unfortunately, Dan Goleman beat him to the punch way back in 1995 with his book \\"Emotional Intelligence: Why it matters more than IQ.\\". If readers keep that in mind, they won't be too disappointed by the methods or originality of the research. His job is to weave together an interesting story, which is something Gladwell does exceedingly well. If all you want is some good entertainment and fodder for cocktail party discussions, Outliers might make a nice addition to your bookshelves.
B000005JA8|3.0|It's ok!  Nothing spectacular, though!  I liked some of the riffs and was really brought back into that DELTA BLUES frame of mind on a few tracks!  There were some things here that I thought were a bit bland and unoriginal, but Nice Try here anyway Captain Beefheart!
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I loved this movie.  I was skeptical about a new Star Trek movie with new actors maintaining the spirit of the original series.  I thought this movie did that.  They also cleverly fixed it so that any future sequels can entail new stories because they are now on a different timeline of events.  Now that's cool!
0307588335|5.0|I picked this book up two weeks back. It is a brilliantly written book from Larry's perspective of all that went wrong in the industry during the boom years and the bust years. The tale of how almost Lehman was run as a fiefdom and autocracy was shocking to read. Each event was beautifully woven into the grand scheme of things.    For me it was one amazing book, that I could not put down. You also get to learn so many new things if you are not in the industry. Nicely written from a layman's perspective but technical enough for anyone in the industry to appreciate too.    I would surely recommend this to anyone who wants to know what happens inside the dealing and trading rooms, but also truly what happened during the 2008 crisis and the whole idea about Mortgage Backed securities, leveraged positions, risk etc...
0399156577|4.0|I loved this book - it's one of my favorites by Nora Roberts. The relationship between the main characters was really quirky and made me laugh out loud several times. The dog named Jaws made me picture my neighbor's adorable puppy in my head so I had a great visual! Really good story and cool characters. Would definitely recommend.
B00008OP0H|2.0|The first time I watched this series I borrowed copies from a friend who recorded it off of the tv. This version has been re-edited to shorten the length of each episode. I am GREATLY disappointed. Some of these parts were things that I was looking foreword to watching again. The pacing was changed in other parts that left a different impression on what happened. If I was watching it for the first time I may have enjoyed it, but knowing what I'm missing and just how much richer the story was before, I have to give it only one or two stars.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|My 13 year old son wanted a watch and this one has worked out perfectly for him.  It is not too large or out of proportion for his smaller wrist as many other adult style watches can be.  It has a sporty design and casual strap that he likes.  Plus, it has the reliability of a Seiko.  We also like that it is self-winding and no batteries are required.  We could see him using this watch well into college.
B00164EAC8|4.0|I grew up watching Godzilla movies and all the old TOHO monster movies. That said, I really liked this rendition, too. I just can't agree with all the sticks in the mud that feel Godzilla is only good if it's a guy in a suit stepping on models. I would still buy any of those in Blu-Ray as well, though.    I docked it a star for a few issues I had with this movie. My main issue was the way they basically stole the ending death scene from the King Kong movie with Jeff Bridges. Not that I thought either ending was special, just too familiar. Another is how Godzilla breathes fire only when he roars and kicks up some vehicles which collide and explode in mid-air. It just seemed way too contrived.    As far as effects go, Godzilla has held up quite well for a 12 year old movie.    To say this was an intro to Godzilla and liked it but decided to not like it after seeing the old ones. That's just schizo.
0061537969|5.0|I read this book a while ago, and I was intrigued about the dog being the narrator of the book.  I don't think anything could make this book any better than it is.  Enzo makes you wonder what goes through your own dogs mind.  This book is laugh out loud funny, while being compassionate and real. Possibly one of the best books I've ever read.  A fantastic piece of literature, to say the least!
0525423842|5.0|As an avid Grisham fan, I was eager to read the latest of his work available:  Theodore Boone, Kid Lawyer did not disappoint.  Although clearly written for a younger audience, the story moved along with more than enough of Grisham's usual twists and surprises to keep me involed with the characters and the plot.  The read, as usual, was over much too soon.    The real bonus of this book came with it's sharing with some of my young friends and grandchildren (several fit both catagories!)  Their responses have been joyful and exuberant.  How wonderful to share my interest with them and contribute to their summer reading!    Thank you, again, John Grisham - can't wait for your release which I've preordered for October.

B001M5UDGS|5.0|I've been waiting for \\"Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog\\" to be released on Blu-ray for along time.    Fans of Joss Whedon can rejoice, as the Blu-ray edition includes a musical commentary, a filmmakers' commentary as well as the making of featurettes, behind the scenes footage, the evil league of evil application videos, outtakkes and an interview with the evil league of evil.
B002BFBAWO|3.0|Adventureland is definitely overrated.  It's a film intended *entirely* for young adults.  It has a few serious problems though.    For one thing, it completely lacks humor.  That wouldn't be so much of a problem if the storyline ever picked up and actually went somewhere interesting instead of being one of literally thousands of typical college teen movies released over the last 10 years involving the *same exact topics*.      Relationships obviously is the most popular topic covered here- partying, fitting in with crowds, and just having fun comes next.  It's become so predictable and completely unnecessary by this point that it adds up to a LOT Of useless storyline segments.  Instead of movie writers coming up with new material, they keep falling back into the same old routine of predictability, and that's a shame.    In this particular case, the entire storyline revolves around a young college man who takes a part time job at an amusement park, and while there he falls in love with two women.  He's actually more interested in one, while the other girl feels more like a mistake to him.    I don't find anything remotely funny about Adventureland either, especially some of the recurring bits (such as one kid kicking the other one in the crotch repeatedly- this isn't really funny to me).  Another segment shows the amusement park games being fixed, and paying customers finding out about it.  This felt like a really horrible missed opportunity for humor and storyline progression.  Awful writing here.    The writing has just become extremely bland by this point.  As a result this is a really bad storyline that doesn't even make an attempt to separate itself in a positive way from the rest of the college films out there.  What a shame.  A film you'll know exactly which direction it's going after the first 20 minutes.    I enjoyed all the Lou Reed material being heard throughout the film, and it's actually an amazing coincidence because I just got done listening to several Lou Reed albums myself, so the soundtrack was a welcome surprise.  Still, that's not enough to save some dreadful storytelling, so I recommend skipping Adventureland.  No adventure here, I'm afraid.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Loved this DVD! This is a great workout, and even as a fitness trainer, Level 1 got me to sweat. I did notice that some of the same exercises are repeated in levels 1, 2, and 3. If you want the \\"Level 4\\" version of this workout, buy Jillian's \\"Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism\\" DVD instead, and especially if you are already an intermediate/advanced exerciser, skip this one altogether and go for Banish Fat. I'm glad I bought that one instead.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|Never watched the television series entitled \\"Lost\\", but received the first season dvd as a gift and now hooked.  Have purchased other seasons from Amazon.Com and waiting for the last season to be released.    For pure fascinating entertainment, all the episodes are a \\"must\\".
0805209999|5.0|\\"The trial\\" is a deeply symbolic novel and opens with the protagonist Joseph K., being arrested by two warders followed by an interview with the inspector.  Joseph K. is told that he is under arrest but is free to go about his daily duties.  Throughout the first half of the novel, Joseph K. strives at all costs to comprehend why he has been arrested.  Although all of his attempts to shed some light on his charges are unsuccessful, he still attempts to mount a defense...claiming innocence.  Throughout the novel, the way in which Joseph K. handles his trial compounds his guilt and at the end of the novel he is executed by being stabbed.  Throughout the novel, Kafka is ambiguous and leaves many open ends with respect to the point and meaning of the novel.  Thus, several interpretations can be made with respect to the significance of the novel.  However, focusing on the symbolism inherent in this text, it can be argued that Joseph K. represents every person living and working in modern society and that the trial represents a lifelong process that all humans must endure to some extent.  Further, \\"The Law\\" represents the laws of nature, God and evil to which all humans are bound.  Therefore, Joseph K, representing modern bureaucratic society, breaks \\"The Law's\\" of nature/humanity by being morally shallow, self-centered, and superficial and hence must face the trial.  However, due to his own failing attempt of searching and finding what he was guilty of and blindly associating himself with innocence, his trial (life's journey of trial and error) was ended, and Joseph K. executed, symbolizing his ultimate fate of death and complete ignorance.<br /> When the novel opens, the narrator explains how Joseph K. routinely receives his breakfast from the cook precisely at 8:00 am.  However, there was an interruption to his routine that day.  Instead of his breakfast, two guards showed up and after Joseph rang his breakfast bell, the warders notified him that he was under arrest.  From that moment, Joseph attempted to find out why he was arrested and what he was being charged with.  He stated that he had no knowledge of the law and the guards in reply took that statement as further evidence that he was indeed guilty.  Following his arrest, he was instructed by the guards to dress up so that he could meet the investigator.  Having met the  investigator, Joseph K. realized that he would be equally unhelpful in clarifying why he had been arrested.  However, the inspector notified him that he is free to go and return to his daily activities.  This gesture symbolizes the need for Joseph K. (society), to focus in on themselves and realize how they have been living their lives and in this case leading it in the wrong direction.  As a matter of fact, the court encourages Joseph K. to find out the reasons for his arrest. However, Joseph K. seems to be focusing more on his innocence than on what he has done wrong.  In fact, when he appears for his interrogation at the courthouse, instead of attempting to find out what he has done wrong, he criticizes the court, the proceedings and states his innocence.  Joseph K., is also easily distracted by small, meaningless details that surround him in daily life.  However, rather than pay attention to the details that can help him solve his problem of guilt, he seems distracted by his observations.  The inspector's charge that, \\"Joseph K. is insensitive to the nuances of his situation.\\"  This implies that the court is indeed encouraging Joseph to focus on detail, but once again, Joseph K.'s approach to the trial further compounds his problems and both approaches that Joseph uses to prove his innocence fail him as he should be searching for his guilt and is therefore not focused on the appropriate things.<br /> As Joseph K. begins to mount a defense for his trial, he in no way has any idea what he is being charged with, or what he is guilty of .  As a matter of fact, he remains  focused on his innocence and doesn'teven fathom what he could be guilty of.  This represents his blindness to his situation.  His (societies) defense should have focused on what wrongdoings were done and how they could be avoided in the future at all costs.  Instead, the defense showed general stubbornness and apathy to \\"The Law,\\" and just like the laws of nature in the world we live, in Kaska's, \\"The Trial,\\" \\"The Law,\\" is never wrong.  Joseph K., while being interrogated at the courthouse, stated that he would fight the court not merely for himself but for all other's indicted.  This line has several implications the first being that he is not the only one being accused.  Therefore, even in the novel, Joseph is representing not only himself but also all others indicted.  The major problem to his statement is that he is fighting an institution that cannot lose.  He does not realize that the trial that is being held because he broke the law is a process that all humans must go through.  Further, if he freely accepts his wrongdoings, he can in a way win, by being able to go on with life and better himself.  However, he constantly chooses to fight the entire process and this leads to his downfall and eventual death.<br /> Throughout the novel, Joseph K. comes across three women.  The most important meeting is with his neighbor Frailein Burstner, who warns him to focus on his trial and is also present when he is being dragged to his death.  Blindly, Joseph K. only wants to see her in a sexual manor and in the novel wildly kisses her on the lips and neck.  This symbolizes his animalistic nature and immorality.  Further, as Frailein gives Joseph the invaluable advice of focusing on his trial he only focuses on her and doesn't heed any attention to her warnings.  The other two encounters with woman are purely sexual in nature.  Joseph K. comes across his lawyer's assistant Leni who wants to be his mistress as well as everyone else's mistress, and the usher's wife also offers herself in a sexual way to Joseph.  These latter two women again symbolize immorality.  They function to take Joseph's attention off of his trial and what he has done wrong and instead attempt to lead him astray.<br /> This novel can be interpreted in many ways.  It is sometimes argued that \\"The Trial\\" is a satirical political novel, however, the fact that the defendant is allowed to rest before his interrogation and that he roams freely whilst arrested is a hint that this novel doesn't address the issues of a police state.  Further, it can be interpreted as an existential piece that symbolizes the meaninglessness of life and what leads up to one's death.  Similarly, it can be argued that this novel depicts the adventures of a paranoid schizophrenic.  With the aforementioned analyses that could be attributed to \\"The Trial,\\" one can imagine the loose ends that Kafka leaves for the reader.  However, the symbolism of society, the laws of nature, and Joseph's eventual expulsion from the world seem a more valid argument.  Therefore, throughout the entire novel, Joseph K. (society) focused on the wrong thing.  When it was brought to Joseph's (societies) attention that he was to be arrested, he reacted by immediately identifying with innocence.  This was the identity that made him and makes society feel comfortable.  But, instead of claiming innocence, Joseph should have focused more on what \\"laws\\" he was breaking and not adhering too.  In essence he and society were attempting to go against \\"The Law\\" of nature/God and when it was brought to his (societies) attention, he ignored where he had gone wrong and rather blindly focused on what he had NOT done wrong.  Therefore Joseph K.'s reaction to his arrest and the way he handled his trial was his (societies) ultimate failure.  If Joseph (society) would have abandoned immorality and admitted guilt at the \\"trial\\" of life and then turned his (societies) ways around, he (society) may have been allowed to live a meaningful life, rather than facing ultimate death.hese latter two women again symbolize immorality.

0316113506|5.0|I love this book!  It is very informative and interesting! Learning about all the effects that exercise has on the brain has really increased my motivation to exercise on a regular basis. If you're experiencing stress, fear, depression, anxiety, ADHD, addictions, or other mental issues, start exercising and see if it helps you! In addition to this book I would also recommend the following books: \\"Ready, Set, Go! Synergy Fitness\\" by Phil Campbell and \\"Pace: The 12-Minute Fitness Revolution\\" by Al Sears M.D.
014241543X|4.0|One minute 17 year old Mia is riding in the car with her mum, dad and little brother enjoying a day out to visit family - the next minute she is standing next to a car that has been eviscerated, even though she can still hear the music of Beethoven's Cello Sonata No. 3 playing on the radio. Her parents are lying dead and she can see someone's hand sticking out which she thinks is her brother's, until she realises that it's hers.........<br /><br />This all happens very early in the story and, as Mia watches the paramedics work on her and take her to the hospital, she wonders if she's dead or alive as she can't feel anything. We move on to the hospital ward and Mia, who is narrating the story, alternates between watching the nurses, doctors, friends and family visiting her and looking back over her life.<br /><br />\\"If I stay. If I live. It's up to me.\\"<br /><br />This was a thought-provoking book and it certainly made me think about life and death and what I would do in Mia's position.<br /><br />The story went back and forth in time and I liked the way the author handled this, with just the right amount of time being devoted to each timeline without getting bored.<br /><br />Mia was a lovely person, and I did like her but I thought she should have grieved more for her parents, they were an important part of her life, but it just seemed unreal to me that she hardly mentioned them at all.<br /><br />An interesting look at the choices we make in our lives.
B003HLM2QO|4.0|I was glad to get the cd. I liked the fact that I got it cheaper to actually buy it and have it shipped than it would be to actually buy it at the store. The one thing I didn't like is that when it was shipped it got a little damaged. Not the cd its self just the case but I guess that's the side affect of having things shipped, but other than that everything went well!!!!!! :)
055357342X|5.0|By far the best of the first three. Throughout the book your saying \\"how's that character gonna be brought back cause he can't just be killed off.\\"

B002WY65VU|5.0|This is a funny movie based on what could be a very serious subject. The props and acting are great and I thought Woody Harrelson was excellent. Watch this movie, but don't take it too seriously!! I understand a sequel is coming out in 2011, which I am looking forward to.
1849162743|5.0|An extraordinary read. This is a fantastic culmination of all the previous events happening to Sallander. She is a one of a kind heroine. Pity the author has passed, I'd be looking forward to other books from him
B00275EGWY|4.0|This movie is ok, but I didn't think it was outstanding for a movie that has won an Oscar. The main character is a US Army Sergeant who is a Bomb Disposal Technician who has just been deployed to Iraq. He enjoys his job and the adrelien that goes with it. He is very good and professional at his job, but he seems to be addicted to the danger and violence. I thought the acting and special effects where excellent. I hope this movie reminds people at home in the U.S. and Australia what the average soldier is going thru and the dangers they face everyday.
0385340990|5.0|I was skeptical when I noticed the book was written in the style of letters. But, once I started to read, I just could not put it down. It was fantastic. I highly recommend it.
B003J27WFW|5.0|I got finally and its really good. I have only had a chance to watch disc one but its excellent. It covers the bands formation and early years really well and the best part is that the band are on screen a lot - loads of photos, chats with them and their families and friends. The best stuff is probably the enigmatic Neil Part who overcomes his natural shyness to speak about some deeply personal things on camera.     There are lots of star talking heads - Billy Corgan, Vinnie Paul, Kirk Hammett etc and they offer some good insight as to what motivates Rush fans. At least I recognised a lot of what they were saying especially Billy Corgan talking about learning to play all of 2112!    Its a little light on material on the bands career in the mid eighties - and there probably could have been more mention of the live records.  At the same time I suppose the film makers are trying to squeeze the best bits of a 40 year career into about 90 minutes and viewed from that angle it really is a fine film, a real achievement and a great tribute and introduction to a truly fantastic band.    For fans this is essential viewing and anyone even mildly interested should enjoy it as well.    PART 2   Last night I watched the extras Disc and I have to agree with so many of the other reviewers here - the extra footage adds up to make this one of the most compelling and intimate documentaries ever seen. After this you really do feel like you have met the band and it gives a really great idea as to what being in a working band is like or should be like. All three come across as very genuine, funny guys, remarkably dismissive of the fact that they have sold so many millions of records. Their integrity really puts the antics of some modern \\"stars\\" into perspective. The archive footage with John Rutsey is great and the 1979 La Villa Strangiato performance is fantastic - probably my favourite.     To close - get this - if your a fan and if you're not you might well be getting into Rush by theend of it.

B0029LX2LC|5.0|I have always liked The Roots but they have never had a whole album of good material to make me wanna buy their Cds..  ..  I bought Things Fall Apart because of the \\"You Got Me\\" song. The majority of that album was skippable in my opinion.  .  I saw the new album on I-tunes and listened to snippets of each song. Any real hip hop fan can tell if a song is good by listening to just 30 seconds of it.  .  I was impressed that they finally delivered a cohesive sounding album.  .  I can listen to it back and forth w/out skipping a song. I am true hip hop fan and this is a CD worth purchasing, which I did.  .  I only buy Classic Cds now and this is one of them..

B003PGNBO8|5.0|I gave up on TV about 10 years ago because even with 100 channels, there was never anything worth watching. This was when the so called \\"reality\\" shows came into vogue. Recently though, on the internet, I've discovered a handful of shows that I really enjoyed. FlashForward was one of those few. Intelligent premise, well-acted, well-scripted, good action - it left me wanting more. I really hope the TV networks reconsider and give this show another season. Give us more shows like this, and I might actually consider paying for cable again...

0307463745|3.0|I love a good business book.  I especially ones that go against the grain of typical thinking and practice.  Just like in business, if you can't offer something different than your competitors, you'll be lost in the noise.  I heard about this offering on Marketplace several weeks ago and my heart fluttered a bit when the contents were discussed.  A book that goes against the norm?  Saying that workaholics are counterproductive?  Someone finally wrote what I've been thinking for years.    And after opening the book, or in my case, hitting \\"Next Page\\" on the Kindle, that love affair ended.  Although the points of the book make it worth the price of admission, the presentation is downright atrocious.  Each \\"chapter\\" is a few pages and doesn't offer much beyond a glossing-over of the topic.  Its disjointed to say the least.  Present a topic, explain it, and give details and references as to why the reader should believe you and use it in practice.  References are few and far between.  I read more hidden advertisements about 37 Signals than proofs about the topics.  Some ideas were logical, but others lacked substance.  It read like Obama's \\"Hope\\" and \\"Change\\" posters, but without a man behind a podium explaining what they meant.      Finally, the overall tone of the book sounds like a motivational speaker at the local Holiday Inn.  I felt like I was reading \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" again.  No substance, just a training partner at the gym yelling motivational slogans.    If you can filter the trash from the gems, this book is a great read.  Don't be surprised if you're worn out after reading 20 pages.  It takes effort.
B003ITZBVI|5.0|If you don't like anime and hated \\"The Batman Vs. Dracula,\\" then this is the first pure Dark Knight cartoon since 2003's Mystery of the Batwoman. And I am pleased to say, this is the greatest Batman animated feature since Mask of the Phantasm.    The mysterious new Red Hood rolls into Gotham and tries to control the Gotham gangs with Batman and Nightwing caught in the middle. Bruce Greenwood, Jensen Ackles, John DiMaggio, and Neil Patric Harris do a superb job in their roles. Special mention should go to Neil Patric Harris who does an absolutely perfect performance as Nightwing. On the other hand, John DiMaggio provides a different voice for the Joker than we all are used to, deeper and a bit reserved, compared to the loony, cackling Joker that Mark Hamill and Heath Ledger used. Despite this, the Joker really steals whatever scene he's in.    This is all because it's written and plotted so perfectly. There's plenty of action that will keep you glued to the screen, but there's also a great conflict in this story that is a hallmark of all great Batman lore. Not just the Joker, but Batman, Nightwing, and the Red Hood are written true to themselves that any fan of the comic book will instantly recognize them. If you're not a fan of the comic book. that won't affect your enjoyment of this movie. It's been perfectly adapted from the source material, so that all the problems have been ironed out.    I should say, though, Robin III (Tim Drake) isn't in this movie at all.       They really covered their bases with the Extras on this Blue-ray. Two documentaries \\"Robin: The Story of Dick Grayson\\" and \\"Robin's Requiem: The Tale of Jason Todd\\" really fill in the blanks for the average fan that doesn't know the history of Batman, Nightwing, and Robin.     Also included on the Blu-ray, four episodes from Batman the Animated Series: \\"Robin's Reckoning, Parts 1 & 2,\\" - which details the origin of Robin, \\"Mad Love\\" - where the Joker meets Harley Quinn, and \\"The Laughing Fish,\\" when the Joker tries to copyright a face on a fish. These four are really great parallels to the movie, besides being phenomenal all by themselves.     Plus, a First Look at Superman/Batman: Apocalypse, which can only be better than the last one. We hope.    And of course, the 11-Minute Jonah Hex cartoon. It has good animation, but what really stands out to me is the excellent music direction.    Some trailers pad out the rest of the disk.     But if you only get the Two-Disk edition, you don't get the \\"Jason Todd Documentary\\" or \\"Mad Love\\" or \\"The Laughing Fish.\\"      If you have a Blu-ray Player, don't hesitate to get the blu-ray edition. You don't want to miss all that good stuff. Great adaptation. Great acting. Superb animation. Awesome extras. A five-out-of-five. For Batfans, and people who love cartoons. What's the greatest Batman cartoon movie? It's either this or Mask of the Phantasm, and if you already own Mask, get this already.    The only thing missing are the commentaries. This is Blu-ray. Stop giving me trailers, and cram in some commentaries.
030745455X|3.0|Is it an entertaining book - Yes. Is it a good story - Fair. Should it be in the Best Seller List - Hardly.<br />I bought the first book because I wanted to know what readers found interesting these days. The second one I bought to see if the writing would get any better. To me it was like looking at a Cabbage Patch doll and wondering why every kid in America wanted one. I bought the Kindle version, so I can only take the word of those that acquired the actual book that there are really 600 plus pages. If so, at least 300 are unnecessary. My biggest problem with this book is you have to make notes to figure out who all these characters are. The author writes as if he thinks everybody knows them. Sometimes I would get down a full page and then find out I had been reading about somebody I thought all along was somebody else. Was that Bjorck or Bjurman? Or was it Blomkvist? Even recalling them as Be-jork and Be-jurman didn't help. How do you pronounce 'Blomk'? I can't make my mind do it, much less my mouth. And as for the names? Most Americans reading this book will have problems remembering names that defy all attempts at pronunciation. There were so many characters with so many strange names and they were thrown in the story like sprinkles over sugar cookies. It would have helped if there had been a character glossary to go back to every few minutes to figure out who was who? Finally, his style is sloppy to the point that I do not believe a credible publisher would have published this. My question is, how did this book get published?
B001P9EQH8|4.0|I have hearing problems.  My Ipod was just not loud enough.  This more than solved the problem.  The unit is very small making it easy to carry with me.  The only reason this did not get 5 stars is the bass boost slider is very flimsy.  I wasn't expecting anything near this good with a price of $20.00.  I am extremely satisfied with this.
0307454541|5.0|I picked this fine piece of literature up on a whim after noticing that my local library had over six hundred hold requests for it.  Though my initial interest was sparked by little more than wanting to know what all the fuss was about, I can safely say now that I'm glad that small amount of interest was all that it took for me to make this purchase.<br /><br />Larsson immerses the reader in the lives of Mikael Blomkvist, an investigative journalist, and Lisbeth Salander, an investigator in her own right.  In the wake of a libel-related scandal, Blomkvist accepts an offer from industrialist Henrik Vanger to escape the busy streets of Stockholm and investigate the disappearance of Vanger's niece, Harriet, who has been missing for several decades.  Blomkvist isolates himself in the fictional town of Hedestad and begins his investigation.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Lisbeth Salander, the book's namesake, has her own struggles to deal with.  Originally tasked with performing a routine background investigation on Blomkvist, Salander finds herself increasingly interested in his new course of action in Hedestad.  The two eventually come face to face after Blomkvist realizes his need for a research assistant and seeks her out.  By the end of this harrowing tale, this pair of talented investigators have not only uncovered the reasons behind Harriet's disappearance, but have also struck back at the libel suit Blomkvist had been plagued by.<br /><br />The story is fresh, the characters are interesting, and the entire book is a page-turner.  A must-read for mystery fans, and highly recommended for anyone who simply enjoys good fiction.  While the book itself isn't too long (running around 600 pages), it is a longer read.  One of the most interesting parts of this story, and undoubtedly one of the most time-consuming tasks central to understanding the text, is connecting it's various themes (corruption, misogyny, etc.) to the lives of the central group of characters.  All in all, this book is well worth the money you'll spend buying it, the time you'll spend reading it, and all the hype it has generated.money you'll spend buying it, the time you'll spend reading it, and all the hype it has generated.

But when I ripped the tracks on to my computer and played them for the first time, I was pleasantly surprised about how much I liked the entire CD. I even risked mocking from my friends when I posted about the CD on Facebook. I have watched Miley grow up as my kids have watched her over the years, and I think she has developed into quite an accomplished artist. I hope that she can keep her talent up to this standard.
B000WS4OUW|5.0|Have you ever wondered what it would sound like if Dr Frankenstein made his monster using parts of Marvel Comic's Wolverine and, the King: Elvis Presley?  What if the monster sung lead in a dark and moody metal band?  Wonder no longer!  That's what you get with Danzig's second LP release.<br /><br />It's more than the length of his side burns, short muscular build, the hairy-chest photo on the cover, or even his Southern blues-vocal stylings!?! (He was born in New Jersey, wasn't he? Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain!)  The first Danzig album was good, perhaps very good; it was more of a straight-forward metal/rock sound, perhaps a bit rockabilly at times, very clean and tight.  However, this second album takes Danzig's concept of a bluesy-metal band to its ultimate depth: Soulful dark sounds emanating from the deepest swamps of the bayou, delivering tales of those cursed, or damned, or soon to be wailing and gnashing their teeth, all in a heaping bowl of jambalaya goodness.  The second Danzig album, while following through on his stylized moody black metal (that harkens back to his Samhain days), delivers the goods as a one-of-a-kind album and epitomizes Glenn Danzig's sound and artistry.

B003INBNXO|5.0|I can't say one bad thing about this movie. It is entertaining from start to finish.<br />Donnie Yen is superb as always and both the the action and drama are very well balanced.<br />There is one point though, where IP Man (Donnie Yen) is walking away from the camera, music is playing slowly and you think the movie is ended. It is not. Keep watching because it continues to entertain.<br />Supporting roles are equally well portrayed.<br />IP Man was the teacher of Bruce Lee and this is about his life when he was younger. There are definately excellent Martial Arts moments but there is also a story of the occupation of Japan and how the events of IP Man's life effected his family as well. This is not your run-of-the-mill Kung-Fu movie.<br />5 stars
030726999X|2.0|I am glad that I got the audio-tape to \\"read\\" this book. If you are an expert in techno-lingo and fluent in the Swedish language then this is for you.<br /> Mid-way through the story,another plot develops. Politicians, secret police...(each charactor in the conspiratorial group were confusing to me)the P.M. (Prime Minister),illegal tapping into private records, and ways and means to get access to highly sensitive material.  We even have the KGB. The \\"Big Issue\\" was when the journalist was going to publish information that would reveal who the \\"baddies\\" were. YECK!<br />The story begins, interestingly enough, about Sanderlin and what has happened to her.....then the story goes off in another direction.<br />I know this book was translated. Really?<br />I know this about the author, he was highly interested in automobiles, ( charactors had to be in a Saab) and he made special notations about what they wore,where they were going, and what they ate. Also, he went into detail about what kind of \\"weapon\\" they carried. Who cares about such triviality ?<br />That is how he developes his charactors. I can't picture in my mind any of them except Sanderlin....and that came from The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. ( which I thought was a better mystery!)
0307454541|1.0|I'm not sure what all the hype is about this book, it was awful. It's hard to describe how bad it actually is, you have to wade through MORE than half the book until it slowly begins to limp along to something actually happening (besides the protagonist boning somebody). It is more than awful, the main character is so monodimensional that it is almost funny, and the side kick (the girl with the dragon tattoo) is like a ridiculous cartoon image of \\"those darn kids nowadays\\". And then the plot itself is just stupid, it is so cliched and insipid. Save yourself some time and read something else, I mean just about ANYTHING else would be better. Seriously.<br /><br />Look, this is a book that somebody chose to hype and has been doing a great job causing a stir. It is horrible. Save your money, this is one highly polished turd.
0156034026|5.0|Moshin Hamid's The Reluctant Fundamentalist is a really good book. I can't imagine I have gone so long without discovering this great writer. When the book came out in 2007, it apparently awakened a lot of strong emotions in the readers. In many cases, this strong emotional response obscured the beauty and the importance of this book.<br /><br />The plot of The Reluctant Fundamentalist is quite simple. Changez, a young Pakistani who was educated at Princeton and worked on Wall Street, is telling his story to a nameless American he meets in a restaurant in Lahore. Changez is both fascinated and repelled by America that offered him an education and a lucrative job but at the same time, made his life intolerable in a multitude of ways. Changez's uneasy relationship with America is mirrored by his equally painful involvement with a woman called Erica. (As you can see, Hamid is quite heavy-handed with the way he names his characters. He makes his Erica-America parallel so obvious that it becomes annoying.)<br /><br />When Changez first arrives in the US, he discovers that the opulence that surrounds him in his Ivy League school and his Wall Street job makes it difficult to maintain the same vision of national identity that he brought with him from home. He likes reminding himself that his people had created a complex and sophisticated civilization long before anubody heard of the United States.<br /><br />As much as Changez prides himself on his people's glorious past and enjoys contrasting it with the recent historical origins of America, he has to rely on his American success to gain access to a social class his family was expelled from in Pakistan. For a while, Changez manages to swallow all the instances of discrimination he experiences. He also studiously avoids noticing the suffering of people who lose their jobs as a result of his professional activities. The reward for being an obedient little cog in the Wall Street machine is too high.<br /><br />But then 9/11 comes and Changez cannot maintain his state of obliviousness any longer. His initial reaction to the events of 9/11 is complex, ranging from contentment to shame, and he explores it honestly. In the US, everything that has to do with 9/11 has been transformed into a holy cow of sorts. Any attempt to analyze what happened and how one reacted is branded as anti-American. Hamid's book received a lot of criticism for daring to discuss 9/11 in a way that is a little more profound than the official narrative. Unfortunately, those who insist that the only valid narrative of 9/11 is the simplistic one sold to us by George W. Bush don't realize that they are not doing us all any service by denying this hugely traumatic event the right to be explored in all its facets.<br /><br />Hamid is just beginning as a writer and this is only his second novel. There is certain heavy-handedness that sometimes comes through in his writing. From time to time, he fails to recognize the moment when the writer should stop explaining himself and let the readers draw their own conclusions. He is also still searching for his own voice, and that's why there is quite a lot of V.S. Naipaul in the way he constructs his sentences and builds his plot. Still, these little flaws can be forgiven to an author who can create a book as beautiful as The Reluctant Fundamentalist.<br /><br />In the recent decades, the writers from India and Pakistan have produced the best literature in the English language of anybody on the planet. Moshin Hamid is a wonderful addition to the pantheon of great writers from the region who keep literature in English alive.<br /><br />I also wanted to add a couple of words about the Kindle edition of this book. Unfortunately, the Kindle version contains quite a few typos. You get a typo every other page and sometimes, there are 3-4 typos on a single page. The book is readable but it's very annoying to have a crucial word messed up. When you have to stop every once in a while and guess what a word means, that really breaks the flow of the reading process. I understand that the goal is to have every single book available on Kindle, but quality should not be sacrificed to this extent.the reading process.

0061730335|5.0|What does an African schoolboy do if his family is reduced to abject poverty by a severe drought and he is kicked out of school because his parents cannot afford to pay school fees? In this book, William Kamkwamba describes how he went to the library to study books to try to keep up with his classmates, and in those books he found some ideas that could be used to improve his family's situation.<br /><br />A school textbook called \\"Explaining Physics\\" showed how a rotating power source could be used to generate electricity to power a light globe, and another called \\"Using Energy\\" contained pictures of windmills. William decided to build a windmill to provide electrical power to his house and eventually hopefully to power a pump that would enable his family to irrigate their crops even if there was a drought. Using parts gathered from a scrapyard and some remarkable ingenuity, he made a windmill which worked, much to the surprise of the people in his village.<br /><br />I found the book to be very moving in the way it described the privations and gradual starvation brought on by the drought and the government's failure to respond, and then the resourcefulness of William in understanding and building advanced technology that no-one in his village had ever seen, merely on the basis of photographs and drawings in school text books. It is a great story, well told and intriguing to the very end. I highly recommend it.
B001FB5634|5.0|this movie was so underated because of the subject matter. in the day of blockbusters, inane rom-com movies people don't want to watch a movie that might cause them to face serious subjects.  viggo mortensen was so wonderful as the father - not even a mention or nomination for any awards last year.  he continues to be the most underappreciated actor.  after i left the theater seeing this movie i sobbed in my car for 5 minutes.

That is one of many reasons I love his music, it will always be changing on you. This starts out with a rousing Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum that just rocks, Mississippi goes blues and just when you think you've figured out where this is going, along comes Floater (too much to ask) and we're in the 30's and big band sound. There is also the 50's rock n roll, so just enjoy yourself and let this one roll over you, it keeps growing on you the more you listen. His voice is deeper, growlier and full of feeling. This is a KEEPER.
0143118420|3.0|I had heard all the hype about this book. I bought it. It wasn't a long read, but I just could NOT finish it to save my life! I happened on a discounted set of audio cds of Eat, Pray, Love---read by the author. I listened to all 10(!) CDs and it was THE BEST way to experience this book. You could hear her passion, her confusion, her frustrations....and you empathized with her. You rooted for her. This is one time where I think reading a book was a waste. Hearing her pronounce words she is learning in each language was great. You just can't get that from reading the book.
192076920X|4.0|Shantaram - a novel written by Gregory David Roberts, a convicted Australian bank robber and heroin addict who escaped from Pentridge Prison and fled to India where he lived for 10 years. This book is believed by some to be based on real events; however, the story and its incidents are largely fictional.<br /><br />This novel is influenced by real events in the life of the author. In 1978, Roberts was sentenced to nineteen years' imprisonment in Australia after being convicted of a series of armed robberies, which he had committed to feed a heroin addiction after his marriage ended and he lost his daughter. In 1980, he escaped from the prison in broad daylight, thereby becoming one of Australia's most wanted men.<br /><br />The protagonist arrives in Bombay (now Mumbai) carrying a false passport in the name of Lindsay Ford. Mumbai was only a stopover, but he decides to stay in the city. Lin meets a guide - Prabaker - who soon becomes his best friend. When Lin goes to Prabhakar's village, Lin gets his name 'Shantaram' (meaning Man of God's Peace). On getting robbed while returning to Mumbai, Lin is forced to live in the slums, giving him shelter from the authorities and free rent in Mumbai, where he sets up a free health clinic. During his stay, he learns much of the local culture, including learning Marathi, Mumbai's local language.<br /><br />This novel describes a number of foreigners too - Karla, Didier, Ulla, and so on. Lin falls in love with Karla, befriends local artists, and is recruited by the Mumbai underworld for various criminal operations. Lin eventually lands in Bombay's Arthur Road Prison; however, Lin is eventually released thanks to the protection of Afghani mafia don \\"Abdel Khader Khan\\". Eventually, Lin works in black market currency exchange and passport forgery. Lin later goes to Afghanistan to smuggle weapons for mujahideen freedom fighters in Afghanistan. And it is in Afghanistan that he gets to know the various secrets from Khan and falls into depression after he returns. When his mentor Khan is killed, Lin decides that he must fight for what he believes is right, and build an honest life.<br /><br />The way Roberts has written this book is in a flow. The beginning of the book is a bit slow, only picking up momentum as we progress. There were few chapters that had descripton of various characters in detail, which I feel at times wasn't required in such detail. Also, since I was aware of the fact that there was a movie being planned on this book, with Johnny Depp playing the lead of Shantaram and Amitabh Bachchan playing Abdel Khader Khan, I was visualizing Johnny Depp and Amitabh Bachchan while reading the book.<br /><br />This book is worth a read - at times it is slow - but overall, it's a good read.rns.

0375507256|1.0|'Disapointment´is an understatement for this book which is, in my 44 years of reading, possibly the most awful thing I've read. The idea is, in theory, brilliant, but despite my plodding, persisting and struggling through the pages, I found nothing to suggest it was anything other than - dare I say, amateur. It didn´t hang together, it made absolutely no sense and the plots were just fantastical and unrealistic. I won´t deny Mitchell´s undeniable talent as a critically acclaimed and esteemed author, it´s just this book......One of the reviews I read on this site was from someone who had read it and wanted to claim their life back for the hours wasted on reading it. I share this sentiment, having chosen it as the only fiction to bring on my Spanish holiday. Sadly, I feel completely ripped off, conned even. I´d have got more sense from actually sticking my head in the clouds for a few days, and wish I had.
030726999X|4.0|First of all, \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest\\" is not stand-alone book. Anybody who has not read the first two books in the series by Stein Larsson, besides being confused and likely bored, will be left questioning the hype. Those of us who love this series will find much less action and a lot more talk along with recitations of Swedish law and politics. This can get tiresome at times, but does add a lot of background which heightens and adds substance to the plot and conclusion as the story proceeds. I do not see any point in summarizing what happens in this book (and adding bulk to this review) and will just give some of my impressions. It begins with Lisbeth Salander in recovery from the action at the end of the \\"the Girl Who Played with Fire' and facing new perils, mostly from sinister forces within the Swedish legal system and intelligence service (SAPO). Lisbeth is far from helpless, and is exotic, spunky, and quirky as ever. She also has many friends and sympathizers helping her cause, such as the main character of #1 and #2, journalist Mikhail Blomkvist. Most of the activity is cerebral and clever as Lisbeth and her band of supporters outwit and expose those who have hijacked Swedish democracy and decency leaving the bad guys to their just desserts and the heroes to good things. No spoiler intended, but it ends about as one would expect with some excitement, courtroom drama, and a nasty (in the best sense) confrontation near the end. Is the \\"Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest great? No, but it is near great, must reading for Lisbeth Salander fans, and I am torn between four and five stars.  I hope there are more of this series in the Stein Larsson archives.
B0029O08WA|3.0|I was really disappointed with this soundtrack.  Granted that the book and movie are slow and depressing in mood because of the plot, but the whole soundtrack really didn't need to be.  I like that all the artists are original, but the songs are just too slow and depressing.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend.  I'm not going to talk about the actual story because others have done a great job of it.  I'm going to talk about the reading experience.<br /><br />It took me close to 100 pages to get into it, just as my friend had warned me.  I believe the problem is that there are a lot of Swedish names of streets, buildings, towns etc. that are hard to wrap our minds around because they are long and unfamiliar.  At any rate, just as she said, all of a sudden this book grabbed me and I couldn't put it down.  I was reading half the night.  Although I couldn't read full time, I read all 3 of the trilogy within 4 or 5 days.<br /><br />This was supposed to be the first book of a 10 book series, but unfortunately, the author died while writing book 4.  What a disappointment to think that there are no more in this series to read.  I highly recommend this trilogy.<br /><br />Can't wait for the movies!
B002FGU4EE|5.0|I bought these for my husband, so I can not comment on exactly how they feel.  I can tell you that from the second he tried them on, he was in love with them.  He said they are the most comfortable sandal he's ever had.  I have purchased other 'expensive' sandals for him, but he said that the sole and the arch support on this one is what makes it feel like a tennis shoe, only better.  Most of his other sandals are more flat footed, he said he loves the contours of this sole.  They look great, too!

B002GY9F9K|3.0|This is one of those Sunday afternoon epic fantasy series that media conglomerates, in hopes of finding the next Xena, create but don't really support. It nonetheless has its charm.    But first, why someone might not like this. There's no shortage of reasons. If you know anything about sword martial arts, for instance, the fight scenes are distractingly unrealistic even before they get repetitive. (Real sword fights weren't flashy: they tended to be tedious as they were frightening, if they weren't simply dehumanizing bloodbaths.) And of course, since this is television, it bowls a near 300 in terms of fantasy cliches. (Google 'fantasy cliches' and any of the lists that come up are essentially lists of spoilers for this show.)    But most of the problems stem from the structure of individual episodes. I can't find a list of complete screenplay credits, but it feels like the assignments for different episodes were doled out to different writers who went off and did their own thing. Having to write twenty-two episodes is a lot of work -- that ends up being about as long as the entire Star Wars hexalogy. The fast way to do this is to farm out the work. But the problem is that different writers, some of whom don't seem to have much respect for the genre, have different conceptions of the show. This causes the show to wildly fluctuate. One episode, for example, is basically a battle over the soul of a man between a reluctant, maternal, chaste dominatrix and a class of genuinely sadistic dominatrixes. (Is there even a plural of `dominatrix'?) There's no G-rated way to describe the plot. Then the next episode seems geared toward the ten-year old crowd, except it's so violent it has a decapitated head talking. Then there's an episode on whether to engage in infanticide. Huh? Who is the intended audience here?    This moodiness also creates all manner of inconsistencies. What is easy to do with magic in one episode is virtually impossible in another. A tough female character screams in one episode like a little girl in fright. In some episodes, swords become bloody. In others, they don't. Again, huh?    It also makes the plot lines very repetitive: there's a continual rehashing of the debate about whether it's acceptable to sacrifice the innocent to defeat the ultimate evil. The main good guy is repeatedly presented with side quests from his job of killing the said ultimate evil. This invariably leads to questions of whether he should in fact allow himself to be distracted and he invariably concludes that completing the side quest helps the larger mission.     Then there's the Merlin/Gandolf/Obi-Wan/Dumbledore character of Zeddicus the wizard. The actor is a pretty good wizard when he's angry, but most episodes use him as comic relief and that's quite frankly painful. At those moments, he really reminds me of Tom Bergeron. You shouldn't be thinking of America's Funniest Videos while watching epic fantasy.     All of these things aside, the show is fun to watch. For starts, the book upon which it is based is unreadable -- those one- and two-star reviews for _The Wizard's First Rule_ are accurate -- so expectations going in will be low. Second, almost everyone involved seems to have embraced what they're doing and that enthusiasm is infectious. (It's not like the actors are resentful that they're working on this when they were destined for Oscar-winning adaptions of Henry James.)    Third, the  show is simply so good looking. I was too irritated with how they mangled the books to appreciate the scenery in The Lord of the Rings movies, but in this show, New Zealand, as composited and touched up by computers, is jaw dropping. The special effects, except for the ones involving fire, are quite nice, and the costumes are rich and just feel right. And the cast is serious eye candy -- the show dispenses with the cliche of requiring villains to be unattractive -- and is on serious display. It's pretty amusing how many different excuses they have for having people underdressed. (And the Midlands have amazing dentists. Such sparkling teeth!)    The real saving grace of this show is the actress who plays the Confessor (the previously mentioned reluctant and chaste dominatrix). Like almost everyone else in the show, she's attractive of course. She's played by Bridget Regan, a sort of poor man's Molly Parker. (Okay, you've never heard of Molly Parker: she's this great Canadian character actor trapped in an extremely attractive body.) Regan is able to handle a wide range of emotions with a light earnestness and a thin smile that neutralizes the potential absurdity or triteness or melodrama of many of the scenes.  She can go from silly, like when a goofball character figures out a way to impersonate her -- you can tell by her body language whether it's really the Confessor or the impersonator -- to tragic: she carries the weight in the last episode of the first season, which has probably the most poignant time travel story I've ever encountered. (It should have been a season in itself.) A forbidden love is central to the story and Regan can really convey the pain of it.    The bonus materials are thin. There are some commentaries, which generally sound like \\"Oh, there's Bob, the stunt-guy. He gets killed about every other episode. Great guy. Very funny.\\" They do occasionally make some interesting observations, like when a producer comments that a monster in the pilot episode cost a lot of money and then watches the scene and observes that it didn't cost enough, or like when the man who plays the male lead said his initial concern about the show was that it would end up being \\"Baywatch in the Woods\\". The \\"Making of. . .\\" is basically an ad.     Overall, my sense is that life is generally too short for television like this, but if you're going to be stuck somewhere -- a trans-Pacific flight, home recovering from a nasty cold -- this show is fun and will make the time go by very quickly.

B0039SFKSW|1.0|lacking progressive elements is an understatement as well as the song There Was a Time. I bought this CD expecting to hear the powerful asia from my teen years, but was surprised to find asia' niche is now easy listening.     Do not buy this CD if you're expecting Only Time Will Tell, or Heat Of The Moment.      I turned to the bands official site looking to express my opinion, but the inexpensive looking site had no message board.    I went to the band members websites and was surprised to see that my post to express my criticism of the CD was deleted.    As I read some posts I was mystified as it appeared that it was or what is supposed to be John Wetton posting to everyone throughout the day, every day.        Thinking this was a bit unrealistic or unconventional, I created 4 different screen names and asked John Wetton 4 questions, to my surprise all 4 questions were answered by John Wetton?, within minutes.      I suspect a ghostly activity, or some shady phantom public relations tactic going on, to probably help the sales of this boring CD or his own unpopular solo releases that never made it on radio.    Being unable to express my honest opinion it is not a realistic message board where fans can honestly express or exchange their thoughts, but rather I found a very controlled and unrealistic environment.    Was John Wetton just waiting by the computer for me or anyone to register and post? I doubt it as much as I believe JFK was revived.   Save your money on this CD, unless you like Engelbert Humperdinck attempting to step it up a notch.

Everything you could possibly want in an animated Batman film.  This is what you get when you combine Batman the Animated Series with the Dark Knight.     As a matter of fact, this is the 3rd best Batman film ever created. Period. Right behind The Dark Knight and Batman Begins... Awesome!!!

B002VPE1XY|4.0|Typically leather camera cases are overpriced and/or poorly made.  Because of this, my camera, a pocket-sized Canon SD780, had been sitting in a large, unattractive, nylon case for a while.  It has now moved to this much better looking, well made case.<br /><br />Size - The case is a bit smaller than expected, but luckily it fits my camera like a glove.  It adds less than 1/2 inch of thickness to the camera and is still very pocketable.<br /><br />Features - The case has a convenient hole for the camera strap at the top, a magnetic snap closure, a fairly useless small slot for a memory card, and a velcro closure belt strap.<br /><br />Materials - This series is called \\"Basics\\", and it is fairly basic.  The leather is decent, but the rough edges aren't all that attractive.  The snap seems solid and well attached.  The belt clip seems a bit cheap, and like it could come apart/tear off.  The case will hold up to use for a while, but I wouldn't expect a lifetime.<br /><br />Overall I think this case is a good value for the money.  Although not the best case in the world, it's certainly better than typical cases in this range.

0805091742|4.0|As a surgeon, Atul Gawande has been thinking hard for years about how to make the surgery room safer.  The surgery room can be an incredibly complex place because the individuals -- surgeon, nurse, anesthesiologist -- involved are highly specialized individuals who must exercise extreme discretion and precision in their work.  The stress and the complexity involved means that now and then a nurse forgots to wash her hands, with disastrous and deadly consequences.  It's also common that when strangers suddenly meet in a room to either save or destroy lives people forget to ask each other's names, let alone communicate during surgery.  Atul Gawande's solution is simple and effective:  a check-list.    This idea is about how to practically implement the universally promoted mantras of teamwork and discipline , communication and process.  Atul Gawande looks at the different fields of medicine, aviation, and finance, and argues that all three are high-pressure environments where highly intelligent and usually extremely disciplined individuals temporarily let go of their sanity.  To hold everything in place and to cool the most feverish heads Atul Gawande suggests a check-list.  Indeed, people have always thought that Warren Buffett, that most legendary of investors, himself keeps a mental check-list (although he would make more money if he kept a real one, because even geniuses slip now and then).      Atul Gawande is not suggesting that the checklist is a panacea -- what it is is a physical and concrete reminder for individuals, who would otherwise be overwhelmed by either pressure or ego, to maintain and to follow process, and to communicate with teammates, no matter how mundane and redundant the tasks seem.      Dr. Gawande is not a great writer, and he's aware of his limitations so he keeps his book short, simple, and plain.  We can also see that when writing and editing his book he also kept a checklist.  Do I make my main point, and back it up with evidence and proof?  Do I hold the audience's interest, and explain things in the clearest and simplest manner?
B003JYOFIW|5.0|I've been a DEVO fan since 1980 and saw them in concert during their \\"Oh No! It's DEVO!\\" tour.  What a great time that was.  However, my interest in their music starting fading with their \\"SmoothNoodleMaps\\" CD.  I really liked the \\"Post-Post Modern Man\\" track on that CD, but the rest sounded like filler.  It seemed the best of DEVO's remarkable creative energy had become depleted (even though Mark Mothersbaugh successfully continued making commercial music for soundtracks, etc.)   Throughout all these years, I have thoroughly enjoyed listening to their older albums.  Then I discovered DEVO had released \\"Something for Everybody\\" and decided to buy it.  It is a jubilant return to their creative heyday.  With familiar sounds from previous albums like \\"Freedom of Choice\\", \\"New Traditionalists\\" and \\"Oh No! It's DEVO!\\", I have had so much fun listening to this new album.  The sound is definitely classic DEVO with as much energy, quirk and pep as ever.  This time around, the songs have a stronger message.  Perhaps they were right all along about de-evolution.  But the message doesn't overshadow the fun of listening to this energetic record.  A couple of years ago, DEVO-contemporaries, the B-52's, released a CD of all new material, and it was fantastic.  DEVO's new release is just as good.  What a treat to have fun new music from DEVO!  I highly recommend it.
B001UV4XUG|1.0|The plot for this awful film is simple, boy meets girl, girl dumps boy, boy bellyaches for the rest of the film. The two main actors are horrendous!!! They are at best supporting characters not Star material.  Zoey is very beautiful but can only show one emotion which is indifference. Levitt is just painful to watch, I wanted to punch him through the entire film.  This movie is full of boring romance film cliche's. And the cheesy ending, brutal!!! There are way better romantic films to watch with your lady, eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, Charade. Avoid this ridiculous movie.

B002OEBMN4|3.0|This could have been a good album like Season of the abyss but, Tom Araya continues to want to scream instead of sing for some stupid reason. I guess he wants to assimiliate into the hardcore trend of todays metal. Personally i think the thrash groove Slayer displayed in their early albums where Tom actually sang on key is more aggressive and darker then what they've come out with since Diabalos en musica but, some one needs to drill that concept into Tom's head
B002ZG983M|1.0|Before you say anything about premature reviews (as the official release date is next week), I have received this DVD today from a retailer who ships DVDs well before the official release.    And now that we got that part out of the way, let's cut to the chase: The dynamic range of this DVD's audio track is compressed beyond recognition, i.e. every single scene in this movie has the exact level of loudness, which is especially annoying during action scenes. They even seem quieter than the scenes surrounding them and lack any sort of bass! Normally, action scenes should be the loudest part of a movie, here it is the other way around. I have played this DVD on two separate systems, and both showed the same results, so it definitely is an issue with the DVD itself. It also is not an issue with the movie. In the theater, everything sounded as it should sound.  The DVD almost sounds like the action scenes were edited separately from the rest because they also don't have any bass (the other scenes do have bass).    And to add insult to injury, this DVD has a form of copy protection that violates the DVD standard, i.e. some players, and especially computers, might not even play this disc!    I love this movie, but this DVD manages to screw it up really good. I have never heard anything like this on a DVD (and I have a rather large collection). Please abstain from buying this until Lionsgate decides to release a corrected version.    Seriously, does the loudness war have to extend to movies now, too?

0783225725|5.0|Critics and audiences made a huge deal over Unforgiven as being innovative and being a modern Western.  Clint Eastwood did this in 1973 with High Plains Drifter.  With set designs harkening back to German Expressionism and filming techniques that employ Surrealism, this film was lost in the 70's cynical treatment of the Western as a genre and never got its just dues.  Those of us who love the Western will never pass up a chance to watch it in reruns.  This was a Western that pulls no punches and all of the characters are despicable.  Innovative, provocative, and uncompromising, High Plains Drifter was way ahead of its time for its filming technique, treatment of the anti-hero and the forerunner of many \\"revisionist\\" Westerns to come.

6301971272|5.0|An epic masterpiece of tremendous proportions.  Sergio Leone is a genius at directing this movie and employed innovative usage of extreme close-ups, unusual camera angles, extended sequences and amazing action that changed how films were made after that.  What keeps us coming back to this movie time and time again is the wry humor and the MUSIC!!  Along with Jaws, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly elevates itself to the level of the greatest motion picture score of all time.  It has become a cliché now when the opening whistle melody embodies the Western shootout in movies, TV, commercials, you name it.  Keep in mind, before this, the western ideal for music was always the large orchestral scores with sweeping melodies ala Copland, Korngold, Moross, Elmer Bernstein, etc.  Ennio Morricone used electric guitars, whistling and hyena howls!!  Talk about innovative!!  The Ecstasy of Gold sequence is a cinematic clinic on how to unite editing with music.
0451191153|5.0|But I hated every character in this book.  Everyone of them was a selfish, self-centered person.  Even those who pretended to be caring about their fellowman turned out to be selfish.  I think that is what I liked about the book, everyone behaved like many people I know.  Nobody was a \\"god.\\"  The story itself a pretty good read, but I'll be remembering these people for a long time.
B000F0UUIM|5.0|Monument Valley never looked better in VistaVision's three strip filming process.  Roger Ebert stated, \\"John Ford's ''The Searchers'' contains scenes of magnificence, and one of John Wayne's best performances. There are shots that are astonishingly beautiful.\\"  The only Western in history to be placed in the top 10 Sight & Sound Poll as among the greatest films of all time.  AFI ranked The Searchers #12 in their all-time list and in 1989 the United States National Film Registry's first year of selecting films for preservation, chose The Searchers as one of the first 25 films to be deemed \\"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.\\"  The Searchers has influenced films as diverse as Star Wars, Taxi Driver, Hardcore, Dances with Wolves, Saving Private Ryan, The Wind and the Lion and Apocalypse Now.  David Lean studied The Searchers in preparation for Lawrence of Arabia and as a result movie history was made with that famous shot of the across-the-desert entrance of Sherif Ali.  Sergio Leone listed The Searchers as one of his favorite films.  Much has been made of the film's racist overtones, but both sides were equally represented and based on historical fact.  The basis of Ethan Edward's obsession is clearly stated when Debbie hides next to a tombstone that states the massacre of Ethan's mother at the beginning of the film.  Not so obvious is John Ford's hidden subtext about Ethan's affair with his brother's wife and that Lucy or Debbie could possibly be Ethan's children.  The thirst for vengeance makes total sense especially with the prospect that Debbie's been \\"living with a Buck.\\"  So many great scenes (the wedding scene, the letter reading scene) and lots of comic relief (\\"That'll be the day!\\"), keep the viewer's interest throughout.  As far as I'm concerned, this is John Wayne's greatest acting triumph.  When Ethan has to explain to Brad that Lucy was dead and he says, \\"What do you want me to do? Draw you a picture? Spell it out? Don't ever ask me! Long as you live, don't ever ask me more,\\" is delivered with such harrowing conviction by Wayne, it gives me goose bumps.  Then there is the scene when Ethan sees two white women who were raped by Indians and regressed to their childhood, Ethan says, \\"They aren't white. Not anymore.\\"  As Ethan exits we are given one of the greatest close-ups in movie history (seen over and over again in motion picture retrospectives).  John Ford was sparse with camera movements and so when he employs camera movements, there is a heightened sense of drama.  Ford's camera rapidly tracks in on Wayne's face to that close-up and reveals Ethan's total contempt--a chilling moment.  Every shot is framed.  I've never seen a movie that did this so effectively and with such beauty.  It's like Frederic Remington painted each shot.  Keep in mind, this is all before CGI.  The cinematography is stunning.  Then there is that incredible final shot, perfectly framed again with awesome cinematography and John Wayne's personal tribute to Harry Carey.  I am in awe every time I watch this movie.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|This movie was absolutely amazing! The story itself gives a different view of religion. Eli's \\"quest\\" was a powerful message in what it was about. It showed a man following what he believed in and being rewarded, in a way, for his staying the course. Denzel Washington did an excellent job in portraying the man. As did Ms. Kunis showing a different side of herself. The actors picked were great! The ending kind of throws your for a loop but it makes you appreciate Eli all that much more.
0792163710|5.0|This movie has it all...action, family values, gunfights, fist fights, great humor, great dialogue, incredible editing (saloon fight and final shootout), beautiful Teton locations, breathtaking cinematography, incredible cast and incredible acting.  As a Librarian, I usually say that the book is better than the movie, however, the book comes nowhere near the character development or having the reader visualize the locale.  George Stevens accomplishes this and more.  This movie operates on so many levels that it takes repeated viewings to understand all of the subtleties (especially in the actor's choices).  Just like The Searchers, the sexual tension between the main character and the female lead contributes to a multi-layered screenplay that would make Freud proud.  There are so many great moments in this film (Stevens is a master of great movie moments):  Dixie on the harmonica, Shane's first dinner and the reaction of Joey when Shane gets jumpy, the stare-down between Shane and Jack Wilson when they meet for the first time, the fist fight in the saloon,  Stonewall's death scene in the mud and the subsequent scene at the Reb's funeral and his dog at the gravesite (the crew wept while filming this scene) and of course the final scene.  In 1993, Shane was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\\"
B002VWNICW|5.0|First off, let me say that I'm not a huge Jane Austin fan, nor am I a fan of most 'romantic' movies (because they suck!).  But I absolutely adore this movie.  For all you purists out there who complain it leaves too much of the details out, it's a movie not a mini-series.  I also have the 4 disc BBC production, which is lovely, but who has time to watch 8 hrs. of movie on a regular basis?  Visually this movie is stunning, and so is Kierra.  It looked awesome in DVD and is even better in Blu-ray.  It's a much 'fresher' version of the original, the actors are just as good (Mathew MacFayden is just as good a Mr. Darcy as Colin Firth, just different)and the photography will simply blow you away.  Just a beautiful, beautiful film.

The thing that got me was that it showed the entire amount I needed were available, but there was a limit placed on the amount that I could buy.  This meant that I had to go to other vendors to complete the purchase for my group.  I will look at that first next time and probably choose to use a vendor who can complete my order amount and not buy from this vendor in those instances.
030726999X|5.0|Ever so often a book or series of novels sets the world aflame with its fame. This was the case with the Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings books. Now the fire has been set blazing by the literary talents of the late<br />Stiegg Larsson (1954-2004) from Stockholm Sweden. Larsson was an investigative reporter, expert on Neo-Nazi and right wing nut groups and a strong feminist and opponent of violence against women.<br />  The three books in the trilogy are\\"The Girl With the Spider Tattoo\\"; \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" and \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.\\" In over 1500 pages of dense text and well rounded characters Larsson is able to weave together an exciting murder mystery, a psychological examination of troubled souls and enough Swedish lugubrious atmosphere to warm the cockles of the late film director Ingman Bergman's Swedish heart.<br />  In this last book we see Lisbeth Salander recovering from serious injuries which were incurred by her ax wielding attack on her father Alexander Zalachenko and her brother Niderman (who is responsible for the three murders which police suspect were committed by Lisbeth!). She is helped in her trial by journalist Mikael Blomkvist who is her former lover and has a deep desire to help her in her predicament. She is defended by Mikael's lawyer sister<br />Mrs. Giannini. Salander is opposed by a rogue organization called the \\"Section\\" operating within the Swedish government's secret service.<br />  The book is very long and is character driven. Sometimes you feel Larsson's yarn has more characters in it that does a brick of a book by the likes of Tolstoy or Dostoevski! Is is something about the long Swedish winters?<br />The book has a satisfying ending; the court scenes  memorable. The book deserves its reputation as the number one novel on the Amazon bestseller list. It is regretful that Larsson did not live to complete his projected ten novel series on the lives of Salander and Blomkvist. The book has many characters with hard to remember and pronounce Swedish names; includes a great deal about the publishing business and is detailed in its coverage of police procedures. It is still a worthwhile read for those who persevere in this convoluted tale of murder and redemption. A classic in the filed of crime novels.ber and pronounce Swedish names; includes a great deal about the publishing business and is detailed in its coverage of police procedures.

B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Clint Eastwood really does act well.  His character begins as a frustrated and negative Korean War Veteran/Retired Auto Worker who is hateful of his Asian neighbors. But as the movie progresses, he softened by his neighbors love and generosity.  By the end of of this film, Clint becomes quite fond of his Asian neighbors and makes a great sacrifice to eliminate a violent gang.  I enjoyed this film very much and so will you.

Since I read five people it was very meaningful and had a clear message that it was trying to send and I knew tuesday's with morrie would be the same as well. I have not been a very avid reader in recent years, but with this book it put me on track to start another book as well as another Albom book.

B002ZG98VE|5.0|It used to be the standard, in educating the young members of American or British societies, to talk about the Magna Carta as the root document for our idea of liberties.  We have gotten away from that because the Magna Carta applied only to a small number of people, and it was only over time that the class of people who enjoyed those liberties expanded.      Yet there is a great truth hidden in the old story, which this movie helps restore.  The late historian Sidney Painter wrote of how the Normans extended what had been the rights of \\"vassals\\" who served the king to all free men, as a means of avoiding revolts.  As the class of free persons grew during the Middle Ages, all who joined that class came to enjoy what had been (and remained, in other parts of Europe) the traditional rights of knights.    The history in this movie is imperfect, in order to tell that story in a way that is easier for a modern ear to hear.  Nevertheless, the movie is outstanding as an endorsement of ancient liberties in full voice.  Robin Hood, 'the common archer,' is elevated to knighthood by pretense and comes to be a defender of the idea that these basic rights should be enjoyed by all of humankind.  This movie does a great service by providing a aesthetic to go with these ancient notions of \\"liberty by law,\\" and helping to introduce modern viewers to the questions.  As with Braveheart -- another movie whose history was imperfect, and indeed far worse -- those engaged by the aesthetic will pursue these questions further, to our common profit.

This movie is not for children at all which is probably why its so good. I was scared to see how they would animate the death of Jason Todd onto a screen and it was a lot better than I expected. Aside from the voices, which change every movie so it seems, its still great. Great action/chase scenes and its shows what great partners Batman trains. The graphics are exceptional...even in regular format. The characters are well developed for such a short run time.

B0019N8P2W|4.0|I was ecstatic to finally be able to purchase the whole series instead of just watching scattered episodes on YouTube.  To sit down and watch the whole thing was fun, and it shows the complex progression and character development that the series begins during the third season.  The rumors, however, are true, the music is mostly changed.  I can get over that, but it does remove some of _Daria's_ cultural situatedness.  Without the 90s soundtrack, it feels as though Lawndale could be a cartoon \\"anytime/anyplace\\" instead of a very important generational moment.  Overall, I got over it.  Unfortunately, my main complaints with the dvds are about the sound quality.  It's inconsistent, and the dialogue varies in volume at times.  Also, there's no episode guide included with the dvds at all.  Some kind of booklet would have been nice.  I guess they produced this one on the cheap, which helps the affordability, but I'd easily have paid $25-30 more for MTV to have been a bit more fan-conscious.  Ultimately, I love the set, and I don't regret buying it.

0321687299|5.0|HTML5 is creating more and more a name for itself in our industry, but while it excites those on the cutting edge of web technology, many are left feeling uncertain about it. Its ongoing development has been victim of politics, fragmentation and more, leaving few to have a good grasp of its current status. However, a lot of the technologies that make up HTML5 (and more) have become mature, even implemented across all the latest browsers--but did you know that? If you've kept an arms length to everything going on with HTML5, now is the time to dive into its waters and explore.<br /><br />Fortunately, you don't have to do it all by yourself: just get Introducing HTML5, written by Bruce Lawson (Opera) and Remy Sharp (Left Logic).<br /><br />Exactly as its name implies, Introducing HTML5 is an introduction to all the new semantics and application-oriented technologies that make up the HTML5 spec. You don't have to be a web development expert to read this, but you'll come out closer to one when you've finished. All you need is a good grasp of web standards-based techniques, e.g. semantic markup; separation of structure, presentation and behavior; and accessibility. Bruce and Remy will teach you everything you need to know to bring your skill set to the next level.<br /><br />Starting out light, Introducing HTML5 first teaches you the most important new HTML5 elements and their semantic purposes, which is especially helpful if, like me, you kept an eye on these since the early stages of HTML5, but got confused as their meanings were changed or redefined.<br /><br />The book continues with the new HTML5 Forms, serving as a nice segue into the more JavaScript-reliant HTML5 Audio and Video, before it hunkers down on the real new technologies in HTML5, starting with Canvas and going all the way to the Messages, Web Workers and Web Sockets APIs.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Bruce and Remy do a great job at not just introducing the new technologies, but informing you exactly of what does and doesn't work in which browsers. Even the latest releases of browsers have some glaring bugs here and there, but where fixes are available, they are presented, and where not, workarounds explained. As a result, Introducing HTML5 is a tremendously practical book, going well beyond a surface-level introduction and straight-up teaching you how to wield these new technologies today.<br /><br />One thing I am personally very happy about is how the book teaches you how to implement things in an accessible way (via ARIA or otherwise), making sure that visitors to your sites aren't left out. HTML5 is exciting, but our excitement shouldn't come at the cost of accessibility--and following Bruce and Remy's advice, it won't.<br /><br />The compact but dense information in Introducing HTML5 means that in just an afternoon or two, you'll find yourself brimming with new knowledge, excitement and ideas for making your websites or web applications richer, more exciting and more powerful. All in all, a highly recommended read.browsers.

B002VPE1XE|5.0|I measure the interior of the main compartment of this medium-ish bag to be 5 x 3 x 2.3\\". The interior lining is soft and protective, and the outer fabric is a good quality heavy nylon packcloth. Has a nice belt loop with handy velcro so the belt doesn't have to come off in order to install or remove it. On the front there is a sidewise slender pocket with a good quality zipper. On mine, the velcro closure is where it is supposed to be for the bag to function properly. So maybe there was a quality control issue with the bag received by the earlier reviewer.<br /><br />There is one flaw on mine, which is that the top flap is too narrow to properly protect the contents of the bag. If I were to load it in just the right way, and really stuff it, the flap would keep stuff in, but not completely prevent rain from entering. That is if I were out in the rain. Otherwise it wouldn't be an issue, would it? So - sooner or later I will find a piece of black coated nylon in my arsenal of such stuff, and create a little rain shroud. Already got it designed in my head. I'm always doing that kind of mod. But one shouldn't really have to. Still for six bucks this gets five stars.
0060558121|2.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Anansi Boys and Neverwhere, so I was really looking forward to American Gods because I knew so many people that looooved this book. When I finished the first chapter, I was sure I'd be one of them. But by the time I got halfway through, I felt like I was still trying to figure out where the story was going. There were too many scenes that didn't seem all that relevant to the plot. This one just didn't grab me like his others.<br /><br />I know many people value a strong literary voice; I'm not one of them. Gaiman really seemed to capture a nice balance between the literary arts and the pace of unfolding a plot with Anansi Boys and Neverwhere, but I felt American Gods tipped over on the literary side this time.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|-Background-<br />This is my third headset for use in the workplace. I'm in the IT field. I spend about half my day talking to people, and the other half with my head down working. The trouble is, the people around me are in the same situation, and our quiet parts of the day are seldom aligned, plus we are all loud talkers, so my office is usually really noisy.<br /><br />The first two headsets I tried were earbud headsets. One set (Shure e2c) accomplished sound-isolation via earbuds composed of foam earplugs. Another set (from Phillips) used active noise cancellation. Both worked pretty well, the Shure being the standout for sound quality, but earbuds have a few fundamental problems.<br /><br />I found earbuds were a real pain to take in and out of the ear to accommodate 'drive-by' conversations. The Phillips would sometimes fall out of the ear. With the Shure headphones, I could stand to have them in my ears for about a half-day before the skin in my ears became irritated and wearing them became painful. The noise cancellation feature was great for external low frequency sounds, but did not isolate the real noise problem of background noise from other people talking.<br /><br />After some painstaking Googling and reading up on reviews here at Amazon ('Amazoning?'), I landed on these headphones.<br /><br />-Sound Quality-<br />This was my first set of high quality over ear headphones, so I cannot size these headphones up against their competitors. That said, I was floored by the sound quality of these headphones. Previously, my favorite place for enjoying music was in the car, where I can play it as loud as I like without the concern of disturbing others (my own little environmentally-controlled acoustic bubble). They blew away any consumer-accessible home theater setup, car stereo, headphone or earbud I had ever heard previously, and instantly sold me on high-quality headphones as the ideal music enjoyment experience.<br /><br />These headphones are very well balanced. The lows are perfect: Strong but not overpowering or uncomfortable, present, and clear. Well managed bass is typically difficult to find in headphones, where it is either overdone or underpowered. Highs are are perfect: Clear, and not overpowering or \\"over bright.\\" I have never heard high 'clipping' or distortion unless it was in the recording. With well-balanced highs and lows, the oft-neglected mid tones are in perfect balance with the rest of the sound. I feel like the sound is perfect, an even, level balance, even after several years of heavy use. I hear things in music that I never noticed before (even with other headphones), like sniffs and coughs from the audience during a winter-time recording of Horowitz.<br /><br />-Sound Isolation-<br />The headphones have a sealed back. They do a great job of filtering out background noise. I sometimes wear them alone (no music) just to muddle down the noise in the office and on airplanes. They work just well enough - better than nothing but not as isolating as foam earplugs (and certainly more comfortable).<br /><br />Good sound isolation sets the stage for good sound reproduction. I barely have to turn my iPod up to enjoy music at a comfortable level. The lowest volume settings easily drown out my coworkers and works well on crowded airplanes, also.<br /><br />They also do a great job of not letting sound *out.* I often listen to really good jams pretty loud at the office. When I press the ear cups together, I can barely tell they are on while holding them in my hands. Great for not disturbing people around you or for not disturbing one's partner when playing video games late into the night.<br /><br />-Usability-<br />You don't need a powerful setup to enjoy these headphones. I use them primarily with an iPod, but I have also used them for gaming.<br /><br />They are easy to take off and put on for quick conversations.<br /><br />While the sound quality is excellent, and a sealed back design is good for sound isolation, they may not be so good as a DJ headset, since the ear cups do not rotate 180 degrees.<br /><br />-Comfort-<br />I have a large cranium (I wear a XXL motorcycle helmet) and large-ish ears. These headphones fit great and feel great. Usually they are all the way out to the second or third from last 'click' on the headband adjuster. With the ear cups on, the headband rests on the top of my head, but has never tossed my hair.<br /><br />I routinely wear these for a full 8-12 hours. There is no pressure on or around my ears or on my head. Sometimes they get a little warm, but never uncomfortably so.<br /><br />On airplanes, I usually put them on as soon as I sit down to filter out the conversations around me, and leave them on for the whole flight, including sleeping with them on.<br /><br />-Durability-<br />These headphones don't get out much. They mostly sit in a drawer at my office when not in use. I have taken them on a few trips (DC to Salt Lake City and to Greece) where they have had to endure air travel in a laptop bag and a few trips through security. They have held up very well, with no signs of wear.<br /><br />-The Bottom Line-<br />These headphones changed the way I listen to music, and they inspired me to seek out a headset for gaming. I would buy them again without a second thought.<br /><br />I know Sony has made a successor to these headphones, and from what I've read, the sound quality on the newer headphones is not as well balanced. I hope Sony continues to manufacture these, as they are a very nice, high quality product. Why mess with perfection?<br /><br />I often seriously consider buying another set for home or as a backup to my set at the office.<br /><br />Highly recommended.olation, they may not be so good as a DJ headset, since the ear cups do not rotate 180 degrees.<br /><br />-Comfort-<br />I have a large cranium (I wear a XXL motorcycle helmet) and large-ish ears.

B000F8O4E0|5.0|The year 1975, was the year I woke up and discovered the beauty and the power of progressive and album rock.  My aunt introduced me to album rock while I was still listening to Casey Kasem's American Top 40.  That changed my life (nearly) forever when I suddenly discovered ELO, ELP, Robin Trower, Aerosmith, Yes, Led Zeppelin, Alice Cooper, Pink Floyd, and the such.  I stopped buying 45's and I started buying 8-track tapes, and then vinyl LP's.  Albums of the Immortal Gods of Rock Music.<br /><br />WDRQ FM 93 in Detroit played a great mix of current Top 40 music, mixed with pop from the late sixties to the current time of the summer of 1975.  I could never imagine that radio could ever be better.  Then when I started listening to WRIF and WABX, I heard more than just songs from artists that I heard the hits of, I started to hear other tracks from these artists that were simply just extra songs from their current new album, and from some previously released albums.<br /><br />I could give you many examples from so many great albums from 1975, but I'll just stick to how this album \\"Face the Music\\" from ELO moved me.  Earlier in the year of 1975, WDRQ started playing ELO's \\"Can't Get it Out of My Head\\", a Top Ten single.  As the song became more popular, WDRQ started to expand on the song, and so they started playing the \\"Eldorado Overture\\" and \\"Can't Get It Out of My Head\\" together.  That \\"Eldorado Overture\\" was like magic!  It wasn't a song, it was an introductory passage before the hit song.  I got goosebumps because I never heard something so beautiful.  At this time, I still never put it to my mind that if I wanted to own that whole song, I had to buy the whole album.  I've never bought a whole album before (well, except \\"Elton John's Greatest Hits), and after a while, the song disappeared from the radio format as newer songs were entering the Top 40 through the summer of 1975.<br /><br />Then, suddenly, I hear \\"Evil Woman\\" play on the radio.  I asked my favorite aunt (just two years older than myself) if she's ever heard of ELO, and then she asks me; \\"Where have you been?\\"  She owned the albums of \\"ELO II\\" and even \\"Eldorado\\".  When I saw the album of \\"Eldorado\\" by her stereo console, I got a hard-on!  I asked her if I could listen to it.  So, she put it on for me, and she had a pretty nice stereo (something I never heard before either).  Then, I heard the \\"Eldorado Overture\\" once again, but now with a wash of glorious amplified stereo emphasis.  My eyes teared up at the beauty of what I was hearing.  I listened to the whole album.  I wasn't familiar with anything else that was on the album, but I loved every song nonetheless, and how they all ran together like classical music with lyrics.  So, for my love for music at 14 years of age, I knew that I had to get out there and start cutting peoples grass, washing people's cars, and what ever little odd jobs I could get for myself so that I can get myself a real stereo.  My little Panasonic AM radio just wasn't enough for me anymore.  I had to get my own stereo.  Plus, I got myself a real job.  I started washing dishes in an Italian restaurant and as time went on, by first snow, I was taught how to make pizza.  This got me to make more money, and got me to buy my first stereo just before Christmas.  My parents would never buy me a stereo. I always knew that.<br /><br />When I got my first stereo, it had an FM band.  So, I started to listen to FM stereo in my room on my days off after school.  And about this time, I started hearing hits and non-hits from ELO, ELP, Robin Trower, Aerosmith, Yes, Led Zeppelin, Alice Cooper, Pink Floyd, and the such.  My life changed forever!  About this time, I heard ELO's \\"Evil Woman\\" on the radio and in stereo, but wait.  I started hearing other songs from their new album \\"Face the Music.\\"  WRIF started playing \\"Nightrider\\", \\"Poker\\", and even \\"Fire On High\\" and the DJ explained what artist it was and which album it came from.  FM DJ's talked differently than AM radio DJ's did.  They were more personal about the music. And more relaxed and mature. I loved that!  While heading into 1976, with my new stereo (unfortunately it had an 8-track deck, and not a turntable), I got more work to do, shoveling snow for cash on days I didn't work at the restaurant, and I kept buying vinyl LP's, and I eventually made enough money to buy a turntable.<br /><br />I know this review was more about a reminiscence of the era of when this album was released, but I wonder if other people had a similar experience as a kid who discovered album rock in this way.  I'd really like to read your story.  You can read more about my experiences of the introduction of progressive and album rock if you read my reviews on the Yes albums \\"Close To The Edge\\" and \\"The Yes Album\\".  These albums were also part of my transition to the love of the Immortal Gods of Rock.They were more personal about the music. And more relaxed and mature. I loved that!

B003U6HQGW|5.0|Truly Inspiring! At times, it may be hard to believe. but it is told with such humble pathos that one cannot help but weep with the men over the fate of Katrina, rejoice ecstatically over the successful trapping of a snake (their future meal), and hold their breath at the faintest hint of discovery. Only when this book has been read can your mind fully grasp the significance of &#34;to the utmost limits of one's strength&#34;. This story is one which will thrill you to the depths of your soul.

B003ITZBVI|4.0|Probably having just as much knowledge about the Batman mythos as any average Joe out there, I am glad to say that I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Batman: Under the Red Hood.\\"    The story itself is just as the advertisements have been talking about, everything revolving around just who exactly is this new person called the Red Hood. With Batman having taken down a good number of criminals and having already gone through two Robins in the process, it seems as if times are finally changing for the caped crusader. Having initially ruled over villains through fear, there still remain those who aren't intimidated by Batman and continue on their rampage around Gotham City. With this problem at hand, the Red Hood has taken it upon himself to clean up the crime Batman has left behind, not even fearing killing those who get in his way.    As short as the running time for the movie is, the pacing is actually perfect with nothing feeling either too fast or too slow. Gaps in the story are explained with the help of flashbacks and don't remove from the experience at all during the movie and appearances from villains the Joker and Black Mask only add to the enjoyment of the film. Conclusion: Definitely not your typical B-rate direct to DVD movie.    Special Features are standard for DC, with two documentaries covering the history of the first and second people to have played as Robin in the Batman mythos. Also tacked on (at least for the Blu-Ray version of the release) are two episodes from \\"The Batman\\" animated series, covering the backstory of the first Robin and two episodes from the original \\"Batman: The Animated Series\\" revolving around the Joker. While the Robin episodes make sense as an addition to this release, the two Joker ones seem more like they were added on last second in that they don't connect all that well to the film itself and are merely alright in terms of episode quality (the first, covering Harley's backstory is a fan favorite, but the second concerning the Joker andsome fish was rather dull).    For those who picked up the Target exclusive, the only additional content is a second disc, which contains the special features already on the first disc as well as two more episodes from the animated series I've yet to watch. I'd say if I had to choose again, I would have gladly gotten the amazon.com exclusive with the lithograph over a filler bonus disc any day.    All in all, a great movie that was only slightly hindered with its filler special features.
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|Celine Dion continues to exude professionalism with this DVD / CD set.   To see the concert then see the same concert from her perspective, backstage is truly a leaning experience.  If you own other Dion performances, and not this one, you lack the best.   If you own this performance and not others, you have the best.    John G.
142313494X|3.0|Curious about the buzz, I picked up _The Lightning Theif_.  It was entertaining, and I can see the appeal and attraction for young adult readers.  Even with the understanding that the book is geared towards a  younger audience, it wasn't spectacular.  There are a number of things the story has going for it: the protagonist has ADD / ADHD, and is labeled a \\"troublemaker\\" by his teachers - as it turns out, all the children of the gods (of which Percy - \\"Perseus\\" - is one of many) are so diagnosed.  The classical allusion and clues to Percy's father and breadcrumbs leading to the climax are a bit plain to a sophisticated reader, but will almost certainly keep the attention of younger readers, and the action is vivid.  An added bonus are the jokes and good-hearted jabs at adults in general and teachers specifically.  Its not a real stretch of the imagination to understand why these stories resonate with young boys especially.<br /><br />There are some flaws, however.  Most significantly for me was the dialogue and writing -as an earlier reviewer pointed out, the 'colloquial narration' wears thin after a few pages.  In fact, the quality of the writing overall is not nearly as tight nor as imaginitive as Rowling (my gold standard for YA literature.)  More than once the characters find themselves in dead-end situations that are resolved with rather silly escapes, as if Riordan wrote himself into a corner and needed an easy out to move on with the story.<br /><br />For adults, I can't recommend.  Riordan simply isn't as strong a writer as Rowling, Lewis or Tolkein.  However, for the young adult set, this would be near the top of my reading list.  Its an easy read (both in terms of story and language) and it will certainly capture their imagination.  As an added bonus, its a great introduction into the ancient world, Percy Jackson a younger, more modern stand-in for Odysseus.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|The Eagles are one of the greatest artist groups of all times. Born to the general public with original songs in the 70's, they still maintain   that certain stage presence that gained them instant fame.   This DVD set is well worth the investment for anyone remembering their continuing greatness.  RECOMMEND!    John G.
B002QGUFWE|5.0|I absolutely love this CD.  Not only does it contain several songs from the radio, but also some amazing new ones I had never heard before.  I would highly recommend it to any Lady Gaga fan!
B003INJETO|5.0|Many of the negative reviews on this album seem to have one central theme: this is not the Pain of Salvation we are used to.  You know what?  They are correct.  This is not the Pain of Salvation we are used to.    I heard a preview of Linoleum before the album came out, and let's just say, I was not particularly hopeful.  It was decent, but it wasn't prog metal.  And Pain of Salvation is a prog metal band, right?    Well... Maybe.  Was Be prog metal?  I don't think so.    So let's just get this out of the way: Road Salt One is not a prog metal album.  But Pain of Salvation already has at least four albums that can be easily slotted into the prog metal genre, and all are great, so why do we need another?  Is Daniel Gildenlow going to write a better prog metal album than Remedy Lane?  I'm not sure anybody is going to accomplish that feat.    So, perhaps Gildenlow decided that in order to prove he is not a one trick pony, he would try his hand at something else.  So we have Be, with its pastoral instrumentals spread among the relatively few straightforward songs.  Then we got Scarsick, which was easily their weakest effort to date.  The relative crappiness of Scarsick is the potential cause of my skepticism, but Gildenlow took a completely different path.      When I started listening to Road Salt One and discovered that it is not prog metal at all, I was at once taken aback and thrilled.  This is an album with its own distinct sound and melodies.  It is unique.  I find myself with an urge to listen to an album of 70s inspired songs with a truly modern view, and this is the only album that can satisfy that yearning.  Thus, it has spent more time in my rotation over the last month than any other album.  After digesting it, it doesn't get stale; it remains fresh with each spin.    If you want another great Pain of Salvation prog metal record, you might be left waiting for awhile.  But if you are truly progressive and appreciate the sort of change that modern prog has come to shun, by all means, buy this album.    UPDATE: Originally this review was four stars, due to the proclivity for most reviewers to give out five star reviews with reckless abandon, but I have updated it to five stars for two reasons: (a) this is getting unjustifiably panned by people who obviously can't listen to anything that does not stay strictly within the boundaries of what can be called progressive metal, and (b) it has only grown on me since I originally reviewed it.  This is up there with Remedy Lane for me now.
B003ITZBW2|5.0|One thing that can be said about Batman is that his character as a whole has created a monster fan base. Part of that fan base that grew up with the Dark Knight has actually had the privilege to create some of his most memorable adventures. Bruce Timms' newest animated movie `Batman: Under The Red Hood' is one of the more recent Batman classics brought to us. What makes this story so special is that it was derived from one of the darkest stories in Batman's legacy, and that story revolved around the death of the second Robin. Historically the death of Jason Todd is known as `Batman's greatest failure'. What Under The Red Hood does is takes `A Death In The Family' and adds a whole new chapter. Deriving from the major elements it turns `Death' into a much larger story with an incredible epilogue. As much as I would have loved to s `A Death In The Family' brought to life, `Under The Red Hood' may in fact be the best Batman story the DCAU has offered us.<br /><br />The story that this film gives us takes place five years after the death of Jason Todd. Suddenly the crime lords of Gotham City have a new threat and he is this merciless vigilante known as Red Hood. His mission is to keep the mob in line and make sure that while their actions continue to flourish, they have to work under his rules. Because, if they step out of line, they die. Of course Batman leaps into action to try and take him down, but once he gets too close to this new threat his world will be shattered when he discovers who Red Hood truly is.<br /><br />This movie was such an incredible piece. It is definitely the darkest film up until this point, but it is such a well executed story. There are however a few negatives, but I will go with the positives first. What I loved about this film was the homage to the ending of `A Death In The Family'. While it is not as graphic as depicted on the pages of the comic, keep in mind that this film is rated PG-13. Still, they kept the actions taken and the dialogue intact and it is such a gripping scene to watch. That feeling that you get in that moment carries on all the way to the end of the film. The final showdown with Batman & Red Hood is incredible. I have never seen such passion and emotion thrown into one of these films up until now and I have to say that I had to re-watch that whole final scene, just because it was so well done. On that note the voice acting was perfect. Bruce Greenwood did a spot on job as Batman. I have to admit, there were points in the film where I couldn't even tell it was him because he sounded so similar to Kevin Conroy. What made Greenwood a better choice for this film was the passion in his voice especially when he raised his voice. Jensen Ackles was great as Red Hood. He started out just as a regular voice actor, but the scenes he has with Batman are so great. The final showdown he puts almost an Oscar worthy performance, I have to say I was enthralled. John DiMaggio took on the Joker. Now, I have to say that many people always hate when Mark Hammil isn't there, but let's face it with a movie as heavy as this one Mark Hammil's voice would just come of extremely cartoonish. Don't get me wrong in Phantasm and Return of the Joker he does a great job, but take a look at those movies in general and compare them to the setting of Red Hood. I promise you, you will understand why they used another actor. Still DiMaggio as a plus turns on that Mark Hammil Joker charm in this film, but the voice he brings is a darker, creepier Joker and it's a win for this film. The best voice would have to be Wade Williams as Black Mask. He brings sheer over the top villainy to Black Mask. It is one of those voices that just makes the character so evil you grin with delight at his madness. Black Mask was this guy that would get so high strung in two seconds he would punch through a brick wall.<br /><br />So, what are the faults of `Under The Red Hood?' It was too short. A movie of such grandeur should be more than 79minutes. I don't know why Bruce Timm thinks that we have such short attention spans. There were so many great things thrown into this package that I felt there wasn't enough. An example would Neil Patrick Harris as Nightwing. I could watch NPH perform in front of a brick wall for 3 hours and be entertained. He breathed great life into his character, but it would have been great just to see more action with him in it. The flashbacks of Jason Todd were great as well. I thought maybe it would have been a plus to throw some flashbacks of Dick Grayson as Robin maybe to see him depart from Batman or encounter him for the first time as Nightwing. Yet, I digress.<br /><br />`Under the Red Hood' is a great film, mostly because it revolves around the Robin character. Robin is a persona in DC comics that is always blasted by fans because of the camp of the silver age and the old Adam West show. Still, Robin is probably one of the most important characters because he brings a human side out in Batman. To see what Batman goes through when a hero that he trained becomes something he shouldn't be it just makes the Batman persona more of a legend, but more than that a hero with a heart.  Also if you are planning to get this film on DVD, purchase the two disc edition, which features another DC Showcase short. This one features Jonah Hex, and since his movie bombed this will be all the Jonah Hex you need.minutes. I don't know why Bruce Timm thinks that we have such short attention spans.

B000J5XS3C|5.0|I'm looking forward to my future recordings using the 802 - It is always fun to have a new toy! Highly recommended piece of equipment that is  nice value for the cost.I was looking for a low cost mixer to use with my other recorder and did a little research on the leading brands. Just looking at it with it's inputs, number of controls, I would have guessed it cost close to a couple hundred bucks. Imagine my surprise when, after reading the positive reviews, that I discovered this thing was only ! I bought it immediately and, right out of the box, it did exactly everything I was expecting it to - this is a truly nice little piece of equipment for getting the recording control and flexibility that is not inherent on some of the other models.

B001U0HBPG|4.0|For me, this was the type of movie that did keep your curiousity up and made a person want to watch more to see what happened next.  If you are a viewer that is looking for the natural order to things, then this movie is not for you.  But if you like something different and are interested in being open-minded and see what develops on something that is unnatural, then this movie will intrigue you
B003FBCSX8|5.0|I know this book is getting a lot of mixed reviews, and I can understand why. However, I loved it. It reminded me a great deal of Young's \\"The Shack,\\" though darker and perhaps a bit more honest. It is also thought provoking in ways similar to the writings of C.S. Lewis, i.e. not terribly complicated writing, but deep. What I really loved about this book was the originality of it -- first of all, having the entire story narrated by a character who has already died, and secondly, of her idea of Heaven. While it is controversial in nature and I'm not sure I entirely agree with it, it was quite captivating to read of a Heaven in which the afterlife is NOT perfect, and a soul in Heaven still continues to grow and change even after death. I think this will cause most people to examine their own ideas about the afterlife and what they think it may be like. This, to me, was most fascinating about the book.    The only things I didn't like about the book were the sometimes tedious descriptions (Ms. Sebold paints beautiful pictures, but sometimes she uses too much paint) and what I felt was an unjust resolution of the murderer and the rest of the world. In that regard I would have preferred a more satisfying ending, but other than that, I think it was well wrapped up.

B0017V7GLC|5.0|There's no question about it; \\"Velocifero\\" is noticably different from either 604 or Light & Magic. It continues the trend started with Witching Hour, a sort of emphasis on the \\"clash\\" part of the so-called electroclash sound. As such it is less self consciously synthesized and electronic than the first two. I'm not saying this is a bad thing (Velocifero is my #3 listened to album of all time on Last.fm) it's just settling in more to the Witching Hour introduced sound, where, perhaps Ladytron has found their niche in their growth cycle. In my mind Ladytron can do nothing wrong, but if you were expecting a return to sounds like \\"Another Breakfast With You\\" or \\"Startup Chime\\" after Witching Hour, you probably won't care for it much. The best advice I can give for those most persnickity of fans is to let yourself feel for the band and progress and mature with them.
0061689246|3.0|Perhaps I would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't seen the movie first... I couldn't help making comparisons as I was reading it. It was a good story, lots of imagination and originality. Also, the writing style was clear and entertaining to read. But, the love story was kind of lacking, with point A to B with no stops in between. The ending was also anticlimactic. It wasn't a bad book at all, but not my favorite fantasy novel either. I give it 3.5 stars.
