0553382179|5|Although her website ([...]) contains pretty much all the same information as this book, I found the book to be more intuitively laid out, and much simpler to navigate than the sometimes-cluttered website. <br />But no matter which you decide to use, the system works wonders.  I can't believe the difference that it's made to my home and my life.  I don't have to worry about company dropping in unexpectedly and I haven't run out of clean clothes in months. <br />Try it, it really works...
B000008PC2|5|This recording is consistently ranked among the best releases of all time.  After a rather lackluster solo debut, Lou Reed went in another direction here with the assistance of David Bowie.  Glam themes abound, with influences ranging from T.S. Eliot to Andy Warhol.  Several of the songs are actually reworkings of Velvet Underground tunes done to better effect.  The instrumental arrangements of the late, great Mick Ronson really enhance the effort.  Although not all of the material is stellar, some of his best compositions can be found here, including 'perfect day', 'satellite of love', 'vicious', and 'walk on the wild side'.  I should mention that I have the 24K gold collectors edition that has exceptional sound quality.  Highly recommended.
B00170DEM8|5|This is the best Bing Crosby movie ever! And a little known fact---this is actually the movie that the song White Christmas was written for.
B008Y2FRFO|1|There don't seem to be any guide's. It's probably the most boring game out there. What's the point of this game? I can't see any, except frustration over the waste of time.

B00006690G|5|This CD is great!My favorite song is \\"Cleanin' Out My Closet\\"!I also recommmend any other cd by Eminem:The Marshall Mathers LP,The Slim Shady LP,and Devil's Night(D-12).For all of you R&B people I recommend Aaliyah's latest CD,Aaliyah.
0142428280|5|Fantastic writing and, obviously, real attention to history..  This is the first of a trilogy by Ken Follett.  It takes place in the build-up to and fighting of WWI.  If you never knew much about WWI, this book, (or audio book, as I used to entertain myself in my drives to and from work) will be a painless way to inform yourself.  I can't recommend it highly enough.
055357342X|5|A Storm of Swords is part 3 in George R.R. Martin's series A Song of Ice and Fire. And while the first two books, A Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings were engaging enough to keep you reading to the end and then picking up the next book, they are just \\"good\\" books(as in  3 or 3 ½ stars) . A Storm of Swords, however, is where Martin comes into his own as a master of the epic saga (5 stars).<br /><br />The book continues in the same style as the first two, with each chapter being told by a different character. In the earlier books, this style slowed them down by making them somewhat confusing to follow at times. But in A Storm of Swords, it actually helps to propel the book forward and difficult to put down as the end of each chapter leaves you breathless with anticipation for that character's next chapter to come up. Then by the end of the following chapter, you are just as breathless over that character. This is one of those rare books that you could just sit and read in one sitting, if it weren't 1100 pages long (in paperback) and you didn't have any interruptions. This installment in the series is set apart because Martin has finally mastered the art of parallels - the plots and timelines of the various characters are woven together in a much tighter mesh, and the parallels between them are simply stunning. I love how Martin can take something as simple as a song (most memorably The Bear and the Maiden Fair) and by simply having it sung by various characters throughout the book remind you of earlier chapters. And while it is short on romance, this book contains elements of every genre imaginable - historical fiction, sci-fi/fantasy, humor, and even horror. I found myself crying, laughing, shrinking in horror at some of the more brutal scenes, and trembling with fear over the scary parts. Martin also does a magnificent job of turning the different story lines on their heads and keeping you guessing. The plots are anything but predictable as established, well-liked characters are killed off and more minor characters are brought to the forefront. There are even times when you find that you are suddenly sympathetic towards what originally seemed to be very unlikable characters.<br /><br />I simply cannot think of words to describe how exceptional this book is. As far as the series goes, you really wouldn't want to read it without having read the first two, but if you can make it through them (each book is massive with over 700 pages in the hardback editions) then you will fly through this one. I don't know if I can stand the wait until I can get the next book, A Feast for Crows.
B00FAPF5U0|3|This game is amazingly addictive.  As a cheapskate I refused to pay extra for bonuses, and that's why it's only getting 3 stars.  This company and its ilk are essentially preying on folks with addiction problems.  They analyze their data very carefully and maximize the profits from the game by getting you hooked and then little by little sucking your virtual wallet dry.  Once you get to a certain level it's almost impossible to advance without paying extra.  I could also see this being a big problem for kids, I'm sure there are a lot of parents out there getting big surprises in their cellphone bills!
B00BEPVAV8|4|Good game play. It's fun leveling up the different cars .It's simple yet enjoyable. I think it would bring cool if you could choose different areas to race though
B000FCKGPC|4|Enjoyed the further exploration of characters such as Arya and her sister, Brienne, the Lannisters and Sam. Looking forward to the next book in the series and the return of Tyrion!
B00BLGXL3U|5|A masterpiece of cinema, yet controversial because of parallels between the plot and the early days of L. Ron Hubbard.  Philip Seymour Hoffman and Joaquin Phoenix both provide the performances of their careers and their contributions would have been pointless without co-star Amy Adams who is at the top of her game.  Phoenix's performance is all consuming and he plays one of the most menacing protagonists ever captured on celluloid.  Hoffman's character is mischeviously self-important, yet honorable and lovable.  Adams' character is surreptitiously manipulative and controlling. Cinematography is breathtaking.  We haven't seen images this striking in 70mm since Coppola got lost in the jungle and needed twenty five years to edit his way back to civilization.  It's all really very simple - either you make a film worth watching for a billion years, or you don't make anything at all. There is, however, just one small ambiguity.  With Hoffman's, Phoenix's and Adams' characters all writhing around for power, influence, and control by using their respective gifts of persuasion, bathtub chemistry, and covert manipulation, just who, exactly, is The Master?
B0064MPXFA|5|Great
B004OC07F8|1|The book is hard to maintain their is no page numbers no a table of contents for guidance.
B00063F8B2|5|Great music! If you loved the movie you will love the soundtrack!
B008IJTFYW|5|Found the sounds authentic and clear. Great for drifting off in a peaceful sleep!  Love that the sounds could be &quot;layered&quot; for different effects.
B008BQ8YHQ|5|If you like 'Lie To Me' or 'Scandal', you'll love this intelligent comedy. The quick-witted banter between the leads never gets old.
B000066NW0|5|I love the cd since the moment I first heard it. After listen Complicated like a million times. I was just so blown away that I decided to purchase it. And it was totally worth it. As a 17 year old girl I can relate to each of the song of this album. If you've been into brokeups, rejection, moving out, being in love, and all that stuff, you gotta love it. My favorite ones are those who have a lotta guitar and drums like Losing Grip, sk8er boi and Unwanted. Rock on!!!!
B009NFHF0Q|4|A strange kind of magical. A kind of Alice in Wonderland feel. The imagination of a child in an adult world.
B00000DHR0|5|This is one of the best CD's I've ever bought!  My favorite song is The Prayer with Andrea Bocelli. The song makes me cry. It's truly an inspirational CD.
B0061S0A64|5|i have to say is a very well app. it does a remarkable job visualizing the spectrum of music. it does lack instruction but is very intuitive.
B00ST5TBM6|5|This film seems more germane today than it did when it was released in 1972. When scientists provide an impressive argument that the Earth stands on the brink of its sixth mass extinction, such as put forth by Gerardo Caballos of the National Autonomous University of Mexico in a paper published June 19, 2015, the notion that it is driven by just one single species, Homo sapiens, and not by volcanism, or a major asteroid collision makes this work super prescient. The startling thing about Caballos paper is that it doesn't even factor in the global effects of climate change. This is a cautionary tale...averting a mass extinction is still possible - but we don't have much time. Sound is DTS or Dolby mono on the Blu-ray disc, but Peter Schickele's score (yes, he's P.D.Q. Bach) doesn't suffer. Douglas Trumbel's models are impeccable & impressive, decades before CGI made it easy. I'd watched Bruce Dern in &#34;Nebraska&#34; recently, and it's a delight to see him young again in &#34;Silent Running&#34;. Buy this film, then go green. It's the latest addition to my dystopia collection and a welcome one. The Blu ray comes with loads of features on the making of the film plus an optional voice over narrative you can choose to hear while watching the film. Purists will find the notion of gravity on the array of geodesic domes which stick out in all directions possibly irritating. But I surmise those with imagination will have no trouble at all. Maybe in the future the &#34;weak force&#34; can be somehow simulated.
B0063IH60K|4|Just like you'd expect it to. Good game, good interface. Gives you the option to choose a random deal or winning deal for those times when you just need to win.
B007IXWL2C|5|This series is what everyone raves about, just great ! If you don't like kink don't read these books ! Great story but all the sex is full of kink. So enjoy the read and the audio !
B00I8Q77Y0|5|Flappy Wings is basically the same thing as Flappy Bird. There are only a couple things different. Once you get around 20-30 on Flappy Wings there is a rainbow in the background, which does not happen on Flappy Bird. Also, the bird poops different colors and patterns. Also every tenth pole the pole changes to a different color. I like how it's different from Flappy Bird with these extra features.
6302924839|5|The best acting that Mr. Heston has ever accomplished.  The character of El Cid came alive on the screen with such excitement and realism.  He put his heart in this character, and the result was magic.  A time, a place and a great hero was honored by the choice of Mr. Heston to play this role.  The role was made for him and echoes his own personality amd strength.
B00BWBHIUG|1|I liked this game and successfully avoided actually having to watch the video ads.  I am no longer happy with this game.  I have tried growing a rare plant 5 times and each time it has disappeared before it is fully grown.  Very upsetting and discouraging.  I am not going to continue playing as all of the challenges have become impossible without spending actual money.  Waste of time.
B000I8G5C6|5|Cute show!
B00DJFIMW6|5|Omg fun.  very addictive but fun to play.  only thing is wish there were no purchases.  you have to play.
B0099TJ4YQ|5|James Taylor is at his best, along with his wonderful guests.  All the selections are great and truly put you in the spirit of the season.
B0054JZC6E|5|awesome. makes it so easy to pass the time. the games are fun yet challenging and anyone can play. I definitely recommend
B00AB55BS0|5|This is the show that ruined all other shows for me. Literally. It's so good I'm losing interest in most everything else. The Blu Ray extras are great too. I would give it more stars if I could.
B00DQR26EC|5|it has a great play style and quirky items. the fact the flying spaghetti monster is included just makes it that little bit crazed. the humorous can get a little much sometimes so not recommended for children
B008OOYALE|2|i downloaded the app thinking it would be fun. then i kept playing and today it said i need inernet connection and i had wifi connected.
B005UKJX4E|5|Intertwined in this film is a series of scenes of how the Earth began, how life began on this planet.  I can't help but wonder how someone in the 1950's would have reacted seeing the creation of life on the screen, the active movements of the universe.  The producer seems to believe in God and believes that it began with purpose by a creator. The characters in the movie are godly and attend church.  The family in the film is dealing with the loss of a son.  And, what most people wonder is, why did God punish me or punish a good family?  I think what I got most out of this film, is that God does not punish, we are free to choose a wise path or the wrong path.  And sometimes we choose the right path, that we think is our destiny, but things don't work out as we'd hoped.  Such as the father not accomplishing his goals). And so it seems it is the same parallel when we lose someone too.  We deal with the pain of loss/death and learn to appreciate and love who and what we have.  We come to a realization that life is limited and love is what makes life worth living.  I don't know about you, but didn't all those scenes of the universe, ocean, creatures just make you appreciate the value of life?  I think that is ultimately what the producer was going for.
B007TXN4TK|4|using this product made me feel like I was really learning how to play the piano. I would recommend this to my 9yr.old son.
B000002C2E|5|absolute master.
B00DJFIMW6|5|This is a lot of fun and very funny.And they added a course from<br />Disposable me 2 it is cool.
B0071XO8RA|5|I couldn't put this down. From the very first pages I was hooked with the characters. I can't wait to read what happens next.
B006RXSBS2|4|Really not for kids under 18 in my opinion.  Some extremely disturbing scenes that are over the top in bloodiness...horrific violence at times.  Good acting for the most part, superb staging and scenery, but again, this is a very gruesome, dark film.
0805095152|5|This is an excellent book, one that should be read by everyone who, planning it or not, will die someday, very possibly via an illness that could be long and painful.  HOWEVER, I have one complaint: I first read the book having gotten it from my local library, and found it so honest and thought provoking that I wanted a copy of my own, so ordered it via Amazon.com, but was very, very DISAPPOINTED in the quality of the binding, so had to return it.  Pity.
B00008WT5J|5|Great price. Thank you for such a deal. My favorite album and needed a replacement. SOmetimes you have to replace something hard to find.
B009C7ZQM4|4|Works great on my Droid phone. Cleans up the trash and boost when running slow. 5 star for my phone. So I down loaded to my kindle fire hd. Let's me clean up phone sometimes. Sometimes it shows Adobe Air app as a threat and wants an upgrade. It won't let me upgrade. I can't find the app on my kindle to uninstall. I'm not a computer wizard so I'm slightly concerned about threat warning and irritated about Adobe Air App.
B0091XRTTM|5|good movie.  4yr old son just watched it and loved it.  Held his attention for the whole movie.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5|I love this game it is so freakin awesome.
B00EOARZ4G|5|Tom Clancy, as usual, has hit the mark with another GREAT Jack Ryan novel!  The book catches you from the first paragraph and doesn't disappoint as he moves the plot to it's conclusion.
B00SWWPVSY|5|Pretty cool little game. There is 100 levels and normally would take someone a few days to complate. It had me so intrigued that I played all 100 levels the first day I downloaded it. You should try it.
B005LAIIHG|5|What a great story. It was so exciting that we never got a chance to sit back.  More is not better.
B00DR0PDNE|3|Works just as advertised.  Streaming of Netflix and YouTube works well.  Streaming from the Chrome browser is fine but it requires a fairly fast laptop to encode/stream local video files.<br /><br />I bought this to use while traveling for work.  I would give it more stars if I was able to stream from more sources (which I'm sure is coming).  Pretty much have to bring a small travel router with me for use in hotels.  I can use my LTE hot spot but video eats my data plan too fast for extended use.<br /><br />Looking forward to the future of this product.
B0063GORYU|4|This game is challenging and addicting. The most fun you can have, playing a game by yourself. Adding different suits makes the challenge. Have fun.
B00JH3S0AI|1|Crappy doldrums
B004A8ZWVU|5|The Help is a movie that totally surprised me.  My wife wanted to see it but it did not sound like something I would enjoy.  Boy was I wrong.  We both enjoyed it far more than I thought we would.  Maybe it has something to do with the time period of the movie.  I was there and saw the things the movie was about.  It has significant historical value.

B006KAWI2C|5|This year marks 125 years since Rubinstein was born (on 28 January 1887). A great time to consider his legacy in this marvellous set.<br /><br />The title words to this review are those Harvey Sachs uses in the liner notes to the original Rubinstein Collection to describe how those of us who were lucky enough to hear Rubinstein play live felt after one of his performances. As Sachs says, those words also describe how one feels after hearing Rubinstein's recording of Chopin's B Minor Sonata.<br /><br />This set is full of such wonderful performances. The recording of the Busoni arrangement of Bach's Chaconne is titanic and must rank among the greatest piano recordings. It exemplifies what Eunice Podis (quoted by Sachs in his excellent biography of Rubinstein) says of Rubinstein's ability to shape very long legato lines, especially in Chopin. Barenboim, also quoted by Sachs refers to something unerring about Rubinstein's healthy musical intellect and Jeremy Siepmann in sleeve notes to the BBC Legends series speaks of his powerful, all embracing sense of rythm, stating that his playing was straightforward, natural simple and healthy. Siepmann also refers to Rubinstein's ability to hear and balance voices in single chords.<br /><br />Then there is Rubinstein's natural and delicate use of rubato and his gloriously beautiful tone. I would add to the learned opinions above that Rubinstein's sheer love of the music he plays shines through time after time.<br /><br />You will hear and be touched by these qualities countless times throughout this set. Listen to the delicate weaving of Chopin's Nocturnes, especially Op. 55, no.2 in the 1967 recording and the powerful sense of structure in his Ballades and the 1959 Scherzos. The recording of the F minor Ballade is another towering performance.<br /><br />The 1932 recording of Tchaikovsky's First Piano Concerto under Barbirolli is out of this world and the Andantino unbearably beautiful. This recording also demonstrates the amazing clarity of even the earliest recordings in this set thanks to the legendary Fred Gaisberg who produced the original recordings and to the painstaking transfers by Ward Marston.<br /><br />Going to the very end of the set, despite some imperfections, Rubinstein's Decca recording of the Brahms D Minor Concerto with the Israel Philharmonic under Mehta is of such intensity and so full of love for the music that for me it is an essential reading of this great work. Rubinstein was 89 with only one more recording session to go and weeks away from his final ever recital at London's Wigmore Hall on 31 May 1976.<br /><br />Unusually for such a prominent musician, Rubinstein recorded a lot a chamber music and there are many beautiful chamber recordings here. No less of an opposite in many ways to Rubinstein than Glenn Gould was quoted in Look magazine in 1971 as saying in an interview with Rubinstein that the Rubinstein/Guarneri Quartet recording of the Brahms Quintet was the greatest chamber music performance with piano he had heard in his life and that the recording had changed his view of what Brahms represented.<br /><br />One of the pleasures of the set is a wonderful photograph of Rubinstein and Gould in the beatifully illustrated and well set out book which accompanies the set.<br /><br />In addition there are lovely reproductions of the original LP sleeves and the CD's (with the original LP length programmes) are illustrated with the original labels and made to look like mini records. The earliest recordings are in covers cleverly representing 78's in plain sleeves showing only the record label. It is all a pleasure to look at and I find the original LP sleeve notes legible despite their reduced size.<br /><br />I am still discovering new beauties in the original Rubinstein Collection after ten years and have returned to favourite recordings dozens of times.<br /><br />Buy this incredible bargain set: 142 CD's (the equivalent of 95 full length CD's) and 2 DVD's forthe price of about 20 CD's. It will reward you with a lifetime of pleasure.
B005S9EKCW|5|I've seen Les Mis on stage many times with many different production companies.  However, nothing compares the live action recording for this movie.  Seeing up close the actors' emotions, personal interpretation of the songs and incredible visual effects makes this my favorite musical dvd ever.
B007ZGO7EM|4|Simply excellent. Excellently simple. The app is easy to read and clear. I like that it shows what was keyed in an area below the solution which is very useful for those who are used to adding machine tape.

B000002UB3|5|This is propably the best Beatles album (and that is tall order to fullfill).  This is truely a fitting end to the best rock group ever to grace the earth. The Beatles are the best there is, the best there was and  the best there ever will be.

B0076D20E8|5|Really like this movie.
B000FCKRDI|5|I have never been a fan of historical romances, but this one, I just adored it. There was no love at first sight BS. The characters, the plot, everything about this book impressed me.  The sex was also quite steamy which was a nice surprise. This was my first time to read any of this writers work and I'm so glad to have come across it.  I can't wait to check out more.
1442416890|5|He best is this. No words can explain the emotional roller coaster I have gone through with this series. I laughed. I cried. I was at my wits end. Best series I have ever read and I  sad to see my shadow hunter friends journey end. Can't wait for the spin off!!

B0002EXH40|4|Youthanasia is a guilty pleasure of mine.  It is one of Megadeth's most commercial-sounding albums - and is one of my favorites.  With this sixth album, it is obvious that Dave Mustaine wanted to \\"open up\\" Megadeth to new audiences (or markets), and usually I have a problem with that.  Not on this occasion.<br /><br />Youthanasia has some strong pop elements weaving in and out of this album.  We see strong evidence of this in the very catchy choruses of \\"Stream of Consequences\\", \\"Addicted to Chaos\\", \\"Elysian Fields\\", and \\"Victory\\".  I sometimes find myself actually playing these songs while washing my car (you can't really do that with the likes of Exodus or Testament).  Also, Mustaine and crew stray away from the hard, thrash-roots sound of \\"Killing is my Business...\\" or \\"Peace Sells...\\" and opt for a more radio friendly brand of heavy metal.  There are some elements of blues-influenced forms and riffs throughout (even a few harmonica appearances!).  A word of warning - there are no really fast-tempo numbers on this album.  Gone are the days of Peace Sells-esque thrasher cuts like \\"Devil's Island\\" or \\"Black Friday\\".<br /><br />The lyrical content is also more mature and serious.  No more anthems to insanity, nuclear war, axe murderers, or satanism.  These songs address more, shall we say, relevant issues like dealing with mortality, fighting drug addiction, learning from mistakes, and child abuse.<br /><br />If you're worried about musicianship, don't be.  Mustaine and Marty Friedman still take turns shredding on every song.  David Ellefson still faithfully thumps away terrific lines on bass, and drummer Nick Menza pounds out some dizzying rhythms.<br /><br />My choice cuts are \\"Train of Consequences\\", \\"Addicted to Chaos\\", \\"Elysian Fields\\", and \\"Family Tree\\".  Overall, Youthanasia is a gem.  Yes, it is different and it does stray from the formula, but it is nicely done.  If anything, this offering proves Megadeth's versatility and willingness to open up and explore.<br /><br />PS.  If you didn't like this album, then DO NOT get \\"Risk\\".<br /><br />PPS.  Megadeth's latest album, \\"The System Has Failed\\", is excellent.idn't like this album, then DO NOT get \\"Risk\\".    PPS.  Megadeth's latest album, \\"The System Has Failed\\", is excellent.
B005KLT6KO|5|The book surprises, especially the finish. I really enjoyed the pictures and the dedications. Recommend. Who is smartfolder fan, can not stop buying this book. Taking it are wonderful.
B00006RAKP|4|Elton John is a talented musician. A couple of songs like Island Girl, The Bitch Is Back, Saturday Night's Alright (For Fighting), and Philadelphia Freedom, to name a few are not great. But over all, it's a good compilation. I recommend this album to all.
B00AK0X5VQ|4|This is a great game for those who want a fun and challenging game but who aren't big gamers. it's peaceful and oddly hypnotic and yet requires some active thought to get through the levels
B00EQRMLNM|5|Love this song! Sweet but overall good melody too. Many different people can enjoy it even.with varying tastes in music
B00HBQWGXK|4|Kept my interest without being predictable.
B00AREIAI8|5|this is awesome very creative and fun!when I cant go outside and ride my horse b/c its to cold for my horse I can play &quot;my horse&quot; and still feel go to go something horsey and it gives me something to enjoy other then riding
B00MNYTWMI|4|Concept fantastic, moves slow, but good filler while I'm playing other games
B00005BKZJ|5|This is an awesome movie. It has a lot to say about people and change. In a very good way.
030746363X|4|I enjoyed this book a lot overall, after one year having it.<br /><br />I'll say achieving what the book claims is not exactly easy, but achieving at least some good percentage of the results it claims IS EASY, and results follow after not so much time of implementing the techniques in the book.<br /><br />For instance, after about 2 months of doing the exercise that Ferriss suggests for biceps, this funny anecdote happened to me:<br /><br />A collegue on mine mentioned that my arms and shoulders look bigger, and told me not to do too much exercise, because at this pace I wouldn't find clothes that fit me. I said \\"well... 35 minutes a week is not that much, is it?\\" \\"What? 35 minutes a day?\\", \\"No, 35 minutes a week\\", at this point he begins to freak out, \\"35 minutes a week? That's nothing! No way! What do you do for the arms, for example?\\" \\"10 kg\\" \\"And how many times?\\" \\"16 times each arm\\" \\"3 series of 16?\\" \\"No, one series of 16\\" \\"What?? No way, that's impossible. I must be imagining things!\\" He went away, thinking that his appreciation had been mistaken.<br /><br />The 35 minutes a week refers to the total time exercising including 3 minutes break between exercises, and I am not following the program exactly (I eat less than what Ferriss suggests), what I am doing for arms is gotta be about a total exercising time of 7 minutes per week. Too bad I didn't say that to my colleague :)<br /><br />This book, not being super-revolutionary, I think that is great at encouraging you to try new things.<br /><br />The book also motivated me to learn free-style swimming, a very nice experience!<br /><br />No matter what you think from the style of Tim Ferriss, I believe you can benefit from at least some of the stuff on this book for sure, and if not 100% results, you can achieve 60 or 80% with little effort.<br /><br />Luis

015626224X|4|The specifics and cultural differences concerning poverty between Paris and London are fascinating in their own right -- even to the extent that such differences affect the pace and style of Orwell's writing. The time in Paris is compressed, dense and descriptive, charged with interaction, chasing down chances at money or employment, complete with full-on brushes with the category of people known as \\"the employed\\". London is more mannered and given to lists as the dispossessed endure institutionalized segregation from society, making forced marches from one \\"spike\\" to another as the loitering laws so clearly demanded.<br /><br />Yet even though Orwell's prose is concerned with the specifics of poverty during the 1930s, 75 years later much of what he identifies as the stigma surrounding those that suffer in poverty persists and even grows. Because here, a few moments into 2008 we learn that those living in poverty in the United States increased by nearly 5 million people since the beginning of the \\"new\\" millennium, with doubtless more joining the ranks as punitive credit rates and the sub-prime mortgage scheme raid neighborhoods and livelihoods. Let's keep this book and Orwell in mind and remain aware of what has sadly proven to be an all too reliable marker against which human progress must still be measured.
B00IQDFBN4|1|Another terrible app for as trying to mingle with people. Never had no luck connecting with anyone on it. Had to delete it.
B007ZGO7EM|5|No complaints.  Better than my regular calculator.  Ads are innocuous and don't distract at all.  Truly is an essential kindle app
B001AVCFK6|5|I saw this twice when it came out.  Chris Pine was a witty, somewhat tortured, good-looking Captain Kirk.  Quinto was very well suited as Spock.  And, finally, Karl Urban did DeForest Kelley proud!  This was an amazing movie and so fun.  The best part was that you didn't have to know the original story line or be a fan.
B00F91SCXC|2|This movie was absolutely stupid.  The plot was thin.  The acting was weak.  Special effects were ok.  The only thing that was remotely interesting was that the zombies moved quickly.
B007U1FEJE|5|Whomever dislikes this album is obviously not a true Beach Boys fan. I received the album last night and have since played the entire album three times. Yes, some of the songs on the album are &#34;strange,&#34; but we all know that's just Brian's creativeness. Brian and the Boys have blown me away yet again...The harmonies and chord progressions that these guys come up with are outstanding and give me chills. It was great to hear all of their voices click again (Minus Denny and Carl obviously), and I'm looking forward to listening to it again when I get home!!!!<br /><br />As far as the packaging goes - it was horrible and I have noted that with the packaging feedback department. Both of the CD cases were crushed because they were only packaged in a bubble wrap envelope. I'll just have to find new cases for them since the return policy from this seller isn't that great. Oh well. At least the album is good!!!!

0743277457|5|i bought this book in may of 2007, and intended to write a review. I've been bashing my head trying to figure out how i can explain how much of an impact this book has been in my life. What i can say is that this book was written for all the right reasons.The author is not out to make a quick buck, this book is a revelation from a student of learning who has put these tools to work in high pressure moments from the last round of a chess tournament and the training before,to dealing with dirty refs in martial arts        It does not tell you what the path is but gives you the tools to make your own way. This wonderful book is not a mold for you to put your self in, but a guide, a priceless tool that aids you in your walk toward wherever your heart leads. i have been a victim of the New York City school system. i was told that i have a problem learning because i did not do well on the city wide tests, and the label has stayed       with me until my last days in high school when i dropped out. we don't have to label others anymore this book can help them find their own way to learn and fuel the pursuit of happiness. i have faith that this book has already changed so many lives  because i am one of them and you can be too
B0013FSL0C|2|I like the actors and the acting.  But the writing has a reality problem, or else I am not interested.  For a &#34;good psychiatrist&#34; to act out toward his wife is not unthinkable or totally psychotic, but to thoroughly mis-report the event to his own psychiatrist is just a step too far.  So I did not get beyond Week 2.
B0091VTNZC|4|Good movie

B000ICXQUQ|1|Surely, surely THE most fatuous and idiotic premise for any movie....EVER?<br />This one makes “Xanadu” look positively credible by comparison!<br /><br />Some dumb obviously mentally unstable farmer hears a disembodied voice exhorting him &#34;if you build it they will come&#34;, ..and no, it's NOT god talking to Noah and referring to the impending arrival of pairs of highly co-operative animals, but it refers to long dead old baseball players who will emerge from a cornfield to once again play on a ballpark Costner is to construct!<br /><br />(For those unfamiliar with the storyline of this movie, please stop laughing now, ...I assure you I'm NOT making this up!)<br />Costner has “father issues”, ..they drifted apart before Daddy died and he’s now regretting it ....along with suffering severe schizophrenia it seems.<br /><br />But no, you as the audience are supposed to swallow all this completely, and marvel as the delusional hayseed gets the message and actually builds the ballpark.<br /><br />Now cue the “Twilight Zone” theme right here.<br />Famous dead players DO start to emerge from the corn, (HA!), and proceed to play, but strange as it might seem to the rational observer, Farmer-Costner nor the population is hardly even unnerved by the apparent mass resurrection from the graves of the recognisable long deceased sporting heroes.<br />All incorrupt, bodily intact and exceptional sporting abilities undiminished by death? Even their uniforms show no signs of decay from being buried.<br /><br />You too will begin to wonder if this is this really some sort of religious mass-resurrection “Rapture” parable, ...or are we just &#34;not-in-Kansas-anymore Toto&#34;?<br /><br />The immortal line, (delivered straight faced BTW) &#34;Where'd all these baseball players come from?&#34; will reduce you to helpless laughter.<br />(Almost as good as Burton’s “Were you out there” in “The Robe”!)<br /><br />Costner, who suffers the regrettable long term effects of a charisma by-pass apparently undergone sometime in very early childhood, struggles to &#34;act&#34; at the best of times, but it is beyond even my comprehension as to just what substances were ingested to induce his performance in this bizarre plotline.<br />Or his seeming dementia for this monumentally self-reverential, sentimentally ponderous turkey.<br /><br />Any acting abilities of Mr Costner himself are hard enough to discern, but the demand for complete suspension of any and ALL credibility by the audience is just WAY above and beyond all expectations.<br />Yeah yeah, you didn’t bond with yer Dear Departed ol’ Pappy, but don’t worry a little post-mortem chucking of a baseball to each other will soothe those feelings of self-recrimination.<br />Baseball as the universal panacea?<br /><br />I think there was intended to be some deep metaphorical/allegorical mystical new-age sentimental twaddle here, along with some warm fuzzy father-son inter-generational bonding which was supposed to make us all tear-up. That, together with a lot of angst ridden self-recrimination for past deeds, but it all just bogs down in the complete inanity of the whole thing.<br />Think cheap Norman Rockwell, but with more emphasis on hokie sentiment and Pseudo-Pysch. 101.<br /><br />It's hard not to feel sorry for the long-suffering wife, trying to deal with the schizophrenic delusions of an obviously mentally deranged husband blowing all their savings on a baseball park and then awaiting the multiple second comings.<br />The sight of the long line of cars coming to the diamond at the end will tip you right into hysteria!<br />Rather like those full up parking lots outside those multi-million televangelist Taj Mahals today?<br /><br />Now if perchance you happen to be American and view baseball as a kind of national sacrament, and you too once felt estranged from yer Dear ol’ Pappy, then maybe, just maybe you'll think this tripe somehow terribly deep and meaningful.<br />However if like me you view the Costner character's personal delusions as clear evidence of the need for a long spell in some suitable psychiatric facility with a daily regimen of lithium, then you'll be itching to get up and re-arrange that sock drawer that you've been putting off.<br />Your time would be far better spent........ul.<br />However if like me you view the Costner character's personal delusions as clear evidence of the need for a long spell in some suitable psychiatric facility with a daily regimen of lithium, then you'll be itching to get up and re-arrange that sock drawer that you've been putting off.<br />Your time would be far better spent........

B00G5G7EXY|5|Love it.
B00SKFJGMA|3|Been a long time fan of Bjork's, words cannot describe how excited I was when this album was announced. Upon numerous listening's, I have found the album to be quite bland. While there are a few songs that really shine namely, &#34;Stonemilker&#34;, Lionsong&#34;, &#34;HoT&#34;, and &#34;Family&#34;. All the others seem quite dull. Even her grand opus, &#34;Black Lake&#34; falls short. Hopefully we won't have to wait long for something new.
B0007NFL1S|5|Yo, 50 done really did it with this CD. This CD is crazy. The best song in the album is \\"Piggy Bank\\". My friend just gave me this CD today and I was so anxious to listen to it, I couldn't wait til' school was over. Every single song is crazy. If I could I would give this CD 10 stars.
B00BQPEIT2|4|Lots of fun, but can be challenging and activating at times. Was used to playing Temple run 2 so some of the graphic quality isn't as smooth in comparison. Overall fun and passes the time.
B00479SVBU|1|I do NOT recommend this product in any way, shape, or form.  I tried it in a Corvette, Mazda Miata, Honda Pilot, and always had the same result.  Static in the music, distorted sounds, and abysmal sound quality.  I tried a friend's FM modulator to see if they were all this way, and his produced significantly better results.  And his only cost $14 at Walmart.  I won't buy one from Walmart, but I will keep looking.  This one is going back, thanks to Amazon's generous return policy.  I hate to stick Amazon with a return item of such poor quality, but maybe they will elect to quit selling junk like this if enough of them get sent back.<br /><br />Update:  7/31/12:  After my initial review, I was contacted by Satechi customer service.  They said I must have had a defective unit, and they very generously offered to send me another unit at no cost to evaluate.  This level of customer service is rare, and I appreciate the concern for customer satisfaction. I received a new Satechi Soundfly FM Modulator and have evaluated it in the same 3 cars as before.  While I had better results in one car, the sound quality in the other 2 was equivalent to AM static.  This company does stand behind their product and offers great customer service, but unfortunately, I can't endorse this product when 2 out of 3 cars the music is so full of static it is difficult to tell what song is playing.

B00H2EQFBK|5|I was skeptical at first prior to watching the series.  However, as i watched, i quickly became facilitated as the episodes passed.  I really like the series so far (even though i am disappointed with the &#34;Priests&#34; abandonment of Christianity).  We shall see where the series progresses too.<br /><br />I love gritty action, adventure, and historic settings.  I love series such as Game of Thrones, Spartacus, and Rome.  I really appreciate that the creators did not specifically show intense sex scenes.  Sometimes i feel my beloved series go to far to 'out-do' each other to show gritty and raunchy sex scenes for the sake of ratings.  I love the fact the creators show the intent and quick 'skin-showing' parts without the obscene and sometimes uncomfortable parts.  This allows me to watch and enjoy the series with my wife without feeling awkward whether she will feel uncomfortable watching intense action and gritty sex scenes.

159420411X|5|Just a short note to say how much I liked this book.  It's all good, but I particularly appreciated Chapter 8 on Bayesian statistics. I took a full year course in college on probability and statistics, and I learned a lot new about the subject from just this chapter.  Anyone who's serious about thinking about predictions (which is pretty much everyone) should read this book.
B000V86OKG|5|I don't get Showtime, so I couldn't wait to watch Season 2.  Once I started on the episodes, I couldn't stop.  Terrific episodes!  And, even though I knew Dexter would come out OK (since there is a Season 3), I was at the edge of my seat hoping he wouldn't get caught. I love this series!
B001AIRUOU|5|Only Tim Burton could produce a holiday musical about Halloween's grotesqueries taking over Christmas.<br /><br />And in fact he did. Burton wrote and produced a charming stop-motion musical called \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas,\\" which is as close as we'll ever get to a Burton Christmas film. And there's rarely a dull moment in this town called Halloween -- from start to finish, it's a quirky, macabre, vintage-flavoured ride through the darker side of everybody's favorite holidays.<br /><br />In Halloween Town, the undead Jack Skellington is king, and each Halloween the residents try to make their celebration even more horrible than the year before.<br /><br />But this year, something is missing for Jack, and he starts wondering if scaring people is all his life has. He ends up wandering into a sort of holiday junction, and finds a portal to Christmas Town -- it's full of snow, lights, presents and innocent fun. Jack is instantly enamoured of Christmas, and decides that for this year, the residents of Halloween Town are going to celebrate Christmas.<br /><br />He manages to convince the other Halloween residents -- except the sweet rag-doll Sally -- to go along with his plan. So Halloween Town is redecorated and filled with presents (in a suitably ghastly style) and \\"Sandy Claws\\" is abducted so Jack can take his place. But are the people of Halloween Town just not suited to innocent merriment, and can the Pumpkin King fill the capacious red suit when Christmas Eve rolls around?<br /><br />The idea of Halloween ghouls and spooks deciding to take over Christmas sounds terribly twee in concept, like a gimmicky children's book. Fortunately Tim Burton's darkly humorous sense of humor and delightfully gothic designs -- as well as Henry Selick's brilliant direction -- end up turning the movie into something that is more than just another kid's movie. Think a Burtonesque \\"Princess Bride.\\"<br /><br />Much of its charm comes from the richness of Burton's visuals -- his Halloween Town is saturated in spiky iron fences, ghost dogs, insects, mad scientists, and a spooky cloudy night that never ends. And though the inhabitants of Halloween Town are devoted to being grotesque and spooky, there's a lighthearted benevolence in their actions at all times. It almost makes Christmas Town look... dull.<br /><br />But it's also an incredibly funny, sweet little movie, with plenty of heart. There's an adorable little love story between Jack and Sally (\\"My dearest friend, if you don't mind...\\"), despite Jack's total cluelessness. And Burton weaves in lots of solid musical numbers (\\"There's children throwing snowballs/instead of throwing heads/they're busy building toys/and absolutely no one's dead!\\").<br /><br />But the crown jewel is Burton's macabre sense of humor. Hardly a scene goes by without a creepy gag (one child's present is a shrunken head) or clever dialogue (\\"Jack, please, I'm only an elected official here. I can't make decisions by myself!\\"). But the best humor comes from the Halloween-town's residents eagerly trying to be festive, and only making Christmas even creepier than Halloween ever could be.<br /><br />For a skeleton puppet, Jack Skellington is a pretty adorable hero -- he's earnest, generous, but suffers from a bit of ennui from the same old performance every year. His meditative songs about Halloween and his attempts at Christmas add an introspective note to him as well. And he's backed by a bunch of lovable characters, with Sally and the ghost dog Zero at the forefront.<br /><br />\\"Nightmare Before Christmas\\" is a macabre, wildly adorable little movie that reminds us why we love Halloween (besides the candy). Sometimes the dark and fun go hand in hand.ost dogs, insects, mad scientists, and a spooky cloudy night that never ends.

B00HXYKYIE|5|Jodi Picoult always delivers, but she does it with a few new twists in this book. I loved it. To me, it's her best to date.
B004Y042N8|3|I got this as the free app of the day from Amazon today.<br /><br />This should have been a 5 star app, but I will explain why I am giving this one only 3 stars below.  But first I wanted to mention that if you are a fan of the Grabarchuk puzzle book series available for the Amazon Kindles, you will most likely enjoy this app.  It is basically a group of puzzles where you simply connect the dots without tracing over the same lines twice.  It is a very simple game to learn even for a child.<br /><br />However, I am giving this one only 3 stars out of the 5 even though it should have been a 5 star app for the following reasons:<br /><br />1.  Levels have to be be done in a certain order.  You can't skip to do the first puzzle on one the higher levels.<br /><br />2.  Undo Last Move button is inconveniently accessed though the menu button at the bottom.<br /><br />3.  There is a lack of a high score chart or number of moves counter to keep track of how many times it took for you to complete a level.<br /><br />4.  The hand in the memory mode throws you off when you are playing that mode.  I found myself wanting to draw the line from the start of where the hand is when it is finished drawing!<br /><br />5.  There probably needs to be more levels for smarter players.<br /><br />If the app maker addresses all those issues above, they would have a 5 star app in my opinion.  But if you like puzzles, this is still probably worth the .99 cents when it isn't free.
B0000029LG|5|I have an unflappable distaste for most 'pop' music. My favorite stuff is classical from the romantic period (eg Tchaikovsky) and electronica (primarily ambient, eg Brian Eno). But for whatever reason I really like  Michael Jackson's music. I don't think it's quite as lyrically 'deep' as  some others, but it makes me happy and that in and of itself is enough I  believe. I encourage you to take a listen to any of his records, which  although consistently evolving, maintain the same quality. He's a genuinely  nice guy too, which is a plus in this world.

0440217563|4|I  have read all the other reviews of these books on Amazon and am amazed at how seriously some reveiwers have undertaken the task of deconstructing this book and comparing it to the others in the series.  These are NOVELS; fiction; a.k.a. a bit of fun.  Who cares if the storylines are far fetched?  It is fiction.  For me these novels are just pure escape to a different time and place.  (I like to read them in sequence over about a week)  Don't take them too seriously, and don't expect that the author does either.  Have you read the Author's note published in Cross Stitch? <br /> <br />I have loved all the books about Jamie and Claire.  I applaud Voyager for continuing the story of their love.  I thoroughly enjoyed the stories of their far fetched adventures.   I fervently hope that Gabaldon writes of them again to wrap up some of the story lines that have been left hanging.   <br /> <br />Having read the other reviews, I have two comments to add-  <br /> <br />As to the homosexuality themes, I too find them all too frequent and irrelevant to the storylines.  The point had been made extremely well with Randall. I fail to see the point of Grey.  His relationship with Jamie is confusing. <br /> <br />As to the convoluted story lines, Gabaldon's publisher seems to be letting her get away with longer and longer novels. I enjoyed the passage in Drums of Autumn where Jamie and Grey discuss the length of books; the author obviously poking fun at herself.  But, the length of Voyager contributes to the loss of some of the magic of the first books.  If the author was made to focus on reducing length, then some of the more convoluted storylines could, at least, be tightened up.   Voyager was unweildy and looked as though it had been edited in a hit and miss fashion.  As a result, I found that it was, at times, difficult to follow.

0385535139|5|See my review as a comment on Eric Wilson's \\"Novelist\\" most favourite review. My recommendation is: buy the book and have fun, lots of fun and don't let the way the defendant conducts his business discourage you. That's the way of the world, sadly.

B0000C6E4D|1|I considered myself a Sarah McLachlan fan from the days of &quot;Solace.&quot;  I loved both that album and &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy.&quot;  With the release of &quot;Surfacing,&quot; I was disheartened, and with &quot;Afterglow&quot; I just can't be a Sarah fan any longer.  I only found 2 songs to be good (&quot;Perfect Girl&quot; and &quot;Fallen&quot;), another 3 to be so-so, and the rest of the album to be tripe.    It's a sleepy version of &quot;Surfacing&quot; with nothing new to offer.  Even Sarah sounds bored singing her songs, and she looks sleepy in each of the three photos where she's shutting her eyes.<br />Could there be any less emotion as she sings &quot;'Cause I'm a train wreck waiting to happen&quot; in &quot;Train Wreck&quot;?<br />Then: &quot;you save me<BR>you complete me<BR>you're the one true thing i know i can believe in&quot; in &quot;Push:&quot;<br />Say it isn't so Sarah...this has got to be the absolute worst song you have ever written.  Trite!<br />I'm just so disappointed with this album.  The only thing I can think to use it for is to put me to sleep.

B00632HWOG|1|This is definitely a downgrade from the last version for the Kindle Fire.  It takes much longer to get messages than before.  I hope the next version is better than this one.
B000XUBFE2|5|I usually like to read the book before I watch the movie.  If the movie is half as good as the book I'll be satisfied.
B00BHMETKC|5|Its a Hollywood  account so you can't take it as historical fact. Never the less Argo has some surprisingly suspenseful moments and a story that makes me feel a lot better about 1980.
B008K6HN8I|5|Just as powerful as on Android!
B0027BOL4G|5|This movie is EXCELLENT if you care about what you eat.  EVERYONE should be aware of these ideas and we should ALL work to change this.  Otherwise we need to put a warning label on the doors of all grocery stores
B00EVPSJOE|5|It is hard to remember just how refreshing and what an impact this CD and special had back in the day. But it is a real classic and will always be worth having!! A slightly different side of Clapton, a more mellow, softened by tragedy.
B0089LOG02|4|Loving it.  Haven't finished it yet.  Will recommend to fellow readers.
B00AOCLWF6|5|Great show!!
1416583432|1|This book is wordy, tedious, unbearable. Very little info. Mostly going on and on and  on about random anecdotes written in the lengthiest most snooze inducing way possible.
1594202842|4|It's unfortunate that this was reviewed so unfairly in the media. After initially hearing about it, I had no intention of reading it, but a friend lent it to me and promised me it was good. She was right, this was a very good light read. Throughout the book, Chua explores how merits in Chinese parenting are viewed as shortcomings in Western parenting and vice versa. Some of these merits/shortcomings include no play dates or sleepovers, nothing lower than an A, and learning a musical instrument chosen by the mother and practicing that instrument several hours everyday with no days off for being sick or on vacation. This book would be perfect for a book club as I'm sure it will spark many a parenting debate. I do wish Chua would have written with more connection and organization though, it would have made it slightly easier to read.
B000OMD4BG|5|...friends and family of Elliott for putting out these b-sides and previously unreleased songs.  I already knew a few of the songs, (like the alternate versions of his Heatmiser songs, the other take of \\"Miss Misery\\" and \\"Thirteen\\") and the rest are already growing on me.  However, there are still plenty of songs left in Elliott's canon that have yet to see the light of day (on an official album), such as his collaboration with Jon Brion.  But this only leaves hope for future b-side compilations.  Even after the man dies, his music lives on.
B002UNMW7O|5|Not a bad follow up.
B000J5XS3C|1|Don't waste money buying cheap mixers. Save up and go all out because otherwise you'll make the mistake I made buying this. It doesn't carry all the frequencies of your audio. You have to put the jacks half way in a certain position rather than all the way in. Because of this fault with the product I couldn't use it live. The pre-amps are terrible quality and latency is way off. The aux return is good for effects but there is only one. In conclusion save your money and buy a mixer at about £200 and you won't have to deal with set backs like this.
B00L9B7IKE|5|Loved it
B00BD99JMW|5|Amazing book. Don't listen to all those people who say it's not good,take my advice and read it!!! Besides I'm a teen and would know what teens like. So READ THIS NOW!!!!!!!!
B00DJ735KI|5|Looking at beliefs on a biological level can change your life. Changing your beliefs is the secret to changing your life into the adventure that you want to experience. Bruce Lipton explains the cells in the body in a clear manner that anyone can understand. This is an enlightening read and will teach you about the physical manner in which our beliefs affect the reality that we experience. Highly recommend.
B00AZMFK3K|5|I like the story line and the characters of this &#34;new generation&#34; of &#34;original&#34; crew. It's my first blu-ray movie.
B00JOT3HQ2|5|👍
B00ARPMIJE|1|I admit that I uploaded the book because of the 1 star rating by Emily.  Seriously, how you could resist reading a book with a review like that? :)<br /><br />Anyway, I won't go so far as Emily in her review, but I can't understand all of the 5 star reviews and wondered, often, as I was skimming through A French Girl in New York, if we were reading the same book at all.<br /><br />The story was very Cinderella-ish, of course, that's no surprise.  But the characters were more like caricatures of people than real people.  A good editor might have made some suggestions to tone down the caricature-ization of the characters and that would have been a good suggestion for the author.<br /><br />As it is, I finished it.  Unlike reviewer Emily, I don't want to die now that I've read it, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone, and I certainly don't want to read any sequels to Maude's story.
B000I2J6K0|5|I am a runner and avid workout mama (20-30 miles per week). This video was TOO easy in the beginning stages of my pregnancy... HOWEVER about week 30 it started to become more challenging. Exactly what I needed to keep me moving in the last trimester. Plus I felt more comfortable knowing all the moves were safe for baby and I.
B000EMGAOY|2|Skips a bit. Kinda sux paying for a scratched up cd :(
B00007KWHG|5|Listening to it this morning and it is very good as advertised!
B002RI9ZPY|5|a great trilogy  thoroughly worth and made into a good movie  highly recommended<br />nothing much more can be said  go and get it
B005J4TLQG|5|Awesome movie!
B00J1IQUYM|3|It took a while to get into the story. My mind was set for post apocalypse but the story flicked to and fro. Tidy quick ending similar to pulling a rabbit from your hat. Okay read.
6305972591|4|Classic film by a classic writer. It started with Carrie then it went from there. I dont think there is one bad movie that King has ever did.    Made in 84' Its a story about a town that is overun by a group of cult children. They kill off there parents and act crazy all round. The kids meet up in the middle of a cornfield and they all bow down to this figure they call the blue man. Isaac is the leader of the cult group. If you join there group there is no leaving. If you try and leave they kill you.    This is a real scary tail. King will take you to hell and back with this movie. If you like Kings other work I think that you should give this movie a try. Pick it up at amazon.
B004EPZ03O|5|Sure, it is a distant fourth behind The Muppet Movie, The Muppets Take Manhattan, and The Great Muppet Caper, but it is WAY ahead of EVERY OTHER Muppet movie since!
0316055433|1|Were you one of the few who actually read all of Great Expectations in that ninth grade English class?  Then you know what Dickens is all about—and you’ll know right away that Donna Tartt is no Dickens, despite the chorus of frog-like critics croaking praises in the swamp of modern American fiction.  I loved Tartt’s Secret History.  But this novel is self-indulgent in the extreme, substituting endless, tedious, repetitious descriptions for character development, plot, and meaning.  Do we really care about descriptions of drug induced ecstasy—over and over?  Or about a total loser like Boris dragging our hero off the rails of sanity, honesty, and decency to no novelistic or moral end?  The trope of the Goldfinch and the meaning of life, beaten into us in the last few pages, is really, really jejune—all about Fate and how to deal with it in life.  Wow!  Deep!  This book desperately needed an editor who could stand up to a novelist out of control, to insist on control.  And to close the circle, please, please—no more comparisons to Dickens.  Ms. Tartt, you are no Charles Dickens.
B00631VJIC|5|Simply the best!!!!
B00KZ6WRAA|5|very useful - especially if you have your phone but are away from the computer
B005PK56TA|3|I really wanted to that piggy man chop him when he says come here piggy piggy pig... Would be fun right?
B002L6I9Z4|1|This camera arrived but never worked!!
B00881VLCE|5|Puzzles are a lot of fun.
B0036S4B6M|5|Often disturbing. Always interesting. Much more insightful than the Netflix series. Loved the characters and the rawness of their emotions. Would totally recommend.
B004O3YGMC|5|The app works great, and is far faster and consistent than vnc, or other desktop sharing apps. 2 thumbs up!
B00GRVEDCM|5|Very addicting game, the card at its some of the best, easy to learn and great set up for the action.
B00EPFEY44|5|beautiful dvd and awesome scenic views of the city
B001DLWF8U|4|Weight/Volume=Density.... I wonder how Julius Sumner Miller would have rated this film....
B00BJ9VBLI|5|I am really enjoying playing this game and would like to see it to the end. The color and graphics is really good!
B00IK590UI|3|poor remake of a good movie, alot more could have been done even with a good cast, unbelievable how better of a story line the first one was compared to this one
B00KIZ9FDU|4|This is a pretty good album. Not my favorite of his, but still worth adding to my collection. It contains an eclectic mix of songs.
B00HWWUR1Q|5|This is one of those films that needs 2 (maybe even 3 separate ratings). This movie is the second in the &#34;Hobbit Trilogy&#34; of movies and brings the viewers face-to-face with the grand menace of the book - Smaug. Much has been made of Jackson's decision to shoot using 48 fps and his excessive use of CGI. Quite frankly, having seen the film both in 3D HFR and standard 2D, I thought the difference was almost night and day, with the HFR version being far superior. Line details were crisper, shadows and light were more defined. Everything about the moving image quality was enhanced.<br /><br />As for use of CGI, there are a few moments where I thought the movie went overboard, especially in the fast-paced action sequences. However, I have to grant that the cost of trying to achieve the same scenes through modelling would likely be cost-prohibitive if they were even remotely possible. Thirteen dwarfs and a hobbit are an awful lot of digital re-sizing to accommodate. From the standpoint of someone going to the movie solely to enjoy a swords and sorcery high fantasy adventure, this film is fun and delivers on all fronts while including enough content for kids to keep their attention and enough content for adults to keep them from losing their minds.<br /><br />5 Stars: That was the purpose of the film - to create an exciting and fun fantasy epic for the big screen. So for that I give the movie its 5 stars.<br /><br />3 Stars: As an adaptation of Tolkien's works, the movie falls far short of its &#34;Part I&#34; predecessor. An entirely unnecessary romantic side-plot was included and then expanded upon in ways that are downright ludicrous in terms of middle-earth mythos. As an adaptation of the book, up to the point where the movie ends, I feel I'm being somewhat generous giving the movie 3 stars. It includes nearly all the material, but the additions, some made entire from whole cloth, not taken from other works, simply detract from the story entirely.<br /><br />5 stars: Love it or hate it, the movie has been presented in a visually stunning and audibly enjoyable way. Many of the techniques being used are paving the way for how future epic movies will be shot.
B00QW8TYWO|5|If you like minecraft and frogger get it awesome waiting room game I love it.Cool cool cool cool cool<br /><br />Cool 1 1 1 1. 1 1 1 1 1millions stars.
B0087JTAKW|5|I just thought it a very good read. I pretty much am prejudiced as far as anything Mitch Albom writes. He has this unique ability to write something and I know everyone else is reading it, but inside I also know it really was written just for me. I think if you ask ten people what the same book was about they would all give you a different answer. I wish I could explain it better. I hope you enjoy it as well. I'm certain for everyone this will be different. But I am guessing you will want to get rid of all your tme pieces, or start wearing two watchs so you are certain not to be cheated out of one second.
0385341008|4|The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society invite the reader on witty adventure that celebrates the written word as part of the plot. Less than a year following the end of World War II, popular English writer Juliet Ashton is at a crossroads over subject material and her life. Through the almost lost art of letter writing her story, and that of a band of diverse characters, from Scotland to London and the recently liberated island of Guernsey, unfold. Their joys and triumphs, sorrows and fears, with a common thread of survival based in humor and love, captures the reader's heart and lets the soul remain hopeful under all conditions.
B00EXVZZE8|5|This is great love it best ever #Long live Nyan Cat!!🐈
B00005JLT5|5|Better than Schindler's list. This is the story about survival against all odds, love of music in spite of hatred and friendships despite differences. Add to all that, this is a true story about someone who just recently (2002) passed away. <br /> <br />Wladyslaw Szpilman is possibly one of the best Pianists in Poland when Germany invades and disenfranchises the Jews. In a short period of time, Szpilman and his family lose everything; their money, their freedom and eventually their lives. Szpilman because of his genius on the piano is saved time and time again from what could almost be certain death. The story of his survival is amazing, one could say almost miraculous.  <br /> <br />There is also the music in this film, although this isn't your Amadeus (i.e. music throughout) it still has those moments when we see and hear Szpilman play Chopn, and it is in these moments when the suffering (both his on film and ours?) becomes almost bearable. What Amadeus did for me in sparking a love for Mozart, the pianist (unintentionally) did for Chopn.  <br /> <br />I cannot say much more as this movie has been adequately reviewed by 200+ other able reviewers, all I can say is that it needs to be in your collection, whether you love good music, have an interest in history or you want a movie about the triumph of the human spirit in the face of adversity. <br /> <br />One cannot recommend this movie enough - a definite must-see. <br />  <br /> <br />
B000005IU2|5|Forget the album as a masterpiece, forget it as a landmark, forget the Stooges, forget Iggy Pop, forget what everybody tells you about this recording, forget yourself in desperate search of the truth and just listen to the most raw human nature ever recorded...
B000YKE87W|5|Romantic Arias is a 2008 Decca Music Group recording starring Jonas Kaufmann as he sings a wide variety of romantic arias. The selection includes Mozart, Puccini, Weber and even Wagner. Marco Armilato leads the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra. The booklet contains not only well-written music notes, but also all the lyrics and a few great photographs of the Mr. Kaufmann. Truly an amazing debut album that showcases a brilliant voice. I absolutely loved every second of it. Highly recommended. 5/5.
B00TU9UO1W|4|This movie belongs among the epic space movies. Great concept. Very well executed! Loved it.
B001TCNSOI|3|This was an ok movie, with some nicely acted scenes, but for the life of me, I cannot understand why Angelina Jolie got this part. I was totally distracted by her unnaturally puffy lips and blood red lipstick.     And in the scene where she grabbed and yelled at a convicted psycopath, (which would never be allowed in real life), she looked like the creature from Alien, with her grotesque mouth and salivating teeth. I fully expected the little projectile with the baby teeth to come out of her mouth and spear the killer. I actually laughed out loud at that.     I really hope that she will not win best actress for this role.
B00D7Z4GQY|5|fast reading with a twist . I thoroughly enjoyed it. I would recommend to all my lady friends. Will go back and read it again.
B005ZOBNOI|5|Very well written.
0201633612|3|I think I've found the cure for insomnia!<br /><br />I majored in Engineering Math and Computer Science in college; so I'm not having any trouble comprehending the material -- I'm having trouble staying awake while reading it!  I've been working professionally as a programmer since 1995, and one of the things I dread in trying to keep up with ever-changing programming tools, techniques, and languages is having to wade through academic treatises such as this one.<br /><br />Now, I'm only 22 pages into a nearly 400 page book, but the writing style is definitely more geared toward academics and theoreticians than practicing software developers.  Case in point is the following excerpt from page 22:<br /><br />\\"An object-oriented program's run-time structure often bears little resemblance to its code structure.  The code structure is frozen at compile-time; it consists of classes in fixed inheritance relationships.  A program's run-time structure consists of rapidly changing networks of communicating objects.  In fact, the two structures are largely independent.  Trying to understand one from the other is like trying to understand the dynamism of living ecosystems from the static taxonomy of plants and animals, and vice versa.\\"<br /><br />\\"...the dynamism...from the static taxonomy...\\"???  Really?  They couldn't come up with a better analogy?<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I'm still hopeful that the content of the book will be worth the effort required to trudge my way through the authors' exceedingly dull delivery...but until I get to the meat of the material (which won't happen until around page 81), the struggle will be to say awake long enough to clear more than a couple of pages at a time.<br /><br />-----<br />OK, it's taken me 6 weeks, but I finally finished the book.  My opinion of the book has improved somewhat.  The content of the book is actually very good.  Much of it simply puts a name to things that I do in my software development on a regular basis; but, some of the patterns presented have introduced me to some ideas or designs that I hadn't previously been exposed to.  I still find the authors' writing style to be dry and off-putting -- it reads like it was written for a master's or doctoral candidate's thesis, and not like it was targeted at a \\"practicing\\" programmer.  Several of the code examples provided are for SmallTalk -- and in the 19 years I've been working as a programmer, I have yet to see a company advertise for SmallTalk programmers...I'm not saying there isn't one, I'm just saying that I haven't seen it.  Unfortunately, the authors seem to go out of their way to avoid references to \\"Windows\\" (the dominant OS, even in 1995 when the book was written / published); instead constantly making references to Unix and a variety of tools that were relatively common on that platform.<br /><br />I guess my beef is that this book's target audience seems to be a relatively small demographic, while the material itself is of great value to a much larger audience.  Instead of targeting the community of programmers as a whole, it seems to focus more on the academic community, and is written in such a way as to appeal to that group.  I'd much rather have seen examples and a writing style with broader appeal.<br /><br />If I were to give separate ratings to content and writing style, I'd rate the content at 4-stars (maybe 4.5), but the writing style is only 2-stars.  Overall, I'm increasing my original 2-star rating to 3-stars.<br /><br />I'm getting started on reading \\"Head First Design Patterns\\" -- a different presentation of very similar material.  While it may be re-hashing the same material I just read, I'm hoping I'll get more out of a different presentation.
B009NY43NY|5|Love the series! It was a great ending though.  So many great aspects of these characters, and it tied up many loose ends for me.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|I think this game is better than flappy bird. Everyone should definitely download this game!! If you don't download this game you will regret it!!!
B003Y5HWJU|4|Of course look at the people involved in the production - Scorsese, Mark Wahlberg... how could you go wrong? - and a surprisingly good serious acting role on Steve Buscemi's part.  I'm probably interested in this because I did not know the history of Atlantic City, and not that much about Prohibition. I think this is a good cast with good direction that keeps a good story going while learning more about that era that keeps me watching it though.
0553381709|4|George R.R. Martin has a marvelous imagination. His characters seem to come to life. You can't help but to love his style.
B0034G4ORC|5|First off, and Ill probably get flamed for it- I enjoyed Independence Day. It was a fun popcorn movie if a bit on the campy side. In my opinion, camp has a place in Hollywood just as much as serious fare and try to tell me watching the aliens getting their asses kicked at the end wasn't a rush.<br /><br />Now on the flip side, we have Battle: Los Angeles. No silliness, lasers or crusading presidents. Instead we have a platoon of trained marines doing their job. The authenticity of their demeanor and weapons usage (thanks to their actual marine training) shown through every frame. Within the first few minutes you actually believe they are the real deal.<br /><br />I also appreciated the \\"authentic\\" look of the aliens. No sleek fighters, laser guns or big headed aliens, these buggers are a nasty melding of organic and mechanics almost like marines themselves (a view shared early on).<br /><br />Interspersed through the proceedings, it is revealed or at least placed forward what they want and how they intend to get it. Of course they didnt take into consideration the chutzpah of the US Marines- a mistake they pay dearly for.<br /><br />As a Scifi connoisseur and lover of authenticity in war movies (Platoon, Saving Private Ryan etc) this is by far the most real feeling alien invasion movie in memory. Watch it and by the end, you'll be almost as exhausted as they are.
B004UID2LC|4|For the little I've used it, it appears to be good.  Too early to review will see down the road how much I use it
B011LBH0RC|4|Could you spare some paper to make a proper sleeve? Are you kidding me....$14 for a CD in crappy PAPER, not even card stock sleeve? I've paid $5 for CD's with way better quality, I mean you couldn't even spring for silk screening the Disc....did you lose that much money when Richie quit?  You wonder why people steal music and don't wanna buy CD's anymore, it's discs like this one. I'm afraid to touch the damn thing as to not have it fall apart in my hands.

0062082353|5|During Bill O'Reilly and Chief Kyle's interview, Chief Kyle's professional demeanor, resolve, and confidence of his, fellow Americans & Allies Forces actions against savage  enemies (rape of innocent women, terror of hearts children, night letters..), are reason enough to get the book.  I ordered 6 copies to give to friends and peers and will probably order more.  Chief Kyle - Freedom is Never Free - Thank you and all Military Service Members for all the sacrifices given, and more importantly the sacrifices that our spouses make, our children make, our parents make, and our loved ones make!    It is a path that is chosen and for the majority it is for honor, duty and country!  The honor of dedicated service is righteously and justifiably earned.
B008673ZAQ|2|Worst one of the series. Too many things just up in the air. Just prolonging for another book that still isn't out. When book 5 comes out I suggest skipping 4 all together.
B0002W18MU|5|Few artists in American music have been as original as Johnny Cash was.  Few artists in American music have been as brutally honest as Johnny Cash was.  This album represents both of those facets to the extreme.  American V may be the best of the series produced by Rick Rubin.  It shows a man at his most vulnerable physically but still in love with the art that propelled him through his many ups and downs in life.  This album confronts death with a nudge and a wink as if to say, \\"I know your there my sickle bearing old friend but I'm going to keep rowing this boat until the end.\\"  At least that's what I imagine Johnny saying with this powerful round of songs.  It on one hand forces one to think of their own life while on the other rejoice in the power to simply sustain.  Johnny was lucky to have spent his remaining years producing the kind of music he wanted to and we have all been richly rewarded with five (soon to be six) albums that simultaneously celebrate the man and his life and serve as a reminder to us all that truly great artists have more to give than they may ever have the life span to produce.<br /><br />The album starts off with the touching Help Me.  It's hard to hear Johnny sound so frail but at the same time the song successfully resonates his pain and gives a hint at the overall theme of the album.  God's Gonna Cut You Down might just be the best song ever recorded in the years he worked with Rick Rubin.  It nullifies, in my opinion, the arguments that Johnny not being present to approve of the musical arrangements was some sort of unethical act on the part of Rubin and the other musicians.  The instrumentation on this song is perfect and adds power to the words and message being conveyed.  In fact, I can't fault anyone associated with this release with regards to the arrangements.  Johnny was richly rewarded by his association with Rubin and together they struck a friendship and trust that endured till the end.  I don't think many producers would have given of their time so freely as Rubin did and I think Johnny recorded the vocals realising someone would have to add the final touches.  Johnny recorded these songs to be heard and I highly doubt he would have wanted them to be released without music to back them up.  Frankly I find that whole argument to be ridiculous.<br /><br />Like The 309 was his last song but it amazes me how this song resembles his early works.  You can imagine what it would have sounded like in his youth with his original band.  It's a true Cash original and brings to mind a form of American songwriting we will never see again, especially with the utter trash that modern Country artists are producing now.  Next comes If You Could Read My Mind, a Gordon Lightfoot original, that in many ways stays true to the original feel of the song.  Johnny's covers always managed to bring out the true nature of what the songs really were.  I had always thougt NIN's version of Hurt was pretty good, but when I heard Johnny cover it I was even more impressed by it.  It amazes me how much over production can sometimes mask the great song that has been written.  While nothing should be taken away from Lightfoot's version, it was great, however, Johnny's version could sit on the same bookshelf with it quite easily.<br /><br />The rest of the songs on this album continue to flow easily and two more standouts include Love's Been Good To Me and A Legend In My Time.  Both are necessary because they serve to break up a little of the sadness present on this album with a bit of humor.  I don't think Johnny meant for this album to be a reflection of life in general since he recorded many songs in succession but Rubin's selection of material for inclusion on this album helped make it seem that way.  I feel like I will always cherish this album just as I know Cash cherished recording it.  I don't know if any other album that comes out this year will be as amazing and I know for sure none will be as personal.  Thank you Johnny for this gift, and thank you Rick Rubin for wrapping this gift up so beautifully.Thank you Johnny for this gift, and thank you Rick Rubin for wrapping this gift up so beautifully.
6305922748|3|I love \\"This is Spinal Tap\\". However, one has to try to be objective. While the portrayal of a hardrock band on it's way down (IF they don't make it in, say Japan, that is...) is hilarious, as a movie the film has a serious flaw. There is virtually no story. It's are not going anywhere (Japan is not counting), it's more a series of funny sketches and songs. <br /> <br />Having said that, there are many many good things in this film. Like when the band sits and listens to reviews that have been written about their albums. How did they come up with all those stupid album titles? They sound just like something a heavy metal band would come up wi... ah, right. \\"IntraVenus de Milo\\", for example. And of course, \\"The Gospel According to Spinal Tap\\", that is accompanied by an appropriate review: \\"These prentetious Rock Psalms make you wonder on which day the Lord created Spinal Tap, and if He couldn't have rested on that day too.\\" The band actually appreciates that review. <br /> <br />Great lyrics to all the songs, too. You can tell that the movie makers love hard rock music as they make fun of the clichs. Clumsy lyrics about sex (\\"Big Bottom\\" and \\"Sex Farm\\"), a song about the 'mysterious' Stonehenge, and my personal favourite \\"Rock and Roll Creation\\" that mixes concepts from different religions with secular origin science and turns it all into a song about... well, Rock and Roll. <br /> <br />\\"Twas the rock and roll creation <br />Twas a terrible big bang <br />Twas the ultimate mutation <br />Ying was searching for his yang <br />And he looked and he saw that it was good.\\" <br /> <br />That's just ingenious.  <br /> <br />Still, the problem is that with no overall direction for the story (there is no murder to be solved, no love to be found, and even the album is already recorded) makes the film a little bit tiresome to watch. Possibly the gags would have worked better if presented separated in a TV-show, so you don't get too much of the same at once. In \\"The Office\\", we have the unhappy love situation (among other things) that ties the show together. Here we have a series of great sketches and songs, that are of course related to each other, but not going anywhere. Oops, I've already said that. See, that's what I mean. It's the same.  <br /> <br />But it's fun. The music actually rocks. Great parts that are larger than the whole. And look out for Billy Crystal as a mimer.
B0000AUHOH|2|If it wasn't a Star Trek movie full of characters you love, there would be absolutely no reason to watch this film. It's like the filmmakers planned out the RULE OF EVENS (see the even numbered Trek films and skip the odd).  The only lasting benefit to this was that they learned from it and righted the ship for 6.
B004P8JPS6|5|I love all the Jack Reacher books.  Lee Child's is a great story teller, and I can't wait for his next book.
0385341008|5|This was a very good book.  I have never read a book of letters before and do not feel like I have now due to the fact that each letter told a story with great detail, you felt you were there.  It was funny, sad, and reminded me how hard it was for people during a war.  I would recommend to all.
B002QE3CTY|4|So far, I am 43% through the book.  I will update my review later (once I am done), but I wanted to leave a quick note.  If you decide to give it a try, read through Chapter 16 before you make up your mind if you want to continue.  I had a hard time getting through the first few chapters, but by #16, I was hooked (and I think my interest was peaked at around Chapter 10).  The first few chapters aren't bad at all - I just had a tough time getting into the story.  I was very confused and nothing had &#34;grabbed&#34; me yet.  Since then, I haven't been able to put the book down!  Anyway, back to the story!! :)
B00687Q0VC|5|Educational and inspirational
B00005LK95|5|This was one of my favorite movies when I was six years old. I am no longer six years old, but I still find the use of Bonnie Tyler's \\"Holding out for a Hero\\" bittersweet and inspiring.  This movie features Ben Jharvi, a loveable indian main character, who is in reality not indian at all but a jewish man named Fisher Stevens covered in brown shoe polish. Had I known this as a child I would have liked it nonetheless, although I probably would have found it slightly offensive.  FIVE STARS.
B000ATQYT2|5|I have owned this movie for years and cannot imagine celebrating the Christmas season without it. Dickens' classic Christmas tale gets a whimsical twist with inclusion of the Muppets. Henson and company have fun with it without sacrificng the story or its powerful intent. Gonzo and Rizzo make for a great pair of narrators. Songs add to the fun and flavor of the film. Michael Caine is Michael Caine--and that means great acting. In fact, it's a terrific blend of people and puppets. While some versions of the Christmas Carol can be frightening for younger children (i.e., the ghost of Jacob Marley and the Christmas Yet to Come), the Muppets take a bit of that edge off. I highly recommend this as part of Christmas perparation--it has the right spirit!
B0030GJ50C|2|This one was kind of creepy.  Sort of like the way Avatar made me feel.....embarased for the treatment portrayed as our response toward other life forms.
B00CNQ7CRI|3|I loved Bridget Jones Diary and thought Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason was better.  I am disappointed in the third installment but can't quite put my finger on 'Why'.  It has nothing to do with the absence of Mark Darcy, strangely.
B00G4DQVDM|5|thanks!
B00E9PMMX0|5|I got this for my daughter who loves Star Wars even more than I do.  The picture and sound is fantastic.  While I don't like the fact that the original's have been changed and are no longer easily accessible, I still want to enjoy these great classics.<br /><br />If Disney ever releases the undoctored Original Trilogy than I'll be the first one in line to buy it.  Until then, this set is great.
B00HDMMISA|5|This is an AWESOME book. HIGHLY recommend it. Read it in four days which is good for me!
B004GJDQT8|4|Prices are great!
B007J4T2G8|1|It is just amazing how this book is a best seller. the sex scenes are just ridiculous and does not make sense. will not recommend this to anyone at all. I think we should read books that would add value to our lives. Could not finish the book at all. Am glad that i just borrowed from our local library.
0312330537|2|Have you ever had an experience where a gregarious, but slightly dodgy stranger engages you in conversation and launches into a rambling series of tall tales about their life to which you respond by smiling and saying \\"Really? How interesting.\\" in an attempt to be polite and non-judgmental - but as time goes on inconsistencies within the narrative become more and more glaringly apparent until with dawning horror you realize that you are in fact sitting next to a delusional psychopath who not only considers you a gullible fool, but possibly intends you mortal harm?  Reading Shantaram I experienced just such an uncomfortable feeling of being taken for a ride by a career grifter.  I missed the hype surrounding the initial launch of the book so I don't know whether it is intended to be a real life story presented as actual fact, or a deliberately hyperbolic allegory built upon a skeleton of events from the author's life.  Clearly a lot of the success of the book so far has depended on its being perceived as the former, and since the incidents in the story are outside my (and probably most readers') direct experience, or otherwise unverifiable (Mumbai underworld activities, mujehadeen guerilla warfare) I am quite willing to give the benefit of the doubt.  However, small implausibilities in the more mundane sections of the novel chip away at the writer's credibility and gradually bring into increasing doubt the veracity of the whole.  For example, overhearing a conversation in Urdu between Karla and Nazeer, Lin says that he understands only every third or fourth word - but conversational Urdu is practically the same as conversational Hindi in which he claims to be fully fluent.  Later he says that he can perform twenty sets of thirty pushups with a minute of rest between sets - please try this at home - it's a pretty tall order for even an Olympic athlete, let alone someone drying out from a three month heroin binge.  On another occasion he writes that nine men were ableto survive for a month in the mountains of Afghanistan with no other food but the flesh of a single goat - how?  These are just a few random examples, but the point is that if we can't trust the author's account of his language abilities, diet or workout routines, can we really trust the more sensational accounts of his apparently superhuman fighting prowess, ability to withstand torture and sexual success with a string of smoking hot babes?  Of course it could be that Roberts' intention is to present events in the hyperbolic, super-real style of 80s Bollywood in which Indian everymen are able to overcome insuperable odds and take on armies of evil gangsters with their bare hands - in which case the novel succeeds brilliantly as a sort of psychadelic, smellovision fable for our times.  But if he is presenting the events of the novel as autobiographical fact with a completely straight face then one can't help suspecting that we are reading the delusional ramblings of a self-aggrandizing windbag.  Structurally the book suggests comparisons with Sade's longer works - sprawling lists of sensational incident separated by babbling philosophical treatises - but spiritually the character Lin has most in common with is Tomb Raider's Lara Croft.  If, as I suspect, the book is in fact no more than a colorful fabrication purporting to be true I can't really understand why James Frey was hung out to dry whilst Roberts remains the toast of the town.
B000007MVL|2|Kate Bush's second album, \\"Lionheart\\", may be the weakest in her catalog.  Its clear Bush did not want to fall into the trap of constructing \\"The Kick Inside Part Two\\", and instead reaches in a number of different directions, some successful, some less so. <br /> <br />Musically, the album takes stabs at ballads similar to the first record (\\"In Search of Peter Pan\\", \\"In the Warm Room\\"), a more pop structure (\\"Wow\\"), rhythmic shifts (\\"Don't Put Your Foot on the Heartbrake\\") an almost shuffle (\\"Fullhouse\\") and a gret rock song (\\"Hammer Horror\\").  Lyrically, Bush has added a level of sensuality to her work (\\"Symphony in Blue\\") and shows no sign of shying away from controversial subjects (\\"Kashka from Baghdad\\"). <br /> <br />The problem is that it doesn't hang together well to my mind-- admittedly, my rating for the album is in many ways relative to Bush's other work, no album with the absolutelyu amazing \\"Kashka from Baghdad\\" can be all that bad, and certainly \\"Symphony in Blue\\" is strong enough to stop you in your tracks, but the album just doesn't work for me.  For early Bush, try her debut (\\"The Kick Inside\\") or the stunning \\"Never For Ever\\".

B00000ILBK|4|I must disagree with all the critics that have given 'Star Trek: Insurrection' bad reviews. It contains many memorable scenes, and it's a movie with a good plot and storyline. It may not be as good as 'First  Contact', but it's a  very good movie! It follows the good traditions of  'Star Trek'; Excelent Special Effects, rich story, excitment, drama,  action, humour and much more. It's got everything one would want, a must  see!
B000002U9E|5|The Musical Complexity of this album trancsends the pop genre. Brilliant
0142437611|3|It hurt to read this book. Once a son, now a father, it is painful to see how poor this relationship can be. Who is correct here: father or son? What is clear here? Hatred.
B005LAIHRC|1|The best part of the movie was the final credits. All 3 of us who watched it couldn't figure out why this movie bombed with so many stars. The acting was bad and the singing was worse. My bluray player is going through detox after last night's screening.
B008Y1RTUG|5|Great movie, lot better than expected. More action than i thought would be in it. Kristen Stewart and Charlize Theron made the movie great Would reccomend this movie if you are into scifi and fantasy.
B000002ULO|4|I have been discovering Paul's post-Beatle work mostly in reverse order, starting with \\"Memory Almost Full\\" and working backwards.  And I am impressed.  \\"Flaming Pie\\" is a bit inconsistent, but the best songs are truly first rate, and the worst would be considered \\"good\\" by the standards of most other pop stars.  For our era, Paul stands alone as a songwriter.  He is our Schubert, our Gershwin.  I only wish that more people could appreciate the genius that we have in our midst.
B0052RDHTM|5|An absorbing tale of several families from widely different backgrounds set against the backdrop of World War I.  Mr. Follett weaves an intriguing story, connecting many lives and situations keeping the reader totally involved.  There are many details relating to that era that were missing from my education.  It was most interesting as a true product of the American Melting Pot to be presented with so many sides to the story and a chance to peer into my ancesters' time.  I couldn't wait to open the second book in the series.
B00A8MGLAI|5|If you are like me, this film came and went through theatrical release without the slightest notice.  Never even saw a preview or a promo.  Probably says more about me than it says about the film, since there are more than ten times the number of reviews I expected to see (ten TIMES, not ten more), so obviously this film is generating some well-deserved buzz.<br /><br />I stumbled on this island of brilliance while wading through oceans of dreck on our local Redbox machine.  The title piqued my interest, as did the participation of two Wachowski siblings.  That was pretty much all I knew about it, so I'm about as close as you might find to a \\"virgin\\" viewer.<br /><br />I pity (if not fear for) anyone who was not moved by the tremendous currents of humanity (as in, humaneness) coursing throughout the film.  Yes, the numerous plot lines can be a bit confusing, and the future-dialect of Hanks & Barry & Sarandon is difficult to follow (try turning on subtitles?).  I also thought Hugo Weaving as Hanks' \\"demon\\" conscience (for lack of a better descriptive term) was rather obtusely introduced and depicted in cringe-inducing fashion.  Perhaps this was precisely the point, and you certainly can't fault Weaving for throwing himself into the role with his trademark zeal.<br /><br />Still, the ensemble cast is impressive for essentially the entire film, even though it can be a bit distracting (e.g., is that Jim Broadbent AGAIN?).  Honestly, the performances are tremendous -- I never once felt an actor or actress was out of their depth (although Doona Bae as an aging Latina sweatshop owner was too much of a reach -- and a waste of make-up!).  Jim Broadbent's escapades in trying to escape a prison-like retirement community had me in unexpected hysterics -- no mean feat.<br /><br />The prevailing theme, explored in myriad ways, is the unfolding tension between two competing world-views:  one, a crude oversimplification of the Nietzschean saw that \\"the weak are meat,\\" which \\"the strong do eat.\\"  The other, that love is eternal, and the consequences of our actions -- particularly those that are noble or selfless -- ripple into eternity.  The vagaries of human behavior are on full display here, from the most heinous and base to the most inspired and inspirational.<br /><br />I never once felt bored or distracted through the entire 2 hours and 50 minutes, even though I was expecting something much shorter (I had it in my head that it was 1 hour 40 minutes long, for unknown reason).  Quite frankly, I didn't want it to end, or I wish they incorporated even more.<br /><br />Edifying cinematic experiences like this are far too few, so I intend to savor Cloud Atlas through my memory -- and periodic future viewings -- for the rest of my life.  Bravo! Encore!rong do eat.\\"  The other, that love is eternal, and the consequences of our actions -- particularly those that are noble or selfless -- ripple into eternity.

1400069289|4|Charles Duhig's book examines a very powerful force in everyday life namely the eponymous Power of Habit. Duhig effectively introduces readers to the concept of the habit loop, giving us detail on the three components that create a habit- the trigger, the action, and the reward. Using this framework, Duhig looks at a number of examples from individual actions through to corporate and societal behaviors. I found his treatment of Paul O'Neills turnaround at Alcoa to be a particularly fascinating examination of how attention to seemingly minute details can have a much larger impact on the culture of a company. That said, some of Duhig's examples, while narratively interesting, don't seem all that obviously connected to the framework he presents in the beginning of his book.<br /><br />Nevertheless, The Power of Habit is certainly worth the read. Much like Malcolm Gladwell, he chooses colorful examples to illustrate his theory. Additionally, Duhig does take the often-ignored leap of trying to offer practical advice on how to apply this framework to changing habits in the reader's life.

B00466M25A|5|Review of the $30 Canadian version:  The one star refers not to the movie, which for me, is a five-star movie, but rather to the cheaply done blu-ray version of this movie.  All the commentaries, extras, subtitles, etc., have been stripped out in this overpriced ($30 USD) Canadian version of the blu-ray, as compared with DVD versions.  It's so sad, because I own the American, German, and Czech versions of the movie on DVD, which have all been well done, with all the extras you would expect.  This new stripped down no-menu 'your movie will start now' without your control, idea of creating blu-rays is awful!  Shame on companies who cheaply do this just to get something quickly out on blu-ray!  The whole idea of blu-ray is not just the high def, but also all that available space so that you CAN add other languages, extras, etc.  Talk about a waste of space on a blu-ray disc!  I have also noticed this same thing with two other blu-rays I've purchased recently, movies I really love:  \\"The Return\\" and \\"Dark Water\\" (all three of these are my most recent blu-ray purchases and seem to indicate a trend, heaven forbid).  The movie starts automatically without the ability to go to a menu and when you hit the menu button, you get the \\"forbidden\\" sign.  If you're lucky enough to have a \\"pop-up menu\\" button on your blu-ray player, then you can sometimes get some minimal functionality through that -- but still not much.  On this DVD, the entirety of all extras and extra functionality is that you can listen to it in French or English, not even any subtitles!  The DVD versions are what you should purchase if you want to have anything beyond that.  I'm not sure the high def alone is worth it if all my blu-rays have no extras nor ability to control the little functionality that may exist on them.  Update as of 20 April 2012:  I see that another version of this movie is coming out on Blu-Ray.  It is half the price of the other.  Hopefully it will have the extras that were stripped out of the other!<br /><br />Review of the $15 American version:  Update as of 10 July 2012:  I am SOO pleased with the new blu-ray disc of 2012!  It looks like the definition problem has been fixed.  Extras have all been added back in.  This is the American version, available for half the price ($15.00) of the useless Canadian one.  All the wonderful extras of the DVD were added back in.  Other languages were added, and to my delight, a Czech language track (I'm currently learning Czech full blast).  In short, I've changed my rating back to a 5-star rating and added this update.  I'm so glad that those responsible for making this and doing it right this time!  Hats off!  Thank you...finally.
B00AW8UK0K|4|I chose the rating because it is very well presented and the recipes are not too expensive to make.<br />A very good book to have available for quick & ease of use.For those that have difficulty in choosing food for dieting, this book represents great choices.
B00DMCV7K0|5|I was was captivated by this book from the very first page. There were so many twists and turns. The author took liberties in writing this amazing piece of historical fiction and I am grateful to her for broadening my horizons and making this time in history come alive for me. What a debt of gratitude we owe to women like the Grimkes and to Sue Monk Kidd!
B0001I55SS|3|Cannot really go wrong with a Disney movie.  This is an old fashioned science fiction movie that brought back memories from my childhood.
B00ESY77LO|4|If you enjoy Baz Luhrman movies, this is great.  If you don't know this director, you may find the movie a little odd.  There are some fantastic visual effects.  The story was interesting, though if you have read the book, I guess you know that.  As usual, Leonardo DiCaprio enveloped his character and Toby Maguire was tepid.

B00A8ECU24|4|Dear world, I'm a 30-year old woman and I am addicted to playing My Little Pony.<br /><br />I love these games where you build up a town and earn fake money to spend in a fake store to buy more fake stuff to put in your fake world.  It's great, like shopping without spending money.  The problems run when you start spending real money on fake things.  I recently purchased the $4.99 bag of gems to use in the game and the app glitched during the purchase.  I was charged for the purchase but never received the gems.  It is really easy to purchase fake items in the app.  Seriously, just two clicks and you've spent real money.  I think the game makers need to make it a little more difficult for people to spend real money, especially since the game is targeted to children.<br /><br />As some people have said, some of the items are ridiculously high in price.  Like one pony costing over 900 gems.  Gems are really hard to come by so being able to unlock that kind of pony takes purchasing gems.  And the real money it costs to purchase these fake gems is really overpriced.<br /><br />Also, there is no way to receive heart gems in the game without using social networking.  I would like there to be at least the option to purchase heart gems instead of having to beg friends to join.<br /><br />As the game progresses, clearing the dark patches gets more and more expensive which takes longer and longer and longer time to accumulate the coins needed.  Also, some of the shops take two, three, four hours or more before they produce coins again or even twelve hours to build!  I think things should take one hour tops.<br /><br />In all, this game is very fun.  I would like to see things cost less and take less time, but we'll see if the game makers actually listen.  If you are getting it for a child, disable the purchasing in the game so you don't end up with charges you weren't expecting.
B00979OL5A|5|before  my grannd boys  owned their tablets they  would ask iif  they could play games on  my kindle fire  i would say  yes  but only the free ones. and from their  reactions and  the joy they were experincing  i would say its  THE  BOMB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008OOYALE|5|Keep the kids entertained for hours!!!! Great for the car!!!! I would recommend this game to others!!!  A real must have!!!!

0385505833|5|I have to say that when I procured this book I had to look at the cover twice to reassure myself that John Grisham had written it.  Why?  Two reasons, quite simply: (1) its brevity, (2) the blatantly interwoven satire and humor.  Regardless of the number of differences from the &quot;normal/average&quot; Grisham novel, the book was an easy read (a couple of hours at the most) and an enjoyable one.<br />The book takes an honest look at all of the nonsense we engage in at Christmastime.  Unlike some reviewers who have dubbed this a &quot;Bah, Humbug!&quot; book, I received it quite oppositely.
B00A81MV3U|5|This isone of my favorite movies ever, both of the actor's play great parts. I don't go to the movies that often anymore, but I did for this one, like it so much had to buy the DVD as well. The best is the dance scene love it.....
B001GA1RFA|3|I decided to read this after reading Green's &#34;A Fault in our Stars&#34; because I really liked how it was quirky, funny, thought provoking, and emotional.  &#34;An Abundance of Katherine's had brief moments where I thought &#34;ok, its about to get good&#34; and then it didn't.  This book was character driven, rather than plot driven, which I didn't mind because I like getting to know characters in depth but what plot there was seemed unrealistic.<br /><br />Right off the bat, for example, when Collin gets dumped by K-19, K-19 calls and talks with his parents. I don't care how close they were no teenager would call her ex-boyfriend' parents the day after she ended it.  Also, the mom is upset to the point of tears?? The road trip was not a road trip by any means, and the interaction between the boys, Hollis, and Lindsey was strange because they acted anything like strangers right from the moment they met, the conversation between Hassan and his dad,<br /><br />A lot was left to be desired in that it was quirky but not funny, it could have told more of Collin and Lindsey's relationship, and evoked some emotion.<br /><br />I did like the footnotes that offered facts and phrases ect but it was annoying too because they were put at the end of the chapter, instead of on the bottom of the page, so I had to flip back an forth (kindle edition)
1501106422|5|The book is really good, but sad because of the subject of early on-set Alzheimers.  The book had a lot of good information on the onset, diagnostics, genetics and statistics.  Really loved the book, waiting for it to come out on DVD!
B00FAPF5U0|5|This is A very difficult and fun game! it stretches you mind a little cause you have to think how one move will affect another
B007J4T2G8|1|Boring insipid characters engaged in narcissistic self examination that never rises above the level of sophomoric, emotionally stunted musings...which would be fine if at least the sex parts were entertaining. This book is a big glob of mediocrity that has captured people's imaginations mostly because, I think, it has managed to put a slightly more sophisticated veneer on a type of novel that is nothing new. It has done this by branding and publicity and almost nothing else, because there is nothing sophisticated about the writing. This isn't a bad book...it's a bleh book. Also, and this is just my personal taste, is it truly the case that the kinds of characters the fans of this work enjoy reading about are so physically perfect to the point of disappearing into their own perfection? I read the descriptions of Anastasia and Christian and they seem almost antiseptic in their physical perfection. They're mannequins, not people. Weird.
B00ILHW6AG|4|Well... I've nearly every one of Mr King's books. Most of his books I couldn't put down. Revival was no exception. I binge-read this novel. Just couldn't stop reading it. Being a spiritual person of devout Christian beliefs I found some of the book a bit off-putting-but hey it's a novel and it's Stephen King!!<br /><br />But the ending of this novel- well it's plain weird. Mr King is getting on up there in years and he seems to be a little age conscious. But he can still write a novel!<br /><br />Revival is  a good read. But I liked Duma Key better.
B00DR0PDNE|3|I bought this device primarily to stream Netflix and You Tube to my tv.  It replaced a Sony media player withat poor WIFI reception a poor interface with Netflix.  I was hoping to use it to cast music on my android devices to my TV suround system.  I downloaded several apps that indicated that they could do this.  They all failed apparently because Chromecast will not read wma formatted files which were created with windows media player.  They still played fine on all my android devices, but the audio won't cast.  Apparently Google did not make chromecast with the ability to accept wma files which I find a surprising oversite.  Therefore I've downgraded the usefulness of chromecast since it won't read this common format.
B004DI7HZ6|4|Lots of time spent in exposition in the first half or more of the novel, but the story needs it , and it really starts to flow round about the middle.  I'm almost at the end and --finally, after all these pages--I'm well and truly hooked.  Can't wait to read vol. 2.  The writer is obviously well-grounded in history and the mythologies of other-worldly creatures, and her version of vampire/witch/demon lore is well-plotted and plausible.  There is a goodly amount of real information to be had, as well as a ripping good yarn.
B000JIHP88|5|I chose this mobile to go with frog themed nursery. I love the sounds that it has with it.  The nature sound is my sons favorite sound to sleep to.  It is on the quite side and you cannot hear the motors at all.<br /> I've had it running for a week and love it. The remote works great also so you don't have to walk beside the crib and risk waking the baby.<br />You might need some help putting it together it's not hard to assemble but it's easier to have help.
B004JHY8A8|5|I loved loved this book.... couldn't put it down!  Would absolutely recommend it to anybody... fantastic writing and very easy to read.

B00DB3G8KY|5|A classic! Nicely updated.  I bought it for the C style used in the examples.  Fortunately, they are readable on the iPad Air.  In some titles the examples are just 8x8 bit maps, and worthless.  It's a nice easy intro into more advanced programming.  Beware, the first chapter is mostly a review of Unix history and standards,  which I found almost lethally boring,  maybe others find it interesting.  I consult this edition when revisiting an area I don't use every day, knowing  It will give me a solid base to elaborate on.
B00EJOCAYW|5|grandson loves it
B00992CF6W|3|I like this app very much but it needs to be more like the xBox version like being able to go to Nether and The End. I would rate higher if it had these improvements
B0043RSK3K|5|As disturbing as this history is, at least someone has finally documented the facts concerning some very disturbed leadership of this country. This certainly should be required reading in every high school American history course if not in the first year of college.
B004J4WLB4|4|This book keep my attention , making me hope that all could work out for Victoria. I also learned much about flowers and their emotional meanings.
B0028IDXDS|5|These are absolutely adorable and useful. They are bigger so they keep the pacifier in babies mouth and also are good for baby to hold. I love these.
B00L9B7IKE|5|Couldn't put it down
B002KSPKRS|4|I was looking for a wireless headset for my boyfriend when he plays on xbox. He always loves turtle beaches and after a lot of research I got these. These headphones are very nice the surround sound is like your personal movie theater and it crisp and clear and can distinguish where the sound is coming from in the game. The only complaint about this terrific headset is that it tends to crackle here and there because of it being wireless
B000LC55F2|3|I ordered this product for my son-in-law who lives in Costa Rica.  It was delivered to a friend out of state who was traveling to Costa Rica.  I am writing this review so that I won't keep getting emails asking me to write a review.  We own this particular dvd ourselves and enjoy it.
B00D7Z4GQY|2|Not sure why this has been a best seller.
B006FPFTMS|5|Very useful. Especially like the note function that allows you to underline or highlight sentences.
B009HQ9UHC|5|purict if you love great games like riding game's and I love this game awesome I love it so much get it guys ok love love love love lobe love it ber it yeah it is awsome yeah I'm British and I'm from Canada I'm out of the Usa right now
B000IDEQTK|3|This is a modern version of 'Lady Windemere's Fan' which is so badly acted by the american actresses that Oscar Wilde would turn in his grave. The humor and real irony was sucked out of it by Hunt and Johansson whose performance were plodding and unimaginative. Sorry, I like both actresses, but this was not their finest screen moment. I gave it three stars, because, it is Oscar Wilde. Though I don't know why they chose such a boring title as A Good Woman. Oscar Wilde would think it scandalous that his wanton heroine was played with so much sincerity and so little humor or devout character flaws. He hated that sort of thing.
0439023513|5|Mockingjay is an excellent book.  Full of twists and turns, it made me gasp out loud in surprise more than once.  I was very satisfied with how things ended.  Ending such an amazing series this way is not going to please everyone. I understand and can fully appreciate the emotional and physical reactions the characters have.  Sometimes it seems so dark, but how would you react in the face of these challenges and losses?  I loved it. I can't wait to see how the movies turn out.
B009MJU8PW|5|Perfect little figure!
B00Y6QF0PE|5|Great spin on story
B006AZZPCM|5|love this app!  hv no prob on fire!  hv file mngr so mngng files so easy!  no prob dwnloadng format wanted! wll nvr delete! use constantly!!! thx so much Devian Studio!
B00843TZJ2|5|These guys just keep getting better  and better. I saw them 35 yrs ago as well as on this tour. When I left the concert I thought, &#34;man, I wish I could get a recording of them live, now!&#34; Who knew it was in the making?! Thanks!
B009NQKPUW|5|Closer from Blade Runner than Alien in term of the themes the director is exploring.<br />Life and death. The search for the creator. What's the human soul.<br />Very well played and directed. A lot of very deep thoughts. I loved it.<br />Special effects and ambiance are spotless.<br />I assume that some people will hate it because of religious reasons.<br />A lot of open questions too, which I like, but can bother some people.<br />I saw it twice and will defenetely watch it again.
B000000OSE|4|This is a pretty good album, I like it. It's not as good as Greatest Hits, or even Appetite For Destruction but it's pretty good. The lyrics may not be so great but it's got some really good songs. Dust N' Bones, Live and Let Die, and November Rain would be the good songs on this album. Don't Cry isnt bad at all it's a beautiful ballad but can get boring after 3 minutes. I'll rate this 4 stars because it is kind of lousy with bad words. <br />It's cool man, <br />Whirligig.
B00BAXFECK|5|Beautiful language, vivid images, but very dark. It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I savored it. I can't wait for the book club discussion!
B004NS710C|5|I had no interest in seeing this, another runaway train movie.  I happened to be at the library and it happened to be there, and my husband had recently mentioned someone said it was good, so I borrowed it.<br />For once, we were not disappointed.  Granted, when you go into a movie not expecting anything it makes it easier for the movie to impress you.<br />I liked the characters, I liked the action.  Of course you knew the early attempts to stop the train would fail, otherwise there wouldn't be anymore movie.  However it was still a good action movie that kept your interest and entertained the whole way through.<br />I would recommend this movie, however I am not sure its a movie you could enjoy as much the second time.
B009UX2YAC|4|(By sawyer) good game. It is pretty good. Get it. You should like it. You run for miles, collecting coins so you can buy new characters, hoverboards, and gadgets. Plus, you can get mystery boxes. THEY give you bags of coins, gadgets, and trophies. You should get this game. Period.
B003O86FMW|5|Finished all 3 in 2 days! They're amazing, I just couldn't put hem down. Glad I decided to read them
B002DEZXOE|5|Crazy about Woodstock. Crazy about this video I wish I was born a generation earlier because the 60's were FAR OUT!!!!!:) peace.
B0036RCVJM|3|The reflections are written as a documentary style which may disappoint. I accepted the style but thought a lot mor character development could benefit the arousal of emotion in the reader. I have not seen the movie yet, but was told of the emotion evoked. I enjoyed the expose of the reflections and wish Mr Lomax well in his ongoing coping with the trauma.
B00PTB7B34|5|This is an awesome game. To top it all of its free!!! So download it before they charge you!!! You'll be happy.
B00W6XM002|4|Fun and addicting!
B00AGJ4HC2|4|As generally noted, this is a filler game.  It isn't the sort you are going to find yourself playing for 5 hours of a time.  But that isn't to say that you couldn't play it 2-3 times in a row, without growing bored.<br /><br />A person would buy this game if they were looking for a game that was fast-paced, not too long, and easy to teach... but not dumb.  The small number of cards makes it a good game to play outside, especially if you put card protectors on them (63x88mm).<br /><br />The people that are really good at this game are the same people who are good at poker.  Because the cards you receive are random, making the most of them involves your ability to read the people you're playing with.  You estimate what cards your opponents have (and your potential to exploit that), by tracking the cards played and watching their decision making processes at each hand.  It's a bit like if Clue and Poker had a baby.<br /><br />There are plenty of games that involve more strategy and challenge, and this game isn't going to stand up to them.  Its strengths are in its accessibility.  But it really is fun for people that fully engage with it.  If you just play your hand and don't play your fellow gamers, then you will get bored fast.  Sure there's a lot of luck involved, but if you play with someone who's a skilled analyst, they will win most rounds.  The storyline of the love letter isn't really intrinsic to game play, but the characters give you more stuff to joke around about, so it's good they're there.
B008476HBM|3|I recognize quality work, even if I don't totally connect with the material. I did really like Lizzy, though.
B009LMTDL0|5|Love the positive writing in this book. Was reading it at a very stressful time and there were so many times that i felt like she was writing the book just for me.
0062238868|5|I bought is for a gift for my son.  He does not like reading, but loved this book.
B002QE3CTY|4|This is definitely a well written, interesting book... just a little harder for me to relate to the character.  But it's a very interesting look at a different future..
B006MW3UZW|5|Seems accurate portrayal of era. No profanity or nudity to have to watch. Love the costumes and styles of furniture.
1612680011|5|Very easy to read and understand. Well written and insightful. Was able to entrigue me into action. Already bought a few more of his books to continue the journey.
B001ANSS5K|5|Loved it!
B0089LOG02|5|This is such a good book. I knew about there being orphan trains but that was all. Then I began to read and then it was all so real. The perils of Niamh were so sad. Just anyone could take those children. No prior screening necessary. I recommend this book.
B00DR0PDNE|1|I bought this several months ago to stream Netflix.  I've only been able to use it a few times and, in the last few weeks not at all.  Its a waste of time and money.
B000FBJF7I|5|As with all of the No.1 ladies books ... excellent, well written, good philosophy too. intend to try to catch up with all the rest of the no. 1 books.
0804194610|5|Another excellent book of non-fiction by Erik Larson.  This was so interesting with so much I never knew about the events surrounding the sinking of the Lusitania.  The author switches between several locales:  on board the Lusitania; on board the German submarine U-20, in the rooms of British intelligence, and in the White House with President Wilson.  There are lots of fascinating happenings in each place.  I got the large-print paperback for my elderly dad and he loved it, and I stole it from him as soon as he was finished.
B0017SWPXY|5|I read the trade paperback version of this book and loved it!  It was so good, I passed my copy on to my daughter, grandson and granddaughter to read - but this is one I would probably want to read again, so I am buying the Kindle version.  It is sad, happy, inspiring, funny and heartbreaking all in turns.  I absolutely loved Enzo and his human.  One of the  most heartwarming stories I've read in a very long time - highly recommend it!
1844137872|5|Enjoyed this book, it was not too difficult to read, it is an excellent copy. I would recommend this book to everyone.
B000F3AAUW|5|I admit, I only really like a couple of songs on the whole CD, but they're worth writing a review about. Of course, \\"Crazy\\" is great. But I love that they re-did the Violent Femmes song, \\"Gone Daddy Gone\\" I think they did a great job at that.
B009PMEEY2|4|Simplistic puzzle/matching game that is highly addictive! I haven't even managed to finish all the puzzles/levels yet. Many hours of fun! :)
B00785P2QC|4|only problems is being. linked. to facebook and twitter. other than that is great game great for killing a lot of time
B000XUBFE2|5|This is a truly beautiful book. Set some time aside to read it. You won't want to put it down.
B00CO4GO7I|5|I highly recommend reading &#34;American Sniper&#34; by Chris Kyle if you haven't already.  I was riveted at times, sad, amazed, and also shed a few tears in the process.  This is a true American Hero....forget about his unbroken record of confirmed kills as a Navy SEAL  He was an unassuming, humble, down to earth man, husband and father.
B00AREIAI8|3|I liked this game. It is really fun and feels like you are taking care of a real horse. Also if you need you can ask for help.
B007M6P01O|5|Dying Beside Fire was Satisfying, but leaves you wanting more and the action don't dissappoint because of the suspense factor and plot suprises
B00EJXX17S|2|I'd rather her videos were in DVD those I really like
B005K0HDGE|5|Stephen King continues to live up to his great literary reputation in &#34;11/22/63&#34;.<br /><br />The author adeptly and imaginatively handles the &#34;time travel&#34; concept with an engrossing, well crafted story.<br /><br />The characters are painted with a delicate, picturesque brush.  They are real persons with whom the reader may easily empathize.<br /><br />Mr. King is a skilled wordsmith, conjuring brilliant images of persons, real and imaginary, and the places which were the venues of this sad but important time in American history.<br /><br />My only criticism is that the work tends to be lengthy, but Mr. King's writing continually holds the attention of the reader, so the length of the work is only a minor issue.<br /><br />&#34;11-22-63&#34; is highly recommended reading.
B00K2CHWOI|5|The advertisements for this movie really missed the mark, as there is so much greatness going on in this film. &#34;Tom Cruise vs the aliens&#34; or sci-fi &#34;Groundhog Day&#34;? Sure, those claims are true, but rather simplistic. There are several other really wonderful things to love about this film:<br /><br />1) Kickass super-heroine - While many lament the absence of women from the modern superhero boom (and rightfully so,) this movie delivers that rare woman warrior. At the start, Tom Cruise is the puny wimp, while Emily Blunt is the fearless leader of Earth's entire army. She swings this ridiculously giant manga-style sword and crushes aliens like nothing. It's simply great and cool to see anybody doing this, but especially a lady.<br /><br />2) Sci-fi D-Day - This movie showcases a classic &#34;storming of Normandy&#34; sequence where instead of Americans  attacking Germans, it's power-suited humans airdropping onto the beach to make battle with alien enemies. It's big, epic, loud and thrilling.<br /><br />3) Comedy - This movie's hysterical. The dark humor milks the premise of the repeating/neverending day for all the jokes it can, where things change in novel, unpredictable ways.<br /><br />4) New aliens - Tired of the same old aliens that are humanoid with 4 limbs or look like big bugs? Just as this film offers fresh spins on other tired cliches, the bad guys here are the most distinct and unique creations in sci-fi cinema that I can remember for quite some time.<br /><br />5) Big ideas - This film combines a plethora of heady themes: destiny, heroism, politics, morality, war, choice, etc. where the viewer has many deep things to contemplate while riding the roller coaster plot.<br /><br />Beyond the above, sure the movie has great performances (Bill Paxton's sassy and evangelical sergeant is downright poetic), killer action, majestic SFX, and interesting and intriguing plot. I know this movie was based on a Japanese graphic novel, but it still one of the most &#34;original,&#34; cool and kooky films to be made in this era of remakes, reboots and sequels.he most &#34;original,&#34; cool and kooky films to be made in this era of remakes, reboots and sequels.
B005K0HDGE|5|Not predictable--lots of twists and turns. I love time travel stories but they have to be believable even though you know they could never happen. This is so believable it draws the reader right in. I love being brought back to 1958 through the senses --reminding me of the way things looked, smelled, tasted!
B000FC2L1Y|5|I love this series.  It captured me with the first book, The Outlander, and I will be waiting for the promised 2013 new book release while reading all in between!!  I miss the character Ian, but I am sure he will surface again somewhere before the story is finished.  Very skillfully written, rich narrative dispersed with historical facts as well as just enough science fiction. :-)  Try it, you'll love it!!
0800141806|4|This movie helped the gay rights movement. It also helped the audience have a better understanding of help issues and challenges. Awesome cast and acting.
B0000AQS0F|5|This is one of the best-done science-fiction series ever done.  It's realistic in terms of the space travel; the science behind medical conditions portrayed in the show is accurate for the most part; and the acting is really great.  There are a few moments in the series that are definitely not kid-friendly (one of the characters is the futuristic version of a professional prostitute and her job is viewed on-screen a couple of times, and another couple of the characters are married and are shown having fun one evening).  Otherwise, this is a great series.  It's a shame that they didn't allow Joss Whedon to continue this series for more than one season.  Worst mistake ever.
B0012GMUI6|5|Roger Waters is... a genius.<br />I can't say that few people understand his work because MILLIONS appreciate his music and lyrics, and I do mean APPRECIATE, not just \\"like\\" his music.<br /><br />Amused to Death is a 1 in a lifetime album and no wonder Waters didn't create another album yet (aside from Ca Ira) because to do something similar is quite impossible, although I hope that he takes the risk.<br /><br />Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking is a journey that you don't want to miss as well. Just listen to the words of Roger and the guitar of Eric Clapton and feel the music overwhelming you. A song like Go Fishing is a lyrical masterpiece. If you notice how he describes the seasons going by \\"We sat out in the spring...\\", \\"And the sun went down sooner each day...\\", \\"All the leaves have fell down...\\", \\"When the first snow flake fell...\\". Just WOW!<br /><br />If I get to choose one rock star to meet in my life, it would be Roger Waters.
B00005JKL8|4|As usual Gene Hackman is perfectly cast in this dark portrayal of the US and international forces monitoring of the Bosnian/Serbian conflict. I caught the end of this film on a cable channel and it was forever imprinted in my memory. After watching the film again from beginning to end it's become one of my favorite \\"war\\" type of films, realistic, dark and gritty. <br /> <br /> If you like Owen Wilson be prepared for a shock. In many films he is cast in comedic roles as in the Jackie Chan films, Zoolander and The Wedding Crashers but this film shows the true depth of his abilities as a serious actor. This by far is my favorite Owen Wison film.
B00008BXJF|5|Having bought this only a week ago i can say these: KC (fripp/belew/gunn/mastelotto) gave their best album of the post-1994 period, and it seems that the \\"fractalization\\" period DID have a meaning. The sound is aggressive, crystal clear and deep, and the playing is amazing. In some tracks, it brings to mind the album \\"Starless & Bible Black\\", though with a more textured approach. There are less improvisations than in other albums. They use plenty of electronic drums which is refreshing, and they do it pretty maturely. The songs are amazingly good, no fillers. The overall feeling is superior and more cohesive to that of THRAK. To my ears this stuff is combining heavy experimentalism and accesibility which is what art is all about.  Bravo mr. fripp/belew/gunn/mastelotto  Have a nice day
B000K15VSA|5|I had been waiting for this Ultimate version of the movie and in this sort of packaging for years, but the main question as a buyer is 'was a real effort was made to deserve our money'. After seeing some previous Special Editions/Director's Cuts of Ridley Scott's films, I had an idea of what we might expect . It is hard to believe that some would still be unhappy with this incredible presentation of Blade Runner, but that is the way fans are.<br /><br />The set (preordering through Amazon) cost me less than a third of the Australian price, so I cannot complain.<br /><br />For those who have never seen it, the film is amazing and haunting , in some ways sad. I feel it means more as one becomes older. My only reservation about the film is the way it tries to be many things at once, but maybe that is its charm.<br />It is definitely a classic and perhaps those who don't like it don't like the underlying message which may be - think about yourself and what you have accomplished. Are you happy with that ?<br /><br />If not, the film may be difficult to sit through.<br /><br />A great film, beautfully presented in a package to hand down to the Nexus, sorry , NEXT generation.
B00ATDOVNK|5|I really like this game because it has a great story line and it makes you think as well as keeps you entertained. Thanks G5 I will definitely buy more games
B008476HBM|5|Pride and Prejudice is ultimately a love story, but along the way we are treated to the main character's worries and witty observances.
B004FRX0MY|5|I like it you have all the music i like to play
B000007491|3|Supertramps' very first album, a stepping stone to &#34;Crime of the Century&#34;. While it does not have the commercial appeal<br />as their other albums but it does give a feel where they started and where they were heading. Rick Davies and Roger Hodgson<br />are the only original members in the beginning while other members joined in future albums.
0783225849|4|Warning *SPOILERS*! The main one is in this review. So I advize you if you have not seen it, do not, I repeat, DO NOT READ THIS! If you do it'lljust ruin, the twist,so as a movie watcher I ask to not read this if you haven't seen this. <br />Let me start off by saying, I am 10 years old,and from what I've noticed other kids don't have respect for classics. I took this to my friends house, and she's 13, first she said the music in the beggining was awsome (which is true) but 20 minutes into the movie, she said &quot;This is boring.&quot; I know she has her own opnion, and blah, blah, blah. But this aint her review. It's mine, hense, I tell my own opnion.HA! So I looked at her in disguest. She obviously has no respect for horror/thriller/study into paranoi, movies. She's more into slashers. Which I'm all for, but sometimes they overdo the gore. I like slashers yeah, I mean, my personal favoirte horror movie is &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street.&quot; Yes that is a slasher, BUT, it has a psychologocal depth. Same with Final Destination, because in that slasher, people get killed, and there is no killer. You Have to see it to understand. Whatever, but the worst part was she said the shower scene was crap! ARGGGH!It was 1960! Don't expect as much blood as you did in Scream. Well that is done. But here is the spoiler, so if you haven't seen it yet DO NOT read this. Okay. You know how at the end the guy was just really a well...Psycho...because he was a skizo and one of his personalities is &quot;His mother&quot;. Well, when the shower scene first came on, I was watching this movie with my mom and I said, &quot;YOu know what'd be weird? If the guy was a skizofrenyic and thought he was his mother.&quot; And oh my god! I was right. I swear to god, it was so weird, but so cool!<br />Okay so overall, the movies really good, and is worth watching.<br />Maybe I am &quot;Psych&quot;ic
B000002A3T|5|If \\"The Final Cut\\" made you want to commit a suicide, \\"The Division Bell\\" will make you enjoy every second of your life, The best guitar works of Gilmour are here, a very posative album, i find it better than \\"Wish You Were Here\\".
B00722ZHG6|5|Birdy has such a tremendous talent for such a young girl.  This cd is full of many wonderful songs, there is not one bad on on the cd.
0385341008|5|\\"Delightful\\" is not a word I tend to use very often but would have to be the single word I would use to describe this book.  The easy-to-read story is a celebration of the art of writing, of the unique stories each and every person has, and of the different ways love can reveal itself.  It's a fun and refreshing style of writing and presentation of history in a location rarely discussed.
B00FAPF5U0|5|Wish you didn't have to wait for friends on Facebook to unlock next series of puzzles or pay for it. Really addicted!!
B001BZRUR4|5|I enjoy the works of this author and his style of writing.<br />It's a nice message. I always want to keep reading his stories.
B00LTMIAF0|1|One star is even too much! Don't waste your time. It is the slowest movie EVER! I rented it and it just did not make much sense and I finally stopped it after 20 mins. Then 2 months later we accidentally rent it again. Figured we have now paid for it twice...maybe it gets better. Nope. Seriously,  don't waste your time.
B00PB5AO4G|5|Fun game to pass the time!
B0052GACNM|5|Tony Bennett is a gem and it is a wonderful selection of performers he sings with. His songs are ageless.
0441013597|5|Hands down one of the absolute best works of science fiction thus far, not a whole lot more to say. As it nears its 50th birthday it continues to age marginally at most, exploring themes and stories we can all relate to, even today, yet also tell a tale of great war and struggle against true evil, among countless other things. I mean no offense to anyone particularly religious, but it is pure fact that like the Bible or any other sacred text, you can read this book countless times and gain something different from it with each read.<br /><br />11/10. BUY IT.
B00OBW0IUU|5|Love this movey
B005544V6A|5|Had no idea how great this show was.  My Dad mentioned it, but I never watched it.  With Amazon Prime I just watched the whole first season.  It's a show you can't miss...watch it.
B008UX2UIO|2|Good writing, but stupid story.
0307476073|5|Highly enjoyed her adventure from being a recreational loser to an inspirational hiker on her own personal journey of recovery. Highly recommended.
B006GLLXXK|5|Great story lines. So many characters to love and at times hate. How can you not love Erik. Must see
0804178755|5|Well, what can I say, another riveting Reacher story... lots of violence and graphic description but not really off-putting... plenty of &#34;deductive reasoning&#34; between action sections. As always it's hard to put it down. Glad there's another one in the pipeline in a few months. One of my favorite characters and no, I canNOT see that runt Tom Cruise EVER playing him in another movie. Only someone who had never read any of the books would believe him in this role. Come on, Reacher is six foot five and weighs 250. Where is John Wayne when we need him? Or a bulked-up Clint Eastwood? Or even dreamy Tom Selleck, roughened a bit... all BIG men who would be believable in this role. Reacher isn't a pretty boy, but he is compelling and intelligent. Child writes his stories as possible screenplays. Considering his TV background, that's fair enough. One's attention does not wander, and as each page is turned there is a fresh scene or action or question. Always interesting. And here's one character who knows himself really well and knows what he can and can't do-- he can do most anything he sets his mind to, except settle down in one place. I'm glad. There will likely be another one in another year or so.
B00JOT3HQ2|5|I am only doing this because they promised me a new character. I really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really don't care. I'm just trying to reach a 20word minimum.
B000A59PMO|5|All I heard was Veronica Mars - the best show no one is watching.  A 25 year old playing a 17 year old trying to play a private detective on the UPN ... all reasons not to watch, right?  WRONG!  I decided to buy this set to check out the hype and quickly saw it was not hype.  I stuck the first disc in on Sunday to check it out, figuring I would only watch the pilot and have already gone through 4 discs.  In fact, my parents came in on episode 4 and they are hooked too.  We can't wait to finish.  I know that hype usually doesn't pan out ... but trust me, buying this set will not be a waste of money.  I am confident you will love it!!!
B0053Q9DHW|5|I believe my wife ordered this item and treasurers it.  It is a movie that she fell in love with she was very young.
B0000019PA|3|You simply have to adore the effort and passion that Jeff Magnum & co. put into this record.  However, this is not masterpiece.  I agree with the reviewer who said that hipsters cling to this record for its obscurity and the fact that most (all) mainstream music fans will find it impenetrable.  I'm not bashing this album, I think it's quite good.  \\"King of Carrot Flowers Pt.1\\" \\"Aeroplane over the Sea\\" and \\"Two-Headed Boy Pt.2\\" are very well-written songs whose effects carry over well after the album is over.  Jeff Magnum's voice, though, strives to reach notes that simply aren't there for him, and the production is so lo-fi that it's painful to listen to at times.  Anyone with instruments and $1500 can buy a Boss BR-1180 and have production 100x better than this.  I honestly enjoy this band and this album, but it's just NOT worth 5 stars (save that for Disintegration).  I recommend the Decemberists, they play folk-pop in the same vein as NMH, but with much better production, lyrics, singing, and instrumentation.

0446572764|5|This book, and the series in general, does a fantastic job of painting a picture of living in the Soviet Union at the time.  I found myself anxiously awaiting what would come next.  Despite being involved in an awful system, I found myself rooting for Leo.  I really enjoyed the character development and story line. The conclusion requires some suspension of disbelief but I still loved the book overall.
B000067CPX|2|As much as i wish it weren't true, it's definitely a let down. I absolutely hated it at first, searching desperately for funk in any shape or form, but it grows on you if you're persistent and listen to it a lot. And i mean a lot. If you're not a fan, check out ANY of their other albums - Californication, One Hot Minute, Blood Sugar Sex Magik, Mother's Milk, and Uplift Mofo Party Plan, which are all among the GREATEST albums of all time. Hopefully they'll rediscover that which has made them the greatest band on earth in the near future. But if you're a fan i say go for it, you'll find something you'll appreciate.
0307476073|5|Cheryl's adventure was more than wild!  I have to admit that I didn't love her in the beginning of the book.  Her life was a train wreck that kept getting worse.  The hike and her journey to discovering herself was a fabulous story!
B0095P31L6|5|great family movie... 3 yr old and 2 yr old grand kids love it. great story for adults and interesting characters for kids
B0000A02TZ|3|\\"Animal House\\" was the movie that started the trend of college comedies, and by the way, it's much better than imitators like \\"Porky's\\" or more recently the \\"American Pie\\" trilogy. If you have seen many films from the 80s, you will find a lot of familiar faces in this movie, but the only one that started a promising career was John Belushi, unfortunately he died a few years later. Kevin Bacon appears briefly, but he is not one of the main characters. <br /> <br />In \\"Animal House\\" you will see most of the stuff that has been shamelessly imitated throughout the years: there are pretty girls (specially Karen Allen), jokes directed to the authority figures, silly (but funny) humor, a lot of irreverent characters, and yes, the toga scene. <br /> <br />\\"Animal House\\" is a simple, basic comedy, but it's funny and it's better than all those copycat movies that came out in the 80s and 90s.

B00CTSDDVO|5|This movie was great in IMAX 3D and having it in 3D at home is the next best thing. This movie turned me on to Cumberbatch and I have gotten everything he as been in since. Very intersting twist on the old story. Disappointed originally to heading down the different timeline with the new series, but with this they are making the best of it with the juxtapositions.
B00004ZAV3|4|I have been listening to the beatles all my life,my dad got me into them,so i got the beatles 1,and its not a bad cd really,but if you really want to have the ultimate beatles experience,then i would suggest getting the original cd,s,i only own beatles 1,and abbey road,and l love them both,but i was dissapointed,that there were no sgt pepper songs,but it surely beats those annoying rap songs,whatever a rap artist accomplishes all his life the beatles accomplished it with only a album,and this one is it.
B0006A9FKA|3|I'm American, but I enjoy a lot of British humor - Monty Python, Black Adder, Red Dwarf, etc. - and I was hoping that \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" would be up to that level of wit. It isn't.  Yes, there are some funny moments. And the notion that most people lurch through life so bored and oblivious that they wouldn't even notice if their city were overrun by zombies is given a thorough workout. But once you get past that, there's not a lot going for \\"Shaun.\\" The first half is dreadfully slow, and the ending is too gore-filled for an alleged comedy.<br /><br />For the most part,  \\"Shaun\\" is just another zombie movie, patterned on George Romero's \\"Living Dead\\" series, but set in London. It does a good job of showing how ordinary - even stupid - people might try to cope with an onslaught of the living dead, but it doesn't really bring much new to the genre.  It reminded me, occasionally, of \\"The Young Ones,\\" but it's not nearly as funny.  If you want horror mixed with comedy, try Bruce Campell's \\"Evil Dead\\"  movies or \\"Bubba Ho-Tep.\\"
B003102JDM|5|A good man cannot be harmed . . . - Socrates    But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. - Jesus Christ    There are two ways to be a serious man in the manner in which the term is understood in this movie. One way is to be recognized by society as the kind of man who can reward his friends and punish his enemies, a man of consequence, a man to be taken seriously. The other way is to be in full possession of your soul. The eponymous hero of this movie, Larry Gopnik (a physics professor played with great skill by Michael Stuhlbarg) is of the second type. To the eyes of the world, he is a timid man of little consequence. But God, who sees all things, knows otherwise and sends him sorrows so that his soul might bear fruit.     His wife leaves him for another man who, while pretending to be his friend, is secretly conspiring to get Larry denied tenure at his college. One of his students tries to bribe him into giving him a passing grade and when Larry refuses, threatens a lawsuit. His troglodyte neighbor bullies him. His teenage children, being teenage children, can see his predicament and yet are too wrapped up in their own petty concerns to give him the affection and companionship he needs. In desperation, Larry seeks out, in succession, the advise of three Rabbais. The first two try their best to help. The last, the wise Marshak who understands what is going on, offers silence.     What does Larry do? Instead of striking back, he simply absorbs the insults and cruelty. When his wife and her lover suggest he move out of his own house to a seedy motel, he quietly complies. He carries on with each situation by ascertaining the most civil, the most considerate response until, at the end of the film, things turn around and each burden resolves to a tolerably good conclusion, seemingly by itself. Mysteriously, God laid these burdens on Larry and, just as mysteriously, He lifted them. It was all fora purpose. The burdens could have been born with such grace only by a serious man. The trial is over.

0385507755|5|Despite all the controversy, the essense of this book rings true with readers.  James Frey is an incredibly talented writer, and could not have written this book without the hell he went through.  The things that were exaggerated and fabricated don't take away from the true meaning of the book and what I took away from it.  I am reading \\"My Friend Leonard\\" now and it is just as enthralling.  I cannot wait to read anything else he writes.  Everyone has to remember that he is a human being - he has faults just like the rest of us.  Nothing that has come out in the controversy takes away from his talent... I highly recommend this book.

0805079831|1|Before rating my review as unhelpful please read (if you review something negative on a political site you are usually ranked as unhelpful) I am really trying to save you some embarrassment.    I had the pleasure of meeting Ms. Klien in 2006 while she was researching for this book at the University of Oklahoma (where her sister is a professor). She is an attractive, intelligent and hardworking woman, but horribly incorrect on many issues. I was not surprised that the author of  No Logo was once again conflating free markets with corporatism and taking the ideas of free market capitalism out of context in order to make a point.    Worse still, was her representation of Dr. Milton Friedman. For instance, she paints him as disliking democracy. In reality, Dr. Friedman hated the concept of Athenian democracy, not modern democracy. Athenian democracy is seen by the vast majority of political scholars as another form of tyranny. Friedman is an advocate of republican-democracy (democratic government with checks on power for both the minority and the majority).     Klien also has a tendency to conflate Dr. Friedman's love of free markets and limited government with governmental regulation and subsidization of businesses. Corporatism is not free market capitalism, no matter how hard Klien tries to equate the too. Corporatism is when government works to enrich corporations through subsidies, special tax breaks (that competition does not receive), tariffs, and regulations. The idea is to get government to pay and protect certain favored industries.     Dr. Friedman was against that. That sort of government interference in the market (which includes socialism, communism, and corporatism) is NOT free market.    I regret now, sitting silent (my friend paid me not to argue with her) when I heard her present her research. Not, that my corrections of her errors would have done any good. Another liberal professor did take her to task when she tried to argue that Haiti was became a failed state because of neo-liberalism. He pointed out that Haiti was a failed state before neo-liberals tried to reform and remained a failed state when the socialists retook control.    That said, she has a tendency to get historical chronology out of order. Another example is her claim that Dr. Friedman supports dictatorships and that Argentina is a prime example liberalism only working if a dictatorship pushes it through. Pinochet came to power in 1973 but the Chicago boys gained influence until 1975...after the violence had ended. Real market reforms were not put in place until 1979 after the SOCIALIST dictatorship finally relented.    In reality, Pinochet preferred command control socialism (he never had any free market plan when he took control), the idea that the economy would respond to marching orders naturally appealed to the military leader. Command control of the economy was not working and the economy continued to worsen, that is when market reforms began to unfold. I should also add that in the 1980s free market economists from Harvard came down to Argentina and moved the country further toward free market capitalism, by then the country was a democracy.      For a more in depth hammering of Ms. Klien's errors, see Johan Nordberg's review here: [...]  Please read that.     I am serious when I say that Ms. Klien has distorted ideas and conflated corporatism with free market capitalism. The corporatism cited by Ms. Klien is real and it is worthy of criticism. There was no bigger critic of corporatism than Dr. Friedman, even though Ms. Klien seems to think he advocated this.    That said, be warned. If you use this book as a textbook, or a resource, or to gather points for debate you will be utterly demolished by a free market economist or advocate. She does not actually explain free market politics or economics and you will not be well prepared for their counterpoints.    By using this book as a resource, you will only offer more points as to why government is bad - which in the end was one of the central themes of Dr. Friedman.

1400079179|5|The Da Vinci Code<br /><br />The highly acclaimed Da Vinci Code (written by Dan Brown) was published by Corgi, and has been subject to much controversy due to its daring and even slightly blasphemous content.<br /><br />The New York Times best seller tackles such delicate issues as the authenticity of the Bible, as well as portraying the Church as a sinister organization, riddled with bribes, blackmail and organised crime.<br /><br />The epic murder-mystery style book begins with Robert Langdon (fans of the author may recognise him from Angels & Demons) being woken at an obscene hour by an urgent phone call. True to Dan Brown's writing formula, a significant curator at the Louvre Museum has been discovered by the authorities, dead. As a religious symbologist, Langdon was called in to examine the incongruous array of ancient symbols surrounding the recently deceased.<br /><br />As you may have deduced, the Da Vinci Code is set in contemporary Paris and throughout the book, fords the channel to Great Britain. And, after several revelations, high-speed, cinematic car-chases, and encounters with a formidable albino monk, the book reaches its climax in the heart of Westminster Abbey.<br /><br />The plot revolves around Harvard professor Robert Langdon, whose enthusiasm and determination to decipher the many codes and riddles scattered throughout the book, and keep his friends from harm's way proves vital to the intricate plotline.<br /><br />The enticingly enigmatic Sophie Neveu also plays a critical role in the plot. Being the granddaughter of Jaques Sauni&egrave;re (the recently deceased curator), she was always destined to be implicated in the post mortem. On top of this, she is also in the employment of the French Judicial Police via the cryptology department.<br /><br />As well as being Jaques Sauni&egrave;re's granddaughter, Sophie is also the sole heir to the Priory of Sion (an ancient secret society, founded to guard an ancient, sacred secret)'s key to the whereabouts of the Holy Grail. The reason for this is that Jaques Sauni&egrave;re was a significant member of the Priory. Sophie did not, however, realise this until too late, as she had not made contact with him in ten years, due to a childhood memory which still haunts her throughout the five hundred and ninety three pages of the book.<br /><br />One particular moment which embedded itself in my mind, took place at the Zurich bank. The scene's action sparked off when the volatile bank manager (Andre Vernet) makes the rash decision to aid and abet the two fugitives (Langdon and Sophie) in evading the clutches of the French authorities. A series of transfixing events ensue, each one more unanticipated and unforeseeable than the last.<br /><br />Told in third person through the eyes of Robert Langdon, this gives the book a flavour of realism and makes the reader feel more involved in the events that unfold. There are short periods throughout (a few paragraphs), when the story is seen via Sophie Neveu's point of view, but these instances are few and far between. This switch in perspective contributes to the book, by allowing the reader to observe events from multiple points of view.<br /><br />The narrator is constant throughout, but a few chapters are told in flashback style. Several events are related by characters in the book themselves i.e. reminiscing.<br /><br />The language used is vivid, and the author's vocabulary is vast and varied. Due to the nature of the book, a variety of technical terms are used to enhance the reader's comprehension of the plot. Don't worry however, as the terms and diagrams are always reader-friendly and nearly always explained in further detail in parenthesis or a side-paragraph. The author has one noticeable tendency though; repeating verbs. For example, Dan Brown describes Sophie's Smart-Car as being \\"gunned\\" forward repeatedly in neighbouring paragraphs. This caught my attention, in a bad way. The author's lucrative amounts of technicalexplanation more than compensate for the somewhat necessary lack of poetic description.<br /><br />The book is awash with riddles and puzzles, and the prominently English dialogue is occasionally mingled with French. Which is kind of inevitable, considering half of the book is set in France.<br /><br />The subtlety of language is used heavily in the many puzzles and anagrams laced throughout the book, as well as the author playing on natural human preconceptions. Bearing this in mind, I'd say that the book was written with adult readers in mind, and could scarcely be comprehended by a reader with a low attention span. The Da Vinci Code is, for the most part, an earnest book, that tackles some earnest issue. However, the text is occasionally spiced up by humour, usually in the form of a witty quip or flippant remark from an exasperated Robert Langdon. The text size of the Corgi edition of the Da Vinci Code (the edition I have in front of me) compliments the book perfectly; a small, yet legible size, which confident and independent readers should have no trouble coping with. Also, due to its length, it is printed on wafer-thin pages- rather like the Bible. This is also a congruent decision, as the plot practically revolves around the bible and Christianity.<br /><br />Whilst reading the book, you might get the impression that the plot progresses at a crawling pace, however, this feeling is only emulated, because the plot consists of several intricately intertwined events, each unfolding in fast succession.<br /><br />The book is a welcome mix of fantasy, reality and myth, and could therefore potentially be enjoyed by a wide a range of readers.f poetic description. <br />The book is awash with riddles and puzzles, and the prominently English dialogue is occasionally mingled with French.

B00CVCG87O|5|I'm really not a metal person.<br /><br />That's OK, because this isn't really a metal album. It might be tagged that way, but I'm starting to think genre's just a way to organize things by something other than quality so that journalists can write about them and salesmen can sell them. You can throw in a lot of genre words to describe \\"Altered State\\"--if pressed, I'd say it's a complicated and beautiful prog-rock construction with a fine metallic sheen. But those are just words. And as Elvis Costello (among others) famously said, \\"Writing about music's like dancing about architecture.\\" The words dart around the music, giving an idea of what it is and what it isn't, but at the end of the day, it is what it is. I can say the musicianship is dense and impeccable and chunky and delicate and beautiful. The songs are just plain well-built--they careen between dissonance and organization in much the same way that, say, Radiohead's \\"Pyramid Song\\" resolves itself. And the vocals are clean and soaring and glorious, a great big fricking eagle that soars peacefully one moment and then dives shrieking into the metallic canyons below. But the most important thing I can say is: you just gotta hear it.<br /><br />I stumbled across this band accidentally; I went to see a Katatonia show because I'd accidentally stumbled across THEM a while back, and TesseracT was one of three groups opening. I was less than pleased to find out there were THREE opening acts--it was a work night, and I wasn't looking forward to making it a late night--but once I heard Ashe O'Hara's vocals, I was like, OK, maybe this isn't a bad thing. (They were great to see live, by the way--he's new to the band and was obviously just having a blast getting to the U.S. for the first time and touring and playing shows.) And the songs--it was that rarest of things, when you hear something once and want to hear it again, and you hear it again and want to keep listening. Listening to TesseracT is like looking at Owen Wilson's nose--there are all these weird and cool angles, and you just want to figure out what the hell is going on with all of it, so you check it out again, and you still can't figure it out, even when it's RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF YOU, but damn if it isn't compelling.<br /><br />I'm sure those Amazon song snippets don't do it justice. Heck, LISTENING to it won't do it justice, if you only do it once. You're gonna have to put on some headphones and crank it up and spend some time with it. Just trust me on this.son's nose--there are all these weird and cool angles, and you just want to figure out what the hell is going on with all of it, so you check it out again, and you still can't figure it out, even when it's RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF YOU, but damn if it isn't compelling.<br /><br />I'm sure those Amazon song snippets don't do it justice.

B00005NTJK|5|This album is often overlooked, being between Stand Up and Aqualung. However, it is very underrated and an excellent album. It is a bit darker than previous albums, but it makes it different and more enjoyable. Just buy it along with the rest of Tull's albums.

0740748475|5|Calvin and Hobbes is the quintessential book on understanding boys.  Never have I had a comic that I can relate to with imagination and character more than Calvin and Hobbes.  I remember being a young kid and eagerly awaiting the opportunity to steal the comic pages from the paper from Dad to read what my little ADD friend and his tiger were up to.  They provided countless hours of insight and joy to my childhood and being able to revisit them in my older age is a real treat.  This collection is very nice and a very attractive set to add to your book collection.  I look forward to sharing them with my children when they are old enough to appreciate them.
B00BRUQ7ZY|1|In Islam to believe God has a Son is a major sin, thus Jesus Christ, though looked upon as divine in Islam, cannot be the Son of God which Christians of course believe.<br /><br />This book written by a Muslim is consistent with the fact that Islam does not believe God/Allah can have a son and thus is truly biased

1609611543|2|I don't know about this. I'm  sure there are some people that wheat bread will cause bad health, but I believe in moderation. If you are &#34;FAT&#34; cut back by up to  50% of your food intake. That is what I did several years ago. I went from 225 to 185 by just eating about half of what I normally ate and it did not very long to loose it.  If you are sedate very little food is needed,  but you must eat a balanced diet for good health.

B005V5WBFG|5|Easy to install
B00008AWON|5|First off I would warn against comparing this album to other releases for the sole reason that this is it's own album! So many people have said \\"Oh it's not Without You I'm nothing or Black Market Music.\\" DUH!!! This is a step in a different direction. That's what good bands do, they explore and experiment. Placebo is no different.    With that said, I have to admit this is my favorite record by Placebo. From start to finish nothing but beauty escapes the speakers. It is very diverse, almost eclectic, but very \\"together\\" at the same time. The album is laden with synths and drum loops, yet you'll find more than a couple rockers reminiscent of earlier Placebo here as well. Sleeping With Ghosts is never boring. It's a journey that takes you through many highs and lows alike. The signature sound is still here, sex drugs and eyeliner, yet it feels more mature. The mood of this album is just perfect. Every track is a standout, and if you asked, I wouldn't be able to say which is my favorite, or even narrow it down to a top three. If you like Placebo, or just good music, then do yourself a favor; BUY THIS ALBUM!!!

0811826848|4|Years in the making, the long awaited &quot;Anthology&quot; by the Beatles is sure to please the casual and diehard fan.  The surviving Beatles tell their own story, with printed excerpts of interviews with John Lennon telling his tale.  The text is eminently readable, with the book divided into year-by-year sections.  Pictures abound, many never before published, showing the Beatles in concert, at home, and in the studio.  Colorful layouts add texture and scope to the book.  There are a few drawbacks: the coffee-table size format does not allow the reader to curl up with the book for long periods of time; many sixties-era Beatles documents are printed over text or pictures, making many of them difficult to read; and there are few captions with the pictures, forcing the reader to flip back and forth to the index to identify the photos.  All in all, however, one cannot argue with the importance of the book as a document of the sixties and a document of the Beatles.  Young adults interested in music or the sixties should also find this an essential read.

B000083C49|4|Str Trk 4 : Whales    The crew of the innrprize are on sporks planet and they hear that there is this big piece of poo in space that is headed to earth and is going to blow it up a lot. this is like vag'na from the first movie but instead of a mind melt they need whales. Spork is still out of it and is wearing a bathrobe and they all decide that they are going to hang a u-turn around the sun to go back in time to 1980s where there are lots of whales cause there aren't any humpbacks in the future. THIS WORKS! They end up in San Fran and land their invisible plane in the park and someone sees them and is all like \\"WHAAAAA\\" but he's a bum so noone will believe him. they hang out in San Fran for awhile and spork makes a headband so he's all like Rambo now and kills a punk rocker on the bus cause his music is TOO LOUD! Kork flirts with this 80s chick and Scotchy speaks into a mouse and then everyone is freaked out that Checkoff is a russian. Spork swims with the whales and then they go back to the future and the big thing is like \\"FINE!\\" and then it leaves.
B000ZN802W|4|What I know or care about the life of McCandless is utterly contingent on Penn's movie. Thus, however close a physical resemblance Emile Hersch has to the 'real' guy, we have an endearing, gritty, open, call it naive,guy, on a journey of self-discovery. He acted like a teener, so I was surpised to find he was 23. I willed the spirited adventurer on in the hope that his quest for 'Truth', over love and its attending virtues, would help him survive his 100 days in the wilderness. The previous two years on the road have been a full on exposure to life beyond the suburbs and family. It's not the film's province to investigate the motives for his radical disavowal of capitalist 'trappings', sustaining friendships, and rebuttal of his family(who don't seem more messed up than most. Eddie Vedder's emotive baritone fits well, echoing our heroe's moves with subtle understatment: some of the best work I've heard from him. It seems only a short distance into the wild before he encounters the body of an abandoned bus which, providentially, provides the shelter which will finally entomb him. It's not the kind of 'wild' protection I'd anticipated. Didn't he have a tent? Whatever, as the food stocks dwindle and the belt draws tighter, his ignorance of any smattering of bush knowledge is painfully evident. Guilt over wasting a moose. Get over it. You eat cooked,flyblown meat when desperate. At least some of it. I've had to. And no attempt to see what fish the river offered. And, oddly, no wondering or wandering along the track the bus must have arrived on. A doomed trajectory. This guy will perish.We're inexorably drawn to the fatal hours, the collapse, the scribbled epitaph, expiration and heavenward gaze. No matter what license the Penn team may have taken with 'fact', the 'truth' of the movie is satisfying, if not for his grieving family. The improbable bear scene, near the last day, was wonderfully eloquent. Wilderness. Yes. Where is it? In the mind? Really! Out there? Yes.
1933633867|5|New ways of looking at economics, slavery, governent, war, society, etc.<br /><br />I am reading it a second time. And likely will a third.<br /><br />Highest recommendation.
B00CL0J99K|5|The movie was a great addition to the series with lots of action and I love the gag reel.<br /><br />The product has an actual digital copy that can be loaded on itunes, not one of those fake cloud copies that you can only watch if you have wifi.  That's a big plus for me and makes the difference between buying the DVD or not.  The Blue-ray was flawless and the DVD was snagged by my kids as soon as it arrived.  Everyone's happy.

B000001EAQ|3|I'll go out on a limb - POP actually contains U2's best music since 'All I Want is You' - namely found in the two songs 'Do You Feel Loved' and 'Gone'. But 'Discotheque' is too much like &quot;let's do Fly all over again so we can make a cool video&quot;. 'Staring at the Sun' is too much like Achtung Baby, (which is too full of uninspired 'sing-along' melodies for my taste). 'Mofo' reminds me of 'Wire' in its all out intensity, but the comparison ends there. 'If God Will Send His Angels' is a lot like the feel of some of the stuff on Passengers and is a pretty decent song musically. The rest of the songs are listenable but not terribly noteworthy. However, my biggest complaint is with the lyrics on this album. It seems Bono can't stop saying 'Jesus' and 'God' and usually the references to the cornerstones of Christianity are less than positive. I used to admire Bono's stand for Christianity and open declaration of scripture and its truths. (Most noteably on the War album). Some of the lyrics on POP can make a lot of Christians flinch, as they are dangerously close to sacrilege. A person who has a 'grudge' toward God might actually feel comfortable with some of the lyrics. That's why I cannot consider POP a 'good' album. POP is not a fun album. In many ways, it is U2's darkest album. It has very few positive vibes. And very little truth. If you're looking for The Answer: listen to War - not POP.

B009XIXVU6|3|I wanted to like this book, because I loved both of Hosseini's other books, but this one fell short.  It is almost like a collection of short stories, though the characters connect and there are some over arching story elements.  I mainly just wanted to get it over with.  I enjoyed it overall, but wouldn't read it again, and I did not find the story satisfying.

B004A94FE4|5|Let me preface by stating that I have only worn them 2 times, after two long runs. I can't speak to the science behind them (as there isn't much yet) but I will relay my opinions thus far. I am appr. 6'2&#34; 200# these fit me very well, just about perfect. They appear to be made of tough material and have great tough stitching at the seams. Post workout they feel great, keep the muscles warm and &#34;snug&#34; and have a good amount of compression. I can't say that I have seen a huge change in &#34;recovery time&#34; but i have only worn them twice and my longest run was only a fairly tough 10 miler. The real test will be post-marathon.
B00L8OBCQS|3|The blood effects in this movie are almost cartoonish. Everyone in ancient Greece and Persia must have had incredibly high blood pressure. Cuts result in fountains of CG blood. Numerous decapitations, several rape scenes, and more boobies than the original make this one fun for the whole family! Plus, there's a wonderful sex scene between two rival naval commanders. The exact same scenario helped resolve the Battle of Midway in world war 2.<br /><br />It's not historically accurate, other than the fact that Greek and Persian navies did exist and fight each other. As long as you weren't planning on showing this to your 9th grade history class, or doing research for a &#34;History of Western Civilizations&#34; class, you could probably just understand that it's a movie, and an OK one. Not terrible, not great.<br /><br />The plot goes something like this: Hermaphracleetes (or whatever his name was) is the Greek naval commander, and must fight of a much larger force of Persian ships led by Princess Boobula (or something). They fight, they hump, they fight, someone else humps, someone else fights, the end. I've seen cinemax films at 2am on Friday that had more plot. However, there is something appealing about watching freedom fight against tyranny, few fight against many, and boobs.<br /><br />If you've got a few bucks to spend, enjoy this one. It's mediocre.
B00ELE8D4Q|3|Sounds like outtakes from her last couple of dance oriented, vocoder music.  Not that there's anything wrong with that, ... but I really expected a lot better.
B00CH87HF4|4|For the most part this game is pretty good. The graphics are fantastic and are the best feature of the game. The storyline isn't bad but isn't one that goes into great depth (now I’m not that far into the game). The playability if very good overall. The one thing that's disappointing is the fact that it's very repetitive, and you have to repeat the same areas to level or you die. Now, if you purchase the upgrades that are available to you they're very well worth it and will help you immensely. The biggest gripe I have is the fact that there’s not a way to know what areas are for what level or skill (at least not that I’ve found). Naturally it stinks that you have to constantly pay money in order to advance or repeat the same areas indefinitely. Personally I rather pay once to be able to play a game and be able to advance with the option to buy upgrades to just be invincible over having to constantly pay money just to be able to do the basics within the game but that’s how they make their money.<br /><br />Overall a great game but, as with anything, it has its downfalls.
B009UX2YAC|5|This is a good game. I always play. This game is better than temple run 2 I hope there is a update for it soon.

B00005JMJ4|1|This movie rates only a little higher than my &quot;all time worst&quot; - and that was &quot;Up the Sandbox&quot; with Barbra Streisand... yuck!  It is also the second movie which pained me so much watching it that I could not bear to inflict the entire thing upon myself.  I walked out of Up... this one I just hit the &quot;stop&quot; button.  No way this movie could or should have been seriously considered for best picture.  Same with Bill Murray for Best Actor.  Much as I love the guy in other movies (Groundhog, Knew too Little) I had a hard time believing he was &quot;serious&quot; about this role.  The more the movie went on, the more it seemed that he would really rather be &quot;someplace else&quot; (not trying to act the horrible script, for example).  The humor was unfathomable and had a mystic, &quot;should I laugh here?&quot; quality to it.  <br />I despised the agony I felt watching this movie.  Don't buy it, rent it, or go anywhere near it.  If you do, I warned you!!!

0140277447|5|More than 60 years have passed since US attacked Japan with atomic bombs, and Japanese have claimed them as the victims of the use of nuclear weapons from then on. After I read Ms Chang's book, I begin to believe that at that time Japanese did deserve the bombs, and the justice has been done. <br />In his review T.T.Saga said \\"I don't have thorough academical knowledge about this historical matter,\\" then based on what foundation did he draw the conclusion that \\"this book is only scandalous one?\\" The only explaination I can come up with is that either T.T.Saga drank too much saki or he shares the ideology with those excuted Japanese war criminals after WWII.  <br />

Then im sure they would stop supporting trash like gay unit,dipset, lil john, bowwow, t.i.,Mike jones, Paul wall,feminem, etc...Anyways back to Nas's \\"illmatic\\"? What can be said, that already haven't, on most reviews? Its a classic album, sadly we dont hear alot of stuff like this no more.
B000000OSG|4|GN'R takes a more lavish and full approach to their attack here. There seems to be more of an Axl presence than on appetite. It's a very big change, but it works. Al just depends if you like your GN'R to sound more like the Stooges or more like Led Zeppelin. I prefer the Stooges.
B005ZOBNOI|5|This book is a wonderful insight into the world of a cancer patient.  Haze Grace Lancaster has a tumor in her lungs and is terminally ill. Augustus had cancer and now has a prosthetic leg. He wants nothing more than to leave his mark on the world and that he does on Hazel Grace 's heart.<br /><br />The book has some ups and downs. I highly suggest that you do not read this book in front of people if you have a tendency to get emotional while reading a sad book. As I have learned while reading The Fault in Our Stars. Amazing for young adults but not for twelve year olds. A twelve year old might not understand the sadness you go through when losing a loved one.<br /><br />I read this to more deeply understand the agony and sorrow of cancer and how bad this is for many people who have lost someone to cancer.  My friend recently battled Leukemia last year ending up in the ICU quite frequently during this battle.  I hope you realize how precious life is.
B0000062FL|5|This album, along with the first and third Santana albums, is Carlos at his best. I consider this original line up of Santana's band to be the best. Songs like &quot;Incident at Neshabur&quot; and &quot;Se A Cabo&quot;  burn with a firey Latin intensity. There is GREAT singing and Hammond organ  playing from Gregg Rolie on just about every song. Another highlight is  &quot;Hope You're Feeling Better&quot;, a more &quot;straight-ahead&quot;  rocker-less &quot;Latin-sounding&quot; than most Santana songs. Also, the  live bonus tracks are a real treat. The remastered sound quality is  PRISTINE on the studio tracks- a real treat to hear that great Santana  percussion so crystal-clear. While you listen to this album, marvel over  how each song has such a &quot;live&quot; feel to it, not the sterility of  many studio albums. It almost sounds as if the band is plugged in and  playing live at your house! I can't recommend this highly enough-as well as  Santana I and III. Do yourself a favor and get them ALL!
B004J64QSI|5|I use this as a &#34;soundtrack&#34; so the normal 2 CD set is on one DVD so we can listen to the entire play - with or without watching it.
B000SQJ27I|4|La Radiolina is a fun album.  It has a very live feel to it.  I'm still not sure how I feel about it.  Most of the songs are <2 minutes, and are really acoustic-guitar heavy.  Definitely different than previous albums, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.
B00G9B1MEM|3|The app crashes on my phone, but it works great on my kindle. Definitely would give five stars if I could play it on my phone as well.
B007885IJU|2|I'm a big Neil Young fan.  Neil's web page has a big bunch of recommendations of new folk artists, and I've tried some that are quite good.  The Lumineers is not on that list.  Oh, well, what the heck: Neil and I are old folks.  But what's old when both your politics and the music you've always loved are progressive?<br /><br />The Lumineers have fairly clever lyrics, and the simplicity of the songs is affecting; rather like Neil Young's C - G - D variations.  However, there was one thing I couldn't get out of my head, and that was the -- what was it, exactly?  Was it insincerity?  Let me put it this way.  When I hear the vocals, I get a very uncomfortable feeling, as if the band is trying to sound authentic but they know they're just trying to sound authentic.  Because what is authentic any more?  What is folk music?  Some bands (Mumford & Sons comes to mind) seem to encourage the belief that if you hear a banjo, it's folk music.<br /><br />So I guess that's it: I can't really believe this music.  It comes from the head and not the heart.
B007IXWKUK|5|The best book series EVER!!  I totally loved it.  I read it twice so far and plan on reading it again.

B003A4IFGY|1|I like a lot of Petty's music, however I found this CD to be a lot more like \\"folk\\" rock.  Not a whole lot of good guitar licks or solid lyrical charm like there was on previous CD's.  I last bought the Last DJ and I liked that a fair amount, but I don't like Mojo at all, in fact, I sold it a week after I bought it.

B004GYY714|5|Great choice of stations, I love the comedy tv programmes adapted for radio, on the ROCK CLASSIC COMEDY RADIO station and horror, sci-fi and thriller radio stations, just tap on the magnifying glass and type in the station you want and if it's on there it will bring it up, or give you an alternative, if you buy the pro version (I think it cost 99p) you can even record the programmes, it is without a doubt worth the 5 stars that I gave it.
B000LTAY1U|4|Item arrived on time. The watch is good looking but was a little disappointed with the size of the watch, its kind a small on my wrist, My mistake I did not actually look in to detail regarding the size. Its has an automatic movement and was on sale. I am keeping it. No problem.<br />Actually it looked nice on my wife's wrist compared to mine
B00G9U7R2O|3|Definitely not as good as the first one! Still cute, but a little disappointed. Would recommend if there is nothing else out to watch.
B003KRJNBW|2|This movie had the right idea, but left far to many unanswered questions. I was expecting a lot more based on the previews and descriptions, but I was left with a film that was not unique. Denzel Washington was amazing as usual, but sadly, overall, The Book of Eli wasn't anything special. Just another tale about the world will end one day and reveal what savage beasts we truly are.
B00J0LH16Q|5|Very good.

B00EV4EUT8|5|Absolutely love this movie.  I have watched it several times. It is definitely a keeper.  Would definitely recommend to others.
0385534639|5|If someone had asked me to rate this book three-fourths of the way through, I am positive that I would not be so favorable.<br /><br />Then I got to the end.<br /><br />And I finally got it.<br /><br />You know all about this book already, don't you?<br /><br />  \\"The Circus arrives without warning.\\"<br /><br />Indeed. This book takes place in a Circus, for the most part. Le Cirque des Rêves (The Circus of Dreams) is a magnificent circus, open only at night, and made up of tents full of wonders and amazingness that I can't even begin to describe to you. And I won't try-Erin Morgenstern is a fantastic artist who writes the way dreams are made.<br /><br />The prose is beautiful. The descriptions are vibrant and made me feel as if I were there-and that's kind of the point.<br /><br />From the outset, you realize that there are basically three storylines going on within the book: the Circus itself, which includes Celia and Marco and the competition that they are involved in, a boy named Bailey, who seems as though he doesn't really fit into the story, and you-as a patron, experiencing some of the wondrous sights and sounds and tastes of the Circus.<br /><br />Of course, I'm oversimplifying it, because each one of these storylines is very detailed and intricate, and it is downright confusing.<br /><br />Until it isn't.<br /><br />There are so many things that I want to tell you about this book, but the number one thing I want to say is keep reading. This isn't a fast read by any means. It's all so real, so much. And every single inconsequential thing comes into play. Erin Morgenstern is a master storyteller-she's simply brilliant. And I cannot begin to understand the way even the most trivial statement made in passing proved to be absolutely monumental. I'm utterly blown away.<br /><br />I don't usually like the film adaptation of books, but in this case, I am crazy excited. Summit has lots of brilliant material to work with, and I hope they do a good job. It has the potential to be amazing.<br /><br />You follow me-you know I have to tell you about the romance. I'm hesitant to say anything about it but feel that I have to. This book is built up to be an epic, all-consuming romance, and that's true. But you don't know it until the last third of the book.<br /><br />But ohmigod when you feel it-it's just...yeah. Epic. Sweeping. Swoon.<br /><br />The things Marco says. The fact that he associates her with love poems and Shakespearian Sonnets. His ability to be himself with her. Gosh. I don't even know what else to say.<br /><br />All of the characters, though shrouded in mystery, are distinct and multi-dimensional. The parts of them that are exposed to us are real and leave you begging for another glimpse. Though I wanted to get to know them more, I didn't ever feel that they were lacking in character or authenticity. While I had many *gasp! I can't believe that just happened* moments, I never felt like they were acting OOC. I love that about this book.<br /><br />I also love Widget.<br /><br />A lot.<br /><br />There are a few things that I didn't love. Being confused most of the book is definitely one of them. I hated Hector and feel almost as strongly about Alexander, but I'm not sure. I also would like to have understood slightly more about the aging of the characters, especially the original attendees of the Midnight Dinners, and what will happen to everyone who is still involved with the Circus. Of course I wanted more ha! Though everything came together at the end (and splendidly so), I just don't know that the amount of confusion and wth?!? was necessary.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil any more of the plot for you than I already have, and telling you anything else really would do that. There are a few things that I wish that I had known before I started reading, so I want to share. I wish that I knew something about Tarot Cards. I know absolutely nothing, and even looking them up didn't offer me very much insight to a partof the book that I felt to be significant. I wish I hadn't been totally in the dark about that. Also, I wish I had written down the timeline, or paid more attention to it. There were several instances that I found myself flipping back and forth, trying to remember where they were and when it was. I very much would like to read this book again, and when I do, I will be taking notes lol Also, I want to tell you what is probably the most important thing:<br /><br />If you don't know what the hell is going on throughout most of the book, that's okay. It'll make sense eventually. Just enjoy the ride. And trust-you will.<br /><br />You know me and stars. If I could give half-stars, I'd give it 4-1/2. But I'm rounding up for the sheer brilliance of the story, for the awesome imagery and detail, and for Widget, whom I love with a fiery passion ::swoonysigh::.more attention to it.

0151013047|2|Mohsin Hamid's The Reluctant Fundamentalist is a story within a story. One is the clever telling of the other.    At a café in Pakistan, a Pakistani man tells his story to an American man. The men are strangers. We learn about the Pakistani man through his narrative. The American remains a mystery man throughout. In paragraphs between parts of the Pakistani man's story are hints about the American man, the purpose of his encounter with the Pakistani man, and perhaps even the Pakistani man's purpose in telling his story.    In this short novel, the Pakistani man tells of coming to America to attend Princeton and then work for high wages at a New York company. He falls in love with an American who's in love with a dead person. But she's rich and gets him into all the right places. He's on his way to living the high life.    Then, surprise, he decides on 9/11 that he's disillusioned with America. And he decides that America is that big, bad, obnoxiously rich and power-hungry nation that waves its flag as if it can't get over itself and is stuck in some black-and-white movie. He smiles at the sight of the destruction of the Twin Towers.    I wouldn't have bothered reading more. But I had read so many reviews of The Reluctant Fundamentalist that were favorable and praised its suspense. I figured something must be about to happen that would justify all this, and it was such a short book I stuck with it.    The Pakistani man continues to describe his disillusionment with America and his doomed love affair. He goes on to explain why he is back in Pakistan and what he is doing there.     Where was the suspense? The mystery American?    The Pakistani man speaks of the necessity of knowing history but obviously knows little history himself. He complains more than once about the awful Americans invading Afghanistan for no reason and of Pakistan helping America but the Americans refusing to take their side when they go to war with India.     He, of course, doesn't mention the Taliban in Afghanistan and their promise of another 9/11. He also forgets (I don't know how since he lived there) that Pakistan and India have been going at it with each other for years and that this war with India was a frequent occurrence.    So the Pakistani man's story is told, and then comes the ambiguous end. My guess is one of two possibilities.    I can't recommend this book.
B00F522C7C|5|I love the movie, I think it is very cute that I will actually sit and watch with the kids.
B001EA4M7M|3|It was OK. I'm glad I watched it, but I probably wont watch this version again. Maybe it would have helped if the Mr. Darcy were more handsome?
0804106304|5|This is probably one of the best books I have ever read.  I think it is  very influential and shows how we try so hard not to be like our parents  but we really are just like them. A lot of people could not follow the book  but you really just have to pay attention to it and it's not hard.  I  really enjoyed reading it because I remember when it came out on video when  I was younger and didn't understand it but went out and bought it over the  summer. Good Reading!!
B00FAPF5U0|3|This game doesn't go great for everyone who doesn't want to spend their hard earned cash on a game. I think it is addictive, but only if the use in game earned digital coins
B0094BB4TW|5|I can't say how much fun I have had with this app on my device.  It has made Facebook fun again not a chore lie it was on my computer.  Now I am able to check out my Facebook friends anywhere I wish to and have the net available.  I can enjoy posts now ans leave my comments to friends and foes any time.  I am at last no longer lost to my online friends.  I know you will enjoy Facebook more with this app on you device.  Well worth the time and memory used to get this app! As for memory not much used so go ahead GET IT!!!!!
B00001MXXH|5|High school senior Ferris decides to play hookie from school by faking an illness.  How many kids haven't done that?  What happens after his parents go to work becomes one of the best adventures ever including a trip to a Cubs game and dodging the school principal.
0812550757|4|I was expecting this book to be similar to Ender's Game.  It turned out this book was nothing like Ender's Game but was still a very good read.
B002VPE1PW|4|This case does not fit the Kindle 2g. It is way too big, but i can still use it for other things or with my kindle but it will have extra room.
B001EQ5ZJK|5|I have only re-read a few books in my lifetime.  I have found myself re-reading this book twice in the last year and have recently picked it up again. For whatever reason it makes me...hopeful.
B00H99DBFQ|5|Been using this thing more often than I thought I would. Partially charges an iPad 2, but can charge my Galaxy S3 several times over without needing a recharge. Got a friend to buy one, as well.
B001NPDCFQ|1|Large portions of this, specifically all Judy Garland's singing, is missing. Very disappointing! The picture is grainy but considering when this was originally made I have no problem with picture quality but missing sound is not acceptable.
0439023521|4|Highly anticipated book, and I wasn't let down - I wasn't so drawn in that I felt I couldn't ever put it down, but I did absolutely enjoy it and can't wait to read more and see the movie.
B007XIC1GI|5|Even if you don't like manson you will still enjoy this book. It reminds me of the good days of awesome hard rock and ask the juicy stories you want to hear not the sad excuse of what is considered rock today
B00DQAM5LI|4|Gotta say I have stayed away from many modern day metal bands or whatever they label metal today.  I am familiar with these guys,  I have a liked a few songs in the past.  Not a big fan,  but I could definitely see/hear the talent of these musicians, real guitar skill and good vocals!  That's hard to come by today.  I always felt too old to be listening to this band...lol. Well,  sorry kids, Daddy likes this album, it's groovy!  At 43,  I grew up with the metal gods and I haven't been impressed by much since then.  This album is pretty damn good!  You can hear their influences in their songs yet they have a great new feel.  This is the kind of album I wish Metallica would put out. Great riffs, great production, awesome old school vibe.  Grab my Bengay and my walker, this old man's headin for the mosh pit!
B009PQ5Y4M|5|This is a sci-fi film with all the nuances and details you could ever ask for in an epic movie. I love for the compelling story, the amazing visuals, the world the viewers are immersed into, and the characters! The acting is generally really amazing! Great movie.
B00EDY5KTA|5|This is the first Disney album I have bought in years.  It is nice to have great music again.  Reminds me of Beauty and the Beast and The Little Mermaid.  My girls and I have been singing along in the car to the music which is a real treasure.
B00F3VOL38|5|If you're a fan and love the story of the Beatles, this is five stars.  If you love the other Beatles anthologies, you'll love this.  If you're a casual fan, especially if you don't remember reel-to-reel recording, probably not.  The sound is often a bit too '60s-ish in terms of quality - particularly the interviews.  The musical material is mostly available elsewhere in better form, or not worth the search except for a Beatle-phile.
B00377V2M8|5|This movie was recommended to me by a fellow musician who has watched it 5 times and says it is her favorite music documentary.  I agree, and will watch several times myself!  Very well done film!
B00DUGCLY4|5|I have played this game on my Facebook and it still has that challenge.<br />Anyone looking for a hard puzzle game then I recommend this.
B000BW7QWW|5|After watching the Firefly series I wanted more. I was so sad that the show was canceled. Firefly could have gone on for many more hilarious, heartwarming, and action-packed seasons. So when I found out about this movie, my heart sang. And when I watched Serentiy, it did not disappoint. This is an incredible film.  And it is not like an extended episode of Firefly, it is something different entirely. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll need an antacid. I highly recommend watching the Firefly series before enjoying this movie. And enjoy it you will.
0316224588|3|Well, I'll agree wth most reviewers and applaud the return of Rankin's John Rebus character. Very nice to drag the old geezer (okay, not so old, but getting up there in years) out of retirement for another baffling bunch of murders. But unlike waht some are saying, this is not quite the return to form I hoped for, certainly not the top form Rankin has shown us in the past. The story starts off a bit slow but after picking up steam --- and accumulating more characters and suspects --- becomes one of those impossible to put down Rankin novels. That said, I thought the ending was very weak; both anti-climactic and troubling. I really expected a bigger bang, or at least something less morally ambiguous. I also did not like the inclusion of Malcolm Fox from Rankin's non-Rebus \\"The Complaints\\" series (okay, only 2 books, but that almost counts for a series) in the sub-plot of this novel. I felt that this \\"complaints\\" angle was both awkward and poorly executed. Instead of being a somewhat likeable protagonist in one book, Rankin turns Fox into an obsessed, annoying cop with a bizarre grudge. If anything, his presence in this book was distracting, if not annoying.<br /><br />But one of things that I love about Rankin novels, the musical references, are in abundance once again. Starting with the mention of the late great Jackie Leven in the opening pages (which has relevance to this book's title) to the many James Page-inspired Led Zeppelin song titles that pepper the pages, and many other album and artist/band name droppings, this evokes many smiles for my music-loving soul. In addition to the music bits (and yes, Rebus is still playing discs on a turntable!), this novel has many other good suspenseful and funny moments. I think most Rankin/Rebus fans will be quite pleased with this new installment. But for my tastes, this one won't rank with his best efforts.
B0030IIYYS|5|My 2 kids like this more than the original one [[ASIN:B0030IIZ4M Toy Story]] and that's not to take anything away from that one. This movie makes life easier as a parent. Get it. You won't be disappointed.
043599445X|5|Cheap and good exactly like the textbooks that they give at school. The official ib guide. Worth every penny spent.
B00192KCQ0|1|This is Metallica's best album since The Black Album.  Too bad it is mastered so poorly(loudly).  This album has lost almost all dynamic range due to clipping.
B000001GBJ|5|lovely, whimsical music that can carry you away to another place...a Secret Garden :)
B000089RVX|4|And that something is Evanescence. The best compliment I could give them is that they are one of the few bands being played in rotation on the top 40 (thanks to the single 'Bring Me To Life') that are actually interesting and fresh. Even though 'Bring Me To Life' has them labeled as a female-fronted Linkin Park (due in part to Paul McCoy's guest vocals), they simply surpass those comparisons on this disc. &quot;Fallen&quot; is just one of those CD's that is solid all the way through. Amy Lee has a voice that is nothing short of amazing. She carries each song and sings her lyrics with such emotion, conviction and frailty. She is definitely the best female vocalist to come onto the nu-metal scene. She is so good that she covers up the less-than-stellar musicianship presented on here. Not to say that the band is untalented, they are competent, but just nothing that matches the potency of Lee's vocals. She is definitely the reason this band is where they are today. This album has something for everyone; from the hard-rockers 'Whisper' and 'Going Under' to the highly emotional ballads of 'My Immortal' and 'Hello,' Evanescence have all the bases covered and hit all of the right notes. It's hard to not get into this CD. They possess a very likeable sound coupled with stunning vocals and personal lyrics. Definitely one of the better new bands to emerge this year.
B00IUBM8PQ|4|A good follow-on to The Hunger Games, the film definitely appealed to my tween, who has read all the books. She was entertained and the storyline kept her engaged.<br /><br />Personally, I did not like the &#34;ending.&#34; I don't like cliff-hanger endings. But those who have bought into the franchise would probably enjoy the obvious promise of more...
B009UX2YAC|5|The app works great.I would totally buy this app if I were you if you haven`t already.If this is your first time playing or actually any time, then I got to tell you this is WAY better than temple run ,one or two. You can play this in the car or at home. Even when your on a bumpy road -you do not need to tilt your devise to collect coins and you won't get eaten.This is a family orientated app that won't give the little sibling nightmares and will let you buy boosts with money you earn in the game. The only downside is the adds,they big you all the time but you get used to it.:) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)
B00BJA2VFW|4|Works good on my lower-end tablet. Game has nice graphics, fun gameplay, and decent music. I like the option  to play with or without time limits, and the ability to build houses in the village.
B0018RWMNM|4|This review is for the Blue Ray transfer.  In general the picture quality is passible to good comparing to a DVD.  It is certainly not up to the Blue Ray standard.  The problem is with the evening scenes.  The picture quality is poor and full of snowy artifacts all over the screen worse than a poor quality DVD. It can be distracting at times.  Fortunately most of the evening scenes are short.  It is a disappointment.  However; I would still buy the disc for the movie.  It is a great captivating mini-series.  The movie deserves a 5 star rating.  The 3 1/2 - 4 star rating is for the disk.
B0009RCPY8|5|This was in great shape and less than if I bought it at Best Buy.  I loved the Ghostbuster movies.  I'm glad I can now replace my old VHS tape with the DVD of the movies.
B0001Z53F6|5|Wow! Tommy in 5.1 lossless! I thought I knew Tommy-holy socks! It left me wirth chills down my spine. Into high res audio anyway. Wow thats all I can say!
B001NLL93W|5|Can't put the books down. Such a intriguing story, very well told. I love the supernatural element, but that it's not cheesy and not another story based solely on vampires or zombies.
B007C12RDS|5|Originally stumbled upon this randomly...yet, it has become an absolute favorite! Gorgeously staged and acted immersion into another time and place, yet dealing with universal human issues--social, economic, romantic, gender-related. Highly recommended for all ages.
B00A8ECU24|5|My seven year old loves this game and I get into it with her as well. :)))
1591841666|5|A great person to purchase from.  No issues.  Product actually arrived sooner than expected.  I would recommend this book to anyone in sales.
B00371QQ0M|5|Dune fans will love the quality of this Blu-Ray. Very sci-fi
B005K17RU0|5|Works good and offers lots of info. Love checking in other cities also. Love the 15 day forecast.  Still learning more about it.
B008C20TDG|5|Excellent read!  Not sure I could repeat the scientific explanations if I were quizzed on them, but they made sense while I was reading them...the concepts were clear.  Fun read - thanks!
B00CFNUMD0|5|I am bety,Iam ten,Shaun the sheep makes me laugh and also my brother.
B00004VW35|4|Neil Young is probably the most eclectic performer in rock.  The trio of albums he released between 1982-1985 are the best example of his wandering muse.  Trans is a futuristic, electronic album, Everybody's Rocking is an homage to 50's rock sounds and this album, Old Ways is a countrified album in the tradition of Harvest.  The album contains some great tracks awash in the steel guitar sounds that mesh so well with Mr. Young's voice.  Old Ways has some great stuff including &quot;Are There Any More Cowboys?&quot;, &quot;Misfits&quot;, &quot;California Sunset&quot; and the superb &quot;Bound For Glory&quot;.  Old Ways is like an old pair of jeans, comfortable.
B00BESLHEA|3|This movie would have been much better without RZA. I accepted Russell Crowe as a bad ass but RZA was not convincing as an actor, and definitely not a martial arts actor.
B00W6XM002|5|Love this game!! Am so glad you made an app for my Kindle Fire....
B00I75EROU|4|Very easy read.  Not your average King novel.  I found the story to be charming and fun.  The characters for the most part were very well defined and the story was easy to follow.  Liked it a lot.
B00005RHGL|5|This is an incredibly entertaining movie and the development of the relationships between the major characters really makes you explore the human condition.  What really snaps me to attention is at the end of the movie where the narrator says that Wyatt Earp died in 1929 in Los Angeles.  Maybe not for some but 1929 wasn't all that long ago.  I always thought the \\"Wild West\\" was some bygone era but, in truth, it was only yesterday.
1416550542|4|This is a tale told on a windy coast and lived in a cottage where one is not quite accepted at the big house.  I enjoyed it, though sometimes it puzzled me.  Maybe that's the mark of a great book.
B004132HZS|5|I absolutely love this show. I have watched it repeatedly since buying it. It is an updated version of the classic Sherlock Holmes stories. If Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was alive now he could have written this. The actors portray there characters well. Did I mention I love this show.
B00HDMMISA|4|I consider this a woman's read although I have to say I enjoyed it.  Kind of letting your wife pick the movie and you end up liking it.<br />The first third of the book was a bit slow going but then it seemed to pick speed.
B00MRHANNI|5|Love this girl and her ability.
B000BGH22W|1|I have to admit, when I learned that John Williams didn't do the score for this film, I felt a little weary about the quality of this new installment.  But having no expectations, I went into it very opened minded and willing to accept whatever new motifs, themes, and lyrical expressions Patrick Doyle had come up with.  Unfortunately, my assumptions were correct. <br /> <br />Cardinal rule when scoring films in a series, keep the principal themes.  This doesn't mean to \\"copy\\" the past installment's music.  No, that's not what it means.  It just means to include anchoring points that link subconsciously link this film to the past installments. <br />Now the reason why you DON'T take out established character's themes is because these themes are now subconsciously linked with their respective characters, it links each character to their state of being/presence, and as the characters develop and change throughout the series, they have their themes that change and develop along with them.  Now that doesn't mean whenever your scoring a cue for the scene involving the character you write a full out sonata featuring just their thematic motif, you work it in there creatively, find some way to subtly clue in the audience to something about that character with their theme (and it doesn't have to be used for EVERY cue a character is in, I'm just giving an example). <br /> <br />Patrick Doyle left out EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER'S theme (except for a crappy variation on Harry's).  Who knows exactly why he did it.  Maybe he didn't feel comfortable writing music that had bits and pieces of something another composer wrote, maybe he felt it would be cool to \\"do something drastically different.\\"  Whatever the reason, the result is obvious: this score is like the horrible film adaptation of a book.  Every director goes into it thinking they have a better idea than the original concept and every time it fails.  Patrick Doyle's concept contradicted every concept from the past original scores and completely ruined the feel of this movie.  This movie did not feel like a Harry Potter Film mainly because the music just wasn't there.  For example, when Lord Voldemort returns, for the first time, what do you think is missing?  His theme, it's completely gone, and in it's place there is no theme, not even a motif, just a melodic expression (which is completely different from a them). <br /> <br />Even though it's good that Patrick Doyle's music \\"matured as the content matured,\\" like I hear everyone saying, it doesn't excuse the fact that he did a bad job. Sorry to say, but anyone else who's had ANY experience actually scoring films in such a way to fit the emotional and characteristic feel of movies would have done a better job.  Just looking at the difference between the scores of HP and the Sorcerer's Stone and the Prisoner of Azkaban (I won't compare Chamb. of Secrets because J. Williams didn't do the whole score) you definitely sense a shift in the maturity of the themes.  Just that 3 note motif for Sirius was a step forward in character development, it shifts the whole feel of the film in another direction (though Book 3 still represents the characters as somewhat children, the big change in maturity wasn't until Book 4). <br /> <br />This score has no notable themes whatsoever except those variations of what John Williams wrote, and the variations sucked.  Don't get me wrong, some of the original cues that Mr. Doyle wrote were fantastic, but they did not fit this film.  It's a shame John Williams was scoring 4 films this year, because than he lost the chance to score the pivotal installment in the Harry Potter series, and it's a shame, and Patrick Doyle should be ashamed of himself, that such a lack-luster, brittle, and slovenly written score was written in Williams's stead.  If I could've have given this soundtrack 0 stars, (I mean, come on, rock songs?) I would have.
B00MA938B2|5|I just  love the album
B00DUGCLY4|5|Fantastic app. Good all rounder even . My son joined in. Think could be educational for some. I would recommend this app
B00H71PHS0|5|I love it. Suspenseful and historical and still interesting in spite of season 3 deaths of major characters. Very good.
B00JOT3HQ2|5|It's so addicting right now I'm trying to get 100 percent on normal mode.  So fun.
B00B8WXG9G|1|I received this cd withous a best song of the album and they didn't do anything
B00BAXFECK|2|This may have been a good story but the endless rambling in so much of the book was a major turn off ...  So boring.
B002FOQXZK|5|Great buy
B003LSTK8G|5|WALL Street will be the cause of our downfall. I read this twice and will some day read it again.
B0053JJLLC|3|I liked the story line but I really missed the way Michael Crichton used to end his stories. Nevertheless I enjoyed reading this book.
B00AMBLXP8|1|This move was the worst movie that I have ever seen, the focal point was nothing but a foul mouth bear. Save your money and pass this movie up..<br /><br />I cannot belive Mark Wahlberg agreed to make a movie like this.
B00457X7XQ|5|but this book was a recommendation from a podcast I listen to.  I'd give it an elaborate review, but I couldn't wait to get back to a PC.   In short, this book is awesome.  it is hard to tell what is fiction and what is real.  Even though this book has all of the makings of a great novel, it is unique in the fact that is all technically sound and feasible.  Great read!
B0001ZX0OW|3|This story had a really great start with excellent performances by Tim Robbins and Sean Penn. Unfortunately during the point in the story where Tim Robbin's character was a prime murder suspect, because there was a large amount of blood in his car made no sense, because with current advanced  blood and dna testing, the police could have determined that the blood was not from Sean Penn's daughter. Without giving away too much of the plot there were alot of other elements of this story that just did'nt work in this current decade of internet, phone, dna, blood, and forensics advancements. Perhaps it would have been alot more believable during the late 60's or early 70's.
B00IFMHZ58|4|This movie pleased me because it reunited so many of the former Neptune High students and it was interesting to see Veronica struggle with the temptation to let Neptune pull her back into her old role of PI or to return to her new, stable life in NYC. However, the director and show's creator, Rob Thomas decided to do something very risky!!! Rather than wrap up all the unfinished stories and conflicts, he leaves them open and by doing that, sets it up for a Veronica Mars Season 4. If this season should be successful, then that's great, but if the show does not continue then fans will be left hanging once again.
B004SUWR2C|1|, If i would. If If I could give this app zero stars it never loads it takes up A LOT of room and it is just plain stupid save your money
B00OH75ATS|4|Not as good as I'd hoped but worth checking out
B000PC0SPU|5|This is where we are going so get in the game and make the changes you need to make to be successful
0307719774|5|I received a copy of this book as a gift from my daughter-in-law , My daughter was so interested , she called me every night to see what the question for today was , So I bought her one of her own ! She loves it ..(. and she still calls every night)
B000687M48|5|This cd is amazing!  The behind the scenes with the band is hilarious!!  Amy's voice is incredible as always..good buy!
B00BMKDTNC|4|It took me a couple of decades, but I have finished reading The Wheel of Time.  It was worth the time and effort.  It was also worth wading through the last couple of books that Robert Jordan wrote before his death.  As happens so often with an author who undertakes such an epic project, the books in the middle of the series drag and wander.  I commend Brandon Sanderson for the clear and entertaining manner in which he completed the mammoth story.
B00KA7JIII|5|Very well-made game
B00009V7T2|5|I somehow stumbled upon this CD a week ago and I can't stop listening to it. I can't believe it took me this long to realize how great the Mars Volta is. This is one of my favorite CDs now. I love how it just goes from calm one second to full blown music intensity, this guy has the best voice i ever heard and I can't get enough of it. My favorite song is Eriatarka. I highly recommend this CD for anyone who just enjoys great music.  I cant wait to buy Frances the Mute, I hope it is as great or even better than De-loused.
0345535529|5|Very satisfied with purchase. They were a gift for my daughter and she was excited. They arrived nicely packaged. I will continue to order from Amazon I've had no problems and would recommend them to others.
B0098VXBIA|5|I enjoyed this movie but it could be more because I was 6 weeks pregnant.  All the stories were touching and there were a ton of funny moments.
B00DR0PDNE|4|I got this mostly for traveling. I normally use my iPad to hook up to hotel televisions to watch stuff I bring with me or stream. But that's usually kind of inconvenient when you're searching for things to watch and don't really want to get out of bed. This was just finally getting in stock and the price was perfect, so I thought I would check it out!<br /><br />But, unfortunately if you're looking to use it in a hotel, you'll have no luck 8 times out of 10 because you are using the hotels wifi network. Which doesn't really play well with letting different devices connect to one another, for obvious reasons. If your hotel provided a wired connection you could always bring a router and create your own wifi network in the room. But that's getting a little in depth. I have heard of people using their computers as the routers while using the hotel's wifi. Again, sounded like a bit over my head.<br /><br />So since I couldn't use it for that, I figured I would hook it up to my guest room tv. And I have to say, it's pretty awesome! Right now there are only 3 apps for it, Netflix, Youtube, and Android Play. As of this writing the there is a develop program going which will bring many more apps in the near future. It will basically become a pocket Roku device.<br /><br />It's easy to setup and pretty much anyone on your network has access to it. So if you have a friend over and they want to show you something on youtube, they can just stream it using their phone. That's awesome! And the Netflix app is pretty good too! It's kind of crazy when you are using your phone as video streaming device for your 50&#34; TV and it looks great.<br /><br />Also another cool feature was the Chrome browser extension. It basically turns your browser into an airplay like device. Whatever you are looking at is reflected on the TV. I can imagine this being really handy for presentations or even a fantasy football draft.<br /><br />The build quality is solid. It doesn't feel like plastic and actually has some weight to it. It also has a external power adapter if you're using a TV that doesn't have HDMI 1.4 (I guess 1.4 lets you power devices and I think you will mostly only find it on 2013 TV's)<br /><br />So even though I couldn't use it for the reason I bought it, I still really like it. And at $35 it's cheap enough to pick up an check out, if only to use as a Netflix device. And once the 3rd party apps come out of beta, I think this thing will be huge. There are rumors that you will eventually be able to play content directly from your phone. That would solve my hotel network issue!<br /><br />I absolutely recommend this product.  I would have given it 5 stars if they already had the option to do something like Wifi Direct, where you just beam from your phone directly to the Chromecast without a network. There are rumors of that coming through updates too! But even if the rumors don't come true, I'm pretty sure Hulu is coming and maybe even Amazon Prime!
B005HJWWW8|4|I had purchased NVX XPT-100 (64 ohms) headphones and directly connected them to my Sony rear-projection HDTV.  However, with only the direct connection and no amp, the headphones played too quietly even when turned up to highest volume.  So I purchaed this E-6 amp for more volume/quality, hooked it up between the TV and the headphones, and it's working great!  It came with the all the connection wiring I needed.  I even compared it with the Fiio E-12 (for $129) which is much larger and more dependable looking (like a heavy smartphone).  However, this tiny E-6 (it's only 1 1/2&#34; square) pleased me just as much as the E-12 for sound volume/quality and only cost $28.  Additional note:  Though my cellphone wall charger fit the E-12 nicely, it would NOT fit the E-6.  Therefore, I had to use the USB charger the E-6 comes with.  But I found a USB port on the back of my TV, so I just keep it plugged into that all the time.  To switch from TV speakers over to headphones, all I have to do to is push and hold the little switch on the E-6 for a few seconds to get the blue light, and the headphones come right on -- of course I also have to have switched the TV from &#34;TV Speakers&#34; over to &#34;Audio System&#34; first.  With this setup I can also control the volume as usual with the TV remote.  For $28, well worth it. Only hope it lasts.    UPDATE:  5/7/15:  Purchased in June 2014 from Sky Outlet Mall, this was a genuine product and has lasted about 1 year.  Tonight the red light went on to charge it and stayed on about a minute or two, but then went off.  That was it.   Could not get the blue light and the thing no longer works.  Tried with my computer USB and DVR USB also.  Same thing happened with both.  No dice.  As battery is not replaceable, now got to spend another $27.99 for a new one, so am ordering now, from the same supplier.  Hey, it worked nice for one year.
B00CNQ7HAU|4|good
B00H3GZMIE|1|It was cracked when I got it what a waste of money
B00IS87HYI|4|the first few chapters are easy, but then they get more and more challenging. Its a fun game, once you start your hooked.
B000002GZ1|4|Well worth the price
B00EMXBDMA|4|This would have been a wonderful book to use as a basis for a science unit in middle school through high school. Unfortunately, the language is inappropriate for use in a K-12 setting. The profanity peppered throughout the story prevents me from giving this book a five star rating. Even for adult fiction quite a bit of the profanity was unnecessary and distracted from the story. Otherwise a good read and a good effort for a first novel.
0307341577|5|Started out strange at first, but I quickly came to see that this can really happen. So well written I actually felt bad for the characters conditions and situations. The story had a twist I didn't see coming until the very end. Really makes you think.<br /><br />I really enjoy this author and the way she writes. Se does her homework for the common reader. She makes sure you understand the details, the why and the wherefore in terms that grab your attention. Another real '5 star' read from this author.<br /><br />[Actual review by friend of PDA]

B00N1JQ452|5|When my wife and I returned home after seeing Guardians of the Galaxy, I logged into IMDB and gave it a 9 (there are only a handful of films that I've given a 10). It's a thoroughly entertaining film, and with an MPAA rating of PG-13, you could take your teenagers with you and not be embarrassed.<br /><br />It's a fun movie to watch, with a fine ensemble cast led by Chris Pratt as Peter Quill (aka Star Lord). It's all action, but there's plenty of humor too. Guardians owes its lineage to a long line of sci fi and action films, including Star Wars, Raiders, and LOTR, just to name a few. Peter Quill is another Han Solo, and the tree-like Groot is very reminiscent of the Ents in LOTR. And the whole movie revolves around a mysterious powerful object that everyone wants and some will kill for (the plot for all the Indiana Jones films). Partway into the movie, our group of misfits has gotten together: Peter Quill; Gamora, who's betrayed her boss Ronan, a Kree who is planning to use a mysterious sphere to destroy civilized planets in the galaxy; Rocket the genetically altered raccoon; Groot, a tree-like creature with a very limited vocabulary; and Drax, a convict in the prison that the group breaks out of. They proceed to battle the bad guys in a series of confrontations leading to the climactic showdown between Quill and Ronan.<br /><br />The action was pretty much nonstop for the two hours the film ran, and most scenes featured heavy CGI, but it was very well done. The score was also well done and included a number of hit songs from the 1970s and 1980s. In the movie, Quill's dying mother had given him a cassette tape with the songs, which were her favorites when she was younger.<br /><br />Sequels? Oh yeah, for sure. There were some unanswered questions to be explored, number one being: Who is Peter Quill's father? And what will happen with the powerful sphere that Quill has? And there are backstories on the other Guardians to be told. No, we haven't seen the last of our band of Guardians.<br /><br />Tip: Don't leave when the credits start to roll. Stick around for a mini-scene that comes after the credits.band of Guardians.<br /><br />Tip: Don't leave when the credits start to roll. Stick around for a mini-scene that comes after the credits.
B00I2WNYJW|5|A philosophy changing book.  Not your easy read, but an ESSENTIAL one.  The sweet sounding religion of free market self-perfection once rang for me.  But my observations on who would take care of people who did the work, the obviously bizarre gaps between salaries & incomes and &#34;supposed&#34; value to society of contributions fo those so blessed with multi million dollar pay checks and packages.  The irony that billionaires (quote Warren Buffet) pay lower tax rates than their secretaries, begs a review and a rethink.<br />Come Piketty to do the centuries-broad review of history of wealth and capital distribution.  This book will likely surprise you.  It did me.  It showed how the historic effects of world wars were among the greatest levelers of dis-equalized wealth.  It shows how historically nations have gotten out of national deficits greater than ours today, and the simple way this impossible task can and likely will be done.  It demonstrates the simple arithmetic reasons that wealth unequality is getting so out-of-touch with reality once again.  And it demonstrates the rise, fall, rise and fall of the American dream and promise: that people will have &#34;equal&#34; opportunity and that the capable and the working will have the ability to live well.  Also that inherited wealth, title, and power would be flattened in a better society (also the dream of the great societies and democratic revolutions across the globe).<br />He shows the rhythms and the whys of why education (university schooling) and health care need to be planned for and provided in a sensible society.<br />So many things are clarified in this statistic and retroactive fact-based historical tome.<br />If you have observed that without governments taking control of child labor and working wages, the free market place would have continued disadvantaging the majority, you he and I have a point of historical agreement.<br />If you have observed that the multi-million dollar salaries of managers and financial personnel may be just a bit out of line with their societal and economic contributions and value, again a point of agreement.<br />If you have observed curently both the poor and middle classes of the planet getting less, while the top 10%, 1% and 1/10 of 1% control more of the nations' wealth and capital, the simple arithmetic facts and relationships of national economic growth vs. return on capital (money, stocks, real estate etc) invested will be an o-mi-god eye opener for you.<br />So many things worth learning in this book, please do yourself the favor of reading it.
B001IB7SQ4|4|I've just started watching this show on Amazon Prime. I've watched the first 5 episodes and I'm really enjoying it. My initial thought was it's like \\"X Files\\" meets \\"Big Bang Theory\\". I've seen enough that it has me hooked and I'll keeping watching. All in all I'd say the series is interesting and unique enough to keep me viewing.
B0063IH60K|4|Ads are annoying of course, but all in all this is a nice version of Solitaire. It even has an option to deal a winning hand which would come in handy if you're a sore loser.
B000FCKC4C|5|New all time favorite book! Can't believe I hadnt read it before now. Such an inspiration to follow your dreams.
B00FAPF5U0|4|Completely addicted as everyone else seems to be, however I was late to jump on the bandwagon. The only reason I'm not 5-staring this is because I should not have to pay to unlock levels when it says &#34;free&#34;, and is advertised as &#34;free&#34;, I'm sorry. I have it connected to my FB account and have sent out the requests as it has asked me to (which I hate to get from other people so I hope I have not bugged my friends), and it still won't unlock levels for me. Either way, I spend my time replaying the older levels and trying to get the high scores until they unlock!
B004SJ3BCI|5|Great games for the traveling person-fun to play and challenging.  It's a great way to pass time, I would recommend to anyone who enjoys a game.
0141301155|4|As the title implies, this is the story of Charlie. Charlie Bucket is the only son of a very poor family. He lives in a very small cottage just outside of town, with his Mom and Dad, his two Grandmas and his two Grandpas.<br /><br />Charlie absolutely loves chocolate. Alas, his parents are so poor they can only afford to buy him a bar once a year, for his birthday, which is awaited eagerly. Needless to say that passing by Willy Wonka's enormous chocolate factory, the most famous in the world, on his way to school every day is close to torture for poor little Charlie.<br /><br />Until the day Charlie finds one in only five golden tickets in the whole world that entitles him to a visit of the reknown factory.<br /><br />I decided to read this book before Tim Burton's adaptation comes out. What a wonderful children story, full of adventures and twists and turns! The factory's a fantastic place, the characters are great, especially Grandpa Joe, and I'm looking forward to seeing the talented (among other qualities) Johnny Depp as Mr. Willy Wonka. And Quentin Blake's illustrations are excellent. Definitely something I'm going to read to my kids (when I have some). I ran to the shop right after I finished it to buy its sequel: Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator.

0316228532|4|In ordering Casual Vacancy I wanted first to get the book quickly and with little hassle through Amazon and then to find it lived up to the hype as a worthwhile read that didn't try to fly on Harry Potter's broomstick.  The service was a tad better than the book, but both lived up to expectations.
B00FKF0F3C|1|I would not recommend this book. It was a disappointing third book of the Trilogy. It was biased in favor of some American administrations and dismissive of others. The interactions between the real historical characters and the fictional characters were almost silly.<br />Reading this after Follett's Eye of the Needle (which was very well written) made me wonder if it was written by the same author.<br />Very disappointing!
B0029O08WA|4|So I really thought I would be disappointed in the soundtrack when I didn't recognize a lot of the bands.  I was really looking forward to my guys Blue October appearing (disappointment). I must say that I really like all the songs with the exception of The Editors song which I thought sounded like a 60 year old Vegas lounge singer.  The 4.99 MP3 download was a bonus to say the least.  True Twihard fans will not be let down by this purchase.

B0015HOFZI|5|I wanted a turntable that would hook directly to my computer so that I could transfer my vinyl collection to CD. I am 59 so I have an extensive collection of '60s and '70s vinyl. I am very happy with this purchase. Connection and operation are very easy. The unit is plastic and it is belt drive so one gets what they pay for. But in the case of this Sony turntable, one does get a unit that exceeds those particulars. I didn't expect too much but I got a little more. One thing to know before buying; when your read the documentation that comes with it you will find that there will be no sound from your computer speakers being that it is connected USB. I bought a small amp (Pyle from Amazon.com) so that I could also hook up to some speakers so now I can transfer to CD and also hear the music.
B000002UJQ|5|They may not get the airplay they deserve here in the states, but their music isn't exactly your typical pop and drop into your trashcan.  Simply put, buy this CD.  It will literally blow you away.  It's a tightly crafted  classic.  20 years from now people will look back at this album as  something that could be the turning point of music.
B00DJFIMW6|4|WAY BETTER than Subway Surfers or Temple Run. It's a great game for fans of the movies. Was a little slow to download, though, and get working for the first time.

B00005Y1UX|3|Spoiler alert:  This review reveals the ending<br /><br />I heard about the film when it came out--the famous indecent proposition.  It struck me as silly then and I didn't watch it.  But one rainy night when I had nothing better to do I watched it on Netflix.  I still thought the idea was ridiculous and shut it off before she made up her mind.  However Redford was so attractive that I went back the following night just to see what would happen and his charm kept me watching to the end.  I actually liked the whole cast.  Woody Harrelson is likable as the impulsive, idealistic, young guy.  Demi Moore does a good job as the pretty young wife.  And Redford, in his white suit looked like he just stepped out of Gatsby.  Who could resist him?<br /><br />The story is taken from a novel in which the millionaire is an Arab shiek which would be a whole different proposition. I haven't read it so I can't comment but it's interesting to speculate on how it played out there.  The film has a lot of logical holes in it.  First, someone as charming, good-looking, and ultimately nice, not to mention Rich, as the Redford character is, would not have to offer any money to any woman.  Secondly although Demi Moore looked good she's neither beautiful nor interesting enough to justify Redford looking for her. And one would wonder how, after RR she'd really want to back to Woody.  Because he paid a million dollars for a hippo?<br /><br />Finally where the film fails is that it sets up the moral premise--that love is more important than money and that love cannot be bought.  It sets up the Woody character as representing Love and the Redford character as representing Money.  That's all very good but the story doesn't unfold that way.  The Redford character seems to be as genuinely in love with the woman  as Woody  -- even more so, given his heroic act at the end.  The scenes in which he is pursuing her---in the classroom and in his home, are the most genuinely touching of the whole film. Their dance on the patio of his home is much more romantic than all of the scenes with Woody and Demi in the sheets.  It is possible that Woody is the better man for her but the film doesn't show that.<br /><br />And probably most importantly, which Redford pointed out was that he would not have let his wife be sold as Woody did.  So the film doesn't prove its own stated premise.  However it's Hollywood and if you can suspend your own judgement and just sit back and look at the pretty people, you might like this film.
B00IX9UTLU|5|I absolutely loved it!  I so don't like Celia.  I'd have kicked her butt sooner then Laynie did. I so would remember this book.
B00K0MM4AM|5|What a great film!  With all the typical hollywood trash being recycled again and again...it's great to see a true sci-fi film come out in 2014.  Just when you think cinema is dead, this one really shocks you into loving movies again!  I can absolutely see the comparisons to Kubrick.  The soundtrack is truly amazing as well!

B0064W667Y|5|This series is easily becoming my new favorite in graphic novels and comics. Though a new fan I would note that the charm of the series is that like most children growing up I have heard all the nursery rhymes and fairy tales that make up the backbone of these stories. I feel like I am picking up where those happily ever afters left off and have yet to be disappointed. Granted the new world is modern and twisted but some good can emerge from those who were once the villains I loved to hate and new evils and cons will stem from the heroes I once cheered on. I cannot wait to read the next volume.
B00DR0PDNE|5|Easy to set up!<br />Computer in and HDMI stick! Crazy!<br />Connect from any Android device in your network.<br />Several apps supported already, ex: Netflix (works like a charm)<br />Code was just released so more app support on the way, including Vudu!<br /><br />Misconception about the dongle, it's not streaming Netflix from your phone or tablet when you cast it.<br />Your Android device is telling the Chromecast dongle to go out to the web and load this web app and play the video.<br />So your Android device is basically just nice remote control.<br />The only time it's actually streaming media is if the media, like a family movie recorded from your phone, is on the phones memory and you're streaming it. (hope that made sense, lol)<br /><br />I can also stream media from my home NAS synology server and it works like a charm!<br />Sadly MKV format is not supported at this time. but I'm sure that wont last much longer w/that code release.<br /><br />It NEVER freezes!<br />the pix that are cycling when no media is being streamed are nice and changed.<br />It's very easy to use and I can control what my kids watch from any room in my house.<br />You can turn volume up and down as well.<br /><br />This is just a great product, once more video/audio codec's are supported this will replace my huge PC I'm using as an HTPC.<br />Great product for only $35! You can't beat that IMO.<br />Help this information helps. Cheers!<br /><br />*** UPDATE... Nothing really, just wanted to say this thing still rocks!<br />I have a few other streaming dongles and set top boxes that I use in other TV's and what not.<br />But what I want to add is that this Chromecast is used almost every single day and never has it locked! Not even once as apposed to every other dongle and set top box that does lock up all the time.<br />Now that DEV kit is released I can't wait to see what else is added, support wise. Cheers!

To get a full charge still takes too long to make it convenient, but that is just the price we pay to get long battery life with such a large device!

0061689246|5|There is something magical about this book, something that makes you feel as if you have been transported back to your childhood, yet you still know everything you know now. You are the wise and witty, woe  ridden and world weary person you wanted to be as a child. You're having fun reading a fairy tale but you aren't a kid. It's great.<br />It's hard to explain how this book makes you feel.<br />Gaiman somehow manages to take every fairytale character you've ever met and turn them into someone you recognise. Yes, they're magical - good or evil, but still ... you've met that person, or someone very like them. And every character evokes an emotion - a difficult thing to achieve, yet Gaiman does it.<br />I am not an unreserved fan of Neil Gaiman, some of his recent work is losing its sparkle for me. But this never will. In Stardust, he hit the nail on the head. If you are just starting with Neil - try this one first.<br />Oh, and it's a LOT better than the movie.
B00CBKXGPI|4|ALERT:  After I reached a certain point (after I paid of course) the game kept kicking me out. I restarted it under a different name and had no further problems.  Never could go back to the original game though.  Really enjoyed this game.  Loved the art!  Would have been nice to learn a bit about more about the art as I went along other than just artist and title.  Even a date and country would have been nice but a little history for those of us interested would have really added to the experience for me.

B00CWY76CC|4|This game is really fun. It is challenging enough to be entertaining but not so difficult you want to throw your device. The solutions, unlike some levels on 100 floors, actually make sense, it is just a matter of time before you get it.

B000HEWEDK|5|I remember watching this on TV with my Dad and getting so scared that I crawled under his chair. This movie made such an impression on me that before it was so easy to search for the name of shows, it was an obsession of mine to figure out what film it was that scared me so bad. No blood, no gore, just psychological creepiness.

0140158766|4|This book is more of a memoir following the tour of duty that Mr. Mason served in Vietnam from 1965 to 1966. After having read &#34;Chickenhawk&#34; I was rather compelled to follow the life of Mr. Mason; I am glad that I did.<br /><br />Mr. Mason makes no apologies with the exception of effects that some of his choices he made which impacted that of his wife Patience and son Jack during the period of October 1966 to August 1992 in this memoir. Within his personal disclosure of PTSD and physical effects we see simple statements like &#34;...I thought these problems would all go away...&#34; and &#34;...fighting internalizations, talking to self, nodding off, seeking people I've never known...&#34; are all to familiar to myself personally. It is here that I attribute my personal link to his experiences and I have yet to discover whether these within hold a key for my own related issues. However, the story of the human condition continues as one who has read &#34;Chickenhawk&#34; the story that follows is rather tortuous at times. Mr. Mason's self worth depreciates to a value to which I acknowledge within myself; he was and is worthy of much more of course - but if you wear the shoes and have lived his existence then one comes to understand these &#34;internalizations&#34; that continuously haunt him. There were frustrating points in this book that I had to overcome but I read every page and every word out of respect for what he went through and was able to effectively visit my own view of &#34;self worth&#34; within the descriptive pages within.<br /><br />Patience (Mr. Mason's wife) is a stoic woman; the sort of character and courage that existed in her (then) and I speculate that still exists within her today was a source of inspiration for me as I continued to read. Mr. Mason acknowledges and gives full credit to his wife, best friend, and lover who gave to him her all and never stopped doing what needed to be done - even as she worked a paper route to keep the family together. Part of this brought water to my eyes at points as I considered all of her efforts. Mr. Mason also acknowledges his short comings and concern for his son, the life he wanted to give and yet the life he was predisposed (to some extent) to provide for - he (Mr. Mason) never lost sight in the bigger picture though of his personal responsibilities to those around him. Even his worst decision (among other unfortunate ones that he made) were chosen with the intent to &#34;better&#34; the overall existence. Mr. Mason acknowledged fully his short comings but he makes amends, and tackles these issues with an appropriateness of time availability and somehow changes the existence of his life.<br /><br />As a teenager I recall quite vividly the Vietnam Veterans that were still in there 20 something years during the 1970's. The 1970's were a confusing time for many and as a teen then I realized there was an intentional arrogance in society to ignore the period of 1964-1975 for the U.S. involvement of Vietnam. Many good boat people would be camped at Camp Pendleton California in this period of time having escaped barely with only the shoes on their feet and clothes on their backs. The Vietnamese refugees that ended up on American soil in my view have become as important a community of people of this overall society that any of any group of people throughout the course of American History and I for one am thankful they exist and are thriving in some places within the nation as Americans that have &#34;Value and a Purpose&#34; (to put it into a phrase of yet another Vietnam Veteran I know who is doing and has done tremendous work to this day for others affected by this war.) The Vietnam Veterans I knew in the 1970's would show me scars on their body, tell me stories of the events of battles - all I could do was listen, I did; and, later I served in the USMC myself.<br /><br />I give this book 4 stars only because there were some parts I believed sort of dragged on; but, I acknowledge it was important for Mr. Mason's existence to retrieve from memory those events and provide a description to paper for those interested in his story and for himself most importantly to attempt to expel the demons. If you read &#34;Chickenhawk&#34; then I would encourage you to follow up with this great book on the life that followed.ut, I acknowledge it was important for Mr. Mason's existence to retrieve from memory those events and provide a description to paper for those interested in his story and for himself most importantly to attempt to expel the demons.

B00012QM8G|5|I am a high school history teacher.  In preparation to tackle the horror of the Holocaust to make it understood to 15-16 year olds, I read countless accounts and texts on the subject.  I had seen Schindler's List in the theater before I had much knowledge of the subject and was moved.  Seeing it after my research, it is true to history.  Steven Speilberg is, obviously, brilliant.  Students in my classes where moved to tears (even a couple football jocks) and gained a clear understanding of the blind hatred of an ethnicity.  I show the movie and only could show it on VHS.  To be able to have the DVD quality and ability to easily skip past the brief sexual scenes has increased this film's impact in the classroom.  Not a movie to watch with the family on a night of fun but a necessary film for all people to see.  History is our best teacher and Schindler's List teaches us a very powerful lesson.

B000P0J0AG|5|This was a very good movie, but what made it truly spectacular was having De Niro and Pacino alongside one another in the one film (Godfather II was good, but didn't necessarily have the two actors working directly with one another).<br /><br />Either way, from directing to the screenplay, this film is hard to fault.

B001ANYDAO|5|I read this book because my piano teacher recommended it. That was November 2009. In the months following, I slowly came to realize the value of her recommendation as I practiced for the Cincinnati World Piano Competition. My daily average in June was about 6 hours a day, sometimes more. By the time July 1st, 2010, the day of the final round, came, I had logged over 10,000 hours - the minimal requirement for success, as this book explains. With its many intriguing examples, this excellent novel clarifies that hard work and time are crucial components to good results in any subject, not just music. Although not everyone has the same goals (mine was to be a finalist), all will benefit from reading this book - as I definitely did. If anyone is curious, I earned co-gold; 10,000 hours did the trick.
006017322X|4|This ever-popular, Pulitzer prize-winning novel is written from the first-person perspective of \\"Scout,\\" a young girl growing up in a small, segregated Alabama town during the Great Depression. I did not read any descriptions of the book before I began it, so it was fascinating as I began to realize what it was about. Its gentle, childlike, Tom Sawyer, heart-of-America cadence drew me in, but provided a counterpoint to the hypocrisy, racism, and bigotry that was revealed in the town little by little.    The writing itself, of course, is excellent, telling the story subtly but powerfully - or perhaps the power is in its very subtlety. In my opinion, this is not the most compelling book I've ever read on this issue, but it is significant and memorable.

B00IFMHZ58|4|5 stars:<br />As a backer of getting the movie made I am admittedly biased in my scoring but I really feel like this delivers all the fan service VM fans would want to see and still delivers an good VM story.<br /><br />3 stars:<br />If you have not seen any or most of the series prior to this you will get a decent mystery story to watch but it may not feel like a typical movie cause there is a side story that has no direct connection and little payoff unless you are a fan of the characters.

B00005NWM3|5|The summer of 2001 saw a rise in popularity for the Canadian quartet Nickelback. On the strength of their first single, How You Remind Me, Nickelback dropped their second album, Silver Side Up, only to be faced with extremely strong record sales and a growth in their fan base.<br />Silver Side Up is picking up where their previous release, The State, left off: playing guitar driven rock and roll. Chad Kroeger leads the band on guitar and vocals, singing songs about abuse, life struggles, and Hollywood while Ryan Peake plays the guitar and backs Chad on vocals. Setting the rhythm are bassist Mike Kroeger and drummer Ryan Vikedal, who play each track well and adds power to the Kroeger/Peake double guitar display.<br />The drum driven Never Again starts the album off well. Its a rocking song where Mike and Ryan get some time to show that behind the guitars, they are still there. The first single, How You Remind Me, is a very good lyrics and singing and cool working on the instruments. The only problem is that it is so overplayed. Woke Up This Morning is much like the first track except for the fact that the topic of the lyrics is not as dark and the music is more uplifting. The second single, Too Bad, is another good song. Starting off soft and then breaking out into a rocking chorus. The next 5 tracks are of the same formula as the previous tracks: hard rocking riffs, lyrics ranging from personal to imaginative story-telling and solid rhythm. Nickelback has saved the best for last, found in the song Good Times Gone. The track stands out a bit because its a bit softer than the rest but the lyrics are great and the slide guitar is nice.<br />All in all, Nickelback is a pretty cool band and they play some great music. The only problem I have with the band is their fame. I don't say they are sell-outs but now you have all these people claiming to be Nickelback fans when they are only into one song (poseurs). Too many people like that nowadays. This album is for fans of hard rock and maybe even stuff a little bit softer. For those of you who enjoy this album, you should check out The State. Both albums are wonderful.
B00AKKGX4W|5|Awesome, had a hard time putting it down.
B008BM9L72|2|It's totally overrated! I never read these kind of books, but since it was so popular and they are busy making a movie from the book as well, I thought it might be worth a try. But o my gosh!!!!! The repetition and everything described in detail is just too much and very irritating! As somebody else mentioned it is as if it was written by a teenager. It is a clumsy book and need some editing and many parts with all the unnecessary descriptions and repetitions could have been left out. There are some parts in the book that were quite nice to read and it became better as we went along. I quite like the end which depicted Christian's point of view.

B00FCQQ1IW|5|I have read and enjoyed most of Jeffrey Archer's books and can hardly wait for the next book in the Clifton Chronicles series.
B000003N7Q|5|It is a record that works. It has the songs that I am assuming most already know, if they are looking this product up. Amazing selection, creates a great ambiance, and sounds great.
0307887960|5|I bought the US version of this book because, living in the UK and following the UK book for a year, I'd heard that this was different to the original book and wanted to see what the fuss was about. Overall it is almost exactly the same as the UK version. There is a little more information in this book for vegetarians which, to my mind, should have been in the UK book. After all, we have vegetarians here too! Having lived by the tenets of Dr Dukan for the past 12 months, and successfully losing 98lbs, I would recommend this book to everybody out there who thinks they can't stick to a diet. Follow this book, to the letter, and you will not regret it.

B0001HAHXW|2|Please listen to the 30 second samples before even thinking about buying this lame album.  Clapton has recorded some admirable covers of early blues artists in the past - listen to Jesse Fuller's 'San Francisco Bay Blues' from 'Unplugged', for example - but the tracks on this album utterly fail to impress.  What made the legendary recordings of 'Mr. Johnson' (puh-leeeze!) so impressive was the simple fact that they comprised just the sounds of one man's powerful voice and his mesmerizing guitar.  <br />On these tracks, the guitar playing is often buried beneath - rather than complemented by - the sounds of other instruments: piano, harmonica, drums, bass, etc.  The raw energy of Robert Johnson's early work is simply lacking (or buried) on these sanitised Clapton covers.  As one reviewer has already noted, this album is simply too 'slick' for its own good.  A far superior (modern) album covering Robert Johnson's songbook is 'Hellhound on My Trail' from the Telarc label. Mainstream Clapton fans may find the Telarc album too 'authentic' to appreciate, but true fans of Robert Johnson will find more to relish on that album than they will on this unnecessary addition to the Clapton catalogue.
B005ZOBNOI|5|Amazing book. Absolutely amazing. It isn't completely depressing like you would think a book about a kid with cancer would be. It's an interesting point of view.

6303407188|4|Whatever deficiencies Burton's biopic may have as a film are readily compensated for by a subject matter, script, and style so cinematically evocative that the viewer is apt to sense he's seeing many other films at the same time.  Burton captures the fanaticism in every true movie fan, the sheer exhilaration experienced by the lover of movies of every artistic level, the driven exhuberance and enthusiasm that unite the best directors and their audiences.<br />The posters in Woods' office--of &quot;Kane,&quot; &quot;Dracula,&quot; and numerous grade B movies--range from the sublime to the ridiculous, each betraying their owner's undiscriminating passion for films and his compulsive need to complete his projects.  At one point he meets the great Orson Welles (an uncanny impersonation by Vincent D'Onofrio) who, like Wood, is struggling to finance his latest project--&quot;Don Quixote,&quot; of all things!<br />&quot;All visions are worth fighting for,&quot; Welles counsels Wood, who takes the advice to heart.  Sharp enough to know the greatness of &quot;Kane&quot; even in the fifties and smart enough to quote Coleridge's definition of imaginative art as &quot;the willing suspension of disbelief,&quot; Wood remains oblivious to the fact that his movies are fooling no one--except himself.  He watches them repeatedly and uncritically, mouthing each word of atrocious dialogue, shedding tears of pathos and joy, and always shaking his head in disbelief at the wonder of his own illusions.<br />It's easy to see why Tim Burton would be drawn to a project such as this, and Burton's own attraction to the surfaces of the medium, to the light and shadow of the projected image, and his eye for the off-beat make him a creative and spiritual descendant of Ed Wood.  And Ed, like every great director from Eisenstein to Burton himself, understands the very essence of cinema.  It's not about the &quot;reality&quot; documented by the camera: it's about the creative, imaginative, inventive mixing and matching of strips of celluloid.  Early in the film he makes the claim, &quot;I could make an entire movie of stock footage.&quot;<br />Many directors could, and have.  But Ed is represented by Burton as being uncritical and fanatical about his projects to the point of being utterly and fatally careless as well.  He's energetic, relentless, generous, but never exacting.  The &quot;details&quot; don't matter, he tells his crew and producers on &quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space.&quot;  And so his failures, though no less resounding, are at least free of cynicism and are fueled by a vision of cinema in which the viewer's imagination can be counted on to replace verisimilitude.  Wood brings to film-making a kind of free-spirited, carefree vision that disciplined film-makers like Burton know can never succeed with a public insisting that film simulate, and not merely symbolize, reality.<br />My only reservation about Burton's impressive tribute is the casting of Johnny Depp as Ed Wood.  Depp is a skilled, off-center actor and somewhat of a cult Hollywood figure himself.  But Depp's adolescent voice and youthful appearance almost suggest a star-struck, recent teenager going for broke against all odds--a common, familiar theme throughout our culture.  Wood, on the other hand, was an innocent, enchanted child-creature in a grown man's body.  He's the amateur in us all, including those of us who might fit the description of a middle-aged yuppie in possession of nothing more than a camcorder, an iMac movie editing program, and a dream.mixing and matching of strips of celluloid.

B004UJAOLM|5|Deep and moody. A book to take your time reading. A story that may disturb you as much as it entertains. O story that should make you glad that you live in modern times, although obsessive love is as real today as when this book was written.<br /><br />Yes, it is depression at times but had it been a light hearted, frivolous romance would we still turn to it today as an example of a great Gothic romance story? The description of the setting, of the characters lingers with me.
B007J4T2G8|3|I loved reading this terribly written book. What a great escape when I wanted to distract my mind from the real world and read something I couldn't put down.  Its sexy, great story, didn't offend my feminist sensibilities too much, and was the perfect vacation book.  That said, some of the writing was laughable.  Where were the editors??  If she says one more time \\"he pressed his mouth into a hard line\\", I think I'll explode!
B00H48ES7C|1|Enjoyed the first of 4 levels, but could not proceed to level 2 without an in-app purchase. Too bad, I was really enjoying this game. Deleting now.

B005ILWOZA|5|When I picked up my new \\"People\\" Magazine today, I went to the music reviews and was excited, so excited, to see that James Morrison has released his third album.  I would have ordered his new CD without hearing a single track from it, but instead listened to the samples that Amazon shares with their customers.  I sat, my ears tuned in to every word, wanting to hear more of each song, and then without hesitation, hit the \\"add to cart\\" button.  I cannot wait to get James' new CD and probably will wear it out as I have his last two.  It's unbelievable to me that he has not been highly recognized in the US, he's such a huge talent, but believe me, I will do my best to spread the word about him!  Thank you, James, for your talent, voice and soulful songwriting!
B005LHOKFS|4|Takes awhile to get info on kindle
B00IRISI42|5|Great nonstop action book.
B00FG1Q5J8|3|I thought it was ok. I liked it but got put off by the zombies. Personally I think zombies are being overused by the media.<br />That being said if you like this sort of game it's not bad. I recommend it.
0312199066|4|Selected with the third group of American astronauts in 1963, Eugene Cernan &quot;walked&quot; in space as the pilot of Gemini 9, went around the Moon on Apollo 10, then returned there as the Commander of Apollo 17, the last lunar landing mission. A successful and interesting career even for astronaut standards. His autobiography, &quot;The Last Man on the Moon&quot;, offers a personal account of those glory days of space exploration.<br />Throughout the book, Cernan portrays himself as a competitive workaholic, and it shows: there are a few introductory chapters on Gene's childhood and career as a naval aviator, and a brief afterthought on life after NASA, but the bulk of &quot;Last Man&quot; is about the space program, the space program, and the space program. Training and mission planning, the mechanics of crew selection, descriptions of his colleagues and anecdotes about their extracurricular activities, it's all there. The flights themselves are recounted in vivid detail, including a nauseatingly dangerous EVA on Gemini 9 and geology trips through the lunar valley of Taurus-Littrow. Overall, as Cernan later reflects, it feels &quot;as if I was getting off one fast-moving express train only to immediately board another&quot;, and describes well the hectic and busy pace of the Moon race.<br />Underlying it all, and well in evidence, is the aggressive &quot;right stuff&quot; attitude usually found with this elite of pilots. It's easy to mistake Gene's self-confidence for arrogance, but he also displays plenty of humour and self-ironic jabs. Cernan was one of the more personable and gregarious astronauts, who clearly enjoyed the social perks that came with the job, and it's this mixture of cocky determination and laid-back charm that make his autobiography a gripping read. Indeed, &quot;Last Man&quot; is a page-turner in the real sense of the word. Particularly enlightening is the episode that saw Geno decline a LM pilot seat on Apollo 16, a gamble that paid off and in the end brought him command of his own mission. So is his relationship with geologist-astronaut Jack Schmitt, whom Cernan only grudgingly accepted on his crew. After some initial macho reservations against the &quot;pebble-pusher&quot;, he learned to respect Schmitt as a tireless worker and supremely gifted individual who helped make Apollo 17 the most well rounded team of all. In between, with the lunar module on Apollo 10 spinning out of control for a moment, or a helicopter crash in training, there are enough close calls for several lifetimes.<br />The human qualities of the book show when Gene talks about his wife, Barbara, and the ordeals she had to go through, with an often absent husband in a dangerous job, while always displaying the brave \\"Mrs. Astronaut\\" to the public world. Ultimately, this ordeal led to the disintegration of Cernan's first marriage, and he speaks with a heightened sense of value about his family of today and his grandchildren. Such a sense of deep appreciation and philosophical reflection also shines through when Gene recounts his awe as one of only twelve humans to ever set foot on the Moon, \\"looking up at the cobalt Earth immersed in infinite blackness\\", and how the unique experience might have changed him. These are moments that he clearly treasures deeply, that left him with a restless yearning forever after. Cernan seems sad, not selfish, thinking that the accomplishments of the ten years of Apollo would probably take twice as long today, in a much more cautious and conservative age of spacefaring. And he expresses a sense of guilt at feeling unable to truly share what he saw in space with the rest of the world.<br />Geno needn't have worried there, for \\"The Last Man on the Moon\\" is a fabulous book. Well-written and informative, it leaves little to be desired. Perhaps, given the awe-inspiring nature of the subject, some chapters fly by just a tad too quickly, and one could have wished for a little more detail here, or a littledeeper thought there. Overall, though, there are few better astronaut biographies. The page-turner qualities, Cernan's unique perspective (here is one of the three guys who went to the Moon twice!) and a subtle, but strong sense of philosophical reflection make for a very worthwhile read, not only for space enthusiasts.
B0054JZC6E|5|Absolutely LOVE this game. I love the variety of games they have. I could play it all day, It never gets old. Best game on my Kindle!!
B00TLU48N0|3|I'm back on a Todd kick (I've liked him since his late-60s days with the Nazz), having picked up a number of his CDs over the past year. As much of a genius as he is, Todd is real hit and miss when it comes to records, which he tends to build around a particular concept.<br />With Global the boy wonder from Philadelphia walks perilously close to the 2-star rating. That is not to say this isn't a good album; but more to say it's not much of a 'Todd' album. Instead of leading he appears to be under the influence again (Daft Punk, anyone?). True, he's always under the influence, but I was longing for different things...maybe because lately I've been playing 'Back to the Bars' in my car. That album is all over the place stylistically, but very much Todd. His expanded remit sometimes takes him a bit too far away from himself for my comfort. Possibly, as was the case with some others, I'll learn to love this. But my immediate response is that I prefer eclectic Todd over electronica Todd.
B00C49H3WI|2|This series was wholeheartedly recommended to me by a friend. However, it turns out that I don't have the same taste where this is concerned. The concept is certainly cool. The acting is excellent. The skeeviness of the characters presented little redeeming social value for me to want to keep watching them. I became disinterested rather quickly and stopped watching about half way through the first episode. Sorry, not my cup of tea. Probably exciting for others. I won't give away what my friend stated was the most interesting thing about it. So, there's a mystery to keep you intrigued.
6304119046|5|Welles's first film is an absolute tour-de-force.  It didn't break as much new ground as some have claimed, but Citizen Kane builds on the best of what came before, particularly the deep-focus photography & fluid camerawork of the great 30s films by Jean Renoir.  That Welles raised film to a new level at age 24-5 is astounding, but his precocious work in radio gave him a different perspective on the medium and allowed him to use sound in experimental and expressive ways (that have yet to be equalled, really).  Of course, Welles does not deserve exclusive credit for this achievement: H. J. Mankiewicz contributed some of the best material in the screenplay, Gregg Toland was the top cinematographer in the business, Bernard Herrman contributed one of the finest scores ever written, and there are many other important contributions, not least from a very talented cast fresh from the stage (Everett Sloane's Mr. Bernstein I'd single out as the most remarkable performance next to Welles' own . . . both of them are aged so convincingly, and Sloane does it almost exclusively with his odd-bird looks and acting skill).  This is a towering achievement and will obviously always be recognized as such by those who take an interest in the art and history of cinema.  It's also a great story, told through a series of complex flashbacks, about a man who had everything except what mattered most. <br />
B00C5R7F8G|5|Mr Schlosser has brought me very close to the most dangerous thing ever invented by man, and the participants in this unbelievable story. It is truly a miracle that we are still here.
B0084B5TK8|5|Highly recommend reading this story. It is a wonderfully written horror story that keeps you at the edge of the page. Pure awesome.
B0071XO8RA|5|Can't think of anything I disliked.<br /><br />Except...<br /><br />I felt like I was getting beat up at first. There were no easy answers with happy endings.<br /><br />The characters seemed to make choices based on what little evidence was available to them. Not based on what I knew or thought I knew. And certainly not based on what the all powerful author knew.<br /><br />It is what it is. Deal with it. Embrace the suck. Drive on.<br /><br />Awesome read.
B001VLXNLU|5|This is a wonderful series of books! It puts a different spin on vampyres...what they are, how they became vampyres, etc. A must read! Will be hard to put down!
B003PBB4ME|5|Great handle for walking motions and very steady.<br /><br />Highly recomended it even if you think you wont use it as much YOU WILL.
B0036BK6MW|5|I love this movie. It's great for the whole family to watch. This movie will make you laugh and cry.
B0098VXCR0|5|We liked this movie. It was entertaining and had quite the spin from the original Snow White that we grew up with.  A few scenes which we though were going to be predictable were a pleasant surprise.  There was even a bit of comedy in this movie.  It is fairly dark, so not for kids, but a good movie.  We would recommend it.
6304983778|5|This movie still brings a tear to my eye everytime I see Santa take off in his sleigh for the first time... and I'm 47 years old!  It just makes me feel like a child again!  I've worn out my original and am ordering a new one!  The best Christmas movie ever made!
B009ZZDNT6|4|Its good but if ur a hard sleeper then u most likley the ring is in ur dream instead of in real life, but otherwise its good.
B000V6I7WG|5|One of the best imports I've seen. This is a cult classic for sure!  Have watched more of this directors films since seeing this movie, very talented.
B00HDMMISA|5|I absolutely loved this book. I didn't end the way I expected. It was ever better.
0451196716|5|I read the long walk about a year ago, and while it amazed me to the extent that it was refreshing and unique, I was still unsure about it.  I recently read it for a second time about a week ago and realized how much I enjoyed the adventure that plays out for the main character (Ray Garraty).  Truely excellent.  I laughed, I cried, and by the end I was emotionally spent.  Great Read.
B005544TRQ|5|Awesome! Binge watching all the seasons.
B00AEFXXMI|5|The family likes this movie.  It was on time and packed well.
B004HZ76FQ|5|Take the time to read the tutorial. I didn't initially and wondered why I couldn't catch any fish. Once I got the controls down, I was hooked (pun intended)! Surprisingly fun.

B007SGLZP8|5|This is a rainy day book you will not be able to put down and regret that it ends. Love the twists and turns. I was unable to predict the outcome until near the end. Truly an enjoyable read for anyone interested in seeing an innocent man get his revenge.
B00AFCEIB0|5|I really like this app it is so easy and user friendly. It should become a part of Amazon package, it's hard to express just how easy it makes exploring the web.

1402766785|4|Great and quit clear guide - handbook for an artists. Endless field of the drawing needs every chance to upgrade your mastership
B007J4T2G8|5|I enjoy the book very much. But what disappointed me was the movie. I wasn't happy at all with it.
B00BAXFECK|4|This book has some great passages. It was well researched and the details are accurate. It was just too long..cut out some of the repetitive sections and the trajectory of reading the book would have been smoother. In the end the author through the main character appears to transcend the page in a pedantic and almost preachy way. This also would have been better left unsaid. Donna Tartt in her effort to leave no t's uncrossed has left little room for inference on the part of her audience and it comes across as a heavy hand by the end of the novel.
B00P9J58RC|5|Nice
B00HZ3C4N6|5|Enjoyable addition to the Tom Clancy canon of Jack Ryan. Chris Pine, Kiera Knightly, & Kenneth Branagh were spot on.<br />Unclear why US box office was disappointing...rest of the world seemed to buy tickets. Could be US weather mid January or other compelling news, TV, or movies in theaters at the time.
B009C7ZQM4|4|OKay. Freight was Fast
B000001Y5J|4|ok, to start with, this is as good as Nine Inch Nails gets. If ya don't own it, it's worth buyin, sure.  Tracks 98 &amp; 99 are the best on the album, i think.  but to that other guy...call me misinformed if you like, but i've delved into everything from C-Tec to Laetherstrip and everything in between.  i know my industrial and im entitled to my opinion.  kmfdm is most definitely not cheesy, unless that's what they're going for, and in many cases it is.  i'm almost inclined to agree with you on ministry, but there's no denying they've done a lot for the genre.  as far as Skinny Puppy goes, i think remix dystemper is the best album to ease someone into their music.  again, my opinion...whatever.  Anyway, broken's listenable, buy it.  but for god's sake, reznor, quit brooding and give us more of this and stuff like 'the perfect drug' and maybe i'll consider you worthy of your predecessors.  oh, and while you're at it, people, MDFMK is as good as it gets, so download a song, an if you like it, go buy like, 20 copies of the album.  thanks fer wastin yer time on me.
B006ISG9XA|5|Another great classic English novel.  Long to get through, but so beautifully written, it was a delight to read.  I will read it again and again.
B0079HLDCQ|3|I find David Baldacci's books very erratic in terms of quality.  For example, I enjoyed [[ASIN:1455518999 Zero Day]] but I thought that [[ASIN:0446561975 True Blue]] was appallingly bad.  The Innocent has a lot of his trademark characteristics and if you're a fan of his, you will no doubt enjoy it.  I thought it started really well, but it falls apart due to an absence of credibility that becomes laughable by the end of the book.<br /><br />The main character is a Government assassin called Will Robie.  The early chapters establish that he's a very efficient and clinical killer.  Then he gets an assignment which differs from his usual fare - a US citizen on US soil.  When he gets to the target's house, he realizes that it's a Government employee who's a solo mother with two young children.  He hesitates - and someone else shoots the target.  Realizing that he will also be targeted, he bolts for his pre-planned escape route.  Almost immediately, he crosses paths with a teenage girl who is also on the run after witnessing the death of her parents.<br /><br />Up to this point the story is gripping but almost immediately it takes an unlikely turn.  Instead of proceeding with his escape plans, Robie decides to go home, hide Julie the teenager and try to solve the mystery of her parents' deaths for her.  At the same time he is obliged to start working with the FBI to solve the murder of the very woman that he was hired to kill.  Meanwhile there appears to be somebody on the inside who is setting him up at every turn.<br /><br />The main character - an assassin called Robie - is an intriguing character, but he veers between being extremely smart and extremely slow on the uptake in a way that doesn't make sense unless it's purely to serve the plot.  Julie, the 14 year old girl who's just seen her parents murdered, also doesn't feel even remotely credible.  More concerned about keeping up her grades than grieving for her parents and able to make deductions that the grown ups miss.<br /><br />I'd give the first half of the book 4 stars, but it descends to 2 stars - averaging out at 3.

B00000K19E|5|this movie has it all  kung - fu , shoot outs , hacking , a plot , and a mind  melting thrill ride .

B00N6PD3GE|4|Well documented with a nice balance between presenting both interesting characters and the technology and operation of the two vessels. The author paints the two Captains in clear and creditable detail against the back drop of war.
B004Y1WCDE|4|Not as stable or solid as Air Video for iOS, but the best you will get on any Android device. Video streaming services make storing digital video every day less of a thing, but there are always one or two movies you may own that can’t be found anywhere else. It’s nice to keep those at the tip of your digital fingers in your computer so you can play them back from any android device you own.

B001I45UFC|5|Five stars are not enough.  A constellation is needed.  This book still speaks to children.  Reading this puts a child in a perspective with hisory and with the context of the childhood / adulthood dicotomy.  Children need to understand that Edmund's vile behavior is to be understood and can be forgiven.  The realities of WW-II in England, this piece of history is important and is presented in a way that that still speaks to us shether children or adults.
B00003CXCT|1|Finally the \\"original\\" trilogy of Star Wars have been release on DVD. I have to say that I have waited a long time for this and unfortunately I also have to say that I'm very disappointed. <br /> <br />I realised that the versions released would be the Special Edition from -97 witch includes CGI scenery that already looks outdated by now. Unlike many of the classic effects... <br /> <br />But what bothers me most is that Lucas have messed about with the films even more and at such scenery's that it makes me very disappointed. For example: the classic moment from ROTJ were Luke takes of Dart Vader's helmet. I think everyone remembered how exiting it was to finally get so see how Dart Vader looked under the helmet. It was a classic moment that everyone remembers! <br /> <br />In the DVD-version Sebastian Shaw's head is replaced by Hayden Christensen's from Episode III. My first question is why this would be necessary? Didn't he think a younger audience would understand Return Of The Jedi after they have watched Episode III? If thats the case I have to say: Lucas, you underestimate the knowledge of you fans! As Sebastian Shaw has past away I also think it was a bit insensitive to replace him. There are also other scenes that have been changed more or less.  <br /> <br />The documentary is simply great and very interesting but if you looking for the movies I cant recommend this box. I'm happy I bought a deluxe set of the original widescreen VHS-movies back in -93. Not the same picture or audio quality, but they are the originals to me. <br /> <br />If it isn't broke, why fix it...
B004SUDQ4U|3|The Amazon.com editorial review said: \\"This 282-minute version of Das Boot is the full-length TV series, originally shown in six parts but here edited into a seamless whole.\\"<br /><br />After reading that, I bought the Blu-Ray version (Two-Disc Collector's Set). This contains the Director's Cut (208 min.) and the Original Theatrical Cut (149 mins)<br /><br />So I was a bit surprised since I wanted the 282 minute version... I'll keep this one but...<br /><br />I know Amazon has done this before when they combine multiple reviews on different formats but I ~thought~ I was getting the 282-minute version on Blu-Ray...
B00DJWV11I|5|OMG, where do I start? Have you ever read a contemporary or new adult romance, written entirely from the male lead's perspective? Cause I hadn't before Tangled. I was laughing from pretty much page 2. Like laughing so hard I was crying. This was different and amazing and fun to read because of the humour entwined within the story. In some ways it was the typical love story, male player, meets beautiful smart woman, wants her, can't have her. The viewpoint is the deviation from the normal, and it's great! Drew Evans is successful, driven, and has no problem with the ladies, until Katherine Brooks. Katherine isn't at all what Drew expects, or is used to. She is taken. Not only is she unavailable, but she is determined, smart, beautiful, and has a very smart mouth. Their chemistry is undeniable. Drew knows what he wants, and he wants Katherine. Long story short, there is drama, hilarity, heat, more drama, more hilarity, more off the charts heat, you get the point. I loved this story. It was different, and refreshing, getting a complete story written from Drew's perspective. Ladies, the male mind is a dangerous and hilarious place to hang out for a while. If you like contemporary and new adult romances, Tangled is not to be missed. I loved the formula used here, and I am anxious to read whatever Emma Chase gives us next! Congrats on an amazing, hilarious, smart, steamy read!!
B00V3MY10E|3|Interesting.  Although it seems to be a &#34;spoof&#34;, it does carry serious content and the author is very much on target with predictions insofar as the European Union is concerned
B00KA7JIII|5|I only downloaded this app because it was free. I enjoyed it so much that I am going to find and purchase the sequel the moment I finish writing this review.
0140277447|5|Read all reviews, some guys obviously from Japan criticzied this book for faking or from PRC progangda, but , please , read it by yourself, judge by yourself.  <br />After I read this book, I give 5 star to this book, it is really worth for reading.
0393061310|5|Although this book is a bit long to read - the writer has done an excellent job at writing about the history and development of civilizations.  Educated as an engineer and not having been a history \\"buff\\" in high school or college, I found much of what was presented as fascinating.  I recommend it highly to better understand the impacts that guns, germs and steel had on the development of modern day civilization.
B000001GS4|5|Most listeners will come for the Tchaikovsky First Concerto and stay for the two-piano version of the Nutrcracker Suite. I think it should be the other way around. Argerich is a great devotee of piano duets, of course, and has had many partners over the years. In this 1983 performance she found the best of all in Nicolas Economou, the gifted Cypriot pianist and composer who died tragically in a car accident. Their partnership sounds as if one inspired musician were playing, which is the highest praise one can give a duo. It's a unique, celebratory reading.<br /><br />The piano concerto, recorded live in 1994, begins with the most thrilling first movement I ever hope to hear--not only is Argerich at her spontaneous best, but Abbado joins her in a rip-roaring orchestral accompaniment with the Berlin Phil. It really is a sahme that DG's sonics are cramped and clattery, but they hardly matter. The last two movements I would say are decidedly lower in inspiration, and the finale in particular seems to find Argerich doing nothing special beyond, of course, playing in first-rate style. Still, I will return many times to this Nutcracker (too bad there's only 20 min. of it!).
B00BWBHIUG|4|I like it cause it passes time quickly and love the color graphics. Easy enough for young kids to enjoy too

B005NFVZTM|5|Excellent prequel that explains the back story of many characters.
B00CHVJODE|5|The price & content of movie was great & I was glad there was positive feedback. I had ordered from other sites & the movies weren't quality & it took too long to receive the movie. The site also had terrible reviews so was really happy with this purchase!
B002RI9K5Y|5|one of the best books i have ever read, the characters were getting into my head.<br />Superb writing, the good and the evil portrayed in so many different ways!
B009ZQ8FQG|5|Excellent acting, educational, suspenseful, dramatic, beautiful filming, lighting, color, love the music - can't wait for 4th season! PBS rocks!
B009VSW15Y|1|The picture quality and video quality is very poor. It may be that the camera in the Fire HD just isnt that good, but I think largely that the software plays the biggest role in it. The option for 1080 resolution exists for Video mode, however, when that mode is selected the app crashes. I have to restart the app and set everything to default settings in the camera section before the video starts working again. This app has a long way to go to be a five star app from what I have seen so far.
B00275EHJG|5|What makes this movie great is it's heart and it's plot!<br /><br />Andy, the boy from the other two Toy Stories is going to college. He bundles his fav toys for the attic, for his memories or for children (when he has them). They get sent by mistake to Sunnyside daycare center. Instead of loving care they are given to the youngest, most out of control preschoolers with violence and anger management issues. Woody and Buzz Lightyear, et al, are used to hammer in pegs, for the kids to bite, spill food on.<br /><br /> At night, when adults and brats are away, the daycare center is run like a prison by sadistic toy Lotso, the Strawberry Bear with the help of a vaccuous fashion plate Ken (Ken and Barbie). Them the plot turns into the 1950's Classic Cool Hand Luke, with The Bear playing the part of The Captain (made famous by Strother Martin) and Woody playing Cool Hand Luke (the Paul Newman part) and Ken as a \\"Boss\\". Strawberry Bear doesn't say \\"What we have here is failure to communicate\\" but he does everything but, he has the same cane and the same accent, same attitude. He puts Mr. Potatohead in \\"the box\\" for punishment, (those aren't cigars in the sand!) Buzz Lightyear gets rebooted to \\"Boss\\" and romantic Latin Lover modes. Kids won't get any of these insider jokes, it will all fly over their heads, but I defy an adult to watch this movie without being near tears in places. I won't give away anymore plot, but just say its quite bittersweet to all who remember their childhood toys and earlier days and going to college. The ending is not as dark as Cool Hand Luke - it IS a kids movie!<br /><br />For those readers unfamiliar with Cool Hand, I recommend you see this movie and then rent the classic at the video store. An AFI Top 100 Movies of All Time.<br /><br />This could be the best Toy Story of the series, it certainly has the most detailed and emotional plot.<br /><br />The Next Big Thing seems to be 3D and there are more 3D movies than you can shake a stick at. Mostly trash. Hollywood should learn that it's not special effects or 3D that will bring people to the movies, it's movies with good plots, acting or in the case of Toy Story 3 good characterization. This movie has heart. Take the kids but it's really a must see for the parents who remember...it's not special effects or 3D that will bring people to the movies, it's movies with good plots, acting or in the case of Toy Story 3 good characterization.

B0027MJU00|4|Kept me guessing all the way through the book. I highly recommend it.
014241543X|4|(May contain spoilers)<br /><br />I read this book based on a recommendation. I found it to be an interesting and different story, but there were times that it was hard to get through.<br /><br />Mia is a teenager, a talented cellist who is a victim of a terrible car crash. She disassociates with her body in the accident, and her soul hovers between life and death. The question of the book becomes: is it worth it to stay on earth, and deal with the pain?<br /><br />As someone who lost a family member in a horrific car accident, almost lost another in the same wreck and has been support system to the one who survived, there were times that this was overwhelming to me. The graphic descriptions of injuries brought me back to my loved one's injuries, and i had to put the book down, but the idea that the one who was terribly injured had the ability to choose to leave and, despite the pain, stayed, that was profound to me. And that we look over the good times in life while we hover, that is hopeful.<br /><br />I don't know if I would let a pre-teen read this book. It is startlingly graphic, but I enjoyed it.

B006VRDZ44|4|Great
B0063IH60K|5|Good game
B000002GJH|5|How should I start? it's a great thing to realise that whether these fellas where with their original bands or in a \\"side-project\\" it was guaranteed to be great! just like Mad Season, Temple of The Dog is a get-together of some of Seattle's at the time - rising stars, Chris Cornell (vocals, Soundgarden) and Mother Love Bone's surviving members (later Pearl Jam) and Eddie Vedder as a guest (who, obviously started singing in Pearl Jam after this...). The point of this collaboration was to honour the late and great Andrew Wood (singer of Mother Love Bone..) and most of the songs are about him, if not directly about his death, then just about him, some songs fortunately have other themes, and Cornell get more \\"Soundgarden\\" on atleast such tracks as 'Your Savior'. The main weight is however on the softer, saddish and very powerful ones 'Say Hello To Heaven' which is so hopeful, that it simply wishes the best for Andy Wood up there in heaven. 'Hunger Strike' was a minimal hit, and is one of the highlights here, again a very Cornell-highlighted song, he's just awesome on this song, everybody should hear this song, is more than brilliant! 'Times of Trouble' is poppy, but so different in a way from a \\"typical\\" Cornell song, the chorus is just so dyin' magnificent, much thanks to the sensitive piano riff. The rest is grand too, but these songs are the most notable. One thing is a slightly different with TOTD compared to any other grunge line-up, these songs really sound 1991, today I really feel 1991 when I listen to these tracks, they're not as timeless in the same sense as Soundgarden's or PJ's songs, but they still sound great...a must-have for alternative fans!!
B000VMFDW2|5|Great book. I watched The Pacific mini series on Amazon Prime and it rekindled my old interest in World War II history. I was particularly impressed  with E.B. Sledge so I got the book on my Kindle. Great read, great insight into the life of a Marine during those terrible battles and the life changing toll it took on them.
B00H8AXJR6|3|Interesting start to the movie, but the end was not that good.  Girl is into the guy too much with the guy not even trying too much...
B00H2EQFBK|5|Awesome show, great story line... tons of action, would recommend this to anyone! Love the vistas also - very interesting watch!
B004MC8CA2|1|I DID like this...as in past tense.  Now I can't access my plan no matter what I do, it says it has stopped.  I've deleted it from my kindle and rebooted it many times.  Still won't work.  It's a royal pain.
B000PTYP5C|2|How weird that the departure of a keyboardist can lead to the demise of a band's quality, but there has NOT been a great album from this band since \\"Awake\\". The opening tracks on \\"Scenes from a Memory\\" and a couple songs I found on Limewire that don't even appear on \\"Train of Thought\\" even though they came out at the same time are the ONLY comparable tunes this band has come up with since \\"Awake\\".  Everything else has been so boring and pointless that it doesn't even matter these guys are so talented... the music has no rock 'n' roll soul whatsoever, and the lyrics are either a ripoff of \\"Operation Mindcrime\\" or some boring diatribe that doesn't contain the grabbing horror and imaginative images that the albums with Moore contained.  Thus, I'm 99.9% sure this new album is as disappointing as everything they've done this millenium, and I will not be giving it the time of day.
B006VRDZ44|5|Great show
B000SEGUDE|4|I don't consider this a bad thing:This is one of those films that makes you wish you had read the book first, but I had not, so I am reading it now. I will probably watch the movie again after I finish the book.<br /><br />As someone who is interested in string theory, I was captivated by the film's intermingling of time and space. Wouldn't it be delicious if there was a place in time and space where we could actually &#34;get it right&#34; -- especially at those crossroads where we feel we have erred so auspiciously on this plane?

B005D9MUWY|3|I love the layout of this keyboard. It's not often that you find a properly laid out numpad when you go to the numbers mode of the KB. I also like the idea of it \\"knowing\\" which word you will use next, but it's this very feature that kinda doesn't sit well with me. With SwiftKey X, not only am I slower at typing than I am with Swype, but I feel like I have to think too much to use it. Typing for me is brainless. Using SwiftKey isn't, because you look up and your next word isn't there. So you press the first key and look for your word. Still isn't there, so you press the next key and look for your word. Lather, rinse, & repeat. Add to that the fact that I feel like it's sometimes trying to tell me what my next word *should* be - rather than me typing the message I want, I end up saying something else and then wondering what on Earth I meant to say...
B00ESGYQWA|1|Bizarre treatment of a Shakespeare Classic - I almost expected a rap at one point.  Silly silly silly. Plus in parts unintelligible
B00I3ULXBY|5|Love this case. It goes really well with the white gs5. Only thing I would change is that the buttons almost blend too well with the sides of the case to the point I don't know where they are if I try to press them without looking at my phone. Anyway, that's not enough to dock it any points. I haven't dropped my phone yet so there isn't anything to say regarding that.

B00B2JSRAS|5|Loved this book! Pam writes using humor, great examples, plain language, and easy experiments. I can't believe I hadn't read it before, but maybe I'd needed to read the other dozens I've already read about manifesting and LOA before my heart and brain was ready for this one. I'm definitely buying the next one, E3!
B000I0D450|5|high suspense.<br />Accomplished actors
B004UHF51S|5|This cd is a real masterpiece. Once again Michael Franks demonstrates that he is a great singer and a great songwriter. Like always, on Time Together he works with a group of outstanding musicians. It all sounds very familiar with famous names like Will Lee on bass, David Spinozza on guitar and Jerry Marotta on drums, amongst many others. The atmosphere reminds me to The Art of Tea and Sleeping Gipsy, which I think are still his best albums. I am already looking forward to the next album (hopefully featuring the good old Crusaders, or at least Joe Sample on piano).

0767802659|1|Whoever this movie appeals to - and there seem to be a lot of you out there - I doubt if many of them are Heinlein fans. To take just two things that are drastically wrong with the movie:<br />1. &quot;Starship  Troopers&quot; without powered suits is like &quot;Midway&quot; without  aircraft carriers. It's a completely different story. If Verhoeven couldn't  hack the powered suits - and I find that hard to believe - he should have  left the story till the technology caught up. The whole idea is that the MI  have superior equipment, which makes up for lack of numbers.<br />2. The  &quot;anti-fascist satire&quot; angle involves either completely (wilfully)  misunderstanding everything Heinlein was trying to say, or simply ignoring  it. What Verhoeven portrays as &quot;fascism&quot; is what Heinlein was  recommending! He was pointing out that you can't stay free indefinitely  unless you are willing to fight. That fighting involves a good chance of  dying, and people who aren't willing to take that chance don't deserve to  enjoy the benefits. This is a familiar theme to Americans - &quot;the tree  of liberty must be watered with the blood of patriots&quot; - although it  is deeply unfashionable right now.<br />Bottom line - Verhoeven and his crew  took a brilliant SF novel with a great action plot and some very deep moral  ideas behind it, and turned it into a sad quasi-futuristic horror story  that makes &quot;Alien&quot; look sophisticated.

B00288KNJU|5|Directed by Henry Selick, Coraline is a full length, \\"stop motion\\" style animated feature.  Why should you care who Henry Selick is?  Because he is the director of such other stop motion films as \\"James and the Giant Peach\\" and a little movie called \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas!\\"  \\"Wait what?!\\" you may be saying.  \\"Didn't Tim Burton direct The Nightmare Before Christmas?\\"  No!  No I say!  While it was very much his brain child, Tim Burton was actually the producer!  Now that that's out of the way, on to the story!<br /><br />The screenplay is based off of a story by celebrated fantasy author Neil Gaiman.  In case his name isn't immediately recognizable to you, perhaps you might recognize some of his other literary work: American Gods, Marvel Comics' \\"1602\\" & his \\"Eternals\\" re-imagining as well as DC Comics' \\"Sandman\\" series.  Perhaps most memorable to the average moviegoer would be \\"Stardust,\\" which was made into a live-action film in 2007.<br /><br />The one and only possible downside to Coraline's wonderful story is perhaps that it is VERY reminiscent of Alice in Wonderland.  If you can get past that by seeing the plot as more of a \\"shout out\\" than a rip-off, you are in store for a thoroughly entertaining movie full of excitement and charm.  Coraline moves at a steady pace so as not to lose the viewer.  No waiting for something interesting to happen here!  Without spoiling too much for you, Coraline is a young girl who winds up in a new home that carries some old secrets.  Her inattentive parents encourage her to explore and she soon winds up in an alternate reality where things seem quite wonderful...for now.  There are many colorful and memorable characters she encounters and every one of them has a purpose.  Some may find the plot a little cliché but there are still some twists and turns before the credits roll.  Be warned though.  Those with children 8 years old or under may want to wait on this film due to potentially scary content.  Also, there is a verystrange but, in my personal opinion, harmless scene in which an overweight senior citizen is wearing very little.<br /><br />Visually, this is one of those movies that you could watch without any sound and still be entertained.  Fantastic color-schemes and great set & character designs keep you waiting to see what treats the next scene will hold.  Note: The version I saw was in 3D and while it was cool and all, it wasn't really necessary.  If it's the only version that you can get ahold of than don't hesitate but if you have a choice you may want to choose the more affordable standard version.  Especially if you have small children likely to take off the glasses, already wear glasses or are prone to headache or disorientation.<br /><br />The voice acting was good for me because it didn't fall into the common trap of making you think of the well known actor doing the voicework.  This is partially because many of the actors were unknown to me and partially because Dakota Fanning, Teri Hatcher & Ian McShane did a fine job.  They didn't sound too much like themselves or any of their previous characters, especially Dakota.<br /><br />The musical score was the typical fair for this type of movie but not bad by any means.  At times it sounds like it was done by Danny Elfman but it was actually scored by French composer Bruno Coulais.  This movie is NOT A MUSICAL by the way so if that was likely to put you off it is no longer an excuse.<br /><br />Coraline wraps up at a tidy 1 hour and 40 minutes which is not too long for kids with short attention spans (and tiny bladders) and not so short as to feel rushed.  Overall I LOVED this movie and can't recommend that you see it enough.  It has everything to keep anyone entertained, kids and adults alike.
B007K3JFUQ|5|Once again pairing up Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law as the wise cracking sleuths this movie proves Guy Ritchies staying power.
B006ZAZ31U|5|WOW! Just WOW!!! I think everyone should run, not walk, to get their copy of this book! It is an outstanding story of Navy Seal Adam Brown's life and ultimate sacrifice in service to this country. While this book's main focus is Adam Brown, it also brings to light the struggles and sacrifices of each military man and woman along with their families. I, for one, am thankful for the men and women who have fought and are fighting for the freedoms we tend to take for granted.
B004FGMDOQ|5|Wonderful book which I found hard to put down.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and found the pictures helped with the believability.
B00C81LYH2|5|My daughter collects the Holiday Barbie every year. I always try to get her when she first makes it to the stores. This year, I found the African American one but not the Caucasian one in the stores. I also priced her at the store. She was $10 cheaper on Amazon! She was delivered 2 days after I ordered! I can't wait til Christmas when she opens her Barbie!

B00V4JHNZG|5|Wow! Great movie, great effects. Never had the patience to read the Hobbit series so the movie was exciting to see. Any more sequels?
B005COO1X6|2|I love Stephen King. I've been reading his books since I was 12 or 13, and he's the writer I judge all other writers by. Anyone who knows me knows how it pains me to give something he wrote two stars. The sad fact is, I'm pretty sure if anyone else had written this I'd only give it one star. I can't seem to bring myself to take off the 2nd star though the book doesn't really deserve it.<br /><br />I bought this book for my Kindle, happy to give my old friend SK my $2.99. I was surprised when the book ended abruptly at 80%, and the other 20% was a preview of his new novel coming out in November. A cheap ploy, especially considering everyone's going to buy it already so he hardly needs to advertise.<br /><br />The story opened up with a 10 year old kid, and I found myself wondering if SK has finally gotten too old to write children believably. He has written many child characters I've adored - The kids in It, Jake Chambers, Travelin' Jack, etc etc. The kid in this book, Pete, felt incongruous somehow. Not genuine. The story, about a car that's really an alien that eats people, was pretty stupid, but really, a lot of his stories sound stupid in description. I remember a short story about some plastic teeth that came to life and killed people and I liked that one. This one just felt contrived, like he didn't really care about it any more than I did as I was reading it.<br /><br />But what really got me, more than anything else, was the AT&T plug. The cop was playing Words With Friends on his iPad, internet provided by AT&T. That's almost exactly how he said it. I have a very hard time forgiving blatant product placement. It's bad enough on TV; it's worse in books. I don't see how SK could possibly need money and I'd be shocked to hear AT&T had ever inspired that kind of loyalty in anyone, to earn a mention like that. Reading it from my very favorite author of all time made me feel dirty.<br /><br />All in all, I wish I'd not read this story at all.
B00CNQ7HAU|5|A REAL PAGE TURNER. I COULDN'T WAIT TO FIND OUT WHO WINS THIS CASE. John Grisham has done it again.
B007J4T2G8|5|Amazing!!!
B007PVHMCG|3|Product is very small and made for the ages 10+ easily.  Not for the younger kids.  Pieces are very small!
B003Y5H5FG|4|Haven't seen this movie? You need too.
B009NY43NY|1|An adequate foundation has not been layed to end with a Sookie / Sam HEA. And the peak we are presented? A lame roll in the hay and a two-stepping good time with fancy cowboy boots. Happily ever after with Mr. Safe? Cop out Ms. Harris. Glad you are moving on.
B00FAX6XQC|4|He said he really enjoys the game and it has kept his interest for quite some time. A couple of his friends have enjoyed it too.
B008JGSM6G|5|This is a very fun game that becomes more challenging as you solve the puzzle.  It is a good space visualization exercise as well as brain teaser exercise.  I love it!
B008602KQI|5|Well, let me just say in my opinion about how well I think the movie has told the story I read in the book. AWESOME..WELL DONE!!<br />The movie did such a good job with Katniss and Peeta's feelings about actually \\"in the games\\" made me cry and \\" feel\\" right along with the actors!!  Kudos!!  After watching this dvd I went right back to reading the book..fantastic!!!<br />I thank you for bringing it on screen! It showed me just how lucky I am..we all are.. to live in the world we do live in, even with all the \\"stuff\\" that is going on, good and bad.  We are lucky..think about it for a minute, after watching this movie where would you be living???
B00BHMF578|5|Very, very, good.
B0042VJ1PI|5|Great book!  Loved the pace which the book moves.  Very entertaining for sure.  If you like love Castle you will like/love Nikki Heat books they are great!
B0085Z8F4A|5|I have seen this film twice, both times IMAX 3D, both times with my wife and 11-year-old son.  This is my review after seeing it the first time:<br /><br />Let me say at the outset I am more of a fan of Ridley Scott's work generally than I am of Alien per se, although I have enjoyed it and all of its successors (albeit in varying degrees). But I am much more of a fan of Blade Runner than Alien, for example, and also films of his like Black Rain, Someone To Watch Over Me, Kingdom of Heaven and of course Gladiator. So it was with tremendous anticipation that I awaited this film, but NOT because it necessarily had anything whatsoever to do with Alien.<br /><br />I followed every bit of the viral marketing campaign and all the tidbits in places like this (Prometheus-Movie.com), and read a lot of pro and con reviews before I got to see the film. I have to tell you that exposure to all the spoilers I encountered by doing this did not reduce my viewing experience one bit.<br /><br />I brought my wife (also a big Ridley Scott fan) and my 11 year old (he is very mature for his age), who had been watching Alien, Aliens, and Alien Resurrection on the Sci Fi channel, so he knew all about facehuggers and chestbursters. We saw it in IMAX 3D which is definitely the way to see it.<br /><br />I have to say, my mind was totally blown by this film. I was absolutely riveted for the entire duration. I thought that among the key characters there was very rich but very subtle interplay that gave deep insights into their motivations and personalities. Of course, Fassbender's portrayal of David was sheer genius and may get him an Oscar.<br /><br />And the visuals of the film were peerless. It looked real and I was totally lost in the experience. The pacing was great, it moved faster and faster which dragged you along for one hell of a ride. It is the \\"2001\\" of our time.<br /><br />So many aspects of this film are still churning around in my head, but the key one that is surfacing is that this was NOT a scientific mission in the sense we think of it (the way NASA would execute it), it was a last ditch attempt of a dying man with virtually unlimited resources at his disposal to try and find something, anything, to cheat his death. There are multiple layers of story wrapped around this that will make for much pondering (and repeat viewing), but that is the core.<br /><br />The people who complain that this doesn't answer all their questions about Alien or the SJs etc. are missing the point. In all cases of science, or anything for that matter, the answers you get do really lead only to more questions. The same way in Blade Runner (Director's Cut) where it ended with Deckard and Rachel leaving Deckard's apartment, reaching for a future together into the unknown, Prometheus leaves many things open for us to ponder and wonder at. That's what makes it a great piece of art, to me, as opposed to something that sewed up loose ends in a pedestrian fashion.<br /><br />In time this will be viewed with the same reverence as 2001 and Blade Runner, for sure. For me, it already is.<br /><br />Thanks for reading.<br /><br />*******************************************************************************************************************************************************************<br />This is my review after seeing it the second time:<br /><br />I am typing this 39000 feet over Colorado (gotta love Virgin America). So, my wife, son and I saw Prometheus for the second time (again in IMAX 3D) and we still loved it. I noticed the 3D more this time...it is very subtle, it just adds a \\"hyper real\\" feel to the film until the star map, and then whoa!<br /><br />I also saw a number of things I missed the first time. I had missed the fact that you could hear the Engineers talking to each other in the hologram in the control room of the Juggernaut. But mostly I missed some of the things Weyland said.<br /><br />Now it seems much more clear to me. To me, the film really is about Weyland and his attempt to cheat death, and his willingness to use anyone or anything to that end. That is what drives the plot, even though that is not evident from the start.<br /><br />I think with the perspective of time, people will see this as the equal of Blade Runner or even surpassing it. And what other movie in recent memory has kept you thinking about it, talking about it, arguing about it. That is what separates a work of art from just a movie.<br /><br />******************************************************************************************************************************************************************<br /><br />In closing, after thinking about it another week or so, the only thing I would add to the above is to emphasize the \\"Blade Runner\\" like aspects, in the study of David as a character, as a PERSON, with his motivations and, yes, emotions.  A fantastic film.  Even my wife wanted to see it a second time. All these Alien junkies are complaining because it didn't spell out in crayon all the questions raised in Alien. Guess what? IT WAS NOT A PREQUEL. I feel sorry for these folks because a great movie was right in front of their faces and they were too blinded by their expectations to even see it.  2001 left a lot of questions hanging, as did Blade Runner...as did the beloved Alien.
B000002UAX|5|A classic.  Everything great about the Beatles can be found here.  Yes, it is a self-indulgent album with several tracks that would have not sat right on any other one of their records.  But that's part of the genius of this  album- it's all over the map.  Simply one of the great rock albums of  all-time.
B00JBGWP3Y|5|excellent movie
0425170349|1|Over the years I have read numerous Clancy books, and I must say that I have enjoyed almost all of them, yet I have noticed that the quality has gone down-hill since Red October. So, when Rainbow Six came out, I decided to borrow it from the library rather than buy it. This proved to be a wise decision.<br />Firstly, the plot is utterly implauseable and could have been thought up by a ten year-old child, consisting as it does of back-to-back action sequences connected by a thin and highly improbable thread. Secondly, the characters lack any individuality, all sounding the same and falling into predictable cliches according to their nationality. No wonder so many people have been insulted. In my case, I was particularly annoyed by the portrayal of the IRA (or perhaps a break-away faction of the IRA, we are never told which organisation the terrorists actually belong to.) All the Irish characters are mere stereotypes, little more than Leapreachauns with AK-47s.<br />Furthermore, the author seems to have little grasp of the political reality of present-day Europe. Does he actually belive that Germany, or especially France, would agree to the setting up of a US-led swat-team and allow them free reign throughout Europe. Does he think that Austria, Switzerland and Spain (which has far more experience in dealing with terrorism than the US) would immediately come running to the USA for help when faced with a domestic terrorist incident. Dream on Tom, remember, you're writing thrillers, not fantasy.<br />My advice is - don't buy this book, spend your money on a novel written by somebody who has bothered to do his research and hired a competent editor.
B0058BI864|5|This has been one of my favorite shows from the beginning.  I think I know all the scripts<br />by heart.

B000PMLFRA|5|Enjoyed every minute of all 3 films. Brought back lots of memories. I recommend this to everyone. The quality was great.
B00GINENG0|3|My son loves this.
B00AMBH70S|3|This movie was ok, but does not seem as original as the first series.  Does an ok job of explaining some of the background of the \\"programs\\", but is not really consistent with the \\"Behavioral Modification\\" theory mentioned in the first Bourne movie.  Overall, I think I would rather watch those movies Bourne Supremacy again than watch this movie.
1484716469|5|My daughter loves this book whether it's at bedtime or any time of the day. It's fun light hearted and perfect for little girls who love the disney princesses!
B0042816YK|3|I am a big fan of Julia Roberts but I must say this movie is average at best. The story is good and Julia's performance is great but the movie is not as great as I thought.
B00G2SIW7M|5|This album rocks! My childrens loves the arcades fired- dasncing and singing to all the old hits!
B004VD3YIM|3|Easy to add cameras, has a professional look and feel..BUT...none of the camera control features work. None, no pan/tilt, presets, na da...
B00NOPQU2K|4|This will be one of the stand out novels of 2015 I believe. I am sick of it being yet another book that is being compared to Gone Girl. Pfft to that. I think this is way better anyway, but can we stop the comparisons now? I really enjoyed every minute of The Girl on the Train.<br /><br />The Girl on the Train just swept me away into a reading world where from the second half of the book on I did not do anything but let my eyes absorb and my imagination do it's thing. It was brilliant. I will admit it was a little bit confusing at first as I tried to piece together who was who and who was talking in the chapter but that soon subsided until I was totally enthralled and hooked.<br /><br />Rachel catches the same commuter train every morning. She knows it will wait at the same signal each time, overlooking a row of back gardens. She’s even started to feel like she knows the people who live in one of the houses. ‘Jess and Jason’, she calls them. Their life – as she sees it – is perfect. If only Rachel could be that happy.<br /><br />And then she sees something shocking. It’s only a minute until the train moves on, but it’s enough.<br /><br />Now everything’s changed. Now Rachel has a chance to become a part of the lives she’s only watched from afar.<br /><br />Now they’ll see; she’s much more than just the girl on the train…<br /><br />This book is full of psychological twists and turns, just when you think you have it all worked out it shifts gears and direction, then again, then again until you are resigned to the fact you may truly not know until the end. With an undercurrent of tension and creepy factor it's a great book, it really knows how to suck you in.<br /><br />The plot builds cleverly until you are desperate to know the truth and by the time you get it you are exhausted from being on edge for it. The characters are all really interesting with light and shade in all, not everybody is who they seem to be, who can you trust? What is the truth? Take my advice and try to not work it out as you will get brain fuddle.<br /><br />A fantastic 2015 release, put this one on your list for sure this year. It's a winner. 4.5 stars from me. It did not reach 5 stars only due to me being a touch confused as to what was going on in the first few chapters, but maybe I am just a bit stoooopid. Enjoy this one!ruth?

0316776963|4|With sardonic wit and an eye for the absurd, David Sedaris gives hyperbolic treatment and philosophical consideration to what would otherwise be a mundane life.  And just when it seems that his aresenal of experiences is depleted, he invites us to witness from the perspective of his unfettered imagnination.  We oblige, of course, because by now this neurotic maladroit is our friend, his fantasies of being a celebrated and sought-after hero are our own, and we are more like him than we ever dared to admit.
B008IYR2BA|5|Another great season of Dexter. Pins and needles! I was on edge the whole time. If you haven't seen it you must.
B002B4AAS0|3|Heard the Eels \\"Beginner's Luck\\" while driving down the road in Upstate NY,  decided I wanted to hear more and dl'd this CD through Amazon MP3.  Supposed to be a high bitrate and good audio quality.  But I find the tracks to be distorted, especially \\"Beginner's Luck\\".  I wonder if it's just me or is it a problem with Amazon's MP3 model.   I have downloaded many tracks this way and generally they are acceptable, but a few had low volume and then these are distorted.     Great tracks though.  the \\"3\\" has to do with the quality of the mp3's.
B001QD3JYE|5|I absolutely LOVE this movie! I only watched it because I love Johnny Depp But it was a great movie regardless. Johnny Depp makes the character perfect though. I do realize that not everything in the movie is 100% accurate but it is very entertaining and gives you a good look into how drugs got big in America.
0446310786|5|This is my favorite book. My uncle bought it for me when I was twelve, and at the time I thought, okay, I'll read it . . . one day. A couple months later I finally picked it up, and couldn't put it down. <BR>To Kill a Mockingbird is a profound novel because it deals with a topic no one can understand (racism) but tells it in a language everybody can understand (the narrator is a little girl named Scout). Scout's view of the world at the beginning of the novel is like that of any other child: innocent. You know, the lies we all used to believe, that everybody on earth is nice and kind and that we all love each other, etc., etc. But then Scout, her brother Jem, and her friend Dill (who is based on Harper Lee's childhood friend, Truman Capote) are compelled to face reality all of a sudden when their father defends a black man on trial for rape. The children learn the hard truths of life, that this world isn't always a pleasant place after all. <BR>But what is so extraordinary about Scout is that she never speaks with hate. She speaks with a child's innocence, and describes complex things in a child's way, which makes it easier to understand. I don't think this book would have been the same if Atticus had told the story, or if this had been told in third-person point of view. Then it would have lacked its young narrator's frankness. <BR>There aren't enough words to describe To Kill a Mockingbird. This is by far the best book I have ever read, and perhaps the greatest contribution an American writer has made to the literary world. To put it simply, this book should be read by everyone. If we all looked at this world as Scout does in this book, maybe this world would be a better place.
B004UFEJW6|5|Very hard but the Wright way!

0156012197|4|Antoine de Saint-Exupery's book is often thought to be a children's novel, and I admit, when my class and I started reading it, we all thought it was a bit below our level of reading.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Saint-Exupery's tale shows what we all lost when we made the transition from child to adult, when we got involved in \\"matters of consequence\\" and stopped using our imaginations.  I would highly reccommend this book to anyone who misses seeing the good in the world.  This book showed me that innocence can still be found in such a world of corruption and violence, we just need to know where to look for it.  If you have children, are around them, or are just a child at heart, this is a book that you need to read.  It raises the question as to whether children are really cute and naieve, or if we as adults merely forgot to look at the drawing close enough.  It is a tale of friendship, imagination, and love.  After reading this book, I doubt anyone can look up at the stars and not smile.
B0031KC8OC|3|It's ok. Good enough to keep my interest, but not something I would want to re-watch.
B001HPP2X2|5|A friend told me about Dexter. Great drama, stuff that hasn't been done before. Some Laughs. Season 2 is great also, we stayed up hours past our bedtime watching the entire season 2 & can't wait to see 3.

0765318741|5|This was a great book!! It is so much better than the movie. Also the movie had changed the story way too much.  If you saw the movie and then read the book, you will be disappointed in the movie.  Also its interesting to note that this book was written in 1954 and takes place in 1976.  Also the ending was interesting.  Included in this book is not only the story \\"I am Legend,\\" but also contains other short stories created by Richard Matheson. But I would definently recommend this to anyone who was interested by the movie and want to read the actual book which is way better.
1603580557|5|One of the best books on systems thinking for someone who is a beginner.  It's clear, persuasive, and written well.
B00H3JHE0K|5|It doesn't matter where you are on the music appreciation spectrum.... or how old you are.... or what music first grabbed your mind and body - - you owe it to your very soul to skip a few lattes ( because that is all the money it will take), go and buy this Blu-ray or DVD for your home library! Yes buy - because once you pop it in your player you will want to watch it over and over again.... you'll also want to show this to everyone you know - even people you can barely stand to be in the same room with for almost two hours!! Trust me.... Muscle Shoals

B0006284JQ|4|Okay, so this girl ain't got Mariah Carey's chops but few female artists do these days. But in her early days she could sing, even if mediocre at that. Still there is no denying Spears' musical power to persuade regardless if her singing talents may be lacking. From her very bubblegum beginnings in 1998-1999 (listed here \\"...Baby One More Time,\\" \\"Sometimes\\" and \\"Crazy\\") to her latest sophisticated techno-pop (\\"Me Against the Music,\\" \\"Toxic\\" and \\"Outrageous\\"), Britney, in a whirlwind six year span, has become the epitome of the perfectly packaged pop star. Her stance as the industry's reigning No. 1 female entertainer is only intensified here on her first Greatest Hits album. Call her a skank, call her a sellout or call her a bad influence; but amazingly Spears has been able to maintain on top through all the accusations and become the fastest selling female performer in history. On this her Greatest Hits record, the now-24 year-old Britney is out to create even more of a stir since a Greatest Hits is usually after 10 years in the business, and she has only six. But the important thing to realize (compared to other Greatest compilations like Mandy Moore's, for example) is that Britney Spears is such a cultural phenomenon that only she can put out such a record and keep it at the forefront in sales. Almost every track on this album has been a sensation on the charts, from her award-winning, Grammy-nominated smash debut \\"...Baby One More Time\\" to 2000's best song (also Grammy-nominated) \\"Oops!...I Did It Again,\\" from mature (also Grammy-nominated) \\"I'm a Slave 4 U\\" to 2004's best single and Grammy-winning \\"Toxic.\\" Sure, it has its low moments, like the I-can't-believe-it-was-a-single \\"Boys\\" and the fact that it's missing vocally-decent (in Spears terms, of course) songs like \\"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know,\\" \\"Born To Make You Happy\\" and \\"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart,\\" but the cover art alone is more than enough of a reason to purchase this CD. So love her or hate her, that doesn't matter, folks, because whether you like her or not, Britney Spears is a musical force to be reckoned with.
B00005JLYW|5|Anyone who is rating this movie with one star doesn't understand the goal of the movie.  The editorial review describes this movie perfectly.  It's a fun, visually dazzling, no-brainer, movie.  It's not supposed to have a crazy, complex plot or profound dialogue.  It's a release - pure and simple.  Get lost in the fun of this movie and turn off the over-analytical part of your brain!
B00AIUUXHC|4|I like the because it is about sharks and I am a huge fan of sharks. But there are some things I did not like. Like this I get hurt from going to deep in the sea and the hammer head sharks kill you in one hit. So I liked the game but did not love it
B004XUMMFE|5|Was like revisiting an old friend - loved the series originally and was fun to &#34;go back in time&#34; and watch it again.
B000002UB6|5|I purchased this to replace my scratched up record I purchased back when I was 14-quite a while ago.  Enjoying the music and great memories; creating new ones with my kids!

B00I1XYDUQ|5|When the world's most celebrated but relatively unknown bass player finally gets around to making his own album (after 30 some years and over 1,000 albums backing every known major recording artist around the world), it's time for everyone to sit up and take notice. And the breadth of his artistry (last year he played on Daft Punk's &#34;Get Lucky&#34; and Andrea Bocelli's &#34;Passione&#34;) is front and center. There are tracks here to please everyone from the most hardcore jazz aficionado to rock and RnB fan, with some smooth jazz, a Beatle cover and the best rendition of &#34;America The Beautful&#34; that you've ever heard. I'm glad I ordered the physical CD with all the credits and liner notes as well as the Amazon mp3 version to listen to on the go. Get it - if you love all styles of contemporary music, you won't be disappointed.
B000006NUW|5|A well-assembled box set containing just some of Motown's most golden and definitive classics. Nobody knew Motown Records was going to take off in the way it did. Berry Gordy intended to use his artists to break down the then racial barriers, intending to encapsulate a golden and distinct sound that would not only please a black audience but would too appeal to whites. Berry Gordys visions for the company paid off. Key artists like Diana Ross, Marvin Gaye, Smokey Robinson and Stevie Wonder attracted a huge following from both blacks and whites. Seemingly echoing the restrictions of ghetto life in Detroit (which is where Motown began) was the effective, bluesey Money (Thats What I Want) by Barret Strong, Motowns debut release. There is a raw, earthy feel to the classic that has stood the test of time impecably well. There is a strong injection of Rock and Roll on Motowns early releases though they found a more commercially favourable sound with vast elements of pop neatly blended into the production with The Marvelettes famous classic, Please Mr. Postman. The Marvelettes were Motowns premier female group and took the credit of delivering Motown its first chart topper. The Marvelettes didn't have an entirley successful run at Motown. Though they pumped out a sprinkling of fantastic hits eratically through the duration of the decade, their acheivements were pretty limited, probably as they were overshadowed by Martha Reeves And The Vandellas who too admitedly found themselves overshadowed by Motowns biggest act, Diana Ross And The Supremes. Both Martha and the Vandellas and Diana and the Supremes had individual and unique qualities of their own. A vast selection of Martha Reeves finest recordings turn up here from the sassy Come And Get These Memories, the pop masterpiece Heat Wave (though I have to admit I actually prefer Diana Ross' version of it which was featured on The Supremes Sing Holland Dozier Holland album) and the rolling Dancing In The Streets. Just listening to the sheer volume and power of Reeves voice makes you appreciate her often over-looked vocal talents. Diana Ross had a much softer soprano which had soulful qualities, ozzing heavy emotion and genuine feeling that showed subtle hints of a raw vulnreability in her vocal delivery and neatly surfboarded along Motowns complex musical arrangements. Many of their classics are here including the finest of their career with the raw, gritty Love Child and their breathtakingly beautiful ballad, Someday We'll Be Together. Holland Dozier Holland was the main driving force behind a lot of Motowns most golden classics. They wrote and assembled some of the most remarkable pieces of music for both Diana Ross and the fantasic  Four Tops. Lead singer, Levi Stubbs rocketing voice was just amazing and even managed to give you goose bumps. Several of their most famous classics turn up here including their pair of U.S chart toppers, I Can't Help Myself and the hauntingly atmospheric Reach Out I'll Be There. The Temptations were one of Motowns hottest and most versatile acts. The splitting of lead vocal duties between the smooth, sensuous sound of Eddie Kendricks falsetto combined with the explosive volume of David Ruffins more forceful delivery marked an interesting transistion in their work. Tracks like the jamming Get Ready and My Girl respectivley show up on this box set though also highlights some of their most exciting work from the early 70's with the undertones of hot, pulsating funk on Cloud Nine, which saw Dennis Edwards being lead vocalist after the swift departure of David Ruffin and the utterly fantastic classic, Ball Of Confusion, divulging into contemporary social issues.  Smokey Robinson was a key artist at Motown who wrote some timeless music and was generally an all-round and highly versatile entertainer. Some of his most enthralling work is on here such as the infectious sounds of The Tears Of A Clown and the breathtakingly beautiful, The Tracks Of My Tears. StevieWonder was a sheer genius and some of his greatest work is included here, from the masterpiece production of Fingertips to the playful funk of Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours. Marvin Gaye was another one of Motowns definitive artists. His work progresed from the formulaic sounds of Motown on tracks like Stubborn Kind Of Fellow to the masterpiece of I Heard It Through The Grapevine to the profound political statements expressed on the timeless Whats Going On that is deservedly included on here. There is oddly only 1 offering from Diana Ross' solo career with the absolutley magnificent, golden Soul classic, Ain't No Mountin High Enough. Ashford and Simpson always knew how to make good records for Diana Ross and that tracks is one of the many landmarks in her career. You just get goose bumps as that exalting and rip-roaring climax builds and Diana effectivley talks through the verses, emphasising her truly sensual vocal style.<BR>This box set hosts so many classics thats its impossible to chronicle them all but there are some surprisingly rare features on here such as a version of I Can't Give Back The Love I Feel For You by Rita Wright (later covered by Diana Ross on her Surrender album) and some offerings from the over-looked Brenda Holloway. Amongst other familiar classics are the fantastic and the at-the-time controversial nature of Edwin Starr's rip-roaring War, the beautiful This Old Heart Of Mine Is Weak For You by the highly underated The Isley Brothers, the sensational ShotGun by Junior Walker And The All Stars who bought a unique touch of Jazz to their mainstream sound of Soul/R&B/Pop, Needle In A haystack by The Velvettes, ABC by The Jackson 5 (featuring a young, nasal sounding Michael Jackson),Stoned Love by Thr Supremes (possibly their best post-Ross recording featuring Jean Terrell as lead vocalist) and the unforgetable classic, Nowhere To Run by Martha Reeves And The Vandellas. The lists could go on and on and on but the whole box set deserves a thorough listen! Consistently bubbling with red hot, distinct and positivley infectious musical arrangements, Motown opened many doors for black singers and broke down many racial barriers. The golden Motown sound ceased to exist after its headquarters move from Detroit to L.A but all the magic is clearly encapsulated on here. Motown remains a key landmark in the history of black music and also made a significant impact in Pop music all together. Never has there been a record label that has managed to capture and encapsulate such a unique, distinct sound with such a wide range of diverse singing talents. The classics on here are timeless and enthralling. Hitsville USA: The Motown Singles Collection is both superb and timeless but also essential to any serious Soul/R&B collection!
0671027344|5|this is the best book ive ever read and if i could, id buy copies for everyone on earth. <br />its short, full of emotion and superb-delicious-intense-great-and-wonderful-fantastic writing! follow the main character Charlie as he enters his first year of high school and experiences new things for the first time. he writes letters to no one (the reader) and you get to watch as his story unfolds into somewhat of a surprise ending. (i didnt even catch on to it the first time i read it and i still loved the book. the second time around i finally understood what had happened and it was like reading it for the first time all over again.) <br />charlie is a wallflower and you will fall in love with him and the way his mind works. i promise.

B000LC55F2|5|For the family movie buff....
B0083GPDBO|5|With a minimalist poster that indicates only the setting (Seattle), the film's title, mysterious figures in the sky, a tag line \\"what are you capable of?\\", a Facebook page and Twitter hashtag and trailer that appears to show everything but gives away nothing (itself a sly commentary on the current trend in trailers to show everything AND give away pretty much everything) the marketing of Chronicle felt very much like a product of the 21st century, with the requisite dose of virality built in. Whether this was a product of design (I like to think it was) or necessity, as the film's cast s made up of relatively unknown, mostly TV actors doesn't really matter as it was more than enough to get me to see it the first chance I had (a weekday morning in a totally empty cinema) and, more especially, because the marketing under promised a film that very much over delivers (to be clear, this is a good, and increasingly rare, thing).<br /><br />This stands in stark contrast to David Fincher's take on The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo which also had a great trailer (though one that was calculated with scientific precision to gratify fans of the novel while still inveigling the uninitiated), a coolly explicit poster and a title sequence that probably cost more than the entire budget of the Swedish version of the film but whose cast was populated with wall-to-wall famous people (I include Rooney Mara in this though she has limited credits, the hype around her has been...excessive) to the point that even the extras look familiar - seriously, Joel Kinnaman from the AMC show The Killing (who would have been the most famous guy in Chronicle were he in it) has a minor part of a colleague of Daniel Craig's Blomkvist (I don't think he even has a line). However, for all it promised the film, though technically beautiful and somehow able to breathe fresh life into pretty stale material, ultimately felt sterile and over-produced (and WTF was Daniel Craig doing with his glasses? No one does that. No one.) But I digress...<br /><br />As others have observed many of these aspects connect Chronicle to Cloverfield (hey, they both even start with the letter \\"C\\" and have cast members who appeared in True Blood!) further emphasized by the found footage style the film is shot in (a la Blair Witch Project, Paranormal Activity, et al). People complain that there's been a glut of found footage films (especially in the horror genre) and some found it gratuitous and/or pointless in Chronicle. I'm inclined to disagree and would in fact argue that it is a crucial aspect of the film and one that connects it to another great, closely related work of pop culture: Kurt Busiek and Alex Ross' graphic novel, Marvels.<br /><br />Marvels retells the history of the major storylines of the superheroes in the Marvel Universe (i.e. Spider-Man, Fantastic Four, Avengers, X-Men, etc.) from the perspective of normal human beings who view these beings of power almost as gods walking the earth. And like the gods of Greek mythology they are sometimes benevolent, sometimes fickle and often prone to hubris. This shift in perspective and the resulting scope of storytelling is what makes Marvels great and is likewise key to Chronicle's success.<br /><br />Using the found footage mode Chronicle tells the story of (self) isolated teenager Andrew Detmer (Dane Dehaan) who has recently acquired a video camera to document his life to the nth degree (a not unrealistic proposition given the era of compulsive self-documentation we live in) including the mundane (breakfast), the depressing (bullying at his high-school) and the tragic (abuse at the hands of his alcoholic father while his mother suffers in the background, bed-ridden and dying of an unnamed illness). Bereft of any friends the only levity in Andrew's life comes during his daily ride to school with his slacker, philosophy quoting older cousin Matt (Alex Russell). Alex convinces Andrew to join him that weekend at a rave in a derelict building out in the woods. Matt's desire to attend the party is at least partially motivated by the fact that Casey (Ashley Hinshaw) will be there. She is and turns out to be a videographer herself (covering every aspect of her life for her blog) and we have some nice moments of the watchers watching each other (and so who's watching them (read: us) etc.). Later in the evening Matt and a friend the popular Steve (a charismatic Michael B. Jordan) rope Andrew into an adventure deeper in the woods, where they've discovered a hole that leads to a cave and in the cave a object that gives off a brilliant, blinding light... So as to avoid spoilers I'm not going to give too much more away. Suffice it to say that whatever is in the cave grants Andrew, Matt and Steve superhuman powers and the film shifts gears from teen angst (melo) drama to teen angst (melo) drama super-charged with sci-fi as the three discover how to use their powers and, for the first time in his life Andrew has real friends, bound together as they are by their differences from everyone else - and then things go horribly wrong.<br /><br />The people who made Chronicle, namely director Josh Trank (Spike TV's The Kill Point) and screenwriter Max Landis (uh, John Landis' son) don't just have a keen sense of genre, as they successfully blend several together here, but also clearly know their stuff when it comes to comic books, demonstrated by how tightly pack the film is with elements from the several major comic book storylines (power vs. responsibility from Spider-Man, social isolation from X-Men, anger management from The Hulk, etc.). It's skillfully and subtly done, this isn't some hat-tip to geeky comic book fanboys. Rather, all the elements are blended into a very satisfying whole. It treats comic books as a source of pop-culture reference and inspiration much in the way literature, theatre, art and other films have been used in cinema to date - does this mean we're moving into a post comic book era? In the sense that comics can finally be seen as an artistic medium in their own right? (I like to think so).<br /><br />At 84 minutes Chronicle is snappy and, as previously noted, very skillfully made. The special effects work is seamlessly integrated into the visuals and, given the found footage style feel very realistic until the characters' powers grow to epic levels at which point they feel pretty scary and we're made to feel very human, very...small (What am I capable of? I'm just going to sit here and watch the movie...thanks). Consequently Chronicle succeeds where other films that have tread similar subject matter haven't, films such as Unbreakable (too much insider baseball), Hancock (neither funny enough nor dark enough) and even Watchmen (too reverential to it's source material).

B00004TH7Z|5|Bruce Dickinson, the man who is defined as a human air raid siren, has returned to Iron Maiden, finally getting rid of the ill-fated Blaze Bayley.  Also back is old Maiden guitarist Adrian Smith, giving Maiden a three guitar lineup and making them fiercer sounding than ever.  The songs are fantastic as well; &quot;The Wickerman&quot;, &quot;The Nomad&quot;, &quot;Ghost of the Navigator&quot;, &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot;, and the title track are standouts, but &quot;The Thin Line Between Love and Hate&quot; sounds like nothing but a filler song just thrown onto here.  Other than that, Maiden is back, better than ever, and all is right with the brave new world.
B00FEMJF6O|3|Originally on Facebook, just for the games and initially I played every game Zynga released, until they become too difficult for different reasons. Some needed too many neighbors just to get enough of the requested supplies and when not enough people play its impossible to complete a quest or mission that has a time limit and Then turns out you need the prize from that you fussed over to get and now since you don't have it can't move forward. I gave up on ALL Zynga Facebook games because if the previous was not enough to make you run away, then the fact that the games keep breaking, the graphics too much for most computers to handle unless you have a super charge gamers  system setup. So as far as this game goes the graphics are nice enough but not too much to get in the way or slow things down. It takes way too long to make money and many of the simple tasks take a bit too long to make in time as well versus others that only take seconds. It is a condensed version of castleVille and seems to have many of the same characters but expanding takes leveling up and that is also slow. I have the option that Zynga absolutely DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE, DIFFERENCES, OR THE CONCEPT OF &quot;GAME THEORY.&quot;  I have seen enough interviews to believe that the owner DOES NOT Care that his company's products drives customers away simply because he believes more will sign up to replace them and because they only need 1% of the customer base to make a purchase to keep them in business. Which translates into real dollars as multi-millions.  I tried this game out of curiosity and because it is something to do while waiting for the games I really enjoy are busy doing what they do.  As for those that fuss about not having Facebook it's your choice to not have Facebook. It's easy enough to fix. Step (1) get a free email account there a way too many places to list here, where that is possible. Step (2) after signing up for email, use that email account to sign up for Facebook - then you will have Facebook and can get new friends and game neighbors. On a daily basis tons of people are posting &quot; add me&quot; requests and you never have to talk to them or anything else, it's quite amazing and better yet some may even surprise you and actually be nice people that are worth being actual friends... out of over 600 so called friends on Facebook about 20 are family or friends I actually knew in real life before Facebook the rest have been added simply because of needing new neighbors and about 50 I actually have formed a friendship with. As for the rest I only have contact with via game stuff.  So please stop whining about this in games such as this when you know good and well that is how the games go...  geesh.- then you will have Facebook and can get new friends and game neighbors.

The hive login won't finish loving in it just gets stuck loading. And if you get the game to load when you choose a toon to play the game crashes. This is really frustrating! I Gould have given this game 5 stars but the crash limits be from playing now and just playing one day I cannot reasonably give 5 stars with just one day of play time. If this issue is fixed I will update this post.

B000E1YVZU|3|Before I say anything, I should confess that I had never seen RENT on stage, and had only listened to snippets of a few songs. However, it was these snippets that convinced me that I had to see this movie; unfortunately, it was not playing in my hometown, but I was able to see it in the town over (about 45 minutes away) in a really good theatre. Now that's out of the way, what did I think? <br /> <br />Unfortunately, this movie doesn't come QUITE across the way that it was probably intended. Yes, the chilling doom of AIDS is effectively given (Probably the scariest image in the entire film is Mimi lying in a gutter, shivering because of her constant drug feed); however, the fact that Chris Columbus directed the film probably wasn't a hopeful omen to begin with; Chris Columbus will always film an adaptation as completely faithful to its source, and that's not always a good thing. <br /> <br />Really, the problems are a bit obvious, even when you're watching the film for the first time. While the actors give amazing performances (the newcomers [Rosario Dawson as Mimi and Tracie Thoms as Joanne] especially), they are now ten years older than when they originated the parts (except, of course, for the newcomers), and they just don't look the age that they're supposed to anymore. Now one could probably pass this off as saying that this is the effect that both drugs and living in New York in those years would have on anyone, but that just seems a bit packed to me (especially considering how hot Mimi is when, apparently, she's the most drugged character in the entire movie).  <br /> <br />Other big problems come with Columbus trying to make this film as faithful to the stage show as possible. By keeping so many of the events the way they are, and keeping almost every song (although, to his credit, he did cut a LOT of the filler music that made the show almost completely sung through), he essentially turns the film into nothing more than an excuse to sing song after song, with little cohesive narrative to push through. For instance, the whole funeral scene with (spoiler) probably could have been cut, with the film cutting straight to the graveyard. They didn't need to sing there.  In short, The film seems more like a stream of music videos than a film. <br /> <br />Thankfully, however, there is one thing (apart from the actors) that saves this movie, and that is the MUSIC. I myself was not impressed with most of the numbers when I saw the film, but I have since bought the 2-Disk CD, and have fallen in love with every single number. Jonathan Larson really wrote these numbers well, giving them the contemporary edge needed to win over those who might be wary of seeing a movie where people just SING their feelings. Also, this music has some of my favorite lyrics of all time, above anything I've ever heard before, like: <br /> <br />Ever since puberty/ <br />Everybody stares at me/ <br />Boys, girls, I can't help it, baby/ <br /> <br />Please take me/ <br />Out Tonight/ <br />Don't forsake me/ <br />Out Tonight/ <br />I'll let you make me <br />Out Tonight!/ <br /> <br />In short, the music in this musical probably ranks up to my second favorite musical score, beat only by the score of Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera. <br /> <br />In the end, as the title suggests, you need to take this film for what it is: an incredibly faithful adaptation of a hit Broadway show that loses its way a few times. No more, no less.

0316055433|5|The Midtown Atlanta Book Group rated The Goldfinch 4.6 out of 5, which is an extremely high rating (Outstanding!) from this diverse, very literate, often highly critical club.  Because of its heft, at 700+ pages, we split the reading into two parts and extended the discussion over November and December, typically light months in book group participation.  The overwhelming enthusiasm for this book drove record attendance two months in a row, during the busy holiday season. The Goldfinch was so good, most of our book group members devoured it completely before the November meeting, and we still had plenty to talk about in December.<br /><br />The Goldfinch gets off to an explosive start, literally, with a terrorist bombing in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Out of the chaos, a young boy stumbles away with a priceless work of art, and begins a life adventure he could never have anticipated. We follow this young man, as he struggles to overcome tragic loss, dysfunction and deception, from New York to Las Vegas to New York to Amsterdam.<br /><br />The Goldfinch is a brilliant kaleidoscope of a novel, where everything gets broken -- smashed beyond repair at the beginning -- and comes out irreparably skewed, patched back together in a dozen different ways. Donna Tartt offers many threads, masterfully woven, with a cast of characters both dazzling and desperate, from our unreliable narrator and his underworld friends to the denizens of New York society, high art, and the world of fine antiques.<br /><br />Although it is a tragedy, start to finish, The Goldfinch is every genre rolled into one: mystery, romance, suspense, comedy, young adult, and international intrigue. At a time when readers are snacking on fluffy, low-cal supermarket bestsellers, Donna Tartt puts out a literary feast -- a five-part meal, so varied, so delicious and satisfying, you'll be exhausted, but you won't be able to stop until the end.<br /><br />-- Sherri Caldwell, Humor Columnist & Reviewer at RebelHousewife.com<br />Co-Author, The Rebel Housewife Rules: To Heck With Domestic Bliss!Reviewer at RebelHousewife.com<br />Co-Author, The Rebel Housewife Rules: To Heck With Domestic Bliss!

B00065MDRW|5|In the Court of the Crimson King is one of the greatest debuts of all time, especially for a prog band. Tremendously inventive, sporting ethereal mellotron, evocative lyrics (courtesy of Pete Sinfield), and everything from freakish, heavy jazz-rock (21st Century Schizoid Man), to one of the eeriest love songs ever (Moonchild). Sure, it's pretty hard to be unimpressed with In the Court of the Crimson King, but that doesn't mean it's an easy album to like. First things first, if you don't like progressive rock, don't even consider this album. In fact, if you're beginning to explore progressive rock, pick up Emerson, Lake, and Palmer's Brain Salad Surgery, or Yes' Fragile before diving into King Crimson. This band is not for the faint of heart. Buy this album, but don't be ready with comparisons to other prog bands - King Crimson was one of the first, and certainly one of the most original. 21st Century Schizoid Man leads things off with a heavy metal styled introduction before morphing into strange, rapid-moving jazz-rock. I Talk to the Wind is another great song, led by flute and Greg Lake's amazing vocals. Epitaph is about as dramatic as things get, as we return to the classic Crimson sound. Moonchild is the only problem - the first two or three minutes are great (and incidentally, very disconcerting), but the rest is aimless jamming that is only barely listenable. It saps the album of all its momentum. Thankfully, the closer title track is the finest thing on the album, and remedies that mistake.

0393035158|5|As someone who has watched a parent suffer and die of Parkinsons Disease and as a diabetic myself, I was most moved as I read Mr. Harris' section on stem cell research.  At last, someone who can clearly articulate the big picture, who can illustrate the insanity of holding scripture not as the historical documents that they are but but as the word of god.  As we watch the world torn apart by religious strife, Mr Harris asks us to ask the right questions of ourselves.  As impressed as I was with Mr.Harris' writing, I was equally impressed with his impeccable scholarship as evidenced in his copius end notes and extensive bibliography.  At last an articulate voice trying to stop the madness of true believers.
B005K17RU0|5|This app is amazing and let's me keep track of weather in the places I go most often.  It is very accurate even for our town which often has different weather from towns as close as an hour away.
B0018PH3L0|5|Simply put, this movie is one of the best movies/mini series ever made. It's a western, love story, historical drama and so much more. The actors are all superb and the story lines are compelling. As you watch you feel for these people and you CARE about what happens to them.
B00005JMCN|5|Ok, I am totally stunned by how great this movie turned out. I watched it once in theatre &amp; was very impressed. I have recently purchased the DVD &amp; have watched it nearly 10 times. My favorite line in this movie is &quot;It's better to break a man's leg than is heart&quot; This is such a great feal good movie for when you are feeling a little down.I live in Kentucky so, it was nice to see them shoot part of the movie here. I am not really a horse fan at all. If you watch this movie you will truly not regret it. IF I COULD GIVE THIS MOVIE TEN STARS I WOULD!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!
B00000F1D3|5|Maybe it was timing, but I LOVE this CD...&quot;Believe&quot; may well be my new anthem...it makes me feel powerful and in control of my life...and who can't use a little more of that?
B000092ZYX|4|Bleep bleep.  Gurgle gurgle.  KerPLUNK.  Wiggle wibble.  So started the last two Radiohead studio albums to much bemusement and head-scratching by the critics and record buying public alike.  As signals of intention they were not misleading. Although by far the most electronically influenced of the tracks on either of the albums, they still indicated a restless band who had grown weary of the four to the floor dynamics/constraints of a rock band.<br />In contrast, Hail To The Thief kicks off with \\"2 + 2 = 5\\".  A quiet, moody introduction with drum patters and intricate guitar lines clambering all over Thom's voice suddenly does the unimaginable after a minute and a half.  Someone stabs a syringe into the band members' hearts and pumps them with a buzzing adrenaline shot.  Thom spits out \\"You have not been paying attention\\" leaving the rest of the band with nothing to do but savagely attack their instruments in a rock and roll orgy of violence and paranoia.  It becomes easily one of the most exciting moments of Radiohead's recorded history.  If on the second listen the freak out fry up is less of a surprise, it is none the less satisfying as the build-up tantalises and teases before unleashing and releasing the monster.<br />The sound is raw and natural, and comes back throughout the album.  Jonny Greenwood does things to the guitar that probably warrant sexual harassment law-suits during \\"Go To Sleep\\".  \\"Where I End And You Begin\\" sees a serial-killer stalker of a bassline snuggle up to The Edge's industrial guitars circa Achtung Baby to mesmerising effect.  \\"Myxomatosis\\" sounds like Queens of the Stone Age having a drunken grapple with a Euro techno-trance floor-filler inside Thom's head (or possibly headache).  Nagging backing vocals weave between colossal, continental drift drums and Yorke's lonely voice, stitching the two delicately together on \\"There There\\".<br />Other songs are beautifully sung, bittersweet lullabies designed to paralyse.  None has quite the immediate grab of a \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\" or \\"True Love Waits\\", but \\"Sail To The Moon\\"'s haggard, woozy, scrunched-up-ball of a tune haunts the memory.  Meanwhile, Thom's duet with the voices in his head on the devoted \\"I Will\\" is nothing short of stunning.<br />Even more gripping is \\"We Suck Young Blood\\"'s return to the smoky, jazz-flecked stylings of Amnesiac's \\"Life in a Glasshouse\\".  Over a mournful piano Radiohead suddenly come up with the sound of one hand clapping, and it's fair to say that it is somewhat less than half as joyful as those on The Undertones' \\"Teenage Kicks\\".  Yorke's vocals and lyrics portray some crazed devil tempting poor earthly souls, and indeed three-fifths of the way in the music twists and gives us an insight into the flame-licked, scorching after-party for all of ten seconds.  Then it cuts back to Thom, singing sweetly for your pity while secretly stealing your purse.<br />This is not to say the record is flawless.  When the electronics take over, rather than support, the more conventional sounds the results are merely cold and unmoving.  The lack of emotion is completely unrepresentative of the album as a whole, but leaves a nasty aftertaste that can detract from other tracks.  \\"The Gloaming\\" and \\"Backdrifts\\" are particularly frustrating in this regard, as they are nestled in such places as to pull the plug on any build up of momentum, making the whole record a curiously, and infuriatingly, stop-start affair.<br />Only with the final songs does Hail To The Thief find a track it can stick to without toppling off, resulting in the glorious reward of the finale, \\"A Wolf At The Door\\".  Over a faintly psychotic fairground-waltz setting, Thom launches into a hypnotically rhythmic rant.  Then the refrain arrives and for some absurdly fantastic reason, such is the sheer joy of the melody, it sounds faintly as if Julie Andrews is guest starring.  Well, a drugged-up Julie Andrews who hasn't slept for 4 months, singing, \\"I keep the wolf from the door but he calls me up calls me on the phone tells me all the ways that he's gonna mess me up - Steal all my children if I don't pay the ransom and I'll never see them again if I squeal to the cops...\\".<br />It provides a perfect ending to a record that is sad, lonely, angry, paranoid and all the more accurate for being so ragingly inarticulate.  Moreover, it cements Radiohead as the one of the very few rock bands out there, who aren't afraid of getting their wings singed for the pay-off of rocketing into the Sun.  And for that we should be thankful.
0316017922|5|Malcolm Gladwell has a very well-thought and digestible style of writing that's addictive. I've used quotes from this book in both academic papers and fund-raising speeches. I liked his writing so much that I went on to purchase his other two novels, BLINK and THE TIPPING POINT, as well.
B008MM9630|3|I honestly loved this game, and unlike many I WANTED to purchase content...the game would not connect to the market and then froze. I tried clearing the data and reinstalling like Amazon suggested and still have the same problem. It also will not connect with Facebook. Otherwise I would have given 5 stars.
B00992CF6W|5|I like minecraft it is fine and fun please add herobrine to minecraft
B0064MT1U8|5|One of the most literate movies I've ever seen. Up there with Blade Runner; Alien; Becket, and A Man for All Seasons.  I don't have a 1080p projector yet, so I'll edit this when I've seen it on big screen.
B0030MKGKY|5|Jeremy Renner is outstanding. This film makes you feel as if you're in Iraq. Thrilling, compelling, heart-rending, gritty, savage, touching.
B001O304US|4|&#34;Darling, you were wonderful, you really were quite good<br /> I enjoyed it, though, of course, no one understood<br /> A word of what was going on, they didn't have a clue<br /> They couldn't understand your sense of humor like I do&#34;<br /><br />beginning of Yesterday, When I Was Mad.<br /><br />This CD belongs in every PSB fans collection.  Every song is awesome.
B00002NDB1|1|This is the worst album I never heard. I don't recognize anymore the band that made me feel the shivers with his music, with his originality, with his great playing. Steve Harris have exhausted his ideas mine. But I believe that Maiden's end is called Janick Gers and Blaze Baley.
B00004ZBVG|4|Excellent and fast delivery. Thank you.
B00N1HONIO|5|Best scary game in a long time. The first night may be boring but the rest of the nights are a ride you will never forget the game is based around five anamatronics Chica/Freddy/Bonnie/foxy/and golden Freddy and your a night guard that is basically trying to protect your self from these posesed anamatronics by closing doors and checking camera's and they are trying to stuff you in a spare suit witch would not be so bad other than all the metal parts on the inside. And the rest is yours to find out
B00L9B7IKE|5|Great story with some historical value.  Loved it & read in 2 settings
B006ATJXQW|4|The plot is hard to follow but that is just what keeps one reading longer than expected.  You have to find out why, what, and when.
B005CKPQNE|5|This show gets better and better.  I have enjoyed every single season and watched them all on Amazon.  Never a dull moment...
B00NFQT7QY|4|good action movie
B009ZXT4BY|3|yeah your game is fun but when I saw the screenshots THEY HAVE SO MUCH MORE THAN THE DEMO I HOPE THAT THEY MAKE IT FAIR Because who's going to buy it if they don't know that this has more stuff
B0063IH60K|5|I forgot how fun and challenging solitaire can be.  This app is very fun, easy to use, and a great way to pass the time.
B000XUBFE2|5|A very good book. And considering the time it is set in, not just sad, but rather a story of hope. Of what it means to be human in times that are terrible. From the start, you will root for the protagonist and want to know how the story unfolds and ends, even when Markus put's in some purposefully placed &#34;spoilers&#34; that in essence are not spoilers at all. Just a very unique way in driving the story forward. Read this either just for entertainment, or to better understand how ordinary people lived and suffered during the Third Reich, or as a story about humanism and the reason for living. Then read it again, and just marvel at how artfully Markus Zusak has crafted this story, often breaking with convention on how stories should be told, not for show effect, but to get the reader to a much deeper level of understanding, of feeling with the characters, of understanding what led to all the evil and misery on one hand and all the love and bravery on the other hand that people showed in those dark times.
B002NXSRVG|5|I would say this film is classic kick ass hero action! Great for kids of all ages. Tatum is perfect for this role. Watch it, then buy it for your collcetion too

B009A87X80|5|Gone too soon!
B000ICXQGK|5|Although this movie may not have been touted as one of Robin's greatest, the acting in it is superb!!  Everyone who has ever enjoyed *Dead Poet's Society* will thoroughly enjoy the cinematography, as well as the acting in this movie!  Again, kudos to Robin Williams!
B004K4AUZW|1|lady gaga's target audience is the gay audience and night club dance floors.   she's found her niche and that's where it's at.   almost all the tunes have that same techno beat, which i don't care for.   i would like some variety...that's just me...but she will be a big winner with her target audience...GO lady!
B00AE6SS5O|5|Yet another variation on a theme. I love the series of adventure games like this one and Pirates/Pirates2 from Nevasoft. They are on the easy side, but for a few minutes of relaxation they are perfect.
B00AKL1XPU|5|Catching the animals is awesome.  I love the adventure of it. Breeding and crossbreeding give a unique flair with the dinosaurs.
B006R1T40I|3|As one reviewer put it \\"well oiled\\" so well so it sounds mechanical without much groove, feel and emotion. I love Bonnie Raitt, but I don't find this album particulary fun and enjoyable. I hope to see her in concert this year, and just hope she's got her usual moja on.
B0047Y0FGY|4|good for.a.quick read and lots.of.great one liners!  read it in one sitting and laughed.through the whole.thing!!!  Tina fey.is quite the intelligent writer!
B0089LOG02|5|Orphan train is a story of the triumph of the human spirit. You are drawn into the world of the orphans in the past,and the present day world of &#34;orphans as well. I recommended the book to my daughter as well.
B00FVVR2ZO|4|TOO MUCH MONEY FOR IN APP PURCHASES!!! And to play the game uses up energy so fast that you can't even enjoy it - right when you want to explore, you run out of energy! To open new areas is insanely hard because you have to wait for items to &quot;drop&quot;  GRRRRR
B000PWQOBC|5|This Japanese mini-lp replica version of Ozzy Osbourne's best album is simply a work of art! Very beautifully designed with all the lyrics included and with a sound quality remastered to perfection.       This is by far the best version of this album that is out there; great sound quality, great packaging, great songs! A must have in any CD collector's library.
B0065FFMR0|5|Season one is great.  The characters alone make this series a fast favorite.  Every player is both beautiful and also deeply flawed.  The aesthetic is unique and the story line is rich.  If you enjoy horror, mystery, or even a little dash of drama, this is for you.  Give it a shot.  Id suggest buying the whole episode immediately and just watching through, but if you want to test drive the vehicle first, just purchase the first episode and I bet you'll be curious for more.  Thats the thing about it, it makes you \\"curious.\\"  Not many shows can do that anymore.
B000001ELD|5|Great band What else can I say? This is a great purchase a one of a kind cd from a unique band, this is more than awesome.
B004MC8CA2|5|Most helpful bible in many ways with quick scripture references for studying or just reading the bible. The audio versioning give this bible an extra domintion.
B00K7C17QW|4|Fun game
B00BWBHIUG|5|I bought this for my 3 yr old daughter, and I think I enjoy it more than she does. She likes the characters and i like the assignments. There is pressure to spend real money in game, but thanks to playing it in kindle free time and my own will power, we've done pretty well not sinking money into the game. You are able to progress through the first 20 levels with just grinding away at it (that's as far as I've gotten after 2 months). I've had some glitches with the countdown timer for Mr Rays homework assignments, but they are optional, so nothing devastating. I have also noticed an increase in ads. It's annoying especially since its the same one over and over.  Despite that, my daughter and i play it together at least 3 times a week.
0316113514|5|Well researched and an interesting read.  It gives you a lot of reasons to stay active.
B007STXHTM|4|Dive housing works as advertised.  Would have been a five start rating had it came with a red filter insert.
B00DR0PDNE|3|works as advertised but was kind of disappointed.  I was hoping that Google would come out with more features for this neat little device.
B00A0HQ7H8|5|Nice sounding voice and good fun base. Dubstepish but not quite. Being the boyfriend I enjoy as well so if you want to treat your girl to a new artist give her a whirl.
B00DR0PDNE|4|I like Google chromecast, it was very easy to use and enjoying to play videos youtube on my HDTV big screen
B001FSDOZO|4|good
B000002J1O|5|I am primarily a Genesis fan from the days when Peter Gabriel was with the band.(The Phil Collins stuff isn't bad either).But this is the last album with Peter and it is PERFECT.Excellent lyrics and music.Also some excellent word play...\\"Me,I'm just a lawnmower you can tell me by the way I walk\\".
B009ZQC7MY|5|A TV series that spans the generations.
B00I8H6MGS|5|Excelent.
B0002DB50E|2|Very weird film with a dark message about TV watching, I guess. I wasn't entirely sure where this was going, and I wasn't terribly impressed with the swamp monster special effects. This has gotten all sorts of cult worship over the years, but I really can't see why. Debbie Harry gives an interesting performance, and James Woods does the same hyper-schtick he went on to give throughout his career. I did like the ominous, spooky organ soundtrack, like something out of \\"Phantom of the Opera.\\" For Cronenberg fanatics only.
B00LXLM05I|5|Hack and slash dungeon crawler. Great time waster.
B006YTTVHO|5|great book!
B008OOYALE|3|I enjoyed this game at first. Most of the dragons are cute and it's not that hard amassing coins. Getting the gold bars is another story, but I was never too concerned about those. I am still pretty confused about how it determined when I could receive one from the people on my friend's list For instance, I'd have four from four different people sitting there, and not have the option to accept them over the course of a few days. Then it would suddenly offer me one of them. This screen only showed on daily start-up, so I couldn't tell if they vanished over time either. I never used the gold bars I did get, however, since the dragons cost an incredible amount of gold bars, based on rarity level, I think.<br /><br />Anyway, my problem comes from the basic game mechanics. Whenever you breed two dragons, you're essentially relying on a Random Number Generator, or RNG, to give the egg needed for the quests (or if you simply want it, because it's cute.) Obviously some are rarer than others, and I'm okay with breeding more than once to get what I want. However, as an example, while I was playing, there was only one common hybrid result between the Fire and Air dragons. It takes roughly 12 hours to breed for, and also 12 hours to hatch. This means that every time I got that result, it took 24 hours to sell the unwanted dragon and free up the breeding spot again. In the long run, I still would have been patient, but that's the entire game play right there. That's it. Some quests require other options, like decorative items being purchased, buildings built, or leveling up a dragon, but most of them involve owning a specific dragon breed. If you just like the look of it, good luck. The commons are really nice, but obviously the best ones will be rarer. They make you work for it if you're unwilling to pay real money, which makes sense, but doesn't make for compelling game play. If you pay for it, then you're left with something you can only look at anyway. If you spend time breeding for it, there might be more pride and satisfaction, but you still can't do anything else with the dragon, other than feeding it so it can evolve to look prettier and generate more coins.<br /><br />In the meantime, it's both possible and recommended to clear up space on the island and build other things that you need, if you have the coins and maps for it, but this also takes time. I really don't mind waiting, in general. My issue is that there's really nothing to do as you wait. You can visit other people's islands for a small benefit, but it's boring and sometimes it won't load entirely or it crashes if you visit a very large, dragon-filled island.<br /><br />This would all be okay, I guess. Crashing doesn't take long to come back from, and I have other games to play during this time, but Dragon Story is also aggressive about letting you know when something has happened. I think there's a setting for turning some of them off, but I think it was an all or nothing type deal. Oddly enough, it will give notifications, even if you don't have a connection up, in spite of how the game requires an internet connection to run! And when I say the notifications are aggressive, I mean the little logo dragon (a Fire dragon) pops up in the middle of any other game I'm playing, or website I'm browsing, to tell me about whatever has happened. It's cute at first, because the dialog is first-person and personality-based, like a character talking directly to you (even though I doubt this dragon has a name.)<br /><br />Then it got annoying. The game lets you know when to come and collect the coins that the dragons have generated (roughly every hour or less, depending on how awesome your dragons are at generating coins, and how big their habitat is), but I stopped caring if someone had visited my island, when the wild plants had been cleared (also time based), and when my crops were grown. The benefit of returning the visit is minimal, you need coins to clear any more plants beyond whatever you've already cleared, and the same holds true for the crops. The dragons generate coins, so it's possible to gather what you need when you returned, but after a certain point it's critical to start saving up for expensive building and habitat upgrades, and some of the plants and rocks are expensive to clear. Expanding in general becomes more expensive with each expanse and the upgraded buildings/habitats take up more space. It's a never ending process, but not an interesting one.<br /><br />Note: the dragons don't have to eat! The little box that comes up when you run out of food is somewhat misleading. Your dragons won't come to any harm if they aren't fed. The food is only XP. I wouldn't recommend buying it, unless you're desperate to finish a quest right away, and even then it probably isn't worth what you paid for. You can also breed any of the dragons, from what I can tell, it just takes a lot of patience, and in some cases, being at a certain player level, before that breed is unlocked. I didn't feel like spending that much time or money collecting these dragons (especially since each one needs an elementally appropriate habitat; some of which are far more expensive than others.)<br /><br />TL;DR I stopped enjoying this game, after having it for about a month. For anyone who wants a game with very little game play, something to just pop into now and then, this could be for you. It has nice art, decent animation, and isn't that time-consuming overall. If you want to truly play with the dragons, or get more out of your experience, such as mini-games of any sort, you may want to try something else. For the style of game that this is, I do consider Dragon Story to be good.

B0052RDHTM|3|I ordered the paperback version of this book.  The print in the book was almost minute which made the reading of this quite lengthy book very uncomfortable.  I ended up ordering the Kindle version which is fine.
0525423273|5|Taken from my blog:<br />\\"Anna and the French Kiss\\" by Stephanie Perkins is a-freakin-dorable so READ IT NOW. There. That's all I need to say, right? Seriously though, this book is so fun and romantic. I do not normally like contemporary young adult fiction and I absolutely adore this book. I went out and bought a couple copies of it to give to my sisters and my best friend.<br /> Anna is sent away to Paris by her nouveau riche father (who is an author a la Nicolas Sparks..mwahaha, nice touch Ms. Perkins) for her senior year of high school in an effort to broaden her horizons and make him look super fancy. As if leaving her best friend and guy friend (def boyfriend potential) behind wasn't hard enough, she's thrown into the world of upper-crust snobbery in a country where she doesn't even speak the language! Luckily, she falls into a great group of friends and meets the perfect guy, Etienne St. Clair. He's a Parisian, whose also American, but has lived extensively in London so he has a British accent. Plus, add in the fact that he's an incredibly nice guy and is slowly becoming her best friend. Perfect right? Oh yeah, there's just one little hiccup - she's maybe-sorta-kinda taken by that potential boyfriend back home and he's in a long term relationship. Yowza.<br /> To be honest, the description of the book didn't have me convinced. As I said earlier, I'm not a big fan of contemporary YA. I'm more of a fantasy/paranormal/historical gal myself. I decided to take the plunge and give \\"Anna and the French Kiss\\" 50 pages... if it hooked me, great, but if not, I'd go back to my comfort zone. It had me in less than five pages. The writing is just so sharp, fresh, and charming. I instantly loved Anna and Etienne. I cared so deeply about their happiness and let's face it, I'm always a sucker for best friend romances. (Yes, Twilight fans, I was unabashedly Team Jacob and will continue to pretend that \\"Breaking Dawn\\" never happened. Ugh.) For a teen romance, it is so wonderfully realistic too. It's so very real and sweet. There is no crazy love triangle. There is no lusty instant sexual connection. It's real world love and it's beautiful.<br />This book will have you saying \\"oo la la!\\" Seriously, I know I'm being a total cornball here, but I cannot stress enough that if you like LOVE, you will ADORE Stephanie Perkins' \\"Anna and the French Kiss\\". And if you don't like love, um, please go get help.ic too. It's so very real and sweet. There is no crazy love triangle. There is no lusty instant sexual connection. It's real world love and it's beautiful.  This book will have you saying \\"oo la la!\\" Seriously, I know I'm being a total cornball here, but I cannot stress enough that if you like LOVE, you will ADORE Stephanie Perkins' \\"Anna and the French Kiss\\". And if you don't like love, um, please go get help.

B00HDMMISA|5|This was a great book.  From the beginning, you know what is going to happen and when it will happen; but you can't predict how the story unfolds.  There were so many surprises.  Plus the author uses what she knows about humans to develop rich characters with complicated lives.  But it all seems so simple and easy.  To me, this was a masterful piece of writing.  And when the story has unfolded, the author does not give her opinion about the outcome, but allows the reader to draw his/her own conclusions.  I love, love, love this book.  I want to read this one again, and I want to read more of Liane Moriarty's books.
B00H58VGIA|5|A wonderful story that captured my heart and kept me reading. To find that the characters were real people at the end, made me smile. Thank goodness for women like Sarah and Nina Grimke.

B00005JLRT|4|This film had some of the best fast n' furious action scenes I've ever seen in Trek, tv or film. It was exciting, kept you on the edge of your seat, but felt kinda stiff. the characters felt like they were working as actors, and not like good pals having some fun. It felt like they were &quot;OK, I'll read my lines,gimme my check and I'm outta here&quot; type of feeling. The warmth and camraderie from the earlier films and tv show were somewhat lacking. It's good this was the last Trek for TNG guys. Some were beginning to hit the middle age plump-up like those of the original series' films did. Good, but overall it could have been better.<BR>P.S. Thought-if data is an android with an artificial &quot;skin&quot;, then he should look the same in Nemesis as he did episode 1 of TNG;since he definitly appears older, then it's time to retire TNG from the movies and hand it off to the DS9 guys.

I was just going off the advice of a friend to \\"just buy, don't think\\", and I had only heard a couple songs posted on their MySpace that I wasn't really even all that crazy about. What a great gamble that turned out to be. This album quickly made me forget that I even had expectations, and it has already become one of my all-time favorite albums, despite only having it for a little over 2 weeks. I'm dead serious.    \\"Animals as Leaders\\" is leaded by guitarist/songwriter Tosin Abasi (ex-Reflux), and is the first progressive metal band I've heard that really can't be put into a genre. Even \\"progressive metal\\" is a label that would make people think they're going to sound like Dream Theater or Rush, which is absolutely not the case. \\"Experimental\\" might be a good label, but that's also a bad, terrible label, in that it simply clumps together all the musicians who sound nothing like anybody else or each other. This album is fresh, it's instrumental, it's heavy, it's very progressive (both rhythmically and melodically), it's uplifting, it's EPIC, and it's utterly beautiful. No need to genre-ify it.    Anyways, there is nothing more important to this album than the musicianship of Tosin Abasi. I'm no guitarist, but I can easily say that he makes his music come alive with passion and heart, and I'm worried that his guitars might explode if he keeps making such awesome music. The drum work is phenomenal, too. I've been playing drums for 11 years, and some of the stuff I hear is like nothing I've ever heard. I just wish I knew who wrote/played them (may have been Tosin for all I know, some multi-instrumentalists are skilled at everything).    The two tracks currently posted on MySpace \\"Tempting Time\\" and \\"Song of Solomon\\", are good examples of the heavier side of the album. While those are damn good songs that will make you rock out no matter where or how you listento them, they're not my favorites - those would have to be the more laid-back tunes with the jazzier-classical influences, like \\"Soraya\\", \\"Behaving Badly\\" and \\"The Price of Everything and the Value of Nothing\\". Hearing an atmospheric jazz-fusion-esque sound combined with redonkulous 5/16 time, meshuggah-like polyrhythms, and a classical guitar-like composition is the coolest thing in the world! Though, even the songs I didn't mention are absolutely amazing! I just haven't had enough time with the album yet to develop a sense of how to describe them (it's that way with most of the album, actually). I'll just let you find out for yourself what it sounds like.    However, don't get the idea that just because I mentioned which ones are my favorites, that there are songs or parts of songs that are just OK or filler! There is not a single wasted second on this album. There is nothing repetitive, nothing that will bore you, nothing that will leave you disappointed or underwhelmed, nothing that will even make you think about skipping to the next track. This is an album that after your first listen, will leave you feeling as though you've rediscovered music. It was good enough that it's been in my car's CD player for the last couple weeks straight, and I haven't gotten tired of it. I can't say the same for the new Mastodon, the new Isis, or the new Obscura, which I thought were all great albums that really pushed the limits of metal. Will I call this the best metal album of 2009? Absolutely, and possibly the best metal album of the last few years (right up there with the latest Meshuggah, Opeth and Gojira albums, and a few other other great bands that thrive on how original they can be).    People, get this album. A smart man once said \\"What mama don't know can't hurt her\\", but he's obviously never heard Animals as Leaders before. Buy it now, you won't make a better decision for a long time.
B007V9YF5E|4|If you want to see a woman fight in an action movie with realistic moves and punches that actually would knock a grown man down, watch this flick.  She is smart, confident without seeming disinteresed and in a fight, she uses leverage, gravity and here strongest muscles ( legs ) to do some damage to those she opposes.<br /><br />Its a great story too, and something I have recommended to many people....if your looking for action with great stars and a strong story line....this is your flick.
B000OJFV4C|4|I was fairly familiar with the history behind King Henry VIII; this dramatization is really entertaining.  I am in the middle of season 3, and still enjoying it!

B0076DELIG|5|As usual Michael Connelly delivers.  Love the Harry Bosch series and look forward to each new one.  For anyone who loves detective stories you'll love Harry.
B0009X75UG|5|Every album I've gotten of Andreas Vollenweider's is brilliant.  I love the harp and every instrument along with it.  magnificent!
B00KZ6WRAA|5|Works great
0446698326|5|In this book there is a love like no other.  This love goes above and beyond The Notebook.  This shows there is a such a thing as unconditional love no matter how unlikely it may be.  Not many people at all can be so unselfish.  I couldn't put this book down.  The story is so well written and the characters kept you involved in the story.  There were times you want to scream, laugh and of course i cried at the end.  To anyone who is a Sparks fan you will not be disappointed.
B00KMX5V8G|5|I love this game
B0000203Y5|5|these musicians. Enchanting melodies like no other; rhythm that taps you on the shoulder, grabs your arm and you are gone.  Simple lyrical stories only genious could write.  I saw this on PBS so I have to get the movie and  the CD's.  My family almost moved to Cuba when I was young; I agree with  Mr. Nee---I'm ready to go now-don't forget the camera.  Thanks, Buena Vista  Social Club and Ry Cooder.
B00000JXVK|5|Excellent
B00SH04286|2|so so
B0000DJZA5|5|I was never a fan of the original Let It Be. I was also born after the original album came out so I have absolutely no sentimental attachment to it or the Beatles.  Honestly, I don't even like the Beatles as much now as I once did.<br /><br />However, this album has really grown on me over the past 18 months that I have owned it.  I am happy that the chatter between songs has been cut out, and I always HATED the Phil Spector strings in Long and Winding Road, which up to now had been my least favorite Beatles Song.<br /><br />With its fresh remastered sound quality, this album is simply one of the best sounding Beatles records there is.  I don't care if it wasn't what the Beatles wanted, or if is different from what people remember.  The bottom line is that it is an album of great sounding music, and because of this fact, the album frequently enjoys trips in my car's CD player -- a priviledge not enjoyed by any of my other Beatles albums.
