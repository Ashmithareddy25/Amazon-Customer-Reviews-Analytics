B000002KJK|5.0|Of the many Rod albums that I own, this has to be one of the best.  It is alot of fun to listen to, and everyone has experienced some of the songs at least once in their life.
0446347949|5.0|This and &quot;Marketing Warfare&quot; by the same authors are probably the most practical and useful books on marketing ever written. The &quot;positioning&quot; concept is directly applicable to both consumer and  industrial market situations.  But you'll need to think a bit about the  concepts and how to apply them to your particular strategic situation.   (Well, of course you will!  That's what makes marketing interesting.)<br />I  reference these books throughout my marketing courses and seminars.  They  give students a different perspective and make for interesting  discussions.<br />But how could there be only 5 reviews of this excellent  book???  Guess it and Warfare are older books ('81 &amp; '86), so most of  us read them before Amazon reviews.  RECOMMENDATION:  Read them again!
B000002U82|5.0|From beginning to end, this beautiful blend of sounds, with memorable melodies, and incredible guitar work, leaves a lasting impression on all who hear it.  On top of the luscious soundscapes that Pink Floyd achieves  with a delicate perfection, the lyrics provide us with a universal message.   Ingeniously crafted by Roger Waters,  this conceptual opus speaks of  money, life, paranoia, time, and other themes that affect us all.  Dark  Side of the Moon definately has the greatest opening and closing to any  rock album.  A definate must for any rock music connoisseur.  After you  explore this one try &quot;The Wall,&quot; &quot;Wish You Were Here,&quot;  and &quot;Animals.&quot; Don't let this one pass you by.
B000002HMH|4.0|I haven't bought this CD yet, but I've listened to it though. IT may be a little different, but it's still a cool CD. Don't write it off just because it's a little different from there older stuff.
6303039456|5.0|This Video is so funny!!!! The acting is good and jokes and comedy are halarious:-) Doug E Doug is a good actor and adds his style to this movie. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good laugh!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00000FCBC|5.0|For those of you that didn't like LOAD or RE-LOAD this CD will show you that Metallica still rocks. Die, Die and Mercyful fate are two of the better one's on disc 1. and on disc 2 all motorhead and #'s 5,9,11 are  awesome. Metallica still rules!
0440131480|5.0|This book rocked my world.  Never before have I  been forced to think about contemporary American culture in the way Vonnegut outlines in this biting social criticism.
0140177396|5.0|I thought that this book was very good.  I enjoyed  every page.  Forget what some of the other readers said about the book having &quot;no plot&quot;.  Obviously, they don't know what a plot is!
0792151712|5.0|This movie is a wonderful life experience. It shows what true love is. I have seen this movie several times in the theatre and I bought myself a copy when it came out on video. If you have not seen this movie yet, I  suggest that you do! It's great!
0440219078|3.0|I thought it was okay. Jonas's world was weird with there being no color or animals. His dream was sick. About Fiona and the house of the old. And Rosemary being the Giver's daughter was unusal. I wouldn't like living in  his world, with releasement and all. When they released the smaller twin in  the forehead, I was about to cry.
0790736101|5.0|This is simply the greatest Dracula film of all time. Christopher Lee is outstanding as Dracula. He delivers one of the best performances of his career in this film. Peter Cushing plays his adversary, Dr. Van Helsing and  is the perfect antagonist to Dracula. If you enjoy this film, I would also  suggest Dracula Prince of Darkness, and the Brides of Dracula.
B000002GXS|5.0|This is what Tom Waits could do before he lost his voice and went nuts.  Every song on this one is magic, but &quot;Please Call Me, Baby,&quot; for my money is the best.  Also wonderful:  &quot;Drunk on the Moon,&quot;  &quot;San Diego Serenade&quot; and the magnificent title  track.<br />Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant.
6302759110|1.0|I found this adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula downright painful to watch. Suffering through Keanu Reeves pitiful attempt at an English accent as the lead character/narrator was horrible. This film is a gaudy,  flamboyant attempt at creating an artful masterpiece and falls far short of  its mark. This movie is an example of a studio spending a ton of money on  special effects and using all the hottest actors, but forgetting to tell a  good story. They try to portray Dracula as a sympathetic lover but the  result is a pathetic blunder. I'd rather spend the night in Castle Dracula  than watch this dog again.
0553573403|5.0|I read lots of fantasy and this is the best book I've ever read. Lots of interesting characters, plot and fantasy. The writing is excellent and the descriptions are detailed and realistic (when violence occurs, then  violence is described). I can't wait for the sequel...<br />Keep up the good  work Martin !
B000006NL3|5.0|What a great album!  Searingly loud, messily exuberant, this album is the type that leaves its listener forever changed.  Although &quot;Sister Ray,&quot; &quot;The Gift,&quot; &quot;Lady Godiva's Operation,&quot; and  the title track have been (justly) cited in other reviews, the song that  really stood out for me was &quot;I Heard Her Call My Name.&quot;  Along  with being a really creepy story about obsession over a lost love, it is  also a fantastic peice of free jazz that really ROCKS!  That screaming  squealing orgiastic guitar knocks me out!  Definitely the Velvets' best  album, and that's saying a hell of a lot!
B000000FG8|5.0|This album is literally the best you will ever buy. Every punk band is a result of this album. If you love punk and you don't have this album, you don't love punk at all! Traks like Unity, Take Warning, I Got No,  Knowledge, and every other track are the best I've ever heard. This is  where your punk collection should start!
0609603086|1.0|I rate this book Putrid and a total waste of my time.  The plot, sub-plots and expression are all childishly styled and obviously this book sells solely on the basis of the authors name as some of his previous work is  excellent.
0790739909|5.0|This movie touched me in so many ways.  It was refreshing to see a true love story, and the lengths that both characters would go to to attain those feelings.  I found the movie comforting, knowing that someone out  there is watching over us...
B000002PF4|5.0|Agree with bseymour below. This album's highs aren't as high as parts of Aja, but the overall quality is better, which seems impossible. All I can say is that this CD has been the background music to a lot of great parts  of the lives of my friends and family.
0783229011|5.0|When I first saw Babe I walked out thinking: &quot;How the hell did they get the animals do do that?&quot; The animatronics/animation is that believable. Funniest bits are with the duck. And the part where babe sings  &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; is a hoot.
B00000AFWW|5.0|I'm not even a big Hole fan, but I've been listening to this album almost exclusively since Halloween when I bought it. It's definitely the best album of 1998. The End.
B00000G3PA|1.0|As a lover of all movies I expect a bad plot when the title is Armagedeon.  That way I am surprised if it is actually good.  As an audiophile DVDs offer a higher level of quality. This DVD has perhaps the worst sound I  have ever heard.  The tracks are unbalanced and the explosions are  normalized to match the voices.  When I buy a DVD like this I expect a  higher standard.  I didn't recieve one.  -5 out of 5!!!!!
B00000DFTG|5.0|If you like Black Sabbath, live performances and quality sound in heavy metal (hey, these guys are the originals!), you've got to get this album!!
6305265488|5.0|I went to see this movie 3 times in the theater. I can't wait to own it on video and watch it again and agian!  <br />You'll believe in fairy-tales again after seeing this movie.
6305252521|5.0|Yes, Truman Show.  I can't recommend this movie any more than I have, it's one of the greatest movies I've ever seen.  And yes, it's a poor remake of &quot;The Prisoner&quot; but it isn't SUPPOSED to be &quot;The  Prisoner&quot; which is a psychological torture, but an actual crack at  Hollywood and it's eccentricities.  <br />But Paramount has screwed up YET  AGAIN.  They did it wit hEvent Horizon, and thye did it again with  Truman... *NO BONUS MATERIALS*.  Oh yeah, we get 2 trailers, *BUT THAT'S  IT*.<br />This movie SCREAMS for commentary.  It's what DVDs were MADE FOR!   Heck, I think they probably had a WHOLE LOT of cut scenes on the cutting  room floor, but did they include them?  *NO*.<br />I give this movie a 3, 5  for the movie, and 1 for content.
B000006NPY|2.0|While this is not a bad album, it is taking a step away from what is good and taken a step closer to what we true music lovers hate. In this outting, Corgan has done his part to put his knife in the back of the dying art  known as grunge rock. While &quot;Perfect&quot; is undoubtably a catchy  song, it (like all of the songs on this album) is destined to be buried in  the junk pile known as pop music. The music industry today is about selling  out to a bunch of people who will all buy your CD and will listen to it for  about two weeks and then trash it. This is not what Smashing Pumpkins used  to be about and I don't believe that this is how Corgan truely feels. Ifyou  want to hear some classic Pumpkins, get Siamese Dream (ranks right up there  with Pearl Jam's &quot;Ten&quot; and Nirvana's &quot;Nevermind&quot;).  Don't participate in the mass murder of true music by buy trashy pop albums  that devalue and degrade our music culture. I give this album a  &quot;2&quot; only because &quot;Perfect&quot; is a decent song.
0151002002|5.0|a good book.the only dicken book i enjoyed. not because the other books are stupid,  they are just to describtive.
B000002UZ1|5.0|This is an incredible collection of essential hits for the casual listener, collected in a straightforward manner. The sheer number and quality of great hits by this band is boggling. I encourage listeners to  hear this album in conjunction with its companion, &quot;The Beatles  1962-1966.&quot; The Beatles were constantly evolving, and it is important  to take their music as a whole; for while these later songs may sound more  contemporary to modern ears, one should hear where and how modern rock was  invented in this way by these same Beatles, and how they were superb from  start to finish.
0767814622|5.0|This is a great movie for people all around the world, those who fight for the human rights.
0780624890|4.0|It's a cool movie, but the special effects are too computerized, blood is like cartoons, and morphing of faces just doesn't look scary. But the movie itself is great and the sound+picture quality are stunning.The story is god  too. Definetely a buyer
0790737345|5.0|&quot;City of Angels&quot; isn't one of those movies in which you leave the theatre with a humungous smile on your face, laughing all the way to the car while popcorn residue falls from the front of your shirt. In fact,  it's possible to really dislike this film right after you see it. I know I  left the theatre saying, &quot;They can't do that! They just can't do  that!&quot;     But after about a week of sitting at stop lights drenched  in seemingly eternal crimson and haggling over mountains of bills, certain  images work their way into your consciousness, images from the film you saw  a week ago, and you can almost feel an angel's hand on your shoulder as you  stand in the ten items or less line at Lucky.     The beauty of this film,  for me, lies as much in the world it creates as well as the story it tells.  Nicholas Cage and Meg Ryan create an amazing, if improbable, chemistry  through which we feel every emotion in front of us; Dennis Franz gives an  exceptional performance as the lovable fallen angel; And then there's Andre  Braugher, who I believe is one of the finest actors anywhere, period.     But the true credit for this film's stunning grace is deserved by director  Brad Siberling. The world which he creates is one of angels and humans, but  not a world in which those angels play baseball or are obsessed with death.  &quot;City of Angels&quot; is about life, and Siberling's angels are  appreciators of humans,doing so quietly, and yet with immense strength. The  direction of their placement is perfect, and each action of theirs reminds  us of an appreciation for humans (and life)that gives Cage's character all  the more beauty, and credability in the closing scenes. Indeed, it is the  nuances of &quot;City of Angels&quot; which make it so good.      The  supplemental material on this Special Edition DVD gives us insight into  those nuances, and is just another example of why this format should be  supported. &quot;City of Angels&quot; is a movie whichbecomes a part of  you. It teaches how incredible the human experience really is. And when you  believe that, you can almost feel an angel smiling right at you.
0440131480|5.0|In sort of a creative release, Vonnegut creates one of the strangest and most unique novels I've read.  It takes a bit of knowledge into Vonnegut's style, but if you've liked other works by Vonnegut, don't miss Breakfast of  Champions.
0140157352|5.0|as the manager of a middle sized distributor we found this book deals with  the stalls in negotiating, and can teach us all useful methods. if stalls  are what you need to solve, THE 2000 PERCENT SOLUTION,WHICH IS JUST OUT IS  THE NEW BIBLE ON HOW TO SOLVE STALLS.

B000000ITU|5.0|I have a U2 library of over 25 different CDs.  It is without hesitation that I choose The Unforgettable Fire as my favorite.  I've never been so amazed by 10 songs on one album.  I only wish it were longer!  Pride, the  most familiar song on the album, is my personal favorite.  The title track  is another powerful tune.  Personally, it is a true 80s song.  The ever so  popular, Bad, is very catchy and is constantly played back on my CD player.  You can't &quot;let it go.&quot; With powerful sounds it's no wonder why  this album is unforgettable.
6300151379|5.0|Okay, this is a bad thing to do.  But I think we'd all agree we are desperate. Somebody has a copy of this wonderful movie and can copy it and send it out there.  Just a naughty suggestion
0446310786|5.0|This was a book that stuck with me weeks after I first read it.  The novel covers so many relevant themes: tolerance, justice, the title To Kill a Mockingbird.  It made me weep for all the mockingbirds of the world, those  who do no harm yet are punished anyway.  It also made me angry at our  society, and angry at human nature in general.  It was a truly special  book, and I loved the ending.  It was perfect.
6300151379|5.0|Ever since I was a little girl I loved this movie. It is such a well done fantasy film that I still enjoy. And David Bowie---- wow! That scene where Jennifer C and him dance makes my heart flutter. I've been trying to get  this for years but it's not anywhere! I haven't even been able to rent it.   I look forward to a wide screen edition. It's like the Wizard of Oz,  timeless and spellbinding, and perpetually enchanting.
6303908306|5.0|I watched this movie for the first time one friday night in 1996.. and then promptly watched it a second, and then third time.  It is simply unvelievable.  The movie has a complexity the likes of which I have NEVER  run across, but of course, you won't know this until the end...
630349255X|5.0|The beautiful imagery in this film makes anyone love life and all its wonders.  Just buy it!
B000007RV5|1.0|Florida is fast becoming a hotbed of ****** 'music' with such acts as Matchbox 20, Creed, Marilyn Manson, and Limp Bizkit.  I gave this album a listen a few days ago, and I don't even wanna listen to it again.  The only  thing that prevented me from burning the piece of **** was that it belonged  to my younger brother.  Every  'song' in the album sounded the same, and  the dumbest song in this album is their cover of George Michael's Faith.   It is so terrible George Michael should consider suing the band for turning  his song into a utterly pathetic mess.  I hope the 14-year old kids who  bought this **** acquire some intelligence when they grow older, and sell  this **** to their local used-cd stores.
6305177473|5.0|I could never get sick of this movie! I watched it 4 times in 2 days! It is great! It is spirited and fun for all ages. My question is, is the nanny's name Chessie, or Jessie???? ILOVE THE PARENT TRAP! TWO THUMBS UP  (PLUS A COULPE FINGERS!)
0780622642|1.0|As someone who grew up with the TV series, I was frankly disappointed by this remake. The chemistry which made the TV series so enjoyable is woefully missing, save for a few tender moments between Captain Robinson  and Wil. Despite the efforts of the cast and whizzy FX, there's not much  going on in this film. Goes to show you shouldn't mess with a great premise  and a superb cast.
157330087X|5.0|This gathering of rock/blues all-stars is incredible!  Starting with Bonnie Raitt and ending with an all-star jam session, this show is over way too soon.  How many times in a blues fan's life will we see B.B.King, Eric  Clapton, Buddy Guy and Robert Cray performing live on the same stage?  Brother Jimmie's leadership and organization resulted in a very special  event.  One of my favorite moments is watching Eric Clapton's smile go  Grand Canyon-wide as Buddy Guy jams late in the gig.  These folks were  having some fun!  Stevie Ray must have been having fun, too.
6300216047|5.0|The opening sequence of Barbarella is probably the greatest in cinematic history, who thought up the idea of a striptease in space? Whoever it was deserves an award for it sets up the theme for the entire film perfectly.  Mindless sex in futuristic settings, how fabulous. The plot is distored,  disjointed and at the end of the day pointless. But hey, so what...it gives  Miss Fonda plenty of chance to change her groovy costumes. Classic lines  and moments in the film are a plently, with some of the most classic scenes  being Barbarella being attacked by dolls with attitude and Barbarella  having a strange kind of &quot;virtual sex&quot; which leads to  &quot;hair-raising&quot; consequences. This is a classic beyond all  comprehension, it has to be seen to be belived. I saulte you all and offer  you this message..LOVE!!!
630027179X|5.0|The best portrayal, the most lush and, dare I say it?, erotic, of the Arthurian Legend ever to grace film. Director John Boorman managed to squeeze into this film powerful levels of *sparks* (provided by Merlin and  Morgana), lust (courtesy of Gueneviere and Lancelot), betrayal (kudos to  Mordred) and loyalty to duty (Arthur), all incredibly blended with a score  to die for. I have seen this probably 40 times and every time I find some  nuance I hadn't detected before. A guy movie. A girl movie. You get the  picture!
B000001ESF|5.0|Like most of the other 'critics' here, I am a long-time Rush fan.  In the late 70s, &quot;2112&quot; represented a powerful force that caught my awakening musical interests as an easily influenced 14-year old.  I've  'grown-up' with Rush ever since, collecting albums and attending concerts  (I especially enjoyed the live rendition of 2112 on the latest 'Test for  Echo' tour).  <br />Now, as my musical tastes continue to progress and  regress, I feel a longing for 'fresh' concept albums - a '2112' for the  here and now.  A few artists have recently come close (Queensryche's  'Operation: Mindcrime', Marillion's 'Misplaced Childhood', and Fates  Warning's 'A Pleasant Shade of Gray' -produced by Terry Brown btw), but I  still feel a void.  <br />Perhaps '2112' is truly the pinnacle of rock concept  albums.  Or have I missed some talented work along the way?  Feedback on  this subject would be greatly appreciated, either in this '2112 review'  forum or directly to my e-mail address.<br />Are record company 'Priests'  irreverently smashing rock artist's attempts to release non-mainstream  concept works?
0385482582|4.0|As seen from the other comments, there are definitely certain things this book provides that are great, and others that it doesn't.<br />Read this book for the following:<br />A Good, quick, story summarizing the deintegration of  the computing value chain. About the emergence of a zone of 'No Profit' in  memory chips in the 80s. About the importance of looking out on the  periphery. About drawing your industry landscape. About being open to  drastic shifts in your industry. About managing change in your oganization  (a high-level perspective).<br />Don't read it for anything else.
0140430148|5.0|This book has such an elaborate plot from detectives to suicides. It really leaves you guessing who, what, where, when, and most of all how. It kept my eyes glued to the page and without a doubt is one of the best  mysteries ever written.
6303433766|5.0|Heavenly Creatures is my favorire film of all.  Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey give amazing performances.   Peter Jackson proves he can do more than just gore movies.  The fantasy sequences are the best of all.  I love  this movie.  Yeah.
6305229449|5.0|Mulan got me interested in Disney again.  I've always loved their movies but the last few years I have not enjoyed the movies at all.  At 20 years old, I thought I was growing out of Disney (a somewhat disconcerting  thought *S*) but Mulan proved that wrong.  It was great, a fantastic story,  it's a movie I can watch again and again.  I will definately be buying the  video.  <br />I loved the strong female character, the fact that she used her  mind as well as the fighting skills she learned was great.  Disney did a  good job with Mulan by giving us a movie that adults and children both can  watch and love.  I can only hope they can repeat that quality in their next  effort. Mulan is my favorite Disney movie besides Beauty and the Beast.   <br />I would strongly recommend this to anyone who can tolerate animated  movies, it is not one to miss.
630287789X|5.0|Anybody reading this that remembers the anxiety of getting into college, and the pressure of peers will absolutely fall in love with this movie. It stars a young an innocent Tom Cruise and a naughty ReBecca DeMorray. The  soundtrack is absolutely amazing due to Tangerine Dream's mix of eighties  sounds. Also, Bruce Springsteen, Bob Seger, and the Talking Heads are some  others that team up to contribute to this movie. Cruise and DeMorray team  up to give audiences what may be their best perfomances. A MUST  SEE!!!!!!!!!!!
1573226521|4.0|It's a good read, frustrating to think of the ways that it could have been even better.
6304578482|5.0|Go see this movie with three or four of your close girl friends &amp; I guarantee you'll have fun! This is a fabulous movie. It is soooo funny. Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino work together to create a hilarious movie that  is perfect for girl bonding.
0060977493|1.0|Could someone please explain to me why so many contemporary novels read by book groups have to be filled with gloom and doom.  In this novel, it got to be almost laughable.  Not only do we have the standard issues of  alcoholism, child abuse, and indifferent mothers which seem to be in every  novel these days, The God of Small Things throws in incest, murder,  anti-Christian propaganda, and characters who have no single redeeming  quality in their collective little, abused souls.  After reading this  novel, I wanted to take a shower to remove all the depression and filth it  left behind.
6305177473|5.0|First...5 stars is NOT ENOUGH for this film. Let's face it, the remake of The Parent trap was bound to happen, and how can anything compare to the original , which also deserves 5 stars with Halley Mills? Well this film  surpasses the original in almost every way. The acting, direction of this  film is unbelievable! The film is so touching, it leaves you only wanting  to experience it again! This film should be nominated for best picture,  director, actress, (Lindsay Lohan steals the film!), music, and special  efects. If you liked the first one, this film is even better! It is on my  top 5 list of films of all time! What else can I say for a wonderful film,  that is so very funny, truly a masterpiece, and by far the best Disney film  since ever made.
080012166X|5.0|A masterly told story about the highest &amp; lowest human passions, over space &amp; time; a superb direction able to gather ever-great Anthony Hopkins, striking but wasted Gary Oldman, weirdly fascinating Keanu Reeves  &amp; Winona Ryder &amp; an amazing Sadie Frost in a coherent group of  splendid actors that give their best to the only purpose of the story  telling, turning the script into the big star of the movie. A classic since  the very first day it was released.
0790736314|5.0|I REMEMBER WATCHING THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME WHEN I WAS 10, I HAD NIGHTMARES FOR NIGHTS!  AS AN ADULT, I STILL CANNOT WATCH THIS FILM BY MYSELF, IT STILL GIVES ME CHILLS.  TRULY THE SCARIEST FILM OF ALL TIME!

0684135051|5.0|This book, with E.Z.'s (as the author is known to thousands around the world)simple philosophy, shares a hidden world of knitting with us. She touches on her own learnings, &quot;unventions&quot; as she calls them. She  brought me back into the woolie fold of knitters many years ago and I  haven't looked back since. I would heartily recommend this book to anyone  interested in learning to knit their own designs and creations. She also  includes &quot;pithy directions&quot; for those of us who still feel we  need line by line directions. Read this book with wool and needles in hand.
6300216365|4.0|I recently purchased &quot;play it again,sam&quot; here at amazon and as soon as I saw it I started laughing. In this film Woody plays a man who just got a divorce from his wife and is trying to bounce back and pick up  new girls . However , his peculiar mannerisms and foolish mistakes dont  make him out to be the most atractive man in the world. His performance  along with Diane Keaton make this film a truly pleasant one to watch. The  film is both funny and sweet in a certain way , I recomend this movie to  all movie lovers (even if you're not a Woody Allen film lover).
6305229449|5.0|I loved Mulan! The dialogue was great, and the story itself was very well done. I have nothing but praise for any movie that can take me from tears to laughter in the space of two minutes. I was initially worried about  Eddie Murphy's role (must every Disney hero have a silly sidekick?) but his  character, I thought, only added to the movie. He was really good at being  comic relief and at helping to move the story forward. In fact, I thought  he did a better job than most of the other sidekicks! This was one of the  best movies of 1998, and the best Disney in years. I look forward to buying  it and watching it again and again.
6301963911|5.0|This is truly the greatest romantic comedy of all time. Allen &amp; Keaton (one of film's greatest duos) deliver in a huge way , as the movie shows us how love is a necesity in all human beings .&quot;Annie Hall&quot; is loved  and praised by viewers around the world and should be in every film buffs  video library.
B00000DQSZ|5.0|While &quot;Autobahn&quot; blew me out of the water in 1974, &quot;TEE&quot; goes further!    This album has gorgeously crafted sounds -- the cuts are entrancing.    There is a unique mixing of elements here,  classical and Eastern European, to go along with the boys' characteristic  mastery of pure, pulsing rhythms.     This is their BEST work, and  &quot;TEE&quot; is unusual enough that it could appeal to people who didn't  necessarily like &quot;Autobahn.&quot;
0783226551|4.0|This movie isnt one of Scorsese's and Deniro's greatest films but it truly is an exciting thriller , as Deniro plays an ex-convict who wants revevnge from the lawyer that failed to defend him properly (Nick Nolte). The movie  is very entertaining , and Deniro does an excellent job playing the bad  guy. &quot;Cape Fear&quot; makes for a good movie rental anyday of the  week.
0790731185|5.0|Occasionally, Hollywood spits out a quality movie like this one.  They are stories of survival, survival of the fittest.  Andy and Red were survivors.  In the end, they both realized their hopes and dreams.  It's no mistake  that they picked the most ominous and scary prison they could find.  The  filmakers want you to feel that there is no hope in a place like that.   They want you to feel that any inmate sent there can count on a miserable  stay.  Some would say that there was too much violence in the movie.  What  you have got to remember is Violence is a fact of life.  I would suspect  that violence like that was fairly common in that time.  If you want to do  a movie, you would want to depict it as true to life as you possibly can.   <br />All that aside, the movie is spectacular.  The movie is a little long,  but it is necessary to the story.  Remember, Andy was in prison for almost  20 years!  His planning to escape was continuing throghout that whole  time.<br />In the opinion of this film critic it is a must see.
0783221622|5.0|One of america's greatest living filmmakers Martin Scorsese teams up again with Robert Deniro and Joe Pesci (&quot;Raging Bull&quot;,&quot;Goodfellas&quot;...) and did &quot;Casino&quot; in what  turned out to be one of the greatest mob movies ever made .As far as I'm  concerned , this is Sharon Stone's greatest performance as an actress , and  Deniro and Pesci deliver as usual. The movie's script was brilliantly made  and is both entertaining and original.Casino is a movie that should be seen  not only by Scorsese and Deniro lovers , but by movie fans worldwide.
B0000029GA|5.0|Bottom line this album is hip hop classic! and the only reason I would have for any hip hop head buying this album 5 years late is cuz your original CD is scratched up from playin it so damn much!  This album will  never die
6304366027|4.0|Robert Deniro and Liza Minelli give wonderfull performances as a couple who teamed up in the most unsual way to play nightclubs as a saxophone player(deniro) and a singer(minelli).The movie contains great musical  scores and wonderfull choreography .
6300216268|5.0|You're not going to believe all these reviews. They all say &quot;the greatest&quot; &quot;best movie ever&quot; &quot;my favorite&quot;. Well, it is one of my top ten along with Silver Streak and Cool Hand Luke,  Amadeus and that old standby Casablanca. H&amp;M, however is nothing like  any of the other movies. It stands alone and the music is so well suited to  the movie you'll never hear Cat Stevens again without thinking of Harold.  (Sort of like visualizing Anne Bancroft in The Graduate when you hear  S&amp;G sing Mrs. Robinson.) This is one movie you can watch again and  again just to keep you straight. And Harold is not one to go straight, but  then you'll have to see for yourself. Great flick. If you are debating  whether to get it. Don't. Just buy it.<br />Darrell Batchelder
B000002KIE|3.0|This album is neither groundbreaking nor excellent. It is an okay album with about 4 standout tracks (most notably, &quot;bodies&quot;). To honestly put this band in perspective, consider their reunion. Oooh, that  wasn't rebellion, was it. This is about money, which they made loads of.  Not essential unless you are an avid punk fan
0553573403|4.0|I found this book to be quite slow storywise until about the last third or so.  Not to say that it wasn't enjoyable.  The storytelling and characterization are terrific.  Mr. Martin alludes to things that promise  to make the following books very exciting.  The last couple hundred pages  were simply enthralling.  I couldn't put the book down.  I can't wait for  the second installment!!!
6305229449|5.0|Mulan is a wonderful family movie.  Adults and kids will both enjoy this story.  Mulan is a determined young girl who's goal is to help her family and her village.  Using her smarts and her martial arts skills, Mulan  outwits the enemies and everyone lives happily ever after.  Cute  characters, wonderful music!
B000001FI7|5.0|I must admit, Portishead has achieved that most difficult thing to do-- remain higly original and yet produce some good music.<br />'Dummy' will become a classic.<br />addition, Oct. 29th, 2001: <br />'Dummy' has long since deservedly become a classic.  I don't know where else I can find such a delicately perfect balance of sweetness, mixed with retro-beats, heavy synth, and a fair dose sinisterness.  <br />(...)<br />There is always a ray of light, a faint shimmer of beauty in the gloom that one encounters when they hear 'Dummy'.  Perhaps that light has since faded now that Portishead is no longer active as a creative entity, but I'd have to put 'Dummy' on my short list of all-time great CDs top-to-bottom.  It's simply one of the best ever.
B00000DGUG|1.0|Once the CD starts spinning, the crackling of Alanis' horse like screeching voice begins to permeate the air as agent orange did in the Vietnam war.  Her empty and try-so-hard to be deep lyrics do nothing for  the music world but allow mediocre musicians to sound like geniuses when  compared to this true mockery of the music world.  If you want to spend 13  bucks on something, do yourself a huge favor and buy 30000 thumb tacks  instead, because spending 13 dollars on this CD is just like spending 13  dollars for a coffee table coaster.
B000002AZ8|4.0|Whenever bands evolve, whenever artists take risks, there's always someone writing them off with 1 star because the newest album isn't enough like the classic one.  I respect artists like PJ and Smashing Pumpkins who don't put  out six versions of &quot;Ten&quot; or &quot;Siamese Dream&quot;,  respectively.  Vitology rocks, and while it's uneven and contains a few  annoying jokes, it's a lot better than &quot;Jeremy II&quot; would have  been.
B000002BYD|5.0|I've been a huge Pearl Jam fan ever since late 1992 when Ten was getting airtime on all of the radio stations and on MTV. I fell in love with Ten and I still listen to it religiously.  However, Ten was seven years ago and  I am seven years more mature now, and I am glad to see that Pearl Jam has  matured with me.     I have never been disappointed in a Pearl Jam album,  and if they continue to release cd's of this caliber, I doubt I will.  From  the first song, Brain of J, I was captivated by the emotion this cd poured  out.  Brain of J is one of only two hard songs on this cd, the remaineder  is rather mellow, and dare I say &quot;beautiful&quot;? Trust me, unless  you are one of those Top 40 freaks who likes Backstreet Boys, Brandy, and   Barenaked Ladies, you will not be disappointed by this masterpiece in  modern music.
B0000028UK|5.0|I'm pleased to see that other customers recognize the value in this album...some people underrate Vs. terribly because it isn't exactly like Ten.  Quite simply, this album rocks.  Full of raw emotion, it's Pearl Jam  at their grittiest.
630264366X|5.0|An excellent movie - one which will hold audiences throughout with no trouble. I have now viewed the movie on TV on a number of times and always fully enjoy watching it.
B000000WA4|5.0|Anyone who gives this album fewer than four stars hasn't let these tunes seep in.  This music is gorgeous, diverse, intense, and heartfelt.  It's got everything from scorching metal to sweet, romantic ballads to poignant  laments.  There's a lot more to this Sadness than the blatant bitterness of  Zero; Mellon Collie is about a range of human feeling beyond depression.   There's always somebody writing the Pumpkins off, but that's because Billy  Corgan knows how to take risks and let his full talent show.  Don't let  them fool you.  This album will crown your collection of 90's rock.
630463949X|5.0|One of the most impressive DVD's Ever! A perfect balance of bass and chimes to truly test your surround sound home theater! A must for any fan of Fleetwood Mac! As well as a must for anyone with a new home theater with  DVD! You never get tired of watching it! I am looking foward to playing it  the next time I have some friends over... I know they will love it as much  as I do! ~ J. Young
B000000W6R|3.0|This CD is by no means perfect--arguably their weakest--but it contains a few brilliant gems.  If you want a Smashing collection of B-sides, get The Aeoroplane Flies High...Pisces pales by comparison.  I'm getting this disc  because it's Pumpkins and has some excellent songs that make it worthwhile.  :)
0399143904|3.0|Although this is a good book with a great plot summary, this is not one of Tom Clancy's best.  The technical data, as expected, is superior to most other war novels.  The plot is rather original compared to most of the  books I read, but there was just something missing.  Tom Clancy tried to be  to modern, and changed his writing style, for the worse, to appease his  audiance.  This was not worth the effort, as many people would have read  and enjoyed the book any way.  I would recommend this book, but I did think  that it could have been better.                                             -Justin Barr
6305265488|5.0|This is one of the best Cinderalla story put to film.  Drew Barrymore did such a wonderful part in acting the role of Danielle in &quot; EverAfter &quot;. Would highly recommend the movie for everyone to see and especially  to add it to there collection of greatest films on tape.
0792151712|1.0|Pretty worthless - a cliche-ridden soap-opera that takes place on a sinking boat. The sinking boat stuff is kind of nifty, but the story and acting are crummy.
6305229449|5.0|After being disappointed in Disney's last few films, I went to see Mulan without many expectations.  But what I found was the best Disney movie yet!  A strong, unselfish(!) female lead manages to save the civilized world of  her time through her courage and dedication.  The movie was a roller  coaster of emotions, running full tilt from having you rolling with  laughter to the verge (or past) of tears.  Easily five stars.
0790705141|5.0|I loved the shinning it's the best movie for sleepovers!It's so scary
079073382X|5.0|If you've ever travelled through Europe in a train, roamed through cities like Vienna and bumped into characters like the amateur artists in the cow play or the poet by the river, and above all, if you've ever met the right  person at the end of a journey and had to say good bye...this is your  movie. It captures so well the moments, the gist, the atmosphere... You can  watch it again and again and again and find new details every time. Not to  mention the beautiful photography. A must.
B000002AGN|5.0|Like many of the other reviews here, this CD, along with Kind of Blue, was the first jazz CD I purchased.  I do remember that my parents owned a copy of Time Out as well, but I was too young to appreciate what a masterpiece  it truly is.  Where to begin?  Take Five deserves every bit of its  reputation as the best-selling jazz song of all time.  From Joe Morello's  sly and understated opening drum licks, to Brubeck's steady rocking piano,  to THE absolute greatest sax lines ever, as blown by the inimitable Mr.  Paul Desmond (I don't want to sound too much like a teenager here, but  Desmond rules!), the song is a pleasure from beginning to end.  It is so  wonderful that it almost brings tears to my eyes every time I hear it.   Every time I play the CD (which is often), I play Take Five first, then  play the whole CD, basically because I just can't wait to hear the song.   It's that good.<br />Not to be overlooked, Three To Get Ready is a lovely  tune, one that makes my two-year old son sway with pleasure in his high  chair.  I find myself humming Brother Dave's melodious intro. all the time.   Kathy's Waltz is equally wonderful, and is all the more special to me, as  a father, knowing that Dave wrote it for his daughter.  Then...(why am I  wasting space--every song on the CD is great!!)<br />It thrills me to know  that Mr. Brubeck is still with us, at almost 80 years of age.  I recently  read that the marvelous Joe Morello is now totally blind but still teaches  drums and plays (!) too.  I don't know what has become of Gene Wright, but  his fine bass playing should not be overlooked.<br />The only sad part for me  is knowing that the incredible Paul Desmond has been dead for more than 20  years.  I haven't had the opportunity to hear all of the great sax players  (yet), but Desmond will always be at the top of my list, especially for  alto players.<br />BUY THIS CD!!

B000002KB8|5.0|I first listened to this album back in the 60s when it was released.  I was a kid - I was amazed - I was hooked.  I still love to finger through all my BS albums (vinyl of course) and turn them now and again.  BS and DP  are by far, miles ahead of the garbage thats out there now.  I saw BS live  in Virginia at the Dome in 1969 and they blew me away.  I don't like Ozzy's  solo stuff but who comes close to these guys in this album except the  second incarnation of Deep Purple's Machine Head (i.e. with Ian).  Amazing  album! None of the other Sabbath music came close to this release.  And  they cut it in three days.  Nowadays it takes almost a year to crank out  half baked formula crap.  BS was on the cutting edge of new music in 1969  and they'll live on in music history.

0787100277|1.0|I am female. I am a romantic. And I couldn't stand it. This book is so banal and badly written one wonders how it got published at all. The fact that it became such a huge success tells us more about the state of  literacy and education in our world than about the quality of this book.  The prose is wooden, the characters are comatose and the story is so  ridiculous  and hypocritical you want to throw up. The only reason I read  it at all is I got stuck for three days in a camp with no other book  around. A hint for amazon.com: please introduce a no-star category. A hint  for Mr. Waller: please do not write any more books.
6302798450|5.0|Can you say best trilogy of all time?  WOW!!!  Bruce is definatly a bad &quot;Ash&quot; in this one.  Don't forget the magic words....clato,  varata,  nicto!!
0784011796|3.0|I can't stand the math part. It's so stupid and it doesn't make any sense. Good will huntin also has a stupid math part, but at least the movie isn't about that. I still give it 3 stars 'cause it's not quite painful to watch  it and I sort of like the paranoid part
6302038308|5.0|You will never think any horror flick is greater than this after you see it!!!!!  Ash is back again with a new love......of course she doesn't last long.  Ash has many loves in his life.  This movie is sure to make you jump  with surprise and laugh yourself silly,  as Ash knows.  Don't be a goody  little two shoes!!!!!  See this now!!!!
B000002UAR|5.0|wow...this is one you can keep listening to and always come out with a new view on it...sometimes it scares the poop right out of me...an amazing offering by four truly talented men who knew what was going on...ringo had  everyone tricked...
0790701251|5.0|I think that this movie is one of the best I've ever seen dealing with Basic Training and war.  It's odd for a female to be writing a review for a war movie, but I really enjoyed it, being the Army.  I can relate to the  events in their Basic Training.  Oh, and just as a side note.  Everything's  militarily correct dealing with the time.  Watch it, it's a real eye  opener.
0782008372|4.0|Highlander is an awsome movie to begin with. But on DVD the picture quality is less then perfect, that I agree with but one has to understand a few basethings about the movie. First of all Highlander was not a bigbudget  extravaganza but rather a small production that was a huuuuge success. And  being a small budget film the quality of the original fotage is less than  perfect so the DVD has that quality too. DVD dosent preform magic and  cannot make the picture cristalclear on Highlander. So the DVD is more for  the fans and collectors rather than the average viewer. If your only going  to buy it because you want to see the movie and dont care for all the  trimmings on the DVD, buy the VHS instead since the quality of picture and  sound is the same on this on. Maybe the sound is better on the DVD but it's  not worth it in itself.
B000001FN1|5.0|Dark lyrics, with very solid base, combined with a strong German accented vocals.
B000002VTE|4.0|I'm a huge fan of the band, but I'd have to say this is my least favorite of their albums.  &quot;I Think I'm In Love&quot; and &quot;Electricity&quot; are two of their best tracks, but some of the other  songs could use some trimming (how long can one float in space without  feeling uncomfortably spacey?).  Nevertheless, I still put this one in the  CD player on a regular basis because Spiritualized is one of the most  original and inventive bands out there.  I'd suggest &quot;Lazer-Guided  Melodies&quot; as the one to get you hooked; once you're on board, you'll  buy all the other ones anyway.  This is how I occupy altered realms without  drugs--this is sonic mental alteration at its best.
6303430570|4.0|&quot;Clerks&quot; is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  Kevin Smith takes a bunch of average Joes and turns them into a hilarious bunch of characters.  The acting is so natural that it doesn't even seem like  acting.  But it does get a little dirty at times so make sure that you  don't have any small children around.
B000002BYD|5.0|This album is amazing! From the opening riff in Brain of J to the closing oriental song , after all those yestardays, it´s one hell of a ride. Pearl jams music has always been so much about feelings and emotions and they  have constantly evolved. Personally I like the new pearl jam instead of the  old anthem like rock songs on Ten and Yield definately shows that rock  isn´t dead no matter what the critics say and who listens to critics  anyway. Just buy this record and enjoy. <br />By the way, if your´e interested  in great music check out Grace By Jeff Buckley or the soundtrack for the  movie First love, last rites.
B000002UR7|4.0|Pablo Honey offers more than a glimpse at the quality that Radiohead would produce with The Bends and OK Computer. &quot;Creep&quot; is the only track that lent itself to the typical alternative sound, and even that shows a  superiority in comparison to other songs out at the time. A great debut.
B00000HZHS|4.0|The CD contains a lot of songs that I realy enjoy and listen to over and over again. But I don't care for some songs that seem to be just loud shouting and no words.  But I do think it is worth buying.
0312965788|5.0|Great book for all ages. Show the love between a vet and his patients. James hariot master at bring the human and animal race together.
B00000DHTF|5.0|As somebody who is as old as Bruce's recording career, I am just disappointed that I could not see Bruce perform when he was my age. The effort in each of his songs on the first two discs is something which is  quite outstanding, and something which you just don't find with modern day  singer/songwriters. And for all those who don't think the last cd is any  good, you think of a song that is written and sung with as much emotion as  back in your arms and brothers under the bridge. Thanks Bruce!
6305265488|5.0|Forget all those hyped movies of the summer, Ever After outshined them all. Drew Barrymore was great in this film. It has it all: great story, great dialogue, great costumes, great characters, and the scenery is just  beautiful. I loved it in the theaters and cant wait to buy it on video!
B000002IOW|5.0|Rush's most inorganic and difficultly-acquired sound is also their most rewarding.  Presto is an ideal example of the trio's compositional excellence.
B000002UJQ|5.0|So I cheated. I bought OK Computer before I bought Pablo Honey and The Bends. No matter. I was enraptured by the CD - it's haunting, tragic message intertwined with rage (&quot;Climbing the Walls,&quot;  &quot;Electioneering&quot;). If this album isn't in the collection of every  serious music listener, then I'm sure it was an oversight on the part of  the purchaser.
0553269631|3.0|I read this book because it was voted in the top 100 of all time.  I'm trying to expand on the kind of popular fiction I usually read.  While I found the book insightful and well-written, it was very depressing.  I kept  waiting for something &quot;good&quot; to happen to somebody.  I did think  the book's various plots were remarkable for its time (1940).
0312966199|5.0|BRING THE EXPREINCE OF YORKSHIRE TO LIFE.  BRING LAUGHTER AND TEARS TO ME. GREAT BOOK YOU CAN READ ANY TIME.
B000000WA4|4.0|Even though I bought this album over two years ago, I thought I would make a few comments on it. While this isn't the best album ever made, it is a good album with many different types of songs. It ranges from extremely  heavy (&quot;Tales Of A Scorched Earth&quot;, &quot;Bullet...&quot;), to  very mellow (&quot;1979&quot;, &quot;Thirty-Three&quot;). Overall, this  album can't compare to Siamese Dream. For some reason, the guitar on this  album just doesn't sound as clear as on SD. Any way you look at it, this  album is not a bad buy.
B0000020C4|5.0|What else can one say about this MAGNIFICENT concert/recording? I loved every second of it. Every song is worth 5 stars itself. The performances are superb, of course. Well, what else could you expect when you have Colm  Wilkinson (THE Valjean), Philip Quast and Lea Salonga? The only  &quot;flaw&quot; was Judy Kuhn's performance, which I found dreadful.  I  espessially loved the end when International Valjeans sing &quot;Do You  Hear The People Sing?&quot;  The sounds the audience makes (applauding  etc.) are not disturbing at all (except this point in &quot;Castle On A  Cloud&quot; when a ballon pops. I swear, if I knew the kid who did this I  would strangle it).  Don't wait! GO BUY IT NOOOOOOW!!!!
0553296981|5.0|I loved this book so much! It made me think alot about things, about how lonely and scared I would be if that ever happened to me or my family. I think that Anne Frank was brave! She is an inspiration to people all over  the country. I highly recomend that you read this book.
B000002UB3|5.0|The first side of &quot;Abbey Road&quot; is superb.  &quot;Come Together&quot; is extraordinary.  &quot;Something&quot; may be one of the most beautiful loves songs ever written.  Paul's bass playing on  &quot;Something&quot; and &quot;Oh! Darling&quot; is some of the most  melodic you will find anywhere.  &quot;Maxwell...&quot; and  &quot;Octopus...&quot; are lightweight toss-off's, but they're still quite  enjoyable.  &quot;I Want You&quot; is transfixing - a definite headphone  song.  However, it is the second side, starting with &quot;Here Comes the  Sun&quot; that really leaves me stunned.  The music on this song-suite is  so extraordinary, so completely perfect, I could almost be convinced that  is was devinely inspired!  But, I'm not religious, so I guess I'll have to  settle for the notion that these guys were musical geniuses.  There'e  really no way to fully describe why the second half of Abbey Road is so  incredible in the limited space provided here.  A volume of books could be  written on the subject of this album alone.  So, I suggest to anyone who  doesn't own this album, no matter what your musical tastes - go out and  purchase it today.  There's no better place to start your Beatle's  collection.  But be forwarned; you may become addicted to the group!
630027179X|5.0|Simply the best...  Totally free from the Political Correct junkies. I dare say that we may never see such a great adaptation from a historical story again.
B000000W6R|3.0|This is a strange album. When I first bought it, I was blown away by songs like &quot;Frail &amp; Bedazzled&quot;, &quot;Plume&quot;, &quot;Pissant&quot;, and &quot;Hello Kitty Kat&quot;. Oddly enough, I got  sick of this album really fast. I don't know why. Looking back on this  album...it was good...but B-Sides are B-Sides none the less. Overall it's  good for a B-Sides album and I don't think you'll be disappointed. If you  like Siamese Dream, a lot of these songs sound like the ones on that album  because many were B-Sides of the singles from that album. If you really  want the best Smashing Pumpkins album, get Siamese Dream.
0694003611|5.0|Our child has us read this book to him so many times in a day that it has been worn out to the point that a second purchase is nessessary. The words just flow from page to page keeping his interest. The contrast from black  and white to the color pages keeps him searching for the items that are  read. This book is a must for any parent!
B000002UDB|5.0|This is one of the Beatles most enjoyable efforts.   It has a wonderful childlike quality.  Regarding the previous review that mentions &quot;Baby Your A Rich Man&quot; was a &quot;snide comment on Brian Epstien's race and  sexuality&quot;: That is only an unsubstantiated rumour.  While it is  possible, it is unlikely that McCartney or Lennon would say negative things  about Epstien's Jewish heritage or homosexual orientation.  That said,  &quot;Strawberry Fields&quot; has got to be one of the greatest musical  creations of all time.  Listen to this song with headphones on and it will  blow you away!  The rest of the music on this album are is also excellent.   &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; is wonderfully warped.  McCartney comes up with  some terrific melodies on &quot;Penny Lane&quot; and &quot;Your Mother  Should Know&quot;.  &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; is a perfect  reflection of the era.  And the rest works quite nicely within the context  of this album.  The only people who needn't purchase this album are those  who like the Beatles, but are not fanatical, and already own the Blue Album  greatest hits.
B000002HEM|5.0|All the hits are here, and this is perhaps the most polished and unadulterated live performance I've heard. This version of &quot;Because the Night,&quot; for example, like the studio version, is miles better than  the original by another artist. It's not often one can say that.
B000000WJZ|5.0|This is the best of the Smashing Pumpkin albums and is undoubtably one of the best albums of the 90's. The best way to describe this album is to say that it is &quot;Guitar Heavy&quot; and &quot;True Grunge&quot;. This album  houses classic songs like &quot;Cherub Rock&quot; and &quot;Today&quot;.  Other great songs include &quot;Rocket&quot;, &quot;Disarm&quot;, and heavy  hitters like &quot;Geek U.S.A.&quot;, &quot;Quiet&quot;, and  &quot;Silverf*ck&quot;. This album, in my opinion, is what Alternative Rock  is supposed to sound like. Just get this album!!!
0671015206|5.0|Absolutely love this book!  If you want to know the truth of how people become wealthy, read this book.  I thought it was from hitting the lottery, becoming a doctor or attorney, etc.  This book illustrates empirically that  plumbers, car salesman, and even you and me can become wealthy over time if  you follow the lead of the &quot;typical millionaire&quot;.  This is NOT a  'what-to-invest-in' book.  This merely illustrates in great detail how  people became wealthy and, more importantly, how they STAYED wealthy.
0783226160|5.0|It doesn't get any better than this. Where was 'The House' when all those top 100 lists came out. Too many good scenes to count. Go on John - smash that guitar! Did you notice that the check out girl also appears as in  Caddyshack as Maggie - the Irish girl who dates Danny Noonan. Bet you  didn't know that!
6304913176|3.0|There is one point, central to the book, that is missing from the movie. That is, simply, that in order for something to be valued it must be earned.  The book focuses on citizenship, but in the classroom scene uses  the awarding of an unearned athletic award as an example. The lead  character acknowledges that his third place award has more value, because  he earned it, than would an unearned first place award. The book goes on to  make the point that unearned citizenship is not valued (thus our dropping  participation in civic activities). It proposes that citizenship, in order  to be valued, must be earned, and sets out a system for earning it via  participation in the &quot;civil service&quot;. This includes, but is not  limited to, the military. Anyone and everyone who is of age can apply, and  they will find something appropriate for them to do for a full term. If  they serve the full term, they then become a citizen. This is particularly  pertinent today, given the failure of the &quot;self esteem&quot; movement  in education.
6303979882|5.0|Now and Then is one of my all time favourite movies. Even though I had my friendships much later on in the 70's, it reminds me so much of the adventures that I had, the boys I had crushs on, the town's spooky citizens  and even a little mystery. The story shows the strength of friendships  through thick and thin and shows that real friends are there when you need  them the most.<br />See it!
0790735431|5.0|This movie was the best WWII movie I've ever seen.  When I was 5 my dad and I went to see this movie in the theater we both came out sying it was great.  I was suprised to see the reviews and finding out that the critics  didn't like it much, I thought they were crazy.
B0000022WA|5.0|The original film of : &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; is one of the greates of all the Disney classics.  The film is brilliant with Brian Keith, and Halley Mills, and is garenteed to make you laph. It is by far the best film  Halley Mills has done, and the trick photography is absolutly wonderful!  The only way this film can be topped is by the 1998 remake , which is  believe it or not...even better than that this incredible wonderful  classic! This film is a WINNER!
B000002U82|5.0|The Dark Side of the Moon is probably the best album ever recorded; it offers the full range of sound, intensity and emotion.  Truly a modern classic.  What more can I say?  Oh yeah, it was composed by a tone deaf man  in about a month's time.
0670880728|5.0|I find it amazing that so many Americans just don't seem to get it. It's NOT SUPPOSED to be deep or meaningful or sensible. Bridget Jones should not 'grow up', 'take responsibility' or 'get a grip'. It wouldn't be funny if  she did. And surely it's not too difficult to work out the meaning of the  Britishism 'answerphone'. She is supposed to be an exaggerated character,  getting into highly unlikely situations and handling it all wrong. That's  why it's funny. I certainly laughed, and think the American  would-be-psychologists should lighten up and enjoy it for what it is. As  far as I'm concerned, it's v.g, fab and provided me with lots of laughs.
B000003S5H|5.0|This is truly the prescription.  If listened to softly, some of the greatest backup noise to life I've ever heard.  At a loud volume it completely slows time to a stop.  All it makes you want to do is take time  out to listen.  I've never before heard music beckon me.  If that even  slightly describes what you want, buy it.  If you are hyper and need to get  things done, be forewarned and don't buy it.
630508999X|5.0|After such frights like Halloween, Friday the 13th, or the controversial Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the slasher movie genre has been falling into a deep, dark well of unintelligence and redundant reincarnation of horror  movies. Scream and Scream 2 have revived this fallen genre and with it,  came other ridiculous imitations (such as the extremely unsuccessful 'Urban  Legend'). The storyline in Scream 2 does apply some of the typical elements  that sequals are sometimes composed with, but the thing about this movie is  that it is clever in terms of 'hiding' the typicality and stereotypes of  the horror genre by playing around with the asthetic of the genre. The  killings here are more satisfying, and the infamous masked man is as  energetic as the first movie. The whole notion of the way the killer moves,  and the brutal stabbings that it can give the victims is where the horror  lies for this movie. The ending is a little better than the first one but  still needs some innovation to it (I found it hard to admire the killer  actually telling the audience, and the 'last remaining survivers' who  he/she is- it takes away the horror of the 'unknown' aura that surronds the  movie). Overall though, this is as clever as the first one. I truly  recommend it.
6304119046|3.0|History has been far, far kinder to &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; than it has ever deserved. I cannot be convinced that the opinions of many of our  online reviewers have not been influenced by that history. To begin with, I  note that nearly every positive review opens with a mention of praise for  the photography. Without debate, Gregg Toland is one of the visual masters  in the cinema (i.e., &quot;The Little Foxes&quot;, &quot;The Grapes of  Wrath&quot;, &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, etc.), but here one must  recognize the director's influence. Welles intended to overlay the film  with a style and mood that would point up the action, characterization, and  relationship. The placement of cameras, choice of lenses, use of motion,  and deployment of lighting often achieve this brilliantly; but more often,  the effect is misjudged and overdone, sometimes grossly--the lighting,  particularly, is usually painted in SO sparingly, that the look becomes TOO  dark and murky (darker than any film noir) as befits such a subtle medium  as the cinema (indeed, it is far more suited to the theatre, Welles' old  stomping grounds); not pointing up, but rather obscuring its objects.  Welles achieved his heavy-handed approach to photographic style far more  successfully in &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot;. Even though in  &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, the combination of its photography, camerawork,  art direction, editing, and special effects--all crafted with an artisan's  care--achieve a technical near-masterpiece; popularized (if not invented)  many revolutionary techniques; and proved to be the real object of the  endless gushing, all such elements cannot obscure the two gaping holes in  resonance. Its entertainment value is hurt by its sometimes lumpy  narrative, and Welles' typical unsense of humor. Additionally hindering its  entertainment value, and utterly fatal to its emotional force is the fact  that you don't give a damn about the main character. Welles' cannot create  audience sympathy for his performance of the classic tragic hero; simply  because, Welles' has tremendous personal charisma--in his own mind. He  weilds it like a sledgehammer, rather than a rapier; thus, he fails to  connect with anything but sand. This further marrs the &quot;detective  story&quot; facet of the film. Along the way, I found I had repeatedly  forgotten there was any investigation for the enigmatic &quot;Rosebud&quot;  at all; there again, if you don't care about the character, how can you  care about his love? I award one extra star in my rating of &quot;Citizen  Kane&quot; for its hand in advancing the art of cinema; its techniques were  new; but not PERFECTED until used in such movies as &quot;The Little  Foxes&quot;, &quot;The Devil and Daniel Webster&quot;, and &quot;Oliver  Twist.&quot; I honestly relate that, approached with a completely open  mind, during my first viewing of &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, I found myself  repeating throughout, &quot;THIS is 'the greatest movie of all  twenty minutes is unquestionably the best part of the movie. It's all  downhill from there!
B000002BYA|5.0|I love every album of Stevie's.  This one is a perfect example of the perfection he puts into his music.  I loved it.  I only wish he was here to grace us with more of his music.  I miss the guy terribly.
B00000ADG2|5.0|Lauryn Hill is one of todays most talented and creative artists. She blends R&amp;B, Rap, Reggae, Gospel and Rock with her soulful vocals in such a way that you will find yourself addicted to her sound. Her music is  a fresh inspirational funk and will have you screaming GRAMMY! My personal  favorites are &quot;X-factor&quot; and &quot;To Zion&quot;. The guitar in  &quot;To Zion&quot; is the perfect touch as only Santana can deliver. Pure  genius. I Love this CD! I Love you Lauryn!
0140042520|5.0|I was not alive during the time of the Beat Generation, so my experience is limited to brief summaries in history textbooks and to the literature to come out of this time.  Kerouac's book is fascinating; it's  thought-provoking and beautiful.  The scenes atop Desolation Peak are  enough to seize the reader with a desire to go out, to leave whatever is  holding him or her back, and to experience nature and oneself in a new way.
6305079811|5.0|Stirring soundtrack from Queen, colorful costumes, and and a fascinating storyline. The acting could use some help. But watch for Timothy Daltan, who puts in an excellent turn as Prince Baron. This is one you'll want to  watch over and over again... it grows on you. <br />How can you not like a  movie who's main cast of characters consists of a bird man, a prince, a  princess, a travel agent, a scientist, an evil ruler of the universe (Ming)  and the quarterback for the NY Jets (Flash).<br />Bottom Line: If you like  sci-fi, and have a sense of humor, you will dig this flick.
0792837533|3.0|I'm so in love with Gene Kelly, I'd watch him mow grass. But, in 'Brigadoon' Kelly seems to have something else on his mind during the making of this film and it shows. Many times, his eyes gaze empty into the  distance, making you want to wave your hand in front of his face. And in  some of the dance sequences, both Kelly and Cyd Charrise (spelling?) are  looking down at the ground. Even with all this, the dancing is superlative,  as usual, and Charisse provides lots of on-screen sizzle with Kelly. If you  missed your high school's production of this musical, see this version.
6300271145|5.0|A wonderful blend of mood and music. The shadows cast in this black and white film are as strong as the people and places that make them. An all star cast of some of the worlds greatest (jazz) musicians  makeing music  live to tape. This makes it one of the stongest conversational films of all  time. There are the words that are spoken by the actors/musicians, and also  the music that is spoken by the musicians as musicians. The music becomes  dialog. All the live music scenes are recorded live to tape. This is very,  very rare in cinema and only done on talk shows on TV. And in Round  Midnight this magicial marriage merges successfully.
0780622545|5.0|I must disagree with the critics view... the characters are not one dimensional.  I believe that the plot of the story was just as good as the visual effects.
0783113943|5.0|Great movie with real acting. Angelina Jolie was remarkable and it shows (she won a golden globe) Great movie see it it will make you realize many things.
6304143184|5.0|I used to be scared of E.T. when I was five years old, but now I watch this movie everyday!! My best friend, Shanna, loves this movie too!!!!!!!!
B000001DV2|5.0|The title tells you everything about this album.  The songs are packed with energy and adrenaline, and move at a fast, but steady pace.  You will find Make love like a man and let's get rocked pleasantly uplifting and  exciting.  A wonderful follow up to Hysteria.  The Leps stuck to their  formula.  Music was escapism, a chance to elude reality and have fun.  Who  knows what they could have accomplished with the addition of Steve Clark?   He was a brilliant musician.  But the band endured the suffering caused by  the loss of Steve, carrying on his legacy, never losing the magic they  capture with each album, and holding their place in music history.
B000002C1X|4.0|When I was in high school this was my favorite album. I grew up in a really backwater town, and it wasn't until I went to college that I started to meet people who were familiar with it. The overwhelming popularity of it  that I encountered diluted its power. Some albums work better as universal  statements that everyone connects with. Some work best as obscure, isolated  records. Because of the nature of this album, having everybody like it  undermines Pink's &quot;i'm alone in the world&quot; viewpoint. Also  seriously disappointing is that so many people have no idea what exactly  it's about.(It's a combination on three issues: Roger Water's struggle with  the &quot;wall&quot; of understanding between him and the audience, Syd  Barrett's fall into drugs and insanity, and Roger Waters father dying in  World War II.)In hindsight there's too much &quot;filler&quot; or  &quot;transition&quot; songs, especially in the middle, and not enough  &quot;major&quot; songs. It's too bad that the Final Cut didn't get more  recognition. It covers much of the same territory but with much more  maturity and intensity.
B000001GBJ|5.0|I started listening to this CD when a very close firend of mine was dying with cancer.  She said she had never been more moved and felt totally peaceful when listening to this.  As her last few days came around she had  this play continually and it was very comforting to her friends and family.   It definitely touches the heart and soul.
0800184327|5.0|This movie has to be at the top of the list of &quot;the ultimate best&quot; and &quot;most enjoyable&quot; I have had the pleasure to see in quite a few years!  And Chayanne, where has he been hiding?  So handsome,  the most beautiful smile(one that would melt an iceberg), so sensuous,  sensitive,kind, caring, loving, funny, courteous, romantic - if he is  married she has to be the luckiest woman in the world.  He has to be like  his character to have been able to make you feel what he was feeling as  Raphael.  I enjoyed this movie so much so that I watched it 4 times the day  I rented it, bought the CD and the DVD the next day and have watched it at  least once every day since, sometimes twice or more.  The way he looks at  Ruby, oh how every woman wants to be looked at that way - so much love!  I  can't say enough good things about this movie.  I will purchase the video  when it comes out as well.  I also enjoyed all the wonderful dancing  especially when Raphael danced cabaret with Ms. Plowright (he was so sweet  and kind to her).  Hopefully there will be a &quot;Dance With Me 2&quot;!   The story, cast, music, dancing - nothing could possibly be said negative  about this movie!!!!  Vanessa Williams is a wonderful actress and dancer.   She and Chayanne had &quot;chemistry&quot;, you could feel it along with  the rest of the cast - all wonderful.  Please bring us another one as  wonderful as this one and definitely bring Chayanne back!!!!!!! We  romantics want MORE!<br />P.S.When is Chayanne going to be in concert in the  USA?
6302409365|5.0|This film will make you see things in a different light afterwards. Great actors - I especially like the young Christina Ricci - perform that really great and funny story. A must for people older than 12.
6303022901|5.0|Here is one of the best novels in a movie.  I think it deserved a PG-13.  Truly great stories from the diaries of the mothers and daughters of  Amy Tan's first novel.  Last year in the tenth grade, Miss Keifer, our english  teacher read us the novel and showed us the movie.  Since then, I have read  The Kitchen God's wife, and am now reading The Hundred Secret Senses, both  of which are by Amy Tan.  I wish someone would make a movie out of The  Kitchen God's wife.
B000002B38|5.0|Pink Floyd have thrilled audiences worldwide with their spectacular showmanship and surreal tones.  The PULSE brings together the older, more reliable, yet ironically more experimental Floyd and the newer, freshly cut  nineties Floyd.  This CD set is packaged lovingly, with much detailed  artwork;  a fitting tribute to the great music within.  It represents a  great value as it contains two albums as well as live performances.  There  are moments during some tracks where the audience chant hauntingly with the  band, producing a very warm feeling.  Most musicians or bands pray that  they will produce at least one gem they can be forever remembered by.  This  CD contains several Pink Floyd gems and will provide the listener with many  hours of excellent Floyd whether driving or laying in pensive mood.
B000002LR3|4.0|This album is brilliant, but still not quite as good as &quot;Give Out But Don't Give Up&quot; (IMHO).   Classics such as &quot;Movin' on up&quot; and &quot;Loaded&quot; means that most people will find it accessible from the  start, but there is also depth in the other songs too.  I'm not too fond of  tracks 2 &amp; 3, but the rest is brilliant.
B000002MNL|5.0|...and there aren't very many of those here in sunny San Diego.  This CD had me wishing for a cloudburst so I could grab a glass of vino and hang out indoors for the afternoon.  Instead, I had to settle for a margarita on  the deck.  One of the best 10 CD's of the decade, I think this is  Morrissey's best work.  The production is smooth, the arrangements are  full, the lyrics are Morrissey.  What more could a fan ask for?  Best  track: &quot;Hold Onto Your Friends&quot;. Or maybe &quot;Why Don't You  Find Out For Yourself?&quot; Actually, there's not a single dud in the set.  &quot;Lifeguard Sleeping...&quot; is definitely the most haunting Morrissey  recorded, and the music does sound like waves lapping the shore.  Great  Great Great!
0767802470|5.0|A classic!  Exciting, tense, claustrophobic and, ultimately, quite sad.  You get the feel you're in the sub with these characters.<br />Don't let the 209 minute running time deter you--it moves fast.<br />Easily the best film  Wolfgang Petersen has directed.
067158037X|5.0|THIS is why I listen to books in some cases rather than read.  You need to HEAR this unabridged audiobook to fully appreciate it's power to move the soul and provide pathos, laughter, crying and more. McCourt speaks to the  soul  in a first-person way that makes it seem you are living the story.
B000001EAQ|5.0|POP is U2's best album to date.  Each album gets better and better, especially with repeated listenings.  Many say this album is &quot;experimental&quot; but the most experimental was Zooropa.  POP is a  deeply emotional album whose powerful lyrics are shrouded in new sounds and  beats.  When Madonna put out Ray of Light, she was applauded for  reinventing herself with a new sound.  U2 did the same a year before, but  were blased in the press.  It's not techno, trip hop, or rock.  POP refuses  to be classified or labelled and U2 wouldn't have it any other way.
157492589X|5.0|My favorite western of all time. Superb acting, magnificent scenery, and a story line to be envied by all. You don't have to be a &quot;western&quot; fan to enjoy this movie. The scene where Capt. Coll rides -off with Gus's  body as the two women are left behind crying is an all-time classic.  Duvall, Jones and Schroeder were superb !
6302902010|1.0|Where in the world is the original Gershwin musical &quot;Porgie and Bess&quot;?  This movie starred Sidney Portier, Dorothy Dandridge, Pearl Bailey, Sammy Davis Jr., Leslie Uggums, etc.  It is a precious, cultural  classic and cannot be compared to the 1986 disappointing effort.
6305297525|5.0|This film is a life-changing and life-affirming experience. Anyone under the age of 25 may not appreciate it as much as we who have lived a little more.  It illustrates well the adage that hell is on earth and we create  our own hell.  The power of love is a strong theme, but the power of the  mind is the best lesson of the movie.  See it.
6303921248|5.0|This was a wonderful blend of an excellent screenplay and marvellous character interpretations within a very realistic and plausible setting.  I greatly enjoyed how well the actors portrayed the witty personalities  created by Jane Austin.  This is a movie which one could watch over and  over.
6300248550|5.0|I picked up Jane Eyre once just for fun. I was drawn into the words and thought it was the best book I had ever read. I rented the movie and all the scenes I had pictured in my head came to life on screen. This movie  picture brought out all the true characteristics of Jane and Rochester's  relationship. I was very pleased.
0064471837|5.0|This is a great book.  Where most fantasy novels are trilogies, Garth Nix easily fits the same amount of intrigue and complication without confusion in Sabriel.  His characters are lively and realistic; it wasn't difficult  to imagine them in real life.  I plan on reading this again and reading  some of his other books!
630529142X|5.0|Some may say that Adam Sandler is &quot;running dry&quot; with his creative and innovative form of comedy.  On the contrary his comedic performances have steadily increased from film to film.  However,  regardless of personal opinion of Sandler and his career, this movie is  entertaining, positive and most improtantly laugh out loud funny.  This is  the type of movie America needs more of.  Most comedies you get a chuckle  or two but nothing too memorable.  Where as this movie creates an  atmosphere in which the audience interacts with the laugh out loud comedy.   You walk away from the movie knowing that you could watch it again and get  more out of it.  Adam Sandler is one of the few comedic stars who can  elicit the laugh out loud response.  This is what makes the Waterboy a must  see and must own movie.
0780622553|1.0|The only thing that kept me from walking out of the theatre was the interesting visuals.  Otherwise, it stunk.
0553108034|5.0|Can I order the 3rd book right NOW
6305297525|5.0|I am anxiously waiting for the March 9 release date of this video.  At the theater, I was completely entranced by the artistry and pure imagination of this film which made me very glad that I took the opportunity to see it on  the big screen.  An absolutely beautiful movie with inspired performances  by an excellent cast, What Dreams May Come enhanced my joy of living and  reduced my fear of dying...  Both sides of existence are presented as  valuable experiences of the human condition.
0609603086|1.0|Oh please Mr. Follet! Hippie winemaker, Eco- terrorist. Spunky Asian female FBI with a sexist boss and a streetwise hardboiled cop father. Everybody making wild assumptions (all correct of course) with no evidence  to base them on. And the cute &quot;where are they now&quot; ending!  No  surprises, no characters and no plot.  No Way
0060392584|3.0|This book was.....disturbing...but brilliant. I'm not a fan of Manson's but I must say he's a descriptive and interesting writer.This book is good for anyone who wants to hear the work of an off beat genius....and has a  strong stomach.
6302043158|5.0|I've loved the Quadrophenia album since the 1st time I heard it, and since then was itching to see the movie. I knew the soundtrack would be great, it's made by The Who, but it's better than I expected. I felt like jumping  on the parties on the movie, the songs are so addictive! I wish all the  songs played on the movie were on the soundtrack, they made it The  Who-only, but there's so many songs that must have been included. And the  ending wasn't what I was expecting, no Jimmy jumping on the sea and going  to The Rock, but instead a great aerial shot.
6305076626|5.0|Great music, lotsa larfs, and my kids sing the songs all day and night. But depending on your &quot;lifestyle&quot; and hangups you may want to keep this one from them till their older. But I didn't and they're still  &quot;well adjusted&quot;
6302649943|4.0|Being a definite Stephen King fan, I had to watch this and although not as cool as the amazing book, definitely an excellent film which will have you squinting through your fingers to see what happens next!   Having (again)  read the book, I wanted to scare myself again with the film, but  unfortunately cannot get hold of it in the UK.  Pennywise is probably the  most terrifying character you'll ever meet, aside from Eva Galli in Peter  Straub's Ghost Story.
6305263248|5.0|Ronin was one of the years biggest hits.  The cast with Robert De Niro and Jean Reno could not be faultered.  This film has something for most however those inclined to the action genre will love it.  The car chases I have to  admit are better than the classic Italian Job and this film oozes with  style.  The story is so polished that you can see your face in it.  A  positive topper of a flick.  If you like action films this is THE must buy  of the year.
0894803123|5.0|Tired of making the same old stuff out of your ice cream maker's recipe book?  The machine makers should package Ben and Jerry's book with their product.  The book is excellent - humorous and filled with great, easy to  make recipes, right from their own kitchen.  Mint cookies 'n' creme -  mmmmmmmmmmmm!
0790736101|5.0|Like Mike Wheldon says in &quot;The Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Film,&quot; HORROR OF DRACULA (1958) is &quot;the best vampire film ever.&quot;  Even after 40 years the picture is still an effective,  exciting adaptation of the Stoker novel--in my opinion, the one movie that  truly captures the spirit of the book.  Christopher Lee is a worthy  successor to Bela Lugosi in the title role, and the great Peter Cushing  makes the role of vampire hunting Dr. Van Helsing his own--intelligent,  intrepid, kindly, yet not above cooly staking the undead when the situation  calls for it.  The part of Van Helsing has since been played by more famous  actors like Olivier and Anthony Hopkins, but even these fine performers  can't hold a candle to Cushing.  HoD is the first and best of England's  Hammer Films' Dracula series and required viewing for all vampire movie  buffs.  And I agree with another reviewer in recommending BRIDES OF DRACULA  (1960), the second greatest Hammer Horror of them all!
B00000ADG2|5.0|Two words: Simply Amazing. I love Lauryn Hill. She  is one of those great artists that you can listen to anytime. Her songs make you laugh, make you cry make you wonder, make you think, make you dance. Her songs touch your  soul and leave you reborn. It is so hard to find an album that you can just  pop in and let play. And this is one of them. I have a cd for when I'm at  home and a cassette for my car. If you don't have this cd get one NOW!! I  give this 10 Stars!
0783114222|5.0|I always felt that Apollo taught us all that we could be or do whatever it was that we wanted.  I always felt that it represented the greatest possibilities inherent in each and every one of us.  I now know that Tom  Hanks feels the same.  Its based on the brilliant book by Andrew Chaikin (A  Man on the Moon - BUY IT) and it is a great work.  In an age when its easy  to be cynical about almost everything - especially big Hollywood Stars -  both Tom Hanks and From The Earth To The Moon are wonderful breaths of  fresh air.
B000001E18|4.0|Well, it retains the intent of &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; and even some of the ambience, but this album seemed more mocking than &quot;Achtung...&quot; did. I mean, Bono's &quot;McPhisto&quot; persona was  odd enough, but songs like &quot;Lemon&quot; and &quot;Numb&quot; that  basically have this cool edge to them, but also have this aura of  complacency about them. &quot;Stay...&quot; is for this album what  &quot;One&quot; was for &quot;Achtung...&quot;, which means it is the best  song on the album. &quot;Zooropa&quot; can best be described as a skewed  follow-up mirror image of &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;, but it is interesting.  Like &quot;POP&quot;, it grows on you. I still don't really like it as much  as &quot;Achtung...&quot; but let's face it...can they really mimic  &quot;Achtung...&quot; without copying it? Sure...they just use the same  formula and twist it more and more each time...does it work? Good question.
B0000048V8|5.0|It is most definately a classic. We all adore the snowman video, this includes my sons 16 months and 3 years of age and my husband and myself. Even when we haven't watched it for a little while I hear my 3 year old  humming the tune as he plays. It is such a magical story with amazing  illustrations and soundtrack. For those who see the ending as sad, we  interpret it as inspiring, to have experienced such wonderful emotions from  just a little snow and alot of imagination! Big Fans!
1573226521|5.0|It was the book I EVER read. I could not put it down. I did have to read it a couple of tines to understand stuff that I didn't get the first time.   It's going to be one helluva movie!
0385484518|5.0|I read this book last night and can't stop thinking about Morrie and his dignity and love. It was an honor to know something about this extraordinary man...
0385484518|1.0|This book is a quick read, which makes it less painful to get through.<br />Granted, the auther does acknowledge that he was too self-absorbed when he started this book, but by the end of the book, I'm  not left with any indication that anything had changed.<br />The main problem  with this book is that I could not connect with any of the characters: The  neurotic old man who desires to die and the self-absorbed ex-student who  comes to visit him.<br />The old man, Morrie, was a nice guy who was a teacher  for many years. He constantly needed to be acknowledged and be at the  center of attention when he contacts a fatal disease. This book is about  Morrie telling the young man about what it means to live.<br />Unfortunately,  it comes across far too preachy. (too many &quot;should&quot; and  &quot;shouldn't&quot; in life statements), but written in such a cliche  fasion that one feels attached by old gum-drops: sweet, sticky, and the  need to brush them away.<br />In the story we have Morrie (the old man)  putting together a going-to-die party for himself and invites people to  come and tell him how much they admire him. Morrie tells the author about  how he would go to the disco and bring records that no one else would  listen to and dance by himself in front of everyone for attention. Another  story we have of Morrie is sitting at a basketball game, where people are  cheering and chanting for the team and he yells out something that causes  them to stop, star at him, and he sits and grins about being at the center  of attention once more. After a few of these stories, I felt like yelling  &quot;Okay, he's got an inferiority complex! I've got it already! Can we  move on!&quot;<br />We get such odd statements as &quot;One must learn how to  die in order to live&quot;. Excuse me?!? The logic was oddly reversed. If  these were supposed to be wise statements to lives one's live by, I'll take  a pass, thank you.<br />A Jewish book club was touting this book as a story of  a Jew. Please be forwarned that while Morrie was Jewish by birth, he gave  up Judiasm as a child and was more interested in other religions and quoted  them often. He even makes it a point to embarass his brother's Rabbi near  the end and smiles about being at the center of attention once more. There  is nothing Jewish about this book.<br />It's a time-waster. It's a fairly thin  book with a lot of empty space. If normal sized type, leading, and a simple  design were used, this book would be half this size. But then, it really  had little content worth reading.of  a Jew.

This is a &quot;true love to the bitter end&quot; story. The book was perfect as well and I  highly recommend it. Profoundly moving. Watch it AGAIN if you didn't get it  the first time.

0783226063|5.0|So many films today are of the type you see once in the cinema, and never want to see again - particularly the major blockbusters. Dune however is different. It did not do too well at the box office, which isn't hard to  explain, because it isn't a film you can sit down and understand in one go.  (Unless you have read the book!)      The best thing about Dune is the fact  that because you cant understand it at first, you see it again, and again,  until you do. When you understand it enough, you then decide to get the  book, (If you haven't read it already, you're missing out.) and the book  will blow you away. On returning to the film, The storyline seems simpler  and in places, completely different. As I have read all of Frank Herbert's  'Dune saga', I wouldn't want a film that was a carbon copy of the first  book. It would be too long and much of the book is monologue, (for instance  - the Baron Harkonnen thinking to himself about Nefud's semuta addiction.)  and this wouldn't work well in a film.       All in all, I think that David  Lynch has made the perfect film of Dune. It is complex enough to watch over  and over again, and different enough from the books, not so much as to be  disappointing, but yet even more watchable, because of the novelty value.  The film adds to the books, the books add to the film, and if you buy the  soundtrack, then you will notice a lot more of the music! This film is the  greatest sci-fi of all time!

0887307876|5.0|My work involves helping company leaders identify the causes of &quot;stalled&quot; thinking in the organization.  What impresses me about this book is how many of the causes Scott Adams has identified.  The man is  clearly a great observer of organizations.  His crusade against  &quot;stalled&quot; thinking (especially by the leaders) also means that  others with keen insights send him their observations, as well.  Future  historians of the American corporation would do better to start with Scott  Adams than most of the organizational theory and practice business books  that have been written.  His humor is excellent, because he is unerring in  picking the right balloon to prick.  As a management consultant, I  regularly reread his chapter on management consultants to be sure that I am  not behaving like the ones he describes.  Keep these wonderful books and  comic strips coming!  Be sure to post the strips where they will get the  most attention.  Maybe you will help someone wake up in your leadership!
B00000G3I2|5.0|Couldn't wait to get this DVD for my collection.  I loved this movie the first time I saw it, and this new release only improves on a classic movie.

Either they were some sort of scientists, and were looking at it from a  biased perspective, or avid fans of sci-fi, who don't accept a more  realistic novel. I did see the movie before i read the book, and already  loved the movie. SERIOUS sci-fi, with a heart, a relatively realistic  situation, engaging topics, not to mention Ms.Foster's tremendous acting  ability. (Or Matthew .M's good looks) I dove right into the book very  eagerly. Expecting something wonderful, I was more impressed than I  expected to be. This story, simply put, sweeps you away. And you'll most  likely walk away from it extremely optimistic about the future of, well,  us. WARNING! Please, please, please see the movie before you read the book,  or else, i expect you'll probably hate the  movie.
6303832563|5.0|For its time, the film was one-of-a-kind. Since then, its images retain their power, but the technique has greatly improved, as has this particular narrative style (Baraka is the best example so far). Reggio, Fricke and  Glass have put together a wonderful film, full of life and sharp criticism.  Unfortunately, the criticism can be heavyhanded at times, but that doesn't  negate the power of the visuals and the music. Personally, I've worn out  three video tapes, seen it twice in the theater, once with the Philip Glass  Ensemble. Get it if you can!
0452270073|3.0|This is the first in a crisply written trilogy of novels woven around WWI trench soldiers and the doctor that treats them when they come home shell-shocked.  One of Dr. Rivers' patients is Sassoon who takes a stand on  the moral status of the war and it's continuance. Given that it is better  to be thought lunatic than a pacifist Sassoon's friends pull strings to see  that he is treated instead of court-martialed.  His arrival at  Craiglockhart introduces us to a startling variety of damaged soldiers,  their ailments, the treatments, and their futures, which we follow in the  next two books:  The Eye in the Door, and The Ghost Road. Grisley.   Disturbing.  Graphic sex.  I am still undecided as to whether or not I  recommend these books.

0790705141|5.0|I saw this film when it first came out as an eleven-year-old and it has left an indelible impression.  I have just gone through a weeklong Shining festival.  After viewing this film you feel that you have truly been given  the opportunity to experience real madness.  It is a cinematic experience  that will never feel outdated as it relies on universal constructs that one  can not help but fall victim.  Claustrophobic as the Overlook may seem  there is eternal freedom to be found within.  Love and hate torture each  other in a battle that is predestined toward certain doom because of  psychotic and otherworldly forces.  Purely genius orchestration of the  dichotomies of life is evident in the portraiture of the dissolution of the  American family, the power paradigm of such, and the ability of the  familial bond to overpower all odds.  This is a film to dine to...a film we  can all understand because we share most of the psychotic experience-just  not at the &quot;redrumous&quot; level.  It is simply a fairy tale of the  American family.
0553108034|5.0|I have to admit, I wasn't sure if Martin could top his award-winning &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;.  But he has.  &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; not only equals the first book in terms of action, complexity,  characterization, and plotting; it surpasses it.    &quot;A Clash of  Kings&quot; is darker, grittier, and more complex than the original, and is  filled with surprises, cliffhangers, and hair-raising scenes of action and  intrigue.  The climactic battle that ends the book is worth the price of  the entire novel.  The only down side is that you'll go crazy waiting for  the next book in the series.    Martin's saga is definitely the best epic  fantasy series of the decade, and when all is said and done, may even  surpass Tolkien.  Martin has proven that he is not merely interested in  writing a carbon copy of &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;.  He is trying to  re-invent the genre and take it in new and exciting directions.  He is not  afraid to kill off &quot;good guys&quot;, even main characters.  Martin  writes good literature.  The fantasy setting adds spice to the tale, but it  is the story of these characters and their wounded world that makes it one  for the ages.

B00000DMJF|1.0|Though a brilliant album, this version of the White Album is nothing more than marketing hype. It's repackaged, not remastered. Finally Capitol has admitted as much. Get the original release and at least have a better  protective case. The &quot;remastered&quot; edition comes in cardboard, the  original in a jewel case. We all know the music is 5 stars, but the  marketing edition gets a zero for raw greed.<br />Amazon's review might do  some research and resubmit its evaluation. Not to mention that the one  currently positioned for this album is entirely out of touch with Beatles  discography. The reviewer is in love with his own words--&quot;ambivalent  'I Will'&quot;?????? Did you say ambivalent? Huh?
6302641888|5.0|MGM has released this staple of world cinema with high quality resolution and readable yellow subtitles (to replace the occaisonally indescipherable white on most celluoid prints). Time and several dozen  viewings have not dulled the effect of this puzzlingly beautiful film.  Liv  Ullman plays a theatre actress inexplicably gone mute and Bibi Andersson a  nurse ordered to care for her. The nurse is also to discover why the  actress has cut herself off but instead finds her own identity dissolving  and merging with her patient.  Bergman weaves dream sequences,  recollections, replays the same situation from different perspectives, and  even \\"breaks\\" the film itself in this study of dissolution,  fragmentation, and collapse of all continuity.  Although influenced by  Strindberg's \\"The Stronger\\", Bergman built up this film out of a  series of dream images which he himself could not (or would not) explain.   Regardless of whatever one makes of the film's content or themes, it is  hauntingly beautiful - moving from scenes of terrible and self-inflicted  violence to memorable dream-like sequences, especially one where the nurse  wakes up one night to find the actress in her bedroom.  Though totally  silent, except for the sound of a foghorn in the distance, it's a  brilliantly realized sequence.  Moreover, we're never sure who's dreams  we're watching: as the film progresses it moves into areas where fantasy  and reality, identity and illusion weave and merge. Bergman and his  cameraman, Sven Nykvist, possess an amazing continuity over this difficult  terrain.  The move from the ostensibly real to the dream world and back is  done with such dexterity that it takes several viewings and much thought to  discern where the one ends and the other begins (and there's no consensus  on that, either).  <br />The film may sound like a big intellectual tease but  the actors ground Bergman's ideas and demonstrate that there's a lot at  stake here.  \\"Persona\\" anticipates many of our current concerns  about how our identities are \\"constructed\\" and how fragile these  constructions are.  And it doesn't pall these issues with the coats of  glibness and irony that filmmakers bring to this subject nowadays.  Postmodern film culture in the age of Tarantino has huffily rejected the  European 'art' film, of which \\"Persona\\" is one of its highest  achievements, has being too deliberaely abstruse.  Although this may be a  first time viewer's initial reaction to this great film,  \\"Persona\\" proves that abstruseness isn't always, or even  necessarily, an intellectual conceit but perhaps the only clear-headed  approach toward exploring the borderlands of our existenses. It's the most  haunting film ever made.
0800196341|3.0|This is a beautifully filmed rendition of William Shakespeare's Hamlet.  I applaud the effort, and am awed at the beauty of it, but am bored by the length.  As a lover of Shakespeare's works, I try to see all the film  adaptations, but found this one hard to watch!
0780020685|5.0|This DVD is simply the best way to watch this film.  Even though many people are complaining that it is in 1.33 to one aspect ratio, that's the way the movie was made, there isn't anything more to it, Kurosawa wasn't  able to work in widescreen until 1958.<br />The commentary track of this movie  is three hours of reverent discussion that helps the viewer realise exactly  how much genius this man was able to bring to this movie.  The commentary  track is almost like getting two movies together.  Watch the movie first  without it and then with it (if you can stand the 6 hours) and then you'll  realise how great this movie is.
0684800713|5.0|This book is best appreciated by people who are in their late 20's or older, esp. those who have travelled or lived in Europe. The book's vivid descriptions (you can almost feel the heat on your back in the fishing  scenes) and strong characterizations (Jake especially) seem to get MORE  REAL the more time you spend in Europe. As you pass low signs on mass  graves in Belgium (&quot;Morts par les Allemagnes&quot;) and remember an  entire generation was wiped out for-- well, not much, the moodiness and the  tense chatter of the characters make sense. In Europe you don't just see  where this happened, you see how it could have.
6303122876|5.0|In my opinion, The Dark Crystal surpasses all other fantasy movies, even such established greats as Star Wars and ET, for one simple reason - pure and unadulterated creativity.  Jim Henson's genius explodes into this  fantastical film, with characters of the like that are not seen in any  other film.  Not once does a human appear on the screen - everything is  either animatronic or simply a hand puppet.  A superb film for anyone who  loves fantasy films, the Muppets, or just wants to see a mind-blowing film.
6300181456|3.0|From the bizarre subplots about The Yellow Menace, to the happy-go-lucky dance numbers (the elevator hoofer sequence in the beginning is gratuitously hysterical), this comedy is simply wonderful.  It's not a  perfect film -- it does seem a bit long -- but on video it's a real  pleasure because when it drags you can pause to get yourself a nice big  bowl of \\"Razzzzzzzberries.\\"  It's a bit easy to overlook this now, but this  is also parable about women in the 1920s empowering themselves (hey, it was  made in 1967 when people were taking sledgehammers to the walls of gender  stereotypes), thus slipping us a positive message amidst all the  tomfoolery.  Some people have criticized it for not following through with  its promise: the women are \\"liberated,\\" but aren't happy (or complete)  until they get married.  But in these days of \\"Ally McBeal post-feminism,\\"  perhaps we're all becoming comfortable with the notion that happiness - and  therefore completeness - is an individual issue and we should please  ourselves and not worry about what our choices mean on a sociological  level.  It also means you should ignore these weighty issues, curl up on  the sofa with that special someone, and pop this great tape in the VCR.   It's a blast!

6304806426|4.0|Great movie, breathtaking vistas and filming.  I found the subject matter that in many ways praised adultery a bit much, but it was still great.  And of course Binoche is one of the most beautiful actresses living.  The  downside is that there are many digital artifacts on the DVD that became  jarring to me after a while.  The backgrounds often appear 'blochy' because  of this.  I don't know why this is as my other DVDs don't have this  problem.

Then he meets Maude, who accepts him w/ open arms.   We all need a Maude in our lives, to bring our potential to the surface.   The music is great, the script is fantastic!

So many 1-stars from people I can only assume are looking for an easy way to make a lot so they can spend a lot - I can see  why they hated it.  The authors aren't telling us we can't live a little.  Just that pursuing every toy in the Sharper Image catalog will prevent most  people from achieving financial security.  The book DOES go over and over  the main points - but I didn't find it boring, and I guess some folks still  didn't get it.

The average intelligent film-goer would not come within arms reach of this type of happy go lucky  highschool movie. And that's too bad; this movie is a SATIRE of other such  movies, and it is a RIOT! Although adolescents may not pick up on this, its  high humor will entertain them as well, making this one of those truly rare  movies that can be enjoyed by the whole family because it works on multiple  levels. I wish that the advertising would have made it clear exactly how  surprisingly INTELLIGENT this movie is. An extra hat off to Janeane  Garofalo (The Truth About Cats and Dogs, The Matchmaker), who plays the  perfect grounded, cynical contrast to the air-headed main charactors.  Although she is (unfortunatly) only a supporting actress, she balances the  film out perfectly. I haven't been so entertained by any movie (let alone  one I took a chance with), for quite some time.

As a great admirer of Froud's superlative  art I was still stunned by just How Good this book is. The man is a modern  Master of faery painting. His name will go down in History alongside 19th  century Masters like Rackham, Dadd, Doyle and Dulac. Fans of myth and magic  will be pleased to note that the legendary Terri Windling also had a hand  in this book. The text has some of the same flavor as her folklore columns  in Realms of Fantasy magazine, which someone ought to collect and publish  someday. The Froud-Windling connection became apparent when Froud and his  faeries showed up as characters in her magical novel &quot;The Wood  Wife&quot; and it's thrilling to see these two myth-masters teaming up  again. Windling's fans will want to pick up this book and all of Brian  Froud's work while Froud's faery fans will be enchanted with &quot;The Wood  Wife&quot;. The book jacket says they both live in the same town in  England. There must be something magical in the water there! Thank you Mr.  Froud and Ms. Windling for keeping the Myth Alive in our  technology-obsessed world.
0375403477|3.0|Once again, I enjoyed following the familiar characters of Clark, Chavez, Dan Murray, ... . However, in this book the story did not do justice to the  characters as I thought the storyline was mediocre and was only a  rehash/reinvention of many of his plotlines in previous books.  The book  had the potential to be very good, but disappoints in many places.  I wish  Clancy would have let the reader uncover the plot of the story along with  Popov and Clark, instead of spelling out the story to early and then  forcing the reader to wait for the Popov and Clark to figure it out.  I was  frustrated by Clancy's repeated reference to &quot;the President&quot; when  everyone knew it was Jack Ryan.  You have a well developed/liked character  from previous books in the White House, why not use that character to  enhance the story.  However, despite many posts to the contrary, Clancy did  finally mention Jack's name once late in the book. The ending was only  partially satisfying.  The early parts of the book seemed to go into detail  of some items of little importance at length, but at the end of the book I  got the feeling that Clancy felt under a deadline and needed to wrap up the  story as quickly as possible.  Having Popov walk free and purchase a gold  mine at the end of the story... Please!  Also, I wish Clancy would have  dealt more finally with the members of the Project.  Hopefully, this is not  just a setup for his next novel about Project 2.

I'm Your Man is easily the best album he's ever done, though I could have done without Cure for Love - the  love-as-sickness/addiction metaphor was so stale even then that I'm  surprised such an original lyricist would want to go near it. But the rest  is great!!

0446364495|5.0|b.o.m.c. explores chance, life, love, and choices.  this book appealed to me as a photographer, woman, romantic, and human.  r.j.w. takes the time to  set the mood and timeframe of this country setting, as well as the time to  wrap the relationship of these two people around the reader, so that the  feelings are real, and the novel's journey is unstoppable.  i've read it  three times, and i can never put it down until the last page.  a  masterpiece and a work of art.
0783227272|5.0|Powerful. Gripping. The tale of a group of people coming to grips with oppression and liberation. The essential struggle between justice &amp; evil.

0812524586|5.0|In the first few chapters I wasn't too excited about reading Enders Game, since Ender was a six-year-old kid. But later in the book it really hooked  me in. I thought the Battle Room idea was really great. All of the time  while reading I wished that I could be one of the soldiers fighting in  anti-gravity. Card really made me feel what Ender felt. I felt sorry for  Ender, the way they kept tricking him and keeping things from him. It was  spooky when he found the Giant's Corpse in a &quot;bugger&quot; world. It  was probably one of the best books I've ever read.
B000002BE9|5.0|I find her music extremely intelligent, emotional and relaxing. Although it shows a very hurt and traumatized girl, i share her feelings and consider her deeply professional. She could be &quot;THE&quot; female  performer of the late '90s .I recommend it to everyone who apreciates smart  music.
6305205620|5.0|This is what concerts on DVD should be like! Once other bands take a look at this, hopefully they'll know what to do. <br />Not a Metallica fan? Get it anyway, period.
B000002KBU|5.0|Every review listed here says it all. This album is a true masterpiece. I have written and read many reviews on Amazon.com and one common theme you usually see is 5 star ratings and people praising the albums, mostly  because they are fans. That is fine. But, after a while the lack of  objectivity becomes tiresome. So, what artist  can you trust when everyone  says everything rocks and it's a must buy! It's awesome! Well, I am here to  say &quot;Blue&quot; by Joni Mitchell is the real deal. The problem is, I  am just as guilty and subjective as everyone else. So, you just have to  take my word. When browsing the reviews on Amazon searching for that  certain CD you are interested in, make sure you put this recording in your  shopping cart. It is quite simply a remarkable effort. An album that has  truly stood the test of time and influenced many singer songwriters today  (i.e. 90% of Lilith Fair) You will not regret the purchase. Did I babble  enough?
0140013997|5.0|I have read this book twice and would not mind reading it for the third time. Any animal-lover would consider this book to be extremely fascinating  and comic. This wonderful book should be read by every child in order to  germinate the interest and concern for nature.
B0000019PA|5.0|...and (no exaggeration here) one of the best albums ever made.  It's a dreamy vision of love, loss, time-travel, &amp; death that stands not as a collection of songs, but as one complete piece.
B000002JEV|5.0|Led Zeppelin, to me, is one of the greatest and probably my favorite British band of the 60's.  The Beatles took music in new directions, and the Stones may have made it okay for skinny white kids to like the blues,  but Led Zeppelin took the music they loved and transformed it into their  very own, pushing the envelope, and making music that is every bit as  heavy, and far more intense, than anything around now.  And this is coming  from a 16 year old kid!  The BBC Sessions document Zeppelin at their  greatest.  The sheer intensity, the joy of playing, and the balls to the  wall mentality is captured here, live in concert, in front of a very proper  British audience.  I'm not going to describe it any further, because  nothing I will say can do it justice, but this is one of the very greatest  concert documents out there.  It's up there with the Who's Live at Leeds.
6304546386|5.0|This is the best in old fashioned entertainment, where evil in vanquished, good triumphs, and you leave feeling good!  Errol Flynn IS Robin Hood, with a wonderful supporting cast of merry men.  The music is magnificient and  the kind that became the prototype for music in movies like Star Wars.  My  family can almost quote the entire movie from beginning to end.  Plenty of  good swashbuckling action, romance, and just plain fun.  Must Own!
6301797906|5.0|This was a great classic movie.  Fonda was great in it.  The acting was wonderful and so was the plot.  Make sure this one's on your shelf.
6300184269|4.0|Weird Science follows in the classic John Hughes style.  Although it is not an Academy Award winning film, it is still hard to believe that he wrote the film in only 2 days.  Weird Science plays on all of the  insecurities and fantasies which go along with teen life. One of Bill  Paxton's earliest roles, as Chet, is hysterical in his torturing  relationship with his brother.  The motorcycle gang scene at the end is  unforgettable.  This is truly a CLASSIC.
0440224764|3.0|This is a typical Grisham opus, fast-moving, readable, with many a twist and turn.  It held my interest all the way, but I have two fairly major  gripes.  First, as is common with Grisham (with the notable exception of  &quot;The Rainmaker&quot;), the character development is not all it could  be.  You don't feel that you really know these folks, and you want to  understand their motivations better.  But the real drag is the ending,  which is incomprehensible, doesn't fit, and leaves you with the firm  conviction that you just wasted a day or two.  What was he thinking?
3931141802|5.0|After 19 years of working as a pro photographer, I was simply stunted, wordless and sad, because not having a pearle like this in my library.  Simply-PERFECT!!!
044022165X|5.0|This is by far John Grisham's best work, at least of the several I've read.  Great character development:  Rudy Baylor and his somewhat sleazy  sidekick Deck Sheffler come alive, and they're real.  And this book is  FUNNY!  The comic relief blends effectively with the tragic core of the  story, which involves the death of a young man by leukemia while his  uncaring insurance company gleefully pockets the premiums.  Grisham's  (Rudy's) wry narrative of these events is priceless.  And while the David  and Goliath plot may be a bit hackneyed, it engages the reader as only  Grisham can.  First class!
0792152328|5.0|The movie background is very good. James Cameron made a great thing. The ship and all of the stuff looks just like real. You feel like you are living with the people in the same ship and you just understand how big the  disaster. It was a very good movie. You can't stop watching it for several  times because it hurts you. And you feel sorry for the people who died on  April 15th 1912 in the real Titanic. You can't stop crying. Overall, it is  NOT a waste of money and you can love that movie when you watch it. Try it.
B000009ORQ|5.0|Dawn of the Dead, the gretest zombie movie of all time!!  This movie takes you into a deserted mall where four people take refuge. Action packed with graphic special effects, this movie is a MUST for any zombie fan!!!
6305137293|4.0|Part &quot;2&quot; picks up exactly where &quot;1&quot; finished, and continues the scary story of Michael Myers and his sister...The DVD from Goodtimes video is colorful, but transfered quite dark, with a few  artifacts. It is nice to finally hear a rematered Dolby Surround  soundtrack, including Carpenter's eerie electronic score. Great fun for  Horror fans!!!
0670451495|4.0|This heartwarming story will enchant any young child. The feelings of love for one's children are evident as is the notion of helpfulness to those in  need. McCloskey makes it nearly impossible not to smile after reading the  book.<br />I did have a bone to pick though. It struck me odd when Mr. Mallard  suddenly leaves his wife with eight newborn ducklings for a week as soon as  they hatch so he can have fun touring the city while she is busy raising  them alone. Is that the sexism of the author shining through?
6305252521|5.0|I loved the Truman Show.  It was a provocative work that inspired me to think about new dilemmas. Anyone wanting to see Excellent acting, award winning music, and an original story should check this out.
0670880728|4.0|A funny book that made me thankful I'm not like that poor girl Bridget Jones.  What a victim.  but that's what makes her so funny, right?<br />Too  bad the really funny lines like &quot;machinery and pheasants in head&quot;  (hilarious) and &quot;worry bead&quot; (riotous) will be lost in the  translation to cheesy, wanna-be-full-of-charm film.  The true amusement lay  in the insightful contextual metaphors.<br />Kept me smiling with a touch of  aspartame.
0790729342|5.0|He has about 10 lines in the whole movie. Everyone around him is always  talking and yelling, but Max says nothing.<br />This is still the world's best  action film, and in widescreen, it makes more sense because you can see  what's really going on in every shot.<br />I remember reading as a kid that  this film was made for about $4 million, which was huge compared to the  original Mad Max budget. Kevin Costner and James Cameron should learn some  lessons from Kennedy/Miller
B0000070QS|5.0|Mortens second album (first one was only issued in Norway) is one of the most astonishing works ive heard lately. It has wonderful arrangements, and its poetry-oriented material has great quality. Highly recommended! I  wish more people knew about this album.
6302968135|5.0|This is a great pictorial view of gang life in East Los Angelos. It gives you an insight in the life a vato loco. I feel the writer diserves much honor for his work.
B0000009SI|5.0|I hope Amazon.com didn't pay for Andy Gill's pathetic critiques of Zappa's music. To dismiss Apostrophe as &quot;More songs about Eskimos, religious deceit, poodles, pancakes and imaginary diseases&quot; is just pure  laziness. Moreover, it provides a diservice. Zappa was a rare gem in 20th  century musical composition, as illustrated by Apostrophe, yet another  album in a lifetime of diverse, brilliant, and moreover, original and  unique, Zappa compositions.
0876304420|5.0|Forget the classic forms of hypnosis. Deeper, deeper, deeper will only work with about half of your clients. This book talks about the importance  of creating a relationship and how the hypnotist should first hypnotize  himself/herself before the client can go into trance. Excellent, excellent  work. A leader in the field. I highly suggest The Courage to Love by the  same author.
B0000029J5|5.0|Having heard Brownie Mcghee live in the early 60s at Gerdes Folk City I hadn't heard an artist that could compare until now. He is and will become a legend.
6303212263|5.0|This movie seems to approach the ideal of the word 'hero' in mythical terms better than any movie I can name. There are moments that are so extraordinary, so unexpectedly unique. Christopher Reeve is perfect as  Superman. Nothing against Dean Cain and the other actors who have portrayed  the Man of Steel, but Reeve stands alone on the summit here. The supporting  cast is excellent as well, but without Reeve's convincing performance, this  movie would never have 'flown'. It may be, or should be, that someday  cinema fans will look back on this film and realize how much of a  masterpiece it really is. Or maybe not. Maybe it is just me and my personal  taste. At any rate, this will be a movie I will always enjoy. FIVE STARS
6302136105|2.0|I have read about a dozen books on The Doors. Needless to say they are one of the GREATEST bands ever to enter the human ear. In fact, I personally, believe they are the GREATEST band ever (Yes, even better than the  Beatles), so I'd have to say the movie was not what it should have been.  The Doors were art. The movie was not. The movie prefered to concentrate on  the (semi-fiction) &quot;antics&quot; of a mentally unbalanced Jim  Morrison, instead of the poetic side. Also the movie did not live up to  it's own title! It's called &quot;The Doors,&quot; not &quot;The life and  times of Jim Morrison!&quot; It should have concentrated on the band more  (not to say Jim was not a very interesting person...HE WAS!!!) Anyhow,  other than a few lies (ok, more than a few) it's overall an entertaining  movie. Watch it for Val Kilmer as Jim (EXCELLENT performance!!), watch it  for the WONDERFUL concert scenes, and watch it for the great soundtrack,  but don't count on a truthful account of the greatest band EVER!
0440219078|5.0|I first read this in the sixth grade with my class.  Some of the underlying meaning was difficult to understand at first, but now I still  can find more that wasn't pointed out before.  It was so wondrous to think  of a world with no color and feeling, I wouldn't want it, but I wonder what  it would be like?  This is a classic book that should be required for every  middle-schooler.
6300151379|5.0|I loved this film. David Bowie is mesmerizing, Jeniefer Connely persistently innocent. The plot intertwines both of their auras and puts them on the amazing backdrop of a labyrinth. It's just great. I saw this  when I was about 11, now I'm 20 and I want to share it with my 9-year-old  sister. But I just cannot. These are the types of movies that belong in  family movie libraries. Just pure creativity and imagination.      I've  tried to rent it (but its declared &quot;lost&quot;). I am dying to see it  again. I am glad Amazon has provided a place where the people can voice  their views. Now all we need is for the right person to see all of these  great responses and maybe we'll have a chance of getting ourselves a fresh  new copy or two or three... I have a feeling it will happen soon. But in  the meantime does anyone know the address of the production company? If so,  post it and maybe we can bombard them. I also believe that we should be  able to copy it by asking the copyright owners (since there is no other way  to obtain a copy). Great art should never not be available for people to  enjoy. This is great art, and it needs to be rereleased.
B000002KHF|5.0|This cd in essence is some of vans best work. The beutiful lyrics combined with the soothing sounds of guitar make this cd a must have for all true fans of van morrison. If you love classic van then you will love this album  it portrays van at his best.
6304578482|5.0|Don't get me wrong, Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino are fabulous, but this movie showcases Ms. Garafolo at her biting, sarcastic best.  A very fun and surprisingly witty movie that will make for a very enjoyable  evening--especially with a group of close friends.  Don't miss Camryn  Manheim from &quot;The Practice&quot; as Toby.
0784011796|5.0|Pi was a beautiful movie. I loved the aspect of it being all in black and white, and how interesting the characters were. The soundtrack was beautifully done- to match the character's actions.. and the math part of  the movie was really interesting. I heard it was made for around $20,000..  thats amazing because you really can't tell at all. Rent it or buy it now  and you'll be doing yourself a great favor.
0790735954|5.0|This movie is a riot. The funniest parts are when the drill sergeant is screwing with Private Pyle. A superb cinematic experience.
080017948X|5.0|Think about it: &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; and &quot;It's A Wonderful Life&quot; are actually the same film.  They are both about appreciating the incredible gift of life.  The only difference is that in IAWL everybody  changes except Jimmy Stewart; in GD, everybody stays the same except Bill  Murray.  The moral: Only by learning to truly love others can we find  happiness in our own lives.  This is a zen movie.  Harold Ramis -- you the  man!
0780622650|1.0|And way too loud. You know you're in trouble when the best thing about a film is the closing credits. Don't bother.
0788805843|5.0|This is the funniest and most realistic movie from Disney every!  I love the music as well.
B000002BQK|5.0|Mariah makes the best music and this album proves it. This includes 'Honey' and 'My All' as well as some other good songs that never really became popular like 'The Roof', 'Breakdown', 'Fourth Of July', and 'Close  My Eyes'.
6305268835|5.0|If you liked Adam Sandler's, Billy Madison, and The Wedding Singer, You should like this too! I think his movies are always funny. Most teens to middle aged adults will like this movie in my opinion. If you like wacky  comedies, that don't necesarily have to have a point, then this is for you.
B000005AYM|5.0|This is a great album!!. Erykah has a great voice! Hip-hop's latest diva has the best songs! Buy this album today!!
0060229357|5.0|I ordered this book from my daughter's class, but for myself.  When it arrived, I read it aloud to my children, my husband, and my in-laws!  It is  a sweet, simple, wonderful book.
B000002NIW|5.0|If your just beginning to listen to Hard Rock or Metal, or Punk Deftones is the way to start. From the loud guitar to the screaming vocals it will pump you up to do just about anything. The whole cd kicks ***.
0792838637|5.0|I recomand this movie to action- fan espasially to , James bond fans (Like my selves) I already have GoldenEye on VHS, maybe I buy that on DVD too, couse this was fun!
6303346367|5.0|This movie is a superb blend of Hitchcock's storytelling technique and his macabre sense of humor.  The story is excellently crafted.  The audience sympathizes right away w/ Hannay as he listens to the spy's incredible  story.  And it fears for his safety at the words &quot;Clear out, Hannay,  you're next!&quot; and the sight of the knife.  Excellent romantic comedy  bits as Hannay is handcuffed to a woman who dislikes him.  And the  lagniappe is the angle Mr. Memory is framed at at the end of the film.  YOU  MUST SEE THIS FILM!
6305265488|5.0|I have seen this move several times and each time I think it gets better and better.  Who could have thought that Drew could play the innocets of a young girl.  But she did and she did it well.
0345349571|5.0|I was never interested in the &quot;calamitous 14th Century&quot; until I read Mrs. Tuchman's study.  This &quot;awful century&quot; was one of war,  plague, massacre, political corruption, religious controversy, madness and  sex scandal - just like OUR century.  Mrs. Tuchman does a great job making  all this mess interesting for the average reader, and her use of Enguerrand  de Coucy as her focus makes her story manageable, though I don't agree with  her admiration for the man.  A Distant Mirror is also a good prologue for  Mrs. Tuchman's The March of Folly, for in the 14th Century Folly was king!
0316152196|4.0|This one seems to lose some steam and high standard as the old ones, especially the last round-up; a twist too hastily done, let the Internal  Affairs guy kill by mobs while Bosch's skin was miraculously saved. Also,  when read this one, Harry has become a  kinda guy mellowed too much, and  has become quite estranged. Not a lone wolf with strong inner conflict  anymore, but a married guy with a compulsive gambling wife. This kind of  transformation is the worst kind of writing a NOVEL, i.e., you just let a  hero created in a good novel series become too human and would grow too old  too soon, and finally would have to let him die. If Harry Bosch's inner  conflict finally turned into certain marital problem, then this series  would be diluted into a tasteless family stuff. Don't do this, Mr.  Connelly, keep the hero on the right track, and you, please don't lose  focus again.
630512065X|4.0|i loved this film it was great .Howcan we produce a film so good and so nice.
6305229449|3.0|Je suis une mauvaise foi parce que comme j' tais avec ma copine au cinma je me suis plus interesse  elle qu' au flm et donc j' ai pas eu le temps de le voir.
0800141385|5.0|This is a very entertaining movie! Its a touching, yet hilarious story. Hope you enjoy it!!
630512065X|5.0|I've seen many stage plays and this video captures the stage effect better than any other.  We play this video at least once a week!
B000002LUB|5.0|I truly do not understand some of the previous comments.  For years and years and years I professed not only was &quot;Mob Rules&quot; the greatest metal album ever but the greatest metal album that ever could be.  It took  me a while but I finally had to admit to myself &quot;Dehumanizer&quot;  surpasses &quot;Mob Rules&quot;.  I don't know how they did it but they DID  do it.
B00000HZFH|5.0|I've been waiting for this album for more than a year.  And, I'm quite pleased to say it's worth the wait.  Doug Martsch and his buddies have made an album of terrific songs.  If there is any justice in this world, You  Were Right should be a big hit.
6304143184|5.0|My parents will always remember the way this movie made me cry as a kid. The funny thing is, it still does. And when I was applying to film schools for college my parents let me go because they saw how much movies affected  me emotionally. But why isn't the video available? Let's all complain to  Amazon!
6304613199|5.0|This movie was excellent. Frankly I thought it was way better than the book. All the book did was go on forever about Malcolm talking about chaos theories. This movie is a must see for those who appreciate well done  pictures. Malcolm, Eddie, Sarah, Kelly, and Nick go to another island in  which the dinosaures were created. There they find out that Ingen is trying  to move dinosaours off the island. It's then they decide they must stop  them. From that moment on the movie takes away your breath and makes you  wonder what's going to happen next. I only had one complaint. They didn't  have the dilophosaourus (the spitting dinosaur) in this movie. What's with  that. He was poisenous and mean. He should have been in it. Still it's a  wonderful movie.
080018789X|5.0|Tom Crusie played Jerry Macgurie real well.  I really liked how he said &quot; Show me the money!&quot;  It was just a really great movie I could see it like over 1,000 times and not get tired of it.  I recommaned this  movie.  Its got all you want in it romance, drama and suspense.  I don't  think that anyone but Tom Crusie would beable to play Jerry as good as he  did.  I definatienly recommaned this movie to sport fans since it is  bascilly about sports.  It was funny to.  I just loved the movie its still  my favorite movie and he's my favorite actor.  I give Jerry Macguire a  thumbs up a great movie.  I recommaned it to everyone to see.
6304602979|4.0|When I first saw this film I didn't know Tarantino from tutti frutti. All I knew was that it absolutely knocked my socks off! A good story line, great dialog and a ballsy overall attitude made it almost mesmerising the  first time through. Subsequent viewings have only strengthened my first  impressions. Slater has never been better, Brad Pitt is a hoot, and the  scene with Walken and Hopper is scary/moving/terrific. (Am I lying?) And  that's not even taking into account all the other great performances in the  film. Arquette, Gandolfini, Oldman, Penn, Rappaport, Pinchot.  They were  all outstanding.  Hats off to Tony Scott for bringing it all together.
B000002TLX|5.0|Richard Marx is a great singer he's got the voice and he music makes me want to dance.  My favorite song is &quot;Endless Summer nights&quot;  But I also like &quot; Should of know better&quot; and Hold on to the Nights is  good to.  All I can say about Richard Marx is he's the bomb I hope he'll  still be around in about 10 years.  He's greast hits cd has all of he's  great songs I recommaned it for the hard to die fans of him.
B000002AHM|5.0|AS A YOUNG BOY IN THE 80'S LEARNING AND LIVING, I WAS INTRODUCED TO AN ALBUM THAT WOULD INFLUENCE THE WAY I LOOKED AT LIFE. THE POWER THAT WAS PUT OUT GAVE ME UNDERSTANDING IN WHAT I TOOK FOR GRANTED. THE MUSIC MOVED ME  INTO ANOTHER PHASE OF LIFE. THE ALBUM HAS LONG BEEN RETIRED FROM THE NEEDEL  AND UNHEARD IN SEVERAL YEARS, BUT NOT FORGOTTEN. I WAS FORTUNATE TO  REDISCOVER IT IN CD, THROUGH AMAZON. THANKS!
6303542352|5.0|Richardson et al give stellar performances in this brilliant movie about a politician obsessed with the sole goal of becoming the PM and working brilliantly and ruthlessly to achieve that goal.  You will find yourself  quoting Richarson's chilling lines all the time!  The othere two movies in  this series are also definitely worth seeing.
6302968143|5.0|For young and slightly older alike, harmless holiday entertainment. Recommended especially to those who love witch movies. Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy are great as the evil but mostly befuddled  spell casters. One of my all time favorits!
6304119046|5.0|Citizen Kane is truly the finest piece of work to ever come out of Hollwood. Orson Welles managed to create a character so real, so enduring that another character of equal impact will probably never be seen on the  screen again. In 1941 the film was so far ahead of its' time and even today  in 1999 it is ahead of its' time.
0792839730|4.0|After seeing this movie over and over on commercial TV with its pan and scan and cut out sceens, the DVD version is a wonderful treat.  The movie reminds me of Patton in that there is an adequate amount of war action but  the real movie is about the strategy used by the leaders of both  sides.<br />My only complaint is about the video transfer.  The master used to  create the DVD contained specks throughout the film.  I have been spoiled  by DVDs of recent movies but I really wish that the studio either obtained  a better master, or did some clean up on the vudeo before transfering to  DVD.
B000001EC1|5.0|A must have for anyone Bon Jovi fan or any fan who hasn't heard bon jovi's music!
B000000OMB|4.0|Why did I like it? For some of the same reasons your critic didn't.  It's big, lush, complicated and sounds good.
B00000DGUG|5.0|All I have to say (and I won't type it all here becuase it will take too much pages) that this is the best Album ever made as long with Jagged Little Pill , It's AMAZING! Each song is wonderful! I mean BUY IT NOW!!!!!!  ALANIS ROCKS!
B000002UJQ|5.0|An emotional rollercoaster ride or something pretentious like that.  A harrowing tale of alienation and general disdain for the fastpaced corporate world.  I love this CD its indescrible, buy it now!
B0000025DV|4.0|I first bought the LP of &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; back in high school and was instantly gratified.  Now many years later, I have listened to the CD and have rediscovered what good rock and roll can really be.
B00000099Y|5.0|I first hear TOOL while working at Summer Camp, &quot;Message to Harry Manback&quot; got me hooked, the perfect song of unbridled hate.  I've got all my friends hooked on this CD too.  It's wonderful, plus Bill Hicks, the  Man.  Aenima is a wonderful CD all the way through, buy it now, I have to,  my teacher borrowed mine and scratched it.
B000002UVX|5.0|If you are an electric guitarist, this album is indispensible since it contains the single greatest live (or dead) electric guitar performance...Machine Gun.  If you don't agree you aren't yet experienced.   From the opening note to the end of the song the tone, phrasing, control,  power, fluidity and beauty of Jimi's performance is mind blowing.  He is ON  for every single note, and the amazing thing is although he played within  the general confines of a rehearsed song the notes he played on this take  are improvised...he never played the same thing twice.   Throughout the  album Jimi's playing is inspired and loose.  My other favorite is Message  to Love, I love his funky call and response with his guitar.  None of the  songs on this album are &quot;hits&quot; but if you're willing to get  experienced there's no better place to look.
0767802772|5.0|I was looking for a romantic comedy, and this one is the best of both.  Matthew Perry is adorable, and Selma Hayek is beautiful and funny.  I have seen this movie over and over, and will never give up a chance to see it  again.  If you want something sweet, that won't strain your brain, this is  for you!
B000006045|3.0|I'm a really big alternative music fan, however, I still like trip-hop a lot. I think that &quot;Portishead&quot; is the best in this genre - although this album does have some good songs. I have one MAJOR complaint  though - and that is - I don't think that the voices fit the songs well  very much. Whoever sings on &quot;Man Next Door&quot; has the most ANNOYING  VOICE; He echoes on every thing he says and it is so stupid. The voice on  &quot;Inertia Creeps&quot; and &quot;Risingson&quot; is also annoying (not  as much) and I really can't enjoy the music if the voices aren't very good.  The album is nicely crafted though and I really like the artwork. Songs  like &quot;Dissolved Girl&quot; (the COOLEST BASSLINE) completely save this  album. Massive Attach fans will be pleased though... People like me,  however, will think that this is well... okay. Rating: B-
B000002JSZ|5.0|I have listened to most of AC/DC's albums, and this is the only one I would give five stars. Most fans would probably name &quot;Back in Black&quot; or &quot;For Those About to Rock...&quot; as their best record,  but I think this one is much better than either of them. I had this album  on tape when I was in junior high and played it continuously. Almost all of  its songs are great, but especially &quot;Rising Power&quot;, &quot;This  House is On Fire&quot;, and &quot;Bedlam in Belgium&quot;.
0792151712|1.0|Titanic is a hideous movie, a splendidly produced and widely acclaimed glorification of the ugliest of twisted sexual politics.<br />Rose endangers Jack with a kinky and dangerous game, most notably enticing him into her  chambers to sketch her with her fiance's rock around her neck, insisting  that Jack sign it. Then she leaves the sketch with a note in the safe:  &quot;Just wanted you to see that I was sharing it with Jack&quot;! or  something to that effect.<br />What sick motivation would cause a woman to  write such a thing and endanger someone in this way? Romantic? Rose is a  corrupt and nasty female.<br />Once Rose has set up this incredibly dangerous  situtation, she leads Jack through the hold of the boat, knowing that her  fiance's thugs could easily throw him into the drink and noone would ever  be the wiser.<br />&quot;Touch me, Jack,&quot; she sighs. Could she endanger  him more?<br />And when the rock is found in his pocket, she doesn't defend  him, not even for a second: &quot;Jack, how could you?!&quot; is all she  says as he is led away.<br />What a hideous woman! With a friend like Rose,  all Jack needed was for the boat to sink!<br />Everyone is lauding this film  and praising the romance of it. I am astounded. Rose is the most femme  fatale of all and Jack dies saving the precious, useless wench. Why would  you call any of this Love?<br />Titanic is an ugly story about a woman with  nasty motivations endangering one of our competent, sweet Wisconsin farm  boys to his deadly peril.<br />The way I look at this movie, Rose is a  hideous, selfish witch, clear to the end, when she throws away a priceless  gem. How many great-grandchildren does she have who could stand to go to  college? She's a potter, right? And she throws the rock away!? Dah.<br />What  is romantic about any of this?<br />This story about the romantic memories of  a sweet little old lady which everyone is talking about is, when I look at  it, one of the most hideously embarassing tales of a woman setting a man up  for her own vindictive jollys without any concern about endangering him  that I have ever seen on film and it is only in the telling of that story  that it has any value at all.ales of a woman setting a man up  for her own vindictive jollys without any concern about endangering him  that I have ever seen on film and it is only in the telling of that story  that it has any value at all.

0767817478|4.0|I'd say that this movie wasn't to my expectations.  It was good in some parts, but I thought it would be a little better.  I must agree with other watchers and say there was no plot.  People pretty  much just ran away from  a big foot and you never saw the monster.  I would have rather been with my  brother watching &quot;Barney's Great Adventure&quot;.
0783229011|3.0|Nobody in the US seems to realize that Babe is actually an adaptation of Dick King Smith's wonderful book &quot;The Sheep Pig&quot;, and they're really missing out.  He's very popular in Britain and Australia, and was  one of my favorite authors when I was growing up.  It's not surprising then  that &quot;Babe: A Pig in the City&quot; was godawful, because they weren't  taking it from one of his books (and Hollywood has problems with  scripts....).  Anyway, my point is that you should get your kids Dick King  Smith books if you find them!
B0000027KU|5.0|This album is very similar to the first Led Zeppelin album, and this is a compliment. It was released at the same time and the sound is in the same style. There is even one song that appears in both, &quot;You Shook  Me&quot;. The quality of the two records is very high. Beck plays very  roughly, with a lot of energy and feeling. Ron Wood plays with fast fingers  and sounds like John Paul Jones (who plays organ on &quot;OlMan  River&quot;). Rod Stewart sings with his unique voice songs very different  from the style he would go for in the future solo career - very  interesting. The most admired tune by rock musicians,  &quot;Greensleeves&quot;, is here played beautifully in acoustic guitar by  Jeff Beck alone. Nicky Hopkins also is here in two songs. Everyone who  likes rocknroll must have this.
B000000WF0|5.0|I have had this CD for more than 8 months and it hasn't left my CD players line up since I first bought it. This Cd seems to be getting better with every time I play it.
B0000024K1|5.0|It's unfortunate that this album has not been the artistic standard for rap music in the materialistic and misogynous '90s.  Never before has a rap album stirred such feelings of anarchy, emotion and pride in one sitting.   Chuck D is the messenger of the true hip-hop followers... providing us with  information and challenging us to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps and  righting the wrongs that have been perpetrated against us.  This album will  live on indefinitely because its messages will still be topics of  discussion in the next millennium.  Although no one will succeed him as our  messenger, the question for the rap artist of the '90s and beyond is  &quot;Bass, How low will you go for the $$$$$&quot;!

B000002NHN|3.0|It only has three hits. This CD will take some getting used to. You could go either way with this one.
B00000AFGM|5.0|I guess many know how Marilyn felt when writing this album. My taste doesn't even allow my listening to the noises he made on the last few albums, but this one definitely unleashes a more mature and balanced  Manson. Call me mainstream if you will and even though I would rate that as  an insult, it won't stop me from liking this album, simply because I can  relate. Listen to this stuff. Listen to it long enough to see behind the  simple yet effective music. Look for the details and you will see what I  mean. Definitely worth checking out.
B00000AFFF|5.0|This is definitely a strange marriage, but for some reason it works.  I'm an Elvis fan from my earlier years, and after seeing the PBS special where they performed songs from the album I knew I had to get it.  It's vastly  different from most of the benign pop music you hear on the radio, which  unfortunately will guarantee that it gets little air play.  The only  problem with it is that the songs beg to be sung along to, and my family is  getting pretty sick of me crooning along with Elvis Costello!
6302098440|5.0|Seen this movie several Dozen times. Each time it's a thrill. I am a 3D Animator and it inspired me to build a complete castle in 3D for my demo reel. Complete enjoyment for the whole family. May invoke old world  atitudes of yesteryear for the younger crowd. Five stars is not enough for  this old favorite.
6303014100|5.0|I think that the movie is awsome.  I could do without all the talking, but otherwise, its wonderful.  The music and drama really catches you.  I am about to watch it for the 7 time.
6304873441|5.0|i just love ANASTASIA. Not only is the graphic design in the movie awesome, i think the music in this movie has also contributed a great part into the success of it.

B000003BES|4.0|I recently got turned on to the Stones listening to  them on the radio. When I saw this inexpensive collection online, I thought &quot;hey this would be a great way to add some of my favorite Stones songs to my 60s rock  collection&quot;. However, when I finally got the cd I was a bit  disappointed in the lack of real quality to the music. The guitars don't  come across as sharp as they do on the radio, and the vocals sound rather  out of tune on Time is on my Side. Still, the cd does pull together my  favorite Stones songs from their early period, and the price is worth it.

6304578458|5.0|I have admired Mr. Cusack as an actor for many years now, and I think that Grosse Pointe Blank is his best work so far. He has gone from playing lovelorn-teenager type characters to this mature, thoughtful,  well-developed character. He is a hitman who is having second thoughts  about his choice of career, and the movie is about the results of that  dilemma. It not only retains the comedic quirks characteristic of  Mr.Cusack's movies, but plays them to the fullest without being over the  top. Also, there are several members of the Cusack family in the movie:  Joan Cusack plays Marcella the secretary, another sister, Anne, plays  Amy(the new mother at the reunion), and Bill Cusack has a short appearance  as a waiter in the Hippo Club. Minnie Drive, Dan Aykroyd, Jeremy Piven, and  a host of others all turn in excellent performances as well. I give this  movie five stars out of five
0783225792|3.0|Good (because of Scorsese and Deniro) but eventually grating film (because of Stone) about the mob in Vegas.  The docu-first hour is great, but leaves the characters flat and under developed, squandering the Jerry Springer-ish  third act.<br />Still ,it's better than most films out there.
B000002LOE|4.0|This is a very listenable effort, but it pales in comparison to the CDs it was released between, the more varied Green and the glorious Automatic for the People. It's a solid album, but it's far from the first R.E.M. CD I  would recommend to someone.<br />This is one of the more unusual R.E.M. CDs in  that the well-known tracks are not as satisfying as the others. &quot;Radio  Song,&quot; &quot;Losing My Religion,&quot; and &quot;Shiny Happy  People&quot; are not as musically dense and therefore tend to pale quicker  than some of the other tracks.<br />For instance, &quot;Low&quot; includes a  wonderful organ line and a really great vocal from Michael Stipe,  &quot;Endgame&quot; features superb harmonies and is a truly haunting song,  &quot;Belong&quot; is unusual in that the only real lyrics are spoken, but  the refrain is a wonderful vocal counterpoint to the music, even if there  are no actual words. Kate Pearson's guest vocals are great, of course she  is a wonderful singer, but she plays off Stipe much better in &quot;Country  Feedback&quot; and my personal favorite (one of R.E.M.'s best), &quot;Me in  Honey.&quot; This song has a wonderful riff, and Stipe and Pearson  harmonize beautifully. This song alone would be good enough reason to get  this album IMO, even if nothing else here is quite on its exceptional  level.
0790729989|3.0|I like this movie very much; it's the best serial killer story since Silence of the Lambs. The picture quality on this DVD is very good, but I was disappointed to know that only half of the movie was on each side. It's  like going back to having a laser disc without the auto turn-over feature.  I wish I would have known this before buying this edition- I would have  waited for the &quot;all on one side&quot; version to come out. It's a  great inconvenience for those who like to see a film in its uninterrupted  splendor, but also for those film fanatics who like to be able to jump to  any seen throughout the movie at will.
6301543408|5.0|The best of Star Trek. Buy this one now. This movie has everythin
B00000DHTF|5.0|This is the best box set that any entertainer has ever released.  Because this is not your ordinary run of the mill old garbage rehash shit that most people put out!  Au contraire, this is mostly all new unreleased music.   Springsteen has really shocked us here with these hidden gems. This music  on it's own could be the crowning achievement to any other artists career.   But for Bruce it was simply his throwaways.  If your a Bruce fan or even if  your not, I'm willing to bet that you will love this set.  Disk two and  three are my personal favorites.  SO SIT  BACK AND ENJOY !!!!!  <br />PS: The  best way to listen to this set is to put it in a five CD Player and hit  ramdom!!
6300263673|5.0|I first heard of this movie while watching some TV. It was going to be playing on thursday night at 8:00pm. So I thought sounds like fun.So I watched. IT WAS THE BEST MOVIE! I am writing this while buying it. I  watched and i thought it was one of the best movies i have ever seen.        I thought all the characters were well developed and well acted out. I  would recommend this movie to anyone who likes love stories, or dancing or  both!
6303224644|5.0|This movie is simply grand. Lovely acting, expensive scenery and beautiful music you will be singing for months! Vincente pours his love for Judy into every shot. A gem of a movie... right up there with Presenting Lily Mars.  Buy it, Watch it!
0790733226|2.0|The previews hyped this film so much. I had so many expectations trying to imagine what it would be once contact was established. This ending is all they came up with? What a waste!
0800184327|5.0|I really enjoyed all the the Latio dancing.  It was very well performed.  However there is no reason to spend 89 dollars on a movie plus shipping and handling when you can rent it.
6305232660|3.0|If you like drama and realism, then Deep Impact is the film to watch. If you like special effects and action then Armagedon is the clear choice. I think neither film really hits the mark. If only the strengths of both  films could be combined.
6300214753|5.0|This movie was very cool, sexy, exciting and disurved 5 stars for that. I enjoyed the movie and will most likely buy it off amazon.com.
0790729725|5.0|This movie felt so real and right on when it comes to mafia movies. When I first watched it, however, it took me a couple minutes to realize that I was watching the second part instead of the first part (I hate dvd's you  have to flip). I hope they come out with a special collector's edition.

1573226521|5.0|Truly this book was one of the best reads in recent memory. I feel like I can really relate to Mr. Garland. But that is what good writers are striving for,right? The book starts out in Thailand and would make the most  wretched agoraphobiac want to pick up a pack and start hostelling. The  dialogue is very real and the author's voice  is fresh and imaginatively  original. Watch out for the parts when Richard is smoking out with Sammy  and Zeph, their introduction into the book is cleverly done and will be  hard to forget(The surfer act). Also the part where Richard (Excuse me, he  is the protagonist) is imagining a fight scene with Bugs (Once again excuse  the quotations he, Bugs, is another character included in the read). Who  doesn't do this? It is like &quot;Wait a minute, back up, now...no, yeah  thats it, This is what I'd do... Once you read this book you won't forget  it. I have told all of my literary friends about it (The two that I  have-&quot;So Braddocks what did you think of it my man?...Ha) and am very  much impressed. For a young doubtful writer like myself it was a sheer  motivational and inspirational experience. &quot; You are in Vietnam, man!  /people are strange... Thanks.
0792838637|5.0|This DVD is the reason why we have a home theatre and DVD player. Great sound and action you'd suspect from a James Bond flick. Extras abound and the interactive menus fit this dvd perfectly. I just wished they used the  actresses more (especially that Superman babe).
6305229449|5.0|I think it was scary,funny, and exciting.  The scary part was when those Huns appeared from the snow.  It was exciting when she was dressed like a man.  The funny character was Mushu and he was funny because of his voice  and his acting.  Eddie Murphy's voice is hilarious.
B000003N7G|5.0|&quot;A Love Supreme&quot; is Coltrane's musical prayer, and people of the religious vein can only wish to pray so beautifully.  Trane never runs out of ideas on the album, and the listener can glean something new out of  every re-listening.  Each sound fits in the multi-colored fabric of his  improvisations -- and the album as a whole is fully satisfying.  I still  have not grown tired of this album.
0399143904|4.0|Tom Clancy mixes true military genius with eccentric characters in this very imaginative book. The book may be a little too imaginative at some parts, yet the action is fantastic and exciting.
6304490399|5.0|This movie was a surprise on its first viewing, and continues to delight.  The film maker is able to capture, in spite of his documentary style, the joy, spirit and courage of his subjects.<br />At the time of its first  release, Lawwill and Smith were known to but a few &quot;hardcore&quot;  hobbyists. However, the movie gave them, and other characters, an  immediate, universal appeal.  I was fortunate to see the film in its first  release.  The audience was comprised of many non-motorcyclists, not really  aware of the movie's content.  Most were surprised, intrigued and  delighted.
6304696515|5.0|Vicomte de Valmont (John Malkovich) appears to be the ultimate libertarian in an aristocratic society that would not even tolerate thinking about sex.<br />Seducing is a game, a way of life, for him and Marquise de Merteuil  (Glenn Close). Their complicity is the background of a diabolic plan  involving seduction of young Cecile de Volanges (Uma Thurman).<br />While some  people will be stopped by the scandalous and sulfurous aspects of such a  film, others will appreciate the magnificent French style of the XVIIIth  and the fine play of the actors. Really gorgeous!

B000002J6F|5.0|In the early 1970s as an undergraduate at UVA when I eagerly awaited the next album from my favorite rock and roll artists, I was constantly dismayed to read that what had been going on in the late 60s was still  continuning.  Bands that had sky rocketing success were breaking up at the  height of their popularity for no apparent reason to us other than they  just could not get along or wanted more freedom of expression, etc.  None  of this could be understood by those of us who just wanted to hear more  great music.  I could never understand why Crosby, Stills and Nash (and  Young) could not stay together for the next 40 years and satisfy my  unquenchable thirst.  After two solo albums by Stills, I had decided that  he was my favorite of the group.    When Manassas came out and I saw that  Stephen Stills was one of the driving forces in the group, I bought the  album.  Without a doubt, that was one of the best purchases I had ever  made.  What a collection of the finest rock and roll music you will ever  hear.  It starts strong and finishes stronger.  The musicianship, the  vocals, the passion, it's all there.  The first side of the first LP blew  me away.  Then came the country and western side with the wonderful  &quot;So Begins The Task&quot;.  Firefall recorded the first song on the  third side (first side of the second LP), &quot;It Doens't Matter&quot;,  and had a commercial hit.  Anyone who ever compared the two versions would  wonder why it wasn't Manassas's version that they were listening to on  their car radio.  It gets better and better.  My personal favorite is on  the last side, &quot;The Treasure&quot;, a song that makes me want to turn  it up and sing along.    I was fortunate enough to see Manassas in concert  at the College of William &amp; Mary in 1972.  What an experience.   Unfortunately, I believe that was one of only two tours the group ever  made.     For those of us who can remember the LIFE cereal commercial of  many years ago I can only say, &quot;Try it, you'll like it.&quot;  Thank  goodness that I had the chance to replace my old vinyl LP with the crisp  new CD.  After all these years it hasn't lost a thing.  Isn't that so,  Watts?
0553473328|5.0|My mother and I exchange books, and she had given me &quot;DRUMS&quot; to read.  Not knowing, or looking, that this was a series of books, I read the book in a weekend, I could not put it down! The characters are so  spell-binding! Then to find out that there are books that precede, I was at  the library before I finished &quot;DRUMS&quot;! But I couldn't stop  reading the fourth book, and have now read &amp; re-read all of the books.  I only wish my husband was more like Jamie Fraser! Ah, to have lived in  that time, when men were men and women were women! And life was what you  made of it, it's makes me think that we all need to be a little like Jamie  &amp;  Claire.

B00000ADG2|5.0|&quot;THE MISEDUCATION OF LAURYN HILL&quot; is a woderful, texturus and clean solo album by one of RandB's best rappers!! She combines heavy beats and graceful singing with fruitful lyrics and tense subject matter. I  especially enjoyed listening to the remake of &quot;CAN'T TAKE MY EYES OFF  OF YOU&quot;! Anyone can understand why two of the finest songs are already  singles(DOO WOP)THAT THING&quot; and &quot;LOST ONES&quot;.From songs about  her newborn son to lost passion to finding God, this ghetto superstar will  definitely not be finished soon, at least with her fans. Other enjoyable  tunes include: &quot;SUPERSTAR&quot;, &quot;EVERYTHING IS  EVERYTHING&quot;,&quot;FINAL HOUR&quot;,&quot;EVERY GHETTO, EVERY  CITY&quot; and &quot;I USED TO LOVE HIM&quot;. i rate this CD five stars  and reccommend it to anyone.

0060977493|5.0|&quot;The God of Small Things&quot;, though confusing in parts, is a powerful story. In a culture in which relationships have well-defined  boundaries, and those boundaries are taken seriously, Arundhati Roy has  described with sensitivity and practicality, the causes and consequences of  transgression. Though depressing, the story is very real, highlighting the  unpredictability of life, the power of love, and the struggles that result  from the clash of emotions with established social rules. <br />The first  three-fourths of the book is often times confusing. The story comes  together mainly in the last few chapters. It is almost as though pieces of  a puzzle came together to create an unexpected but very powerful picture. I  will carry the image of that picture for a long time to come. My advice to  anyone considering reading this book is to be patient with it and stick  with it, even if it looks like it is not going anywhere......The end is  worth it!!!

B0000057D8|4.0|An extremely brief sharing of information, my friends. This CD contains the 1982 DDD recordings of the Brandenburgs. Pinnock and his English Concert demonstrate why Mr. Pinnock is an early music GOD! A bit silly of  me, I know. The infamous Harpsichord solo in Con. #5 is handled perfectly  by Mr. Pinnock himself. It is the only recording in which the solo doesn't  sound as if Bach had returned from a time warp suffering the after effects  of some pills John Lennon persuaded Johann to try. However, BE WARNED: the  four suites on this CD are ADD--That's right, ANALOG! I do wish our friends  here at Amazon.com would somehow indicate so. If the analog recording is a  problem for you, Mr. Pinnock has recored the suites in DDD along with  examples of Bach's recasting them as cantatas, or perhaps more acurately,  sinfonias, on another CD released, perhaps, in 1995.  I highly reccommend  that CD for the suites although I have not listened to the ADD recordings  on this CD you are researching. Oh, and by the way, that 1995 CD is  stupendous. Why? Because it's Trevor Pinnock, that's why

630438551X|1.0|For every 16 year old who watched this movie and thought &quot;How great!&quot; I only hope that age makes you a little wiser and a little more intelligent with your movie picks. Yeah, I paid the seven bucks to see  it, and I was horrified at the liberties they took.  I know one of the  qualities of great literature is that it can be adapted into modern times  and that it's accessible to all ages, but this is a joke.  &quot;Leo&quot;  and Claire Danes are pathetic as the star-crossed lovers.  It's  uncomfortable to see them try and speak in Shakespeare's language.  It also  seems that acting in itself had gone by the wayside.  There is no  legitimate supporting cast--and I couldn't wait until that John Leguzamo  guy died.  For anyone who likes watching classic movies and not some teenie  bop adaptation--I suggest renting the 1967 Zefirrelli's &quot;Romeo and  Juliet.&quot;  There's a movie that will bring anyone to tears knowing that  this is how it's meant to be done.
B00000GAIW|5.0|The quintessential Tull record, not even Thick as a Brick can rival it.  A two-part concept album discussing social outcasts and religion that contains the band's greatest singles (the title track, &quot;Locomotive  Breath&quot;) and many, many awesome sleeper tracks as well (check out  &quot;Hymn 43&quot; and &quot;Cross-Eyed Mary&quot;).  A must buy.
B00000DHRZ|5.0|I thought this cd was killer. The sound and the lyrics made it an instant classic that will never tire of being played on the radio. This cd is one you could listen to over and over and never get sick of it. If I could I  would rate it 10 out of 5 stars.

6304711905|5.0|The transfer to DVD brings sharp vibrant pictures and crisp sound.  Besides several historical inacuuracies TOMBSTONE delivers.  Memorable quotes  abound in the movie.  Val Kilmer, as 'Doc', gives a 10 star  performance.  TOMBSTONE on DVD is definatley worth it.
B000003TBP|5.0|Beck is the man!!!  Odelay is the first Beck CD I bought and it made me want to get all of his other stuff.  All of his other stuff is great, but none of it compares to Odelay.  In fact, it's my favorite CD I have.  I  play it so much it won't be long until I have to buy another one because of  it wearing out.  A classic album that will go down as one of the best  albums of the '90s.  If you don't believe me just ask some of the top music  critics around.
6303481272|5.0|Ninja Scroll was an excellent movie.  It had a lot of action and suspense to make for a great anime film.  The demons were original and creative, unlike how some movies tend to make demons.  The best thing about this is  it wasn't afraid to show off blood and gore.  The story line was also  superb and allowed great character development.  The movie even had its  share of drama, which also built for a good story.  I really can't say  anthing bad about this movie except that eventually, it ends.
B00000F1D3|5.0|Maybe it was timing, but I LOVE this CD...&quot;Believe&quot; may well be my new anthem...it makes me feel powerful and in control of my life...and who can't use a little more of that?
0792151712|5.0|The director could have cut a lot of corners to save money, but the film is worth watching just to see the wonderful recreation of the ship, the period-authentic costumes and so on.  The cruise ships now, though  fireproof, just aren't the same.  The sound track, a pleasure in itself,  adds to the experience without shattering the nerves.  The movie leads us  to ask the question, &quot;What would I do in these circumstances?&quot; It  is inspiring to see so many brave women characters in the film. <br />Another  theme, social stratification, is poignant, and one wonders what the ship,  populated with noveau riche from today, would look like, and how they would  act? The director makes excellent use of imagery. For example the couple  running through the coal firing room as they fall more deeply in love,  compares to Hal's lighting of cigars. The many subtle, recurring themes,  such as &quot;hands&quot;: poker, the drawings, the car window, and our  last glimpse of the sinking hero, to name just a few of the obvious ones,   make watching the movie one more time a fascinating experience. The movie  has thousands of secrets, details and surprises which make it a real work  of art. It is true to live, yet bigger than life, and the beauty is in the  details.
0790736233|5.0|I saw this movie a couple days ago for the first time and i apsolutely love it.  This is defenetly the best movie ever!!!!
6305229449|5.0|Mulan is a cool movie. Disney always has shown great movies, but the last few weren't so good, but Mulan definitely boosted my opinion of Disney. I especially liked the fact that it was about a Chinese tale, because Disney  mostly shows old time movies and more modern American movies.
6303979882|5.0|Now and Then is one of those films that you absolutely have to see, especially with your friends. It'll always remind you of what your ideal summer would have been when you were twelve, with all of your friends.  Brilliant acting played by the four girls in particular, with a good  supporting cast also.
B000002IZ4|5.0|need i say more
0800196341|5.0|I loved this movie. When I first heard that it was 4 hours long I thought it was going to be torture but when I saw it I was so enthralled that i didn't notice the passage of time.  When I saw it a second time the only  part that detracted at all was the performances of Lemmon(dull and  unaffecting) and Depardieu(way overrated in my opinion). Everyone fom  Kenneth Branagh to Rufus Sewell ,excluding Lemmon and Depardieu, gave truly  amazing performances. It was nice to see his use of old favorites from his  previous films ,Richard Briers and Derek Jacobi, as well as some new blood.  I really loved the Palace they used it added some interesting elements to  the film. My three favorite scenes are the &quot;play scene&quot;, the  &quot;May all my thoughts be bloody scene&quot;, and the  &quot;gravedigger&quot; scene. This movie is easily my favorite of his.
B000000W6F|4.0|This is a good ol' grunge album, and it has distinctive style (since when don't the Pumpkins?)  From the scorching loudness of &quot;Siva&quot; to the soft sweetness of &quot;Crush&quot;, with this album you can already  tell that the Pumpkins were destined to be big...REAL big.  I love &quot;I  Am One&quot;...how it builds from the cool drum intro to the bass, to the  guitar, to Billy Corgan's furious whine.
0893860220|5.0|My friend Ricky needs five minutes to think of five words to say about this book. I type slow, so if I just type a little five minutes will pass, and then I'll type whatever he asks me to type right here. under this blue  moon on a hilltop on an island with the radio playing and the sound of his  breathing. I got my words he says: caution..read with tremendous courage.
6300151379|5.0|labyrinth has been my favorite since i was 6. when i come to find out alll video stores have stoped renting it i went looking but nothing is out there. i say RERELEASE! IT'S SO COOL!
B000002UVX|5.0|Band of Gypsies was one of my first music albums. I was a junior in high school and received it as a gift. It has been one of my favorites ever since. Thirty years later, I am now a 45 year old who is still be amazed  that only three guys can put out such incredible jams. My album is worn  out, my son long since has destoyed my turntable, my cassette copy of the  album is fading so I eagarly await this CD. This recording is timeless!
B00000DHRZ|3.0|&quot;Walla Walla&quot; is an annoying song, but the rest of this album manages to rock pretty well.  &quot;She's got Issues&quot;, &quot;Why don't you get a job?&quot; and of course &quot;Pretty Fly&quot; are fun punk-pop  with the emphasis on pop.  I also like the more serious, punkish &quot;The  Kids Aren't Alright&quot; and &quot;Americana&quot;.  The CD ends with a  long, groovy, largely instrumental track.  Offspring depart a little from  pure punk madness but keep some good visceral rockers in there, managing to  steer away from artsy disappointment and entertain us all the while.  The  CD opens with a funny knock on American push-button materialism.  So get  your credit card and buy this album, you money-grubbing Offspring fan!
6304078102|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite movies.  Dreyfuss is the perfect actor for playing Glen Holland.  &quot;For 30 years Glen Holland found a way to make a differenct.  Of all the lives he changed, the one that changed most  was his own.&quot;  The ending is a tear-jerker!  A... really great movie!
6305107122|5.0|'Halloween' is the movie that started the whole slasher flick trend. Following 'Halloween''s footsteps were 'Scream' to 'Urban Legends'. I've seen this movie 4 times and it stays as scary as the first. It's pure 100%  terror, suspense, horror, and frightful.
6304078145|5.0|YOU JUST HAVE TO WATCH THE MOVIE A FEW TIMES TO REALY APREITATE IT. I OWN IT AND ITS MY FAVORITE. WHEN I HAVE A BAD DAY AT WORK I COME HOME POP IT IN THE VCR  AND IN THE NEXT FEW MINUTES IM LAUGHING, IT NEVER FAILS. WHAT CAN  I SAY BUT FUNNY. JUST WATCH IT FOR THE HUMOR DONT TRY TO ANALIZE IT JUST  WATCH IT AND LAUGH.
B000006NPY|3.0|The problem with reading Adore customer reviews is that a few people are reviewing this as a rock album.  Get it straight folks, the Pumpkins are not trying to rock your world with Adore.  What they are doing is going out  on a limb with some playful electronica/new age/light  goth/hard-to-categorize pop.  There are some very beautiful songs on here,  such as &quot;Pefect&quot;, &quot;The Night Mare&quot;, &quot;To  Shiela&quot; and &quot;Blank Page&quot;.  Although I prefer the ROCKIN'  Pumpkins, I bought this album because it has artistic merit, I adore this  band, and Adore is fun to listen to when you're not in the mood for an  in-your-face rockout.  I credit the pumpkins, they &quot;did it for the  feel of somethin' new...&quot;
6302256615|5.0|This is a movie  for anyone who likes action packed movies. Keanu Reeves should be the King of all actors. The plot is rich with suspense, action and salavates with adenlyn. This movie will keep on the edge of your  seat,your jaw dropped and your eyes won't blink. 'Point Break' is a movie  every human being should own.
B000002BE9|1.0|fiona apple is another example of the music industries 'manufactured' product(s). fiona apple is a fake, she tries to be different, tries to talk and sound deep, but makes a fool out of herself trying. her music is no  other than a 'wannabe' underground artist, that tries to act like she's  indie or something (whatever she's trying to do). i cant beleive i bought  this album, it really disappointed me. i've got five words for fiona : 'you  are trying too hard'.
B000002BFZ|4.0|This album truly deserves the &quot;excellent&quot; rating that four stars entail.  It's varied, well-woven, and most importantly it rocks.  I love the optimism of &quot;Present Tense&quot; and the deep rhythm of &quot;In  My Tree&quot;, but the goods don't end here...buy this album and ignore the  people who insist on discrediting PJ for everything they did beyond Ten.
0061092037|3.0|As eager as I was to see which media magnate would come out on top, I was disappointed by the similarities between this novel and Kane and Abel and, like the reader from Wisconsin (below), I was also dismayed by the poorly  developed storylines. (I also noticed the many typographical errors in the  papaerback copy.) <br />In short, after reading several of his other novels, I  expected more of Archer.  I hadven't read his latest yet, but I hope it is  not such a half-hearted effort.
B000002BYD|4.0|The beauty and variety in Yield let you know that Pearl Jam are evolving as a band.  From the punky, delightfully furious &quot;Brain of J&quot;, to the soft, gorgous &quot;Faithful&quot;, to the powerful centerpiece  &quot;Given to Fly&quot;, this album doesn't disappoint.  Once again, there  are people who insist on discrediting Pearl Jam for everything they wrote  after Ten...and you may promptly ignore those people.  Pearl Jam are here  to stay.
0783228457|4.0|This is probably the most troubling film that I have ever seen.  I have watched it at least 10 times, and each time seems to frighten me more than the first!  <br />James Woods is brilliant in this film, while some of the  other cast members were a little limp.  It's low-budget feel seems to add  even more to Woods' performance.  I recommend watching this movie in the  dark and late at night - you won't regret it!
B000000WF0|4.0|The guy from West Michigan doesn't have a clue...Urban Hymns is a beautiful album! Bitter Sweet Symphony is good, and guess what folks, the CD only begins there. I especially love the songs &quot;Come On&quot; and  &quot;The Drugs Don't Work&quot;...they are gorgeous and powerful. Then  again, nearly every tune on this album is a keeper.
B000005RTV|5.0|Battle Hymn is awesome.  It has a melodious underlying that catches my interest, with good lyrics.  Awesome
B0000024SI|5.0|Another review at this point is probably pointless.  Nonetheless, I feel compelled to put in my two cents, since I bought this album 27 years ago.  At that time, I was astounded that the human mind (and one 24 years old, to  boot) could conceive of something like &quot;Desolation Row.&quot;  The  song still astounds me.  This album encouraged me to play the guitar and  write songs.  Likewise, it influenced the way I thought and lived.  It  remains for me the greatest album ever released, and one of the greatest  works of art of the 20th century.
6303832563|5.0|Along with Glass's music, Reggio's images of the disintergration of modern life is an epic! The unbelievable images, in perfect timing with Glass's hypnotic music, leave the viewer in awe. This film asks the question of  whether technology, as it has progressed, is benevelent in the long term.  Reggio and Glass's perspective on this question is obvious to those who see  the statement they make. The underlying message, which one must take from  the viewing of this film is the hard fact that life, especially urban life,  has become &quot;out of balance.&quot; The director portrays a time when  electronic development, production, technology and the pace of people is so  fast that we end up missing life all together. For if we continue on this  path, we would reach a point where we would cease to be human at all. One  of the best films I have ever seen!
B0000025DI|5.0|Dylan was vilified when he released this album back in 1978 (but then again, he was always vilified -- that's what happens when you're constantly ahead of everyone else).  Nevertheless, I was then and remain a great  admirer of this album.  In fact, I rank it as one of Dylan's finest albums.   My favorites:  &quot;Is Your Love in Vain?&quot; &quot;New Pony&quot; and  &quot;Changing of the Guard.&quot;  For those who still insist the man  cannot sing, listen to his phrasing on the verses of &quot;Baby, Stop  Crying.&quot;
6305095574|4.0|Evil Dead is a well thought-out movie with a decent plot.There are some good kill-scenes in there along with some good make-up.Even though this movie gets a bit slow at times,I would recomend it to any true horror fan.
0517591812|5.0|This is a wonderful book full of rich characters whose lives you become emersed in generation after generation.  As each chapter unfolds new characters emerge to replace the ones who came before.  At first, I didn't  want to let the characters go and was a bit annoyed that I would just grow  to like one of them and he or she would be replaced by someone new.  The  great part of this book though, is that the character traits turn up in  future generations and are never really lost only enriched.  The historical  backdrop makes for a really enjoyable and worthwhile read.  I was sorry  when it was all over.
B000003S09|5.0|A combination of terrific songwriting and top-notch musicianship (listen to the drumming on 21ST CENTURY SCHIZOID MAN). Hauntingly beautiful melodies with a hard, improvisational edge; best use of the mellotron ever  on a rock album. On their first album, the group was more accessible than  on later efforts, almost as if Fripp was Lennon to McDonald's McCartney. I  envy anyone who hasn't heard this one!
0790736233|5.0|I know I may be sounding extreme but this was the best movie to be made in history. Just see it i guarantee you'll like it.
1567184855|5.0|In response to one skeptical reviewer, I can tell you that I am among those who have met and been regressed by Dr. Newton. I cannot say that I saw things with the clarity that some must have experienced, but a hoaks  this most certainly not! I am not easily convinced, but I am convinced that  Dr. Newton is a man of considerable intelligence and integrety. It can  certainly be argued that the mind under hypnosis plays tricks, but  thousands of subjects are unlikely to experience the same tricks. Sheer  volume of experience is hardly proof, but it is evidence. If your looking  for a scientific, virtually irrefutable approach to the subject of  reincarnation  then you must look to Ian Stevenson and his cases  'suggestive of reincarnation'. For my part, I certainly look forward to a  second book by Dr. Newton.
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game is the best book that I have ever read. I read it all in one sitting. This is the best book in the Ender Wiggin quartet. Orson scott card's genius and wit are what makes this book so amazing, and you'll never  guess how it ends(and yes it does unfortunatly end). The story of Ender  wiggin will be so exciting that you'll never put the book down. If you buy  anything from amazon.com make it this.
0783230621|3.0|At last DTS dvds are here, this was my first.  Sound was very good. Way to go DTS.... Probably 5 to 10 % improvement on DD.  However the movie was rather predictable it was still good fun to watch and listen.  The LFE  effects will rock the house!!
6303213650|4.0|Joel Coen shows in this film all his talent and creativeness. It is very stylish and visual - because in the movies, the eyes are more important than the ears. For viewers who enjoy camera movements, this film is  delightful, there is a lot of them. The suicide scene in the beginning is  amazing. The movie may remind you of the Terry Gilliams film  &quot;Brazil&quot;, for its fantastic and strange climate. Jennifer Jason  Leigh makes an impressive and surprising acting.
6302491940|5.0|Funny story, pretty girls, exotic cars, breathtaking European scenery. Too bad the Paramount Home Video release(1992) is so fuzzy.  Looks like 4th generation dubbing. Thank goodness I could get a clean copy off the  cable!!!
6304938276|5.0|Scream 2 is way mroe developed then Scream.  What I mean by this is that when they are called on the phone they know that the killer can see them and that they are in danger.  You never know who is  and isn't gonna die,  except for Sidney she would never die.  But Sidney's boyfriend, whether he  is the killer or not always dies, Billy died in Scream and Derrick died in  Scream 2.  So does her closest friend(Tatum in Scream and Randy/her room  mate in Scream 2).  I think the plot is way similar but still much better  and the length always makes a horror movie better, Scream 2 had almsot a  perfect length, it could have been longer with more killing.
0792151712|2.0|You know how one day, at a certain age in your life, you see this REALLY great film and it just haunts your mind for days on end?<br />And then, you turn back and see it again, and instead of thinking it was great, you could  picture it on the next episode of Mystery-Science Theater?<br />That's how I  felt about this movie. Seriously. I just have to say, I was seriously  hooked into this film and hypnotized by the freakin' Enya-like music that  droned on and on, letting up only when there was an action scene, when the  music was then replaced by pieces of Horner's ALIENS that must have been  left on the cutting room floor of that film. And I must have seriously been  on something when I thought that Kate and Leo were really, really good. It  took Siskel and Ebert's annual movie-trashing right before the Oscars to  wake me up.<br />Yes, this movie is haunting and yes, for a moment, everyone  DID enjoy that stupid song by Celine Dion. Now, she can proudly hoist that  film up in the air and join the ranks of the other stupid &quot;diva&quot;  singers like Houston and Streisand who think that they're so great when, in  all reality, they're nothing but over-rated, over-blown lounge acts.<br />And  I DID pick TITANIC accurately in the Oscars. Not because I liked the film  that much, it's because I knew that it couldn't possibly lose due to the  budget of a small country and the wanna-be epic-like production, reminscent  of Forrest Gump(another piece of overrated junk that gave Tom Hanks the  ultimate complex and somehow convinced himself that he could be a great  serious actor).<br />All I have to say now is that I am sorry for EVER  thinking this movie was great. It was basically the Wizard hiding behind  the curtain instead. James, all I have to say is suck it up. Open up the  last of your champagne, get drunk, try and call your ex-wife who thankfully  left you(perhaps because she escaped the hypnotism?) and apologize to her  for being such a moron to her.<br />Why, you ask? Because STAR WARS is coming.  Everyone took their eyes off it because of TITANIC. It ain't happening  again. And all you little young, teenage girls who weep and sigh when Leo  shows his pre-pubescent chest to you can go ahead and tell me that nothing  will ever beat TITANIC. I have news for you, ladies. When people sell-out  theaters for THE WATERBOY and MEET JOE BLACK just to see the new STAR WARS  trailer, I think that means that Lucas is about to repeat history.  Especially when critics and box-office analysts predict that it will make  $200 Million in the first week, I think that means that TITANIC will sink  again.<br />And all the doubters will sink with them.<br />Good night and God  Bless,<br />Matt Perri, Pleasanton, CAu ask? Because STAR WARS is coming.  Everyone took their eyes off it because of TITANIC. It ain't happening  again.

6305265488|5.0|I saw this flick last summer with one of my friends and it was one of te best movies i've seen in a while.  The costumes and the plot are exceptional.  I have been anticipating its release on video for about half  of a year. This is definitely a great movie to buy.
0783227256|1.0|well the acting was good, the production was good.  but what makes it bad.  the fact it was very historically  unreliable.  obviously they didn't really research their story well enough.  they just wanted to make a movie  that told this story.  some people wondered, why did this movie didn't get  nominated for best picture.  well, duh!!!
6302732778|3.0|&quot;One of the best sci-fi movies ever made.  Doesn't possess the same themes as the original novel (aka my 'Jurasic Park' theory of book adaptations) by author Philip K. Dick, 'Do Androids dream of Electronic  Sheep?' but it is great all the same.  Theme of: 'What is it that truely  makes us human?' is timeless.  Great art design and futuristic vision of  the heights and depths of what humanity is possible of achieving (space  exploration vs. the creation of a slave race).  Original version with  voice-over narration is better.  Why?  Because the character speaks with  his own voice (HELLO SHAKESPEAREIAN DEVICES--Yeah William I think it ***** that we get a glimps into Hamlet's psyche)!  I wish they would bring the  original back on video for sale because I missed buying it while it was out  in stores (stupidity on my part)!  One of Rutger Hauer's best roles in a  sci-fi movie ('The Blood of Heroes' is a great one too) as the  android-replicant 'Batty.'  I like the widescreen feel of the Director's  Cut but only 3 stars because of what else was cut out.  A definite 5 stars  for the original even with the different themes that are stressed in the  movie than the in novel.&quot;
630518299X|5.0|This is by far the best movie of the year. The originality of the story is amazing and Carrey's subdued acting is a sure oscar bet.    I love the story of a man who realizes the danger of his &quot;safe&quot; existence  and breaks free to find his true love.
6305169187|5.0|i know, implausable. i don't care. this movie had awesome actors, great special effects, and in all seriousness, i didn't find it SO implausable that i couldn't bear to watch. Ben Affleck, Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thorton  and Steve Buschemi all turn in stellar performances. This movie will make  you laugh, it'll make you cry, it'll just WOW you!!!!

B000002GEY|5.0|If you are new to Supertramp, this is the album to start with. It shows the individual band members' talents, and results in a synergy that is better than all of the individual parts.<br />Even today this album communicates the timeless inner struggles of everyone: Growing up, Leaving a loved one, Aging, Personal Hardship, and Relationships.<br />The entire album can be summed up from a line in \\"Long way Home:\\" '(Do you) Does it feel that your life's become a catastrophe? Well it has to be, for you to grow, boy.'<br />Applicable to everyone at any time, anywhere.
1560541989|5.0|My college roommate introduced me to Goergette Heyer in the last semester of my senior year. . .and somehow I managed to graduate anyway.  That was 30 years ago and I collected all her Regencies in paperback and reread them  all every few years.  Cotillion is my favorite of many favorites.  I still  remember when I got to the point I was rooting for Freddy.  .  .and feeling  guilty about it becasue he was NOT the proper hero of a Regency book.   Georgette is great.  Now I have a fourteen year old daughter to whom I am  introducing these most witty and well written of books. . . and I find my  collection is musty smelling and the bindings decaying.  So, so I can share  them with my granddaughters (the ones I hope to have years from now), I  will be building my collection of Georgettes in hardback as I can. . .Thank  you, Amazon.com., for making that a possiblity for me.
B000001FN3|4.0|Unfortunately, APP declined with each album after this first one. Reminded me of the days before any band meets commercialism. The Tell-Tale Heart is chilling!, and along with the gloomy setting of The House of Usher, the mood is well-set, just as Poe would have it. Tales of Mystery captured Edgar Allen Poe's mind well, but the group never seemed to find sufficient motivation since (aside from the gambling theme in Friendly Card; and the women theme in Eve - pretty close). A sequel would be most welcomed! And Edgar would be impressed, maybe. If all else fails, perhaps a Mark Twain theme - imagine the commercialism there!
6305265666|5.0|Drew barrymore is the best Cinderella ever.  She is brilliant, heartwarming and intrepid.  It is a must see for the hole family!!!!!
6305252521|5.0|I think that The Truman Show is Jim Carrey's best performance yet! He maintains amazing &quot;self control&quot; in not talking out of his @$$, and give this film four stars, two thumbs up, and the displays the best  acting skills of his career. I award for best movie of the year. Kudos to  Jim for his breakthrough into drama.
0062511408|5.0|This story is very interesting and also inspires me how to face everyday's life. and how to face myself truely.
630021463X|5.0|The first time I saw this movie, I didn't like its distracting late-eighties setting, but when I viewed it again several years later... I began to appreciate its humor. My favorite visual stills: Spock's crossing  a San Franciscan street and his flowing Vulcan robe's graceful accentuation  of his long-limbed movement; his little dip with the whales in Alameda; and  the lovely sequence of Spock's rendering unconscious a particularly  abrasive punk on the BART with his Vulcan neck pinch. If you are a Spock  fan, you'll love this film, where his nascent memory restoration gives his  character a frustrating but adorable naivete, and where one gets a rare,  more three dimensional peek at how the other members of the Enterprise  function when they are AWAY from the inflated, eclipsing presence of  William Shatner (Mr. Creosote's mental twin?).  Even if you're not a  trekkie, I think you will enjoy this film for its lack of esoteric trek  culture and technobabble (despite Shatner's titanic ego, which mushrooms in  all things trek anyway). Star Trek IV: the Voyage Home is a thoroughly  entertaining experience with an ethical message too: save the whales to  prevent apocalypse.<br />Lulu Hansen
0393312836|5.0|Beyond the philosophical issues around senseless violence, Burgess' narrative is extraordinary.  This is one of the very few real page-turner  book I've ever read, not so much for the plot itself but because of the way  the story is narrated. <br />I have found that the special &quot;slang&quot;  language used by Burgess is an essential part of the atmosphere created by  the book.  <br />This is literature at its best and cannot be absent in any  bookshelf.
B00000DGUM|3.0|I'll agree with the &quot;Forty Seasons&quot; part of this title.  It is a good representation of ten years of work by Skid Row.  The &quot;Best of Skid Row&quot; part is debatable in my opinion.  They include a lot but not  all of their hits.  Then they got creative, which I personally found to be  a mistake.  The definition of &quot;Remix&quot; appears to be &quot;turn  the bass way up&quot;.  It doesn't do anything for the songs, except make  them thump too much.  The live cut doesn't cut it.  They'd have been better  off just putting in the original version.  The previously unreleased  material is good, but, they are songs that didn't make the original albums,  so enough said there.  The &quot;Demo's&quot; in place of the original  version of songs are certainly not superior.  Overall, if you're one of  those fans that just has to have the entire collection then it's a good  investment.  If you like Skid Row but don't want to buy their other three  albums, you just want an overview, then this is a good investment.  For my  money, I think I would rather buy &quot;Skid Row&quot;, &quot;Slave to the  Grind&quot;, &quot;Subhuman Race&quot;, and Sebastian Bach's (Skid Row's  singer) new solo album &quot;Bring 'Em Bach Alive&quot;.  I rate the album  three stars based on the overall effect.  The vocals are great.  The  presentation isn't as good as it could be.  It is just a very average sort  of effort from a band that was capable of much better.
630518299X|5.0|I loved this movie, lots of people said it was ok, but I think that's because they didn't know what was going on.  I felt so sorry for Truman, I keep on imaginig how it must be if I was in his position.  I thought it was  so mean and horrible to have your life made for you.
0316152196|4.0|The scenario is somewhat contrived.  Post-Rodney King-OJ LA faced with a brutal murder of a prominent black attorney whose claim to fame is suing LA cops.  Oooh, see potential for problems here?  Fortunately, this story has  more twists and turns than you can count, and the result is anything but  predictable.  Only two minor quibbles keep this from getting 5 stars.   First, when using internet sites, you don't &quot;double click.&quot;  The  other has to do with certain passages where the writing was kind of  awkward.  Still, I'd recommend this book to anyone who likes a good  adventure.
6304458304|4.0|Rex Stewart Movie Review: In the Line of Fire<br />During my first viewing, I was not overwhelmed by any aspect of the movie.  But about 1/3 of the way through it hit me that every aspect of the movie was excellent.   <br />Director: 7/10  Wolfie does a great job of maintaining the drama.  The  pace is maintained.  The movie is exciting, but a relatively smooth sine  wave.   Leading Actor: 8/10 I really like Clint Eastwood.  For 36 years  now. Supporting Actor: John Malkovich.  Perfect.  An ideal role and a  superb job.  Best of the Year Nomination:  9/10.  Like women, its hard to  give out a 10, but if ever there was one Malkovich deserves consideration  for a 10. Leading Actress: Rene Russo.   Unfortunately, I fall In Lust with  most leading ladies and Rene Russo was no exception.  Very Good job. Great  demeanor.  Its hard to believe there are women that nice and compassionate  in the Secret Service.  7/10. Music:  Excellent support for Petersen's  control of the drama. I fell in love with the hard symphonic string trills  in The Untouchables, and they carry on nicely here.  6/10.<br />Movie Rating:  **** Even the critics can be wrong,  Rex Stewart<br />Rex Stewart rating Scale  Overall movie rating:  0 Not worth watching 1 Worth watching once.   Assuming $1 rental on a slow Sunday afternoon.  2*  Better than a down time  watch.  3*  Worth a full price theatre ticket.  4*  An excellent movie.  Worthy of purchase or multilpe rentals over several years.  5*   Blockbuster.  Overwhelming.  Would own the movie and watch it for a  lifetime.<br />Other movie aspects:  5/10  Meets expectations for the movie as  I believe it is projected.
0783223218|2.0|Rex Stewart Movie Review:  Jackal This is a great story line, poorly executed.  During my first viewing, I was not impressed  by any aspect of the movie, except its potential to be a great movie.   The story line has  resulted in a Line of Fire wanna-be.  Pro's:  Best Gun this  decade.<br />Director: 3/10  The Director really falls down in what could have  been a great movie.  I do not know all of the limitations imposed, but  clearly he had the budget for a great cast of characters. He does a poor  job of maintaining the drama.  The pace is maintained.  The movie is  reasonably exciting, but a relatively smooth sine wave.  I am surprised  that in the light of the poor writing and directing the Director did not  resort to more violence and high impact theatrics.  After all, he does have  the best gun of the decade. The Director and writers fail to generate  empathy for the protagonist, a common failing of potentially great movies.   (see Indochine).  Leading Actor: 4/10 I really like Bruce Willis, but he  was mis-cast and mis-written for the part. The character just is not the  Jackal.  (See John Malkovich,  Line of Fire).  Supporting Actor: Richard  Gere. I think I would like R. Gere if I met him (and lord knows he is a  heart throb, for some), but I am rarely impressed by his acting.   5/10.<br />Movie Rating: **  It is very watchable, and I could watch it again  without complaint, but it does not live up to its potential. Even the  critics can be wrong,  Rex Stewart<br />Rex Stewart rating Scale Overall movie  rating:  0 Not worth watching 1 Worth watching once.

6304913176|5.0|The best Sci-fi - Action movie ever made. Combines the two genres perfectly. My personal favorite.
6303921248|5.0|An excellent movie!  Jane Austin fans will love how this film closely follows the novel.  And movie buffs will love the romance and comedy.  Fun for all....
0451525884|4.0|Anyone who has ever abandoned a first impression of another for quite an opposite assessment of the person... or had a disingenuous &quot;friend&quot;...  or been mortified by a parent's behavior in front of  someone whose opinion mattered... or had a wanton and unrepentant  sibling... or been able to lay bear to an object of affection the true  meaning of all of the crossed signals and misunderstandings that occurred  up until that point...  To any such persons (and several more), Austen's  novel, though nearly two hundred years old, will surely ring true.  As in  most any romantic comedy, there is not much question of the couple(s!)  getting together in the end, but it's the getting there--and, of course,  the revelation of it all in the end--that is the fun.
6303109950|5.0|I must say that the cinematography was the best part of this film, aside from Val Kilmer's performance as Doc Holliday. The acting is so-so, but the character development makes this the one and only western I could watch  over and over. I'm not the only one repeating Kilmer's lines. After all,  Val can be my &quot;huckleberry&quot; anytime!
B000002UJQ|5.0|Unlike a lot of albums, OK Computer is consistently wonderful.  Every song is a great big journey.  Unlike most albums, there are no bad songs here.  The entire album is just amazing.  Zen.  Every superlative ever.
079073639X|4.0|I thought I would never see this movie because of the reviews when it was out but I recently saw it on DVD and I have to say that I was surprised. The story was quite good, though I can't compare it to the book since it's  one of the few of his I haven't read, and the effects were incredible. Heck  I was generally jumping in a few spots. What I initially thought to be  another Event Horizon (which is a horrible movie) was actually thought  provoking about what man would do if he were given the power to anything. I  keep hearing that the movie is a waste of talent and I have to totally  disagree. The movie left me thinking and the ending of the movie is the  perfect way to end. It stays faithful to the book, a friend says, and  though a lot of the book had to be cut it still makes a good movie. <br />Now,  the movie has flaws - characters who aren't even one dimensional and few  confusing points - but it makes a great saturday night movie. The three  principals are very good and production values were very high. I recommend  this movie. <br />Plus if you have the nice set up, the DVD sounds amazing and  looks fantastic.<br />I say hunker down on a saturday night and grab some  friends and some popcorn and enjoy.

B0000021RD|5.0|Chicago has been one of the premier rock groups to successfully and ardently combine classical rhetoric with the rock music of the day.  Never tiring of their long success in the music world, as a child I would wait  anxiously for the next &quot;numbered&quot; album and would never be  disappointed.  I played trumpet in high school and would and could easily  play along with them, especially in their 2nd album in West Virginia  Fantasies and Anxieties Moment, and easily did a transcription of their AM  Mourning and PM Mourning for brass and string as an orchestral project in  high school.  Chicago II is absolutely the best album ever put out by this  prolific group, as is evident in their highly rated Make Me Smile, 25 or 6  to 4 and Colour My World
B000002PC6|5.0|This is one of her greatest works. Ironically, the only song I bypass is Physical. Everything else is pure Olivia! This really showcases her range of styles. Anybody who likes this should DEFINATELY get &quot;Gaia&quot;.  It's even better (if that's possible)!
B00000F1D3|5.0|It amazes me how little respect Cher gets while at the same time she has had success in every outlet she has attempted.  Her voice is suited very well for this all dance album.  I always wondered why Cher hadn't done a  album of dance music as her voice fits this genre so well.  I loved  &quot;One by One&quot; &quot;Walking in Memphis&quot; &quot;Paradise is  Here&quot; and &quot;The Sun Aint Gonna Shine&quot; and was very much  looking forward to this project.  I am not disappointed!  But I do hope  they put &quot;Love is in the Air&quot; as a b side to one of the singles.
6303913881|3.0|From a technical standpoint, this movie is quite impressive -- great photography, great choreography, great sound, and gorgeous women.  But as far as being an accurate portrayal of what a showgirl¹s life is really  like, I feel it¹s a failure.  It gave me the feeling it was written by an  avid fan of this sort of entertainment, who was relying solely on  imagination and conjecture.  I realize I¹m on shaky ground here, being no  expert myself on what happens behind the scenes of the adult entertainment  business.  It just seemed like every twist and turn the plot took,  including the brutal rape sequence, left me feeling like I could have  imagined it myself.  There wasn¹t one detail that made me feel the least  bit enlightened.  Overall, this movie ends up being not much more than  another piece of adult entertainment itself, albeit an impressive one.
B000000W6X|5.0|A few of my friends always play Massive Attack, but since it was just background fuzz while we were hanging out, I decided to buy it to get a better feel for it.  I'm so glad I did.  This album is incredibly moody and  wonderfully rhythmic.  &quot;Three&quot; and &quot;Spy&quot; are 2 of my  favorites, however I could honestly do without the Doors cover tune...
0316920045|5.0|As an Ironworker I have come in contact with many of the people portrayed in this book.  As an artist I have met many of the people portrayed in this book.  As someone who has had his share of screwing up big time...it's in  the book.  The only book that says more about America is John Dos Passos'  &quot;U.S.A.&quot;, and that one's kinda got footnotes in it  too...coincidence or conspiracy?  Thanks for the story Dave.
B000009VOL|5.0|As I hear albums, the quality of a sit down listen is in fact the most appealing quality. &quot;Moon Pix&quot; sets the mood, and holds the listener, while the intellectually pleasing tone of Chan Marshall's voice  hold you captive at your own will.
0399143904|2.0|Let's start with a disclaimer - I am a huge Clancy fan. Debt of Honor was one of the best books I've ever read. I thought Cardinal of the Kremlin was the best espionage novel I'd ever seen.<br />So, here's the new Clancy novel.  It's huge, but that only makes me anticipate it more. More thrills, more  great technology, etc.<br />After finishing it, all I can say is - what a  disappointment. The Prolouge is vintage Clancy - greatness! From there, it  gets progressively slower and more implausible. The bad guys never seemed  as horrifying as I think Mr. Clancy intended. The good guys are a little  too super-human. And the last 150 pages made me feel completely ripped off.  I could not believe the magnitude of Clancy's cop-out.<br />Previous Clancy  misfires (most notably, Sum of All Fears) were still pretty good, just not  up to the usual Clancy standard. Rainbow Six is just bad. Please, Tom, take  a few years off and come back with stories that live up to your earlier  great works!

0399143904|1.0|Now that Clancy has made a name for himself he seems to be happy to pump out total pulp garbage.  This book is rife with political correctness and plot errors.  Who honestly believes that the weather in Sydney is 100  degrees and dry during the Summer Olympics?  Remember,  this is winter in  Australia.  The entire plot hinges on this ill-conceived notion.  To boot,   Clancy continues to show his total blind spot in subjects such as small  arms (don't even get me started on the subject of a supressed 10mm...),   high-technology and small unit tactics.  The book is entertaining from a  pure adrenaline standpoint,  however,  if you're looking for literary  fulfillment (or even a credible plot line),  look elsewhere.  Clancy's days  as a credible author were over after he wrote &quot;Debt of Honor&quot; and  he continues to prove this with every new book.
078401213X|5.0|give you my eyes in a jar. This is, by far, one of the best films of 1998, and, dare I say it, the latter part of this century. It blows the doors off just about everything coming out of Hollywood lately. Sure there are  influences of other films, books, stories-whatever-but EVERYTHING in this  world is influenced by one thing or another. Otherwise we would have no  homes, no boats, no planes, etc. This is a SMART film. This is a  BEAUTIFULLY shot film. The sountrack is excellent. And the acting is pretty  first-rate.  The ending is a little much, but that is not the point. This  is visionary cinema, pure and simple. Again, show me a better film done for  $60,000 or six million dollars, for that matter, and I will give you my  eyes in a jar. My hat is off to Aronofsky, cast and crew. Can't wait for  the next one. Thanks for the good time!
B000002MY3|5.0|I've listened to this cd every single day for three years, and I'm still not tired of it. Alanis has got a wondeful voice and great lyrics. She is the best! I can just say one thing; BUY IT! :) (and... buy SFIJ at the same  time, it's just as great.. :) )
B000002IWH|5.0|This CD has a very original mix of interesting music that combines the 90's instruements and style with a very Gothic undertone.  The actual songs fit with the movie and give a definite feeling to the movie and set a  specific mood.  Its a wonderful and intresting soundtrack.
B00000DGUG|5.0|I had quite high expectations when I bought SFIJ, 'cause I thought JLP was so great. I didn't get disapointed; I love SFIJ just as much as I love JLP... They are both great albums. :)
B000002Z71|5.0|When Gene Clark, the legendary singer-songwriter and founder of the Byrds, and Carla Olson, founder of the critically-acclaimed Textones, got together in 1987 to make a CD it was a pretty safe bet to say something special  would result.  It did. With Gene Clark contributing such beautiful, soulful  songs as &quot;Gypsy Rider&quot; and &quot;Why Did You Leave Me Today&quot;  to the project, and Carla Olson adding &quot;Every Angel In Heaven&quot;  and &quot;Are We Still Making Love,&quot; the result in this acoustic album  is nothing short of electric.  Their voices blend beautifully, the  instrumentation is artful, and the magic is palpable.  If you're looking  for acoustic folk music that plumbs the depths of love, loss and life,  you're looking for &quot;So Rebellious a Lover&quot;.

B000000H66|5.0|After fifteen years of being an avid Metal fan, I was unable to like or understand Death-Metal.  It took this album to finally let me &quot;cross the chasm&quot;.  The melodies are so beautiful that you initially don't  pay attention to the growling vocals.  Before you realize it, you start  liking the vocals as well!   A true masterpiece that belongs in every  respectable metal collection.

0790738147|5.0|LA Confidential takes us back to 1950's Hollywood and police corruption.  It also shows how gossip magazine writers would do whatever it took to get some juicy dirt on celebrities, politicians and police alike.  While  extremely violent, it is one of the most important works to come along in  years and it'd be great to see more of James Ellroy's books made into films  like this one.
6304698798|5.0|I agree with most of the other viewers.  I find the widescreen format of the DVD enhances one of my favorite movies, especially toward the end credits when Blondie is riding away into the &quot;vastness of the  West&quot;.  The clarity and brightness of the DVD transfer far surpasses  my old VHS tape.  The soundtrack is not Dolby Digital spactacular, but DD  wasn't available in 1967.  I found one of the seven additional scenes to be  important, but can still live without the other six.
6300215512|5.0|This is one of those classic Hollywood films to be seen more than once over the space of time.  Swanson &amp; Holden are superb in their roles, and watching &quot;Nora Desmond&quot; emote you can't help but smile and  realize how right on Carol Burnett's spoof of her character was on her tv  show! This movie is an unforgettable story and highly recommended.
630516603X|2.0|There's one critical piece of information missing on this video's description -- this is a remake (a very bad one at that) of Lord of the Dance. I thought Flatley had produced a brand new show; little did I know.  Having watched Lord of the Dance just a few months ago, the basic story  line and choreography was still fresh in my mind. As soon as the first  dancers came out on the stage I knew it looked familiar. Yes, the costumes  are new (I didn't say better), the set is bigger (I didn't say better  again), the music has been reworked, and the crowds are larger, but it is  still basically Lord of the Dance. What happened? He had a good thing going  and had to ruin it. I agree with others that this reminds me of a Las Vegas  review, not a program highlighting traditional Irish dancing. Flatley's a  good dancer, but has an ego that exceeds his talent. My recommendaton:  Don't waste your money. See River Dance, see Lord of the Dance, and stop  there.
B000002H1T|5.0|I cant help it, I am a addict to the cars and this album in particular. I grew up listening to the cars, and was 16 years old when this tape was available in my area. It recieved an enormous amount of play and quicly  surpassed lesser tapes in my collection concerning the amount of play.In  fact I was so affected, I purchased a '71 Duster 340 (the car on the album  cover) and still have a copy inserted in my dash's lexan cover. Needless to  say, I think this was the best album available during the day and would  reccomend it over their excellent greatest hits album.
6304109989|4.0|This unusual action movie is the first I've seen where the hero dies in the beginning.  The suspense is incredibly realistic and mesmerizing.  The characters actually act like real people would. There is nothing too far  fetched in this movie(Yes, I think the 747 boarding is plausible).  I loved  this movie because of its striking realism. The one flaw that I can see  would be the tolerance that the terrorist leader had for Halle Berry.
0156907399|1.0|Too much thought processing for my liking.  \\"Mrs. Ramsey thought...\\" or \\"...he thought...\\" gibberish makes my head spin.  Somewhere in this book, there is buried a story.  It just takes too long to find it and once you  do, it wasn't really worth the effort.

Based on the information given, this theory seems pretty sound.<br />I feel the last section, which gives examples to back up his theory, is a bit redundant.  Many of the  examples were mentioned in the explanation of the theory, and it seemed as  if every chapter started out &quot;Why did X conquer Y, instead of Y  conquering X?&quot;<br />The excellence and style of the first 2/3 make up for  the lag at the end, though.

6305265488|5.0|This has to be the cleanest movie of the decade.  Not including low budget films and made for TV movies.  I was very impressed w/the almost complete absence of foul language. There was not even a sexual insinuation  throughout the movie.  This movie shows us that you don't need to hear the  F Word and see nudity just to enjoy a film.  It was excellent, a definite  keeper.

0393312836|5.0|When I read this book, I surprisingly had little difficulty with the difficult language. Although Burgess used some pretty crazy words, the ideas he tried to convey jumped right off the page. The other day I flipped  through the pages, looking at the wacky wording and I wondered how on earth  I finished it.   I suggest renting the movie afterwards, because it is  perhaps stronger than the book - something I rarely see in literature.

The steak is there, but it lacks poetry.  Waters' solo  efforts are long on concept, but Gilmore's absence cannot be offset by even  the likes of Claypton or Beck.  There is something about the Gilmore/Waters  collaboration that transcends who they are individually.  They are strong  on their own, but to try to compare their work since the great Pink divide  is silly and unproductive...it's apples and oranges.<br />Amused To Death is  Waters' best solo work to date.  I know I'm writing this in 1999, but I  came here to re-order a copy since mine was swiped recently and thought I'd  throw my two cents in.  I have heard some critics say that the album is  cliche and offers no new thoughts.  I got news for you.  You find me any  artist with a truly ORIGINAL thought and I will eat my computer.  The art  is in the ORIGINAL TELLING of universal truths.  This album is Fine Art.   From top to bottom, I have yet to hear finer lyrics, aside from Peter  Gabriel's work (I stand by this even in 1999).  If Waters bites off a bit  more than he can chew, what comes up when he gags is head and shoulders  above anything else offered by  90% of other artists out there.  Listen to  it, and remember, what he's talking about isn't some abstract commentary  about life.  He is not being profound, he is warning us.  And for his  critics, I think the lyrics of &quot;The Bravery of Being Out of  Range,&quot; was written especially for you!
B000005B0U|5.0|I like it, it has som real funky pieces and range of artists from all different fields of the music industry both old and new.  Everything from Aretha Franklin to Erykah Badu and everything between.
0790737914|5.0|After I finally rented and watched this movie, I couldn't believe when I thought of the many times I had picked up and put it down at the video store.  I was engrossed from moment one.  Everyone in it is incredible, the  story is amazing.  Forget Leo and Kate, let's here it for Russell Crowe and  Kim Basinger.  5 stars and standing ovations over and over again.

0385015364|5.0|In ORTHODOXY, Chesterton provides somewhat of a spiritual autobiography for the reader, weaving together his eloquent writing style with his brilliant Christian apologetics. This book challenges the mind, while  arousing a sense of wonder that truly captures the deep spirituality of  G.K. Chesterton's own pilgrimage. He explores the realm of mystery in the  Orthodox view, while engaging the tradition that it encompasses,  transforming it from a safe haven of believe to a rich &quot;romance&quot;  of faith and uncertainty. The attentive reader will have difficulty putting  this book down.
B0000024JN|1.0|I bloody hate this.  It's...noise.  Not pleasant to hear.  My obnoxious roommate is constantly playing this shit, and it makes me want to assume a fetal position and start screaming.  Not for people who like good music...
B000002C1Z|5.0|DOGS is maybe the best PF song ever made, only comparable to &quot;Shine on you crazy diamond&quot; from Wish you were here. But the entire CD is not so...  I would say... enjoyable as Wish you were here, Meddle, and of  course, Dark side. Get these first.
B00000DMJF|1.0|One star in terms of this actual version, not the content of the album, which gets five stars. This CD is NOT remastered, and I wonder if those who think it sounds &quot;better&quot; are really listening. The CDs are  actually IDENTICAL to the regular CD version, drop-outs and all. It  unquestionably comes from the same source. Capitol/EMI either messed up, or  they are lying big time. For example, listen to While My Guitar Gently  Weeps on the 1967-1970 CD, and compare it to the regular White Album CD.  The 67-70 set is remastered - Sounds beautiful, and better than the White  Album version! Now compare the same song on the Regular White Album to the  Remastered White Album. They're identical! So...if you already have the  White Album DO NOT waste your money on this issue. <br />If CAPITOL/EMI were  smarter than cattle, they would have released the MONO edition of this  ablum which is highly sought after due to all of the differences it  contains.

0792833201|5.0|POLTERGEIST was the first DVD I bought with my player.  It was exciting to see this old film in its widescreen format, and digitally remastered.<br />Even though the movie was released 17 years ago, it still  hasn't given up any of its spectacular special effects or bone-chilling  storyline.  I don't think anyone could honestly say that clown scene didn't  scare the heebie-jeebies out of them!<br />Poltergeist was unique in that it  contained a certain sci-fi element inside its main plot of restless ghosts  haunting an innocent family's home.  There hasn't even been an X-Files  episode on the paranormal that was quite as captivating as this  movie.<br />Rent or buy Poltergeist on DVD (or VHS, if you must).  You won't  be disappointed!
B000002UAO|5.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this CD!!  It has some of my very favorite Beatles songs on it.  &quot;Drive My Car&quot; is close to being my favorite Beatles song ever.  All the songs belong on the album, there isnt  one that isnt a great song!!  I  also love the song &quot;In My Life&quot;   it is a poigniant song considering it mirrors the feelings that everyone  feels about John Lennon's murder.  I cannot say enough about this album, it  just showed everyone who thought back then that the  Beatles were NOT just  some passing fad....but they were the turning point of music...they changed  music forever.....and Rubber Soul helped them to do that!! I know Iconsider  myself  lucky to listen to such GREAT music!!!!!

6302878527|5.0|I first viewed this film as a sixteen year old who had taken her grandmother to the movies on a Sunday afternoon.  It has stayed with me for years.  Later on, during a stressful period, It as re-released in theaters  and after years of watcing the video on Saturday night, I again experienced  this film in a Greenwich Village theater.  It was a dual show with Marion  and Robin (Hepburn and Connery).<br />There was not a dry eye in the house.   The format by Donan is sparkling, mystifying and magical.  The dialogue is  witty, whimsical and very entertaining.  The scenery alone is worth  viewing. (The film is shot mainly in France). If you are young at heart and  wish to remember what early love, as well as years of marriage mean, view  this film.
0783228600|5.0|For thousands of years I have never seen the reason for water. One day, millions of empty spaces fight with each other, vying for a spot next to Depp. How can they ? Very easily. We follow Depp any of eight possible  combinations around, under, to the sides - never through. Azure greens melt  from dripping frozen charcoal blue, nah only joking. Made you look hahaha.  If I met Depp, would I elude him ? possibly. Would I dance a dainty tango,  probably. Would I skip ? without doubt. Jabby jabby jabby, with sharp  pillows for a month.

6305127638|5.0|I've read the other reviews from other who have purchased this DVD, and I think overall the operative phrase is: &quot;Suspend your belief for a few hours and enjoy the film.&quot;  Going to the movies, in general, is to get  out of reality for a little while and to be first and formost entertained.   If you can leave the theater inspired, then you received an extra added and  possibly an unexpected bonus.  Until Insurrection, this was my favorite of  all the previous installments of Star Trek.  True, I believe there were a  couple of duds, but for the most part the film makers have stayed true to  the genre.  First contact has everything that that makes Star Trek, Star  Trek.  A plausible story line (granted the technology is impossible, but  isn't most sci-fi?), action, suspense, appropriate comedy, and of course  the special effects to make everthing believable.  Star Trek fans will not  be disappointed.  I purchased the video in VHS format, but still purchased  it in DVD after I acquired a DVD-rom.  The DVD format has alot of bonuses  that the other formats do not have, making this Star Trek on DVD a treat to  own.
B000002UAI|5.0|The Beatles' best work? No. Better than work by anybody else at the time? Yes. The Beatles were the masters of rock music, always. Here they display their virtuosity yet again with a superb series of originals (No Reply, I'm  A Loser, Baby's In Black, I Don't Want to Spoil the Party, Every Little  Thing, Eight Days a Week) and covers (This one-take wonder version on  Rockn'Roll Music is better than the Berry original, which is saying  something.) In short, if you like good rockn'roll, this is for you.
B000002GBK|5.0|This is one of Wakeman's better albums, and it is also one of my favorite albums in general.  As one would expect of him, Rick plays a lot of different keyboard instruments on this album (Moog Synthesizer, Grand  Piano, Harpsichord, etc.) so you get a lot of accoustic and electronic  tambres.  This effect is enhanced by his use of a rock band with solo  vocalists along with a male choral group, a full choir, and a full  orchestra.  This amitious project worked out really well.  There are  recuring musical themes both instrumental and a capella, as well as the  full ensemble passages.  There are many a moment on this album which sent  chills down my spine; this was due to the exiting and moving music, but  also because there is much drama in the lyrics as well.  The  &quot;Guenevere&quot; song would bring any sentimental soul to tears.   &quot;Merlin the Magician&quot; begins and ends with a small male a capella  choral group, but the real fire is the instrumental movement in between.   The music gets really sinister and exiting with screaming Moog lines  accented with demonic-sounding decending piano passages.  I don't even know  why I'm trying to describe this album, because it really needs to be heard  rather than talked about.  I would recomend it to anyone who is into  Arthurian tales, anyone who likes grand rock music, or maybe even an  open-minded classical music fan who is willing to try orchestral/operatic  rock.
B000001ABD|2.0|The Stevie Wonder of the early 70s was a true innovator and musical genius.  The post-&quot;Hotter Than July&quot; Stevie Wonder turned out far too much MOR and soundtrack pablum.  Unfortunately this set relies too  heavily on his 80s and 90s output.  Skip it and buy a copy of  &quot;Innervisions&quot;

6301334523|5.0|The leading actors are all magnificent in this diabolic plot that is created for the pleasures given by revenge and to obtain redress, and most of all is the result of vanity and a desperate longing for absolute power.  The drama that is produced in front of us with such beauty and ease shows  of an amount of cruelty that is matchless. The two main characters of Glenn  Close and John Malkovich sets of a series of events that is not only to  devastate the lifes of others, but ultimately to destroy their own.  All  because of their refusal to see clearly what emotions they are driven by  and the nature of their desires. Finally, Michelle Pfeiffer has never been  more radiant. With her fragile and restrained appearance that hides  remarkable strength and courage to overcome that fragility she was born to  play the part of Mme de Tourvel whose passionate heart becomes her ruin.
6302914213|5.0|After I had watched Fire walk with me, I got up from the sofa and sayed to myself, is it really possible to make something that good ? Off cause, it's David Lynch we are talking about. So I barrowed the series and at the end  of episode 29 I was convinced, David Lynch is the greatest director ever  and Kyle Maclachlan is one of Hollywoods best actors.
B0000025SB|4.0|I have to admit that I was prepared not to like The Final Cut -- particularly after the way it was downplayed by the critics and the record company (&quot;every one else is just green?&quot;).  But after giving it  several listens, the Lp grows on you.  Dave provides a little  &quot;musical&quot; backdrop which gives this work a little musical  quality.  Roger mopes and whines but mostly jabs &quot;Maggie&quot; and the  warmongers right where it hurts most.   And, Not Now John is a rockin  classic -- although the only true rocker on the Lp.  Get it and don't let  the downbeat drag you down like a stone.  It's a helluva lot better than  Roger solo.
B000007OY0|5.0|I would indicate this movie for everybody who is disencouraged or wants to see how powerfull the human being can be in turning what they believe real or simply making their dreams come true! It is maybe not enough but  anyways...I wanna say that this movie is probably the best I have ever  watched! If u liked to please mail me and we can share thought about this  historical history!

6304712936|1.0|I live in france and the only solution i had to have this film was to buy the Zone 1 version. U couldn't imagine how deep my deception was. It was impossible to focus, the picture seems to be filtred like in the worse  david Hamilton's film. To complete, the disc is two sided and nothing aware  you at the end of the first side. I suggest you to buy the CD and to close  your eyes to see the film
0790739917|1.0|From the lovely people who have conned you for years, comes another reduction of an international film scaled down to easily consumed bites by the people who hate you.  Wim Wenders masterpiece &quot;Wings of  Desire&quot; has been re-made.  Why not?  Gus has re-made  &quot;Psycho&quot; and I've heard Bergman's greats are under revision as  well.  Has Hollywood finally become this pathetic?  Surprise!  History has  always been written by the most underhanded and greedy.  &quot; Wings of  Desire&quot; was the upside to the only slightly less successful &quot;Far  Away, So Close&quot;.  The upside, of course, is always more profitable.   With the success of the inhumane series &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;,  certain suits saw Wender's international hit as an idiot's goldmine.  The  stars are redundant.  Box-office ecstasy!  There is only a skeleton here of  the ORIGINAL, as angels and humans alike deal with more &quot;carnal&quot;  concerns.  Unfortunately, the only telling critique I can give is to  compare it to the original(and the sequal), but subtitles are so hard to  read.  Maybe it is best, after all, to swallow.  (By the way, 1 star is the  lowest I am allowed to give).
6305252521|5.0|absolutely fantastic, the best film since Top Gun the story line keeps you glued to your seat as the idea is totally original. Just think of it a world following your life...watching you live,sleep,work play and even the  X rated scenes ! (not in my liking, but it could happen) Carrey is  excellent, even better than The Mask. A must buy
0385493800|3.0|One of the world's richest men dies leaving an estate of a mind-boggling amount.  This is the start of the latest John Grisham, so I expected an assassination or two to occur before divvying up the money.  Not so.     It is a more serious but nevertheless entertaining mixture.  Its plot  encompasses the following themes.  Disgraceful behaviour of second  generations of wealthy entrepreneurs.  A look at the awful treatment by the  entire Americas of native people.  Harshness of missionary work.  Power of  prayer.  Crassness of large greedy law firms.  How money influences many  professionals giving testimony.  Shady legal practices when deposing  potential witnesses.   At its heart is Brazil's Indian Affair's Agency.   An investigation in 1967 revealed that it distributed smallpox and  tuberculosis germ-.infected clothing to the Indians.  Deadly bacteria fell  over their villages, dropped from planes and helicopters.  In 1990,  different but still deadly practices continue, and go unpunished.    Grisham drops on us a collection of unforgettable characters.  I found  myself casting the inevitable movie as I went through the book.  Tom Hanks  as the suicidal alcoholic lawyer, Nate O'Riley.  He may be the only one who  can get justice done in the estate case under challenge by dozens of  greedy, lazy, relatives, (and greedy, though hard working, lawyers.)  Jody  Foster as the altruistic missionary who has set aside worldly things to  play a useful role in the world, placing herself in danger.  Michael  Douglas as Josh Stafford, head lawyer and Jack Lemon as the Judge.   Troy Phelan who amassed power of almost fantasy proportions knows his end  is around the corner.  He seeks a way to die in a spectacular manner.  One  that in itself makes headlines, and one whose other ramifications through  his various wills causes an earthquake amongst his unattractive relatives.   Perhaps though, in the end he hopes it will result in doing good for the  world.  It has only a slim chance.  Still, when you are dead, can you be  accused of taking slim chances?   Grisham's new book has wide appeal.
6303332609|4.0|When I saw the title, I was expecting not to be too entertained.  But I was pleasantly surprised.  I loved it and I shared it with a few friends and  they loved it too.  Don't let the title fool you--Killer Klowns from  Outer Space is a must see.
B000002H70|5.0|Ignore anything negative you read about Disintegration. Simply put, it is quite possibly the most intelligent and beautiful collection of songs in the history of rock. Robert Smith's heartfelt lyrics and emotional voice  will reach your soul. Perfect.
0790705141|5.0|With a haunting musical score and superb/sometimes over the top performances this film is the prototype for both Stephen King and Jack Nicholson fans! The most memorable scene for me will always be the  staircase scene in which Jack reveals his insanity to his wife (brlliantly  played by Shelly Duvall) and the camera work ascending up the stairs.
B000002B49|4.0|Deep Forest has a haunting, yet enchanting sound.  The first half of the cd is great for dance warm-up and stretching.  The second half is soft and easy.  The beat will keep you listening and wanting more.  The most  memorable lyrics?? ...DipDip aah-ahh DipDip.  =) It's da bomb!!!
0399143904|3.0|Bottom line: if you like Clancy's previous works, you'll like this one as well.  No, it isn't his best work, and yes it is a bit repetitive at times.  And I'll leave the realism of the plot to others more technically  qualified than I.  But as a generally believable and suspenseful work of  fiction, Rainbow Six succeeds.  A good, if not quite great read.  The only  question remaining for Clancy fans may be: where can he take the series  from here?
0792151712|5.0|The problem is that everyone got so sick of this movie that they ended up hating it.  After going to the theatres for the 2nd viewing, all you could do was but fidgit and find something to munch on to pass time.  TITANIC  isn't really overrated, just over commericalized and over seen by the  public, that's all.<br />Maybe in a year or two I'll actually spend some time  and watch this video, and I expect it to be a new and fresh experience.
B00000FCBC|5.0|If your an old fan, like me, who has felt continuous let down in recent years, try this one.  Disc One contains new recordings of cover tunes and Disc Two contains remastered old recordings of covers.  There are no  originals here, but considering the sound of Load and ReLOAD, that may be a  good thing.<br />The new covers sound great:  The heavier stuff has the Master  of Puppets-type guitar sound; and Hetfield even has his old voice back in  places!  Some of his vocals sound electronically pitch-corrected but who  cares?  I wish they pitch-corrected him on the Cunning Stunts DVD!<br />Some  may object to the slower stuff covered, but I think most of it is good if  listened to with an open mind.<br />Disc Two contains covers you may already  own if you bought the singles or Garage Days Re-Revisted.  Considering the  lame quality of cassette singles, though, most should be glad to replace  their cassettes with this one CD.<br />The sound quality is suprisingly good,  too.  Sounds better than anything they've done since after The Black  Album.<br />I really enjoyed this CD set.  I hope the band learned something  about being FUN from all this.
0800141326|1.0|Gee, this movie sure was pitiful.  Not only was the lizard unrealistic looking, it was the typical average unimaginative green thing with mega fingernails.  Where's the creativity?  As usual, remakes of old  masterpieces flop, and this is a prime example.
6305205620|3.0|If you want to be wowed by your home theater's sound abilities, check this one out and play it LOUD! Sub-woofer required.  Don't bother with it, though, if you only have a mono TV with VHS.  While the sound QUALITY is  great, the band's performance (read: vocals) is terrible.  We've all  witnessed Hetfield's voice being reduced from a great roar to a pathetic  yelp in recent years.  Cunning Stunts shows him at a new low:  Yelping off  key!  Really, any drunk at a karoke bar could sing Hero of the Day better  than this.  They need a new singer.  What a shame, too, because the rest of  the band is so &quot;on&quot;.  I deducted one star for this.  The second  star deducted was for the boring set-list.  Aside from an early version of  Fuel, this is the same old stuff Metallica fans have already heard too many  times.  How about Phantom Lord or Escape... and SING IT RIGHT!

0790734249|5.0|The best movie chronicling the life of a composer I have seen to date. Except, the storyline involving Salieri's connection to Mozart's death, isn't exactly factual, it was clever to assume so.  Tom Hulce as Mozart  gives a breathtaking performance. He becomes the character. I loved his  crazy laugh! This is definitely a movie to see - it was quite epic for me.

0670880728|5.0|Bridget Jones'Diary was one of the most entertaining novels I've ever read.  I didn't find a &quot;deeper meaning&quot; in all of Bridget's escapades...but she surely did entertain me.  After reading this book, I  realized I'm not so insane after all.  I would be reading a particularly  funny excerpt, and begin to laugh out loud.  My curious husband would ask  me what I was laughing at....&quot;Oh, Bridget just showed up at a party  wearing a bunny tail, that's all!&quot;  He couldn't understand what I  found so entertaining about this girl.  Basically, I like her because she  was so close to being like every woman....wanting everything, a  husband, a  job, children, a social life, a sex life....but having no clue why, or how  to get it.<br />This was a very fun book.
B000005HCM|5.0|The great songs and artists can only be judged by their ability to stand up to the whims of time.  Sidewinder is a classic song and this disc is filled with crisp renditions that are as exciting now as when I heard them  35 years ago.  Anyone who likes jazz needs to have this album.  The only  downer: having two takes of Totem Pole in a row.  Although, I admit I  didn't notice it until the third time playing the disc.  Big, Fat sound.  This isn't for romancing, this is for jivin'.  If you are new to Jazz, this  disc will set you on the right track for figuring out who is good and who  was just lucky enough to make a record.
6305165912|5.0|this dvd is actually region 0 and can be viewed in *any* country in the world (confirmed on iMDb and my copy of this disc bought from amazon plays fine on a region 2 only player). a splendid movie, too.
078322608X|5.0|I waited so long to get this and I don't know why?  It's great!  A beautiful DVD transfer.<br />If you love Gilliam's films then you probably already have this.

B000003NA4|5.0|I was watching late night TV and came across the very end of the Monterey Jazz Festival on PBS. I only caught the last act, and man, am I glad I did! Although I did not know who she was at the time, Diana was on stage dressed in a black pant suit with only her bassist and guitarist on the tremedous stage. From the first note I heard, I was hooked! Her silky smooth voice with rough shadings entranced me as I listend through &quot;Peel Me a Grape&quot; and &quot;Can't Take That Away From Me.&quot; I bought the album just the other day and the entire disc delivers with the same seductive, and often times lively, sexy melodies. I wasn't familiar with all of the tunes, but after looking at the composers and copyright dates, I was amazed that she could make such old standards sound like they were written just for her. You'd be a fool to not buy this disk.

0684874350|5.0|The author recalls his boyhood of poverty in New York and Ireland. Having suffered through an alcoholic father, frequent moves, siblings' deaths, illness, and near-starvation, McCourt conveys the waeriness that a family  in such a desperate situation often feels.  He tells his family's story  with love, humor, and a child's sense of wonder.  Even though the narrative  is sad, it doesn't evoke pity or tears.  It's an uplifting story told with  great warmth.  What does come through, however, is a pervasive sense of  McCourt's shame and the insensitivity of more fortunate people to those  less fortunate.
B000002JPA|5.0|I bought this album after only hearing one song, &quot;Pull Me Under,&quot; on MTVs Headbanger's Ball (remember that show?).  It was one of the best things I could've done.  This album is so incredibly  breathtaking-- just listen to ANY of the musicians' parts and then hear how  they mesh together-- simply amazing.  I saw Dream Theater a year ago in  D.C., and I was even more impressed listening to them jam in person.  BUY  THIS ALBUM... NOW!
6300183483|4.0|29. THE LAST STARFIGHTER (SCI-fiction, 1984) For young Alex Rogan (Lance Guest) living in a trailer park is boring. He wants to escape from his rural existence and go to the city where he hopes to go to College. Bot for  his girlfriend Annie (Catherine Mary Stewart) the prospect of leaving her  grandmother behind is hard. Alex's only real excitement is playing a video  game called 'Last Starfighter', having played it so many times that he  finally breaks the game's points record. Soon after he's visited by a  friendly alien power. They want to recruit him as one of their elite  'Starfighters' in an inter-galactic war where his skills will prove the  turning point. Here he finds an unexpected chance to finally break free and  follow his dreams. But will Annie join him?<br />Critique: The Star Wars  phenomenon inspired a slew of science fiction films in its heyday that,  surprisingly enough, has continued to this day. Although the 80s produced  its share of memorable films, this is one of the most appealing of the  bunch. Capturing the youthful exuberance and innocence that made the Star  Wars fantasy a worldwide smash. The 'once upon story' line works from the  disillusioned, dreamy nature of those kids whose earthly existence leave  much to be desired. Wishing they could be whisked away to another galaxy,  and take part in some far-off adventure. An added bonus to the film is the  pairing of the 2 young leads. Exacting the warmth and amazement of  encountering such a journey, and taking their love to the infinite reaches  of space.
B000002C1Z|5.0|I own about 10 Pink Floyd albums, and &quot;Animals&quot; was bought in the middle somewhere between &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; and &quot;The Final Cut.&quot;  However, it is my definite favorite, even though there  are only about 5 songs.  I've never heard Gilmour play better than he does  on &quot;Dogs,&quot; and I love the political undertones of the entire  album.  If you like &quot;WYWH&quot; and &quot;TFC,&quot; invest in  &quot;Animals&quot; -- you'll love it.
B000001GQQ|5.0|Argerich astonishes me with her musicality, clarity, and technical facility. The rapid runs in the Prokofieff are fun to listen to and her Ravel is both playful and beautiful (especially the second movement). She  plays the Gaspard de la Nuit better than I've ever heard it, bringing out  the nuances in pieces that consist of continuous notes. The recording  itself is wonderful, and is essentially indistinguishable from a digitally  mastered one.
0780622553|5.0|This movie, although criticized by many, is one of the best I've seen in years.  Go figure why I never saw advertisement on it!!<br />This is a masterpiece of sci-fi.  After watching that movie, you'll start wondering.   It makes you think quite a lot and leaves you with a puzzled mind.<br />The  quality of the images and the angles and camera views are astonishing.  It  is really the same director as &quot;The Crow&quot;.  It contains the same  new kind of camera view that I like.  If you like the DARK and underground  sci-fi, this is a DEFINITE MUST SEE!!!!<br />I sent 3 copies of this DVD to  friends.  Just to show you how impressed I was.  And Shuterland is really  good as the doctor.
B00000ADG2|5.0|This girl has got it going on. Her music offers you beautiful lyrics, and beats. Everyone needs to own this album, especially if you are a woman. Every single song on the album is great!
0345389409|3.0|After reading Servant of the Bones, which I was disgusted by, I decided to give Rice one more try considering Memnoch was part of the vampire chronicles.  The theme and plot were very interesting, and Rice's  descriptive power shone through.  Yet, when I got to the end I felt  cheated.  I was left feeling like someone had just stolen the last 100  pages of my copy.  The book itself was very well written, but there was no  real ending, and with this I was very dissapointed.
6305229449|5.0|As an Asian-American, There are many adaptations spun from this legend of a strong-willed girl willing to risk her life so that her ailing father would not go fighting.  Disney's Mulan is a fair adaptation of that story  and I was pretty much love the characters in the story.  THERE is NO  stereotypes or exploitation in this story, just a very good treatment of  the legend.  I love the voice actors too!  Ming Wa Neng (Joy Luck Club), BD  Wong(Madame Butterfly), George Takei (Star Trek), Eddie Murphy supplied the  comedy treatment that was so good!  And of course, it is Disney, and it has  the scope of a big feature animation.  Bravo!
0684833395|5.0|It is wonderful when all the bits and pieces finally come together at the end.
B000003CKH|5.0|I love this album.  &quot;The Distance&quot; is such an awesome song.  I love the cover of &quot;I Will Survive.&quot;  Cake rocks the house. Buy it as soon as possible!!!!!!
B000002H72|5.0|Buy it, turn your stereo up to eleven, and scream along with Black Francis as he rips his way through one of the best recordings in the past 10 years.  Each song is better than the next no matter what order its played.  This  is a CD you can't run into the ground, it gets better every time you play  it. If you're interested enough in the pixies to have read the reviews on  this CD then read no further.  Just buy it, you won't be dissapointed.
0800187873|5.0|I love Johnny Depp. Truly. But besides my obvious bias (I own all his movies, including Brasco) Donniw Brasco is the best mobster movie I have seen in years. Pacino is always the star of his movies and Brasco is no  exception, but Depp's performance is what really gave the film lift. I  heartily recommend this film, but be warned: there are some gruesome  scenes, and the language is strong.
0807029181|5.0|Victor Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning is a book that any reader can learn from.  Frankl shares his experience as a prisoner in a Nazi concentration camp during WWII, and how this experience helped him to  develop an approach to psychotherapy (called logotherapy).  Even those  readers who are not interested in the details of his theory will enjoy Part  I, which consists of the story of his experiences at Auschwitz and Dachau.   His main point is that everyone can find the will to go on, even in the  direst of circumstances, if only we can identify something that we are  willing to live for.  Frankl's tragic experiences, and his glorious victory  are an example for every human to aspire to.  Man's Search for Meaning  should be required reading for life!
B000001Y79|5.0|At first, I only liked Spiderwebs, Just a Girl, and Don't Speak. Now I like 6 more songs because I started listening to more songs on that cd. No Doubt is now one of my favorite groups.
6303921248|5.0|P and P, as those-in-the-know among my family and friends call it, is such a wonderful way to spend your time -- even when you're not watching it - when you're quoting it or describing a scene - the images still brighten  your face.  I've seen it many many times and one of my favorite times  watching it was at my mother's house when much of family was back home for  a reunion and everyone, EVERYONE got hooked.  My brothers especially, since  they were the newcomers to the story -- I would explain a scene before it  came on so that they could appreciate all of the nuances of each  characters' reactions, and boy did they love it.  We all stayed up for the  entire 6 hours - into the late night hours and just crashed on the living  room floor.  Then in the morning over breakfast I read aloud the final  chapters of the book when you learn a bit about Lizzy and Darcy's married  life.  Sigh.... such a great story!
B000006OAM|3.0|I liked a few songs on this cd but I thought her cd, Tigerlily was better. I was disappointed because I didn't many songs.
B0000067L2|5.0|This Album should make anyone's all time top ten list.  All tracks clearly show off the great talents of Baker, Bruce and Clapton. Great stuff and totally unique.
080010367X|5.0|Will smith is realy fantastic in this movie. Put on you're VCR and you'll forget everything around you. This is the best movie since Independance day.
0345347951|5.0|Clarke is a true visionary, and for me Childhoods End is his best. Not only is it exciting sci-fi, but it is a fantastic view into human behavior. How we react to the unknown, what our potential is, and how amzingly  arrogant we can be as a race are all issues superbly analyzed. Its clear to  me, with the images of the 4 gigantic spaceships and other plot devices,  where the crap hollywood calls science fiction has come from this decade.  Anyway- good book.
B000007MVM|5.0|If you're looking for a glimpse into the drug affected genius mind of Syd Barrett, this is an excellent place to start.  Excellent, original musicianship coupled with Syd's acid imagery make this a good, psychedelic  inkblot.  I think everyone likes Syd in their own way.  He seems to touch  the MADCAP side of we all hide behind our daily facade..
0380973642|5.0|I have to agree:  this was one of the best collection of short stories that i've read in a long time.  I loved the different variety of stories here and the very weird stuff in each: murdering angels, life eating  trolls, werewolves, etc. Gaiman's style is amazing.  Just wish there were  more. . .can't wait till his next book.
6304938241|5.0|This film cannot be recommended strongly enough.  The cinematography is breathtaking, and the story is equally brilliant.  The love between the young Englishman and the American lady is at once maddening and moving.   This piece belongs on the shelf of any movie lover.
6305127638|5.0|First Contact is the only DVD that I have seen that fully utilizes Dolby Digital 5.1.  The sound is incredible.  A must buy.
6303832563|5.0|Many years ago I passed up the chance to purchase a copy of KOYAANISQATSI.  No money now, I can get it later...well, so I thought.  Although seeing this film on video is a far cry from seeing it on the big screen, it is  still an extraordinarily powerful and visionary piece of filmmaking.  That  this marvelous film is not &quot;in print&quot; is in my estimation a crime  almost worthy of impeachment.  Whoever holds the rights to this motion  picture owes it to the viewing public to re-release it.  It is too  important a film to be kept in the cannister any longer.  And now would be  the time, with the newly released re-recording of the eerily effective  Philip Glass soundtrack.  Seeing this movie for the first time fourteen  years ago was for me, as a previous reviewer named it, truly &quot;an  experience&quot;--one that essentially transcended the very medium it was  produced on.  My must also express my long overdue thanks and gratitude to  Godfrey Reggio, Ron Fricke, Philip Glass, and to producer Francis Ford  Coppola.  And to anyone who hasn't seen it, watch it if you have the  chance.  It is an unforgettable film experience.
0399143904|2.0|Nowhere is the decline of Western civilization more evident than in its art, and Mr. Clancy's latest attempt at a thriller is artless indeed. Poorly developed characters, a plot line written with aspirations for the  silver screen (and not the page), and Mr. Clancy's nauseating platitudes to  the gods of technology make Rainbow Six among his worst in recent memory.  If he cannot be persuaded to take early retirement, then perhaps he might  recall those early days of red storms rising when the desire to tell a  great story superceded the need to placate a great and growing ego.
B00000AOTZ|5.0|this is a popular title, must get in stock!!
0385493800|1.0|This has to be Grisham's worst outing yet.  The story about the search through Brazil is so tedious and boring that I nearly threw the book against the wall.  I finished it merely out of a morbid curiousity.  I was  surprised by the ending, however, in that it didn't have the requisite  Grisham-read-like-a-screenplay-and-fade-to-black quality.  I am a true  Grisham fan, but I would not recommend The Testament to my worst enemy.
0440178002|5.0|I had seen the mini series a dozen times and never expected the book to be any better, but it is one of the best books I ever read.  As a history major , I was taught to take historical-fiction with a gain a salt, but who  is to say what really happemed long ago, none of us were ever there?   Needless to say this book captures the spirit and romance of a bygone era.   Oh how I hate to live in the 20th century.  The lady Mariko almost steals  the show, and the insights into the feudal world of the samurai are  priceless. You will get more out of this book then a dozen dry narrative  histories of Japan. I have recommend taipan and gaijin for those clavell  fans as well.
0446364495|1.0|After reading Bridges, I kicked myself for not having stuck to my guns and refused to read it as I had originally promised myself. Fortunately on searching for Bridges I stumbled across the quaint: Fridges (sic) of  Madison County at Amazon and found it to be a delicious spoof of the  original. It almost made reading Bridges worthwhile!
B000001E7V|5.0|All I have to say is this is a great album.  Interesting music, good beats, great combination of voices, and flat out great.  Get it.
B000003NA4|5.0|I can't wait for Dianna's next release. I would love to hear her sing Peggy Lee's &quot;Fever&quot;. But, in the meantime, I'm wearing out Love Scenes --I couldn't pick out a favorite track since I love 'em all. If you  like blues, jazz, saloon  Sinatra--buy this CD NOW !!
0385484518|5.0|After reading &quot;Tuesdays...&quot; I gave it to my mother to read because she too is dying of a terminal disease.  She and I joyously read it again together and shared our new revelations on how to live life fully to  the last minute.  Anyone who feels the good in life has dissapated needs to  make a friend with Morrie, and learn from his poignant lessons.   Wonderful!!!
B000001FQI|5.0|This was the first CD I ever bought (10 years ago!). I never get tired of listening to it.  Even though I have no idea what &quot;Bad Man's Son&quot; is about, it is my favorite and sounds best very loud.  Buy this CD, it  stands the test of time.
0441172717|5.0|This is a book worthy of any bookshelf.  It has suspense, adventure, treachery, and supernatural powers.  All of these areas are used to create a philosophical outlook on the idea of human consciousness.  However, this  theme doesn't jump out at you, at least not at first.  Rather, it is hidden  inside a masterfully written science fiction plot that alone would make it  a great book.  Herbert incorporates many layers into &quot;Dune.&quot;  It  has political, social, and religious overtones.  I have read the book three  seperate times, and so far, I have gotten something new out of every  reading.  This book is worth anyone's time.
0553296981|5.0|I have read the diary of Anne Frank and it has moved me deeply! I can relate to her more than any other person in the world. I wept when I was finished and still today when I think of the sorrow I still do. Anne was a  special girl and in my heart she still is and her mind and soul was very  deep! I recomend this book to everyone...
0792151712|3.0|Titanic is a nice movie, with great sets, spectacular special effects, good looking leads, and a romantic plot. However, it has been unbelievably overhyped. No, it is NOT the best film ever made (I would have to go with  Citizen Kane or Schindler's List on that), it is NOT the most romantic  movie ever made (The English Patient features a much more adult love story,  and Zeferelli's &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; captures the young love). It  is not even the best movie of the decade. HOWEVER, it is sweet, sad and in  places, very heart-warming. I confess to crying, but the situations did  feel manipulated and staged on occasion. The acting was good: kudos to  deCaprio and Winslet for being able to (mostly) carry off the very  simplistic dialogue. That is the biggest weakness of the movie: it is not  well written. If you want a great script, see Good Will Hunting, because  you won't find it in Titanic.<br />Over all: See it, but don't expect  greatness, and you won't be dissapointed. You'll enjoy it.
0767812646|5.0|Absolutely fabulous! This is an artistic creation that is as artful as it is entertaining. I had a DICKENS of a rollicking time watching this outstanding work. Even Fagin seems a lovable, vulnerable creature.
B0000004V2|5.0|Without reservation, this incredible CD is 'the' best CD ever made. It will be ten years in this April since this treasure was released. Who thought it would be 'the' best CD in rock history at that time? It has been  a slow realization to people that this CD has changed the world.<br />Do you  believe Nirvana brought alternative to mainstream? It's totally American  view. It was the Smiths and the Stone Roses. Though the Smith's regend has  been recovered here in America, only a small fraction of people have  discovered this regendery CD, which becomes 'the' best to those who  discover the Stone Roses. Even though they released only two albums, they  will be remebered as important as the Sex Pistols and the Beatles.<br />Their  self-debut title album, the first of their two albums, is only 'perfect'  album among my huge CD collection. I have never been to Manchester. But,  through this CD, I can dream of Manchester at those Madchester time. Those  cotton clouds, those stars, and their sugar spun sister.<br />I buy a CD  virtually every week hoping to find the Stone Roses II, my imaginary album  as good as the Stone Roses. I wish they had made it. But, they could not.  It's too bad they disbanded. I might not see another band as good as the  Stone Roses in my life. But, it was fortunate for me to discover them.  Otherwise, I would regret after my life.
B00000099Y|5.0|Well, what I like the most about music is the way in which an artist connects the sound with the content (lyric) of a song. In this case it is absolutely amazing. Perfect, dark, heavy, sometimes almost sticky sound  makes an incredible impression together with the lyrics. Even though I  don't agree with some of the texts - especially Eulogy, I must say that the  song is making probably the strongest impression. The album is sort of  poetry that describes the dark side of life and does it in a REALLY good  style. I think that there is a huge jump from Opiate to Aenima. Some of the  songs from Opiate are &quot;only&quot; OK, but the ones from Aenima are  perfect. Some of them are even funny (Die Eier Von Satan). The guitar and  the drums are absolutely amazing. This is for sure a Must-Have album. It is  even better in my opinion than Undertow and by the way, this is my  favourite one.
B000005ITX|5.0|Forever Changes,the last lp by the &quot;true&quot;Lee/McLean line-up of Love,is a wonderful mixture of folk-rock,psychedelia,a bit of Spanish-style touches, and incredible orchestral arrangements that color the songs in a  way that enhances them better than any album by any rock group I have ever  heard.A great,great piece of music that grows in my esteem with each  passing year,and has become a &quot;touchstone&quot;in critical  circles.&quot;Forever Changes&quot;is going to endure-and grow-in the  pantheon of the greatest rock albums.Particular highlights are Bryan  McLeans's&quot; Alone again or&quot;and the epic &quot;You set the  scene&quot;which open and close the album.But all the songs are very fine  indeed,and Arthur Lee's and McLean's vocal are some of rock/pop's finest  ever(yes!).As you can see,I highly recommend this record from 1967(but  timeless in quality and feeling).Not a record heavy in sound;it is powered  mostly by acoustic guitars,it is nevertheless engaging to mind and  body.Ultimately one of a kind,I can only compare it (somewhat)to Nick  Drake's &quot;Bryter Layter&quot;or Tim Buckley's first two albums.
B000002C4J|5.0|Well, over the past few years, Celine Dion has come up with unbelievably beautiful work.  Her job on the album &quot;Falling Into You&quot; made me wonder how she would ever come up with an album to top that....Now, I see  that she has.  From her powerful, moving ballads to her energetic, electric  dance songs, Celine is the most &quot;Pop&quot; artist of today's music  industry, and with this album, the Canadian songbird strikes again!
6304779356|3.0|This is the film that benchmarked the popular '80s horror films. It is good fun and has a great soundtrack. On the other hand, the quality of the DVD transfer is not that good, and the improvements from the VHS version  are not that noticeable. I would recommend watching it, but I would not buy  it.
0783228317|5.0|This was by far the most accurate portrayal of a full blown drug binge I have ever seen.  The movie is a classic right up there with all the Cheech and Chong movies.  I read the other reveiws and was surprised to see people  recommending the book before the movie.  The day after I watched the movie  I bought the book.  I found that &quot;hearing&quot; the words in Depps  voice actually enhanced the book.  I recommend both and Where the Buffalo  Roam as well.  Bill Murray plays a good Thompson too.
0783223218|2.0|Oh no!!! What in the world is this??!!! This film is supposed to be based on Forsyth's brilliant novel, dealing with an assasination attempt on Charles de Gaulle in Paris?  Ok, so the average American viewer probably  wouldn't be able to find France on a world map, much less know who Charles  de Gaulle was. I can understand the need to move the movie to a location  that Americans can relate to (America, of course), and to provide us with  the first lady as an all-American victim. But why did the movie have to be  so extremely unrealistic, openly insulting the intelligence of any viewer?  Here are just a few examples: How likely is it, that the CIA and the KGB  would require the help of an IRA terrorist to find the Jackal? How likely  is it, that said terrorist would dutifully and honorably help them, to the  point of almost having an erotic relationship with one of the KGB's iron  ladies?  Why in the world does the Jackal go through all that trouble to  build an elaborate cannon with video-guidance that can be radio-controlled  from miles away via satellite, only to stupidly sit 10 yards away from the  crime scene while firing? Why would an IRA terrorist who has murdered  dozens of innocent civilians in cold blood suddenly care about the life of  an unknown little girl he has never seen before? Here he has the Jackal and  the little girl at gunpoint - he only needs to pull the trigger to get his  long-sought revenge. He opts instead to mushily save the girl's life, drop  his gun, and place his life in the hands of the Jackal. Isn't it great that  he has adopted the moral values of a good, law-abiding citizen? And why  does his former terrorist partner-turned-housewife wear an evening gown  when she shows up at the last instant to shoot the Jackal from behind and  save the day, like in hundreds of bad movies before this? Good thing she  had a spare gun hidden under her laundry for the last 20 years...  Seriously, this movie hurts, even if you haven't read the book. If you know  the book, which deals with a professional killer's brilliantly and  meticulously executed assasination attempt, this childish display of  technology and fireworks will put you in agony. From the opening scene to  the utterly predictable, cheesy showdown, this movie can only be considered  a bad joke. If this movie were a comedy, the lapses of reason could be  excused, but it takes itself very seriously. The only reason this movie  merits two stars is because of the acting talent of Bruce Willis and  Richard Gere. Sadly, they can do nothing to save the story.
1573226521|3.0|Back in 1970 as an ex-Peace Corps Volunteer I traveled throughout Southeast Asia, hitchhiking where possible - Malaysia yes, Thailand no - and sleeping on the deck of a Thai boat making its way down the coast to  Malaysia - stopping at an island that easily could double for the one in  The Beach. Reading the book was thus eerie: in those days Vietnam was very  real, not a movie; and Southeast Asia wasn't a tourist destination other  than GIs on r and r. Interesting book. The interest in Vietnam - or movies  about Vietnam - by the central character shows that it hasn't been  forgotten. And the view of Southeast Asia in the book is at odds with my  memory of it - mysterious, beautiful, confounding. I guess that's why the  backpackers went looking for that pristine island. Again, an interesting  book that got me to thinking about a very interesting - and different -  time.
6305077630|5.0|Weird Science is one of the many movies that Gen-Xers like myself have learned to appreciate over the years.  I personally have seen it about 100 times and I can honestly say that I probably enjoy it more now than I ever  have.  It is not going to knock &quot;Titanic&quot; off of any best-seller  lists but as far as campy 80's comedies go, it is way up towards the top of  the list along with most of the other movies that the brilliant John Hughes  gave to us.  It moves quickly, it is hysterically funny and it is timeless.   I will be still be watching this movie with my friends when I am 80 years  old.

B00000DMJF|3.0|Like most other double LPs, the White album consists of a number of great songs, but a fair amount of filler.  What could have been a great single LP became a bloated affair that should have been edited (example: Revolution  #9 sounds like a semester project for a radio production class, and a bad  project at that).  I give the whole package 3 stars, equally weighted for  the music and the substandard packaging for an anniversary release.   Someone at the record company really missed the boat when it came to how to  package this thing.  No jewel box???  C'mon!!!
0553108034|5.0|After a few intense days of ignoring much of my life to read this book, I'm completely depressed to find myself at the end of it.  How am I going to live for the next 2 years without these characters??  How much time will  I spend imagining endings to all of those tantalizing loose ends?  What can  I make of Daenyris' prophecies?  When will my fantasy of Arya challenging   Joffrey to a duel be realized?  What the hell did Caetlyn do with Brienne's  sword?<br />I must say I expected the storyline to progress in a fairly linear  fashion in this book, but no, no, no, everything goes haywire and this book  simply roils with some very shocking events! I enjoyed it thoroughly.   Tyrion is especially witty and tricky and battle scenes from his point of  view are a scream (as they were in AGOT).  Sansa seems to be replacing her  lost wolf with the Hound and they are developing an interesting Beauty and  the Beast story that began in the last book. Arya is still my favorite read  but I'm a little worried that a 10 year old killer is so appealing to me.  And MAGIC is back!  Savor every morsel.
B000000OR9|4.0|Glad to see other fans of this GREAT disc out there. With so many dog-awful bands crowding the airwaves during the second half of the 80's, it's a wonder that Blue Murder didn't get completely lost in the shuffle.  This record rocks beyond belief! John Sykes has such masterful tone and  control of his instrument, I'm compelled to play air along side him every  time I here it. Just listen to the barely-under-control harmonics during  the solo in &quot;Valley of the Kings&quot;! Awesome! The title track has a  driving force all its own, featuring some great vocals and a loping,  stop-start rythm that is infective. Blue Murder's rythm section of slide  bass and thunderous drums perfectly complement the soaring and epic vision  laid down by Sykes. All in all, a very proud and atmospheric record, and  excellent representative of the genre.
0316152196|5.0|I read this book in 24 hours. The book grabbed me in the 1st 2 pages. I loved this book because it has everything I think makes a good mystery.  A character one can care about in Harry Bosch, a good story, and a mystery  which is not what it seems.  The book is a page turner.  You may not be  able to put it down because Connelly keeps the action moving. The story  takes place over 48 hours which increases the already heightened tension.   I was waiting for Connelly's new book because he always writes a good  story.  For those who are Harry Bosch fans, Connelly does not disappoint.   If you are not a Connelly fan, after this book you will be.

0553266306|5.0|This was Mr. Forsyth's debut novel, and it couldn't have made a better impression so much as on the readers as on the critics. There was not one boring instant whatsoever and the suspense hung on throughout all of it's  almost 500 pages. Now, to keep suspense going at such a length is already a  major achievement. To do so right on his very first novel, is an even  greater achievement. Mr. Forsyth showed himself as being a player who  played his game really well, leaving the last hundred pages of his novel  packed tight with tension, and the very last chapter with a slam-bang  finale. Bravo!
6304535570|5.0|I recently saw this movie and I... loved it! I know, I know, so maybe it could never happen, but that's partly why it's so good. After the movie was over, I spent the rest of the day dreaming about what if... Val Kilmer and  Elizabeth Shue are great actors. I loved the disguises! The lines are  clever and very often funny. And some parts are very poignant.(Like the  paper squares. Those who've seen it will understand. I *sniff* had a heart  ache at that point) The music is also great. I guess I should stop now, but  I think EVERYBODY should see this movie. : )
078062369X|5.0|I went to the movies to see this and have rented it twice more.  Wesley, Kris and the remaining cast members were excellent!  I can't say enough about them.  The movie held me from beginning to end with lots of twists  and turns.  I would recommend this movie to any and everyone.  Totally  enjoyable.
0446364495|1.0|I quote from the back cover:<br />&quot;HE NOTICED ALL OF HER . . .<br />  He could have walked out on this earlier, could still walk. Rationality   shrieked at him. &quot;Let it go, Kincaid, get back on the road. Shoot the    bridges, go to India. Stop in Bangkok on the way and look up the silk    merchant's daughter who knows every ecstatic secret the old ways can teach.    Swim naked with her at dawn in jungle pools and listen to her scream as  you   turn her inside out at twilight. Let go of this&quot; -- the voice  was hissing   now -- &quot;it's outrunning you.&quot;<br />  But the slow  street tango had begun. Somewhere it played; he could hear it,   an old  accordion. It was far back, or far ahead, he couldn't be sure. Yet it    moved toward him steadily. And the sound of it blurred his criteria and    funneled his own alternatives toward unity. Inexorably it did that, until    there was nowhere left to go, except toward Francesca Johnson.&quot;<br />Boy,  that sure is some fine writing.
630516603X|3.0|Feet of Flames is a very good production, much better than LOTD. The sets are better, the camera work is improved and the dancers are also very good. However, Michael is not as good as he was in LOTD. He is over-weight and  cannot do the high kicks he did in previous productions. He was slower and  tried to make up for it with herky-jerky movements. The outfits he wore  could not hide the &quot;love handles&quot; and the extra weight he was  packing. Another thing that puzzles me, what was the &quot;crawling&quot;  thing. He did it twice. Not good. Also the hat was a mistake.   I see all  of the 5 star reviews and I have to ask, Do I have the same tape they do.
6304722303|5.0|Aliens is the best of the four part series.  Sigourney Weaver and Bill Paxton make the movie the greatness that it is.  I am highly anticipating Aliens 5 and hope that it is as good as this one.  Alien was great, and so  were the other two.  I would have to say, that Aliens takes the cake as the  best of the series.  I will never forget Hudson and Vasquez.  It always  makes me mad to see how they get it.  If any of them survive with Ripley,  it should be them.  As Vasquez has on her armor, &quot;The risk lives  forever.&quot;  And as Hudson would say, &quot;That's it man!  It's game  over man, it's game over!&quot;
B000007177|5.0|The two CD's included in &quot;Nightcap&quot; are by design very different from each other.  CD#1 goes back to 1973 when Tull was recording in France and apparently not enjoying it.  The boys scrapped this recording, returned  to jolly &quot;ol England and began working on what would become the  &quot;Passion Play&quot; release. Hence, this CD sounds very much like  Passion Play, with numerous recognizable elements from it.  If you enjoyed  Passion Play then there is no reason why you wouldn't enjoy CD#1 as well.   If Passion Play was not one of your favorites this probably won't be  either.                                                 Listening to CD#2  is like finding that blue sapphire necklace from the Titanic!!  What a  treasure of delight!!  This CD has 18 tracks without a marginal one in the  bunch.  At seventy minutes it's like getting 2 new Tull releases. Ian  Anderson says in the liner notes, &quot;Most of the sessions for past  studio albums have produced an extra song or two surplus to requirements.   Sometimes these pieces failed to make it on to a record because they were  too similar to one of their brothers or sisters: sometimes, as the ear may  just detect, because they were too different!&quot; Fellow Tull fans, isn't  that precisely why we love Jethro Tull? You're going to love this CD from  beginning to end.  There really is no such thing as a &quot;bad&quot; Tull  song anyway.  There are a number of tunes from the Broadsword and the Beast  era which is probably my personal favorite. If you like to sing along with  Ian you'll find a bunch here to loosen up your vocal chords.  If you don't  own Nightcap already go get it!  You'll be sorry if you don't!!
B000001Y79|5.0|I've owned this CD for several years now, but it's still fresh.  My fave songs are Don't Speak and The Climb (which I think is perfect for Capricorns) but I also like Spiderwebs, Excuse Me Mr, Just a Girl, Happy  Now, Different People, Sixteen, Sunday Morning, and Tragic Kingdom.  Well  over half the CD.  It's hard to listen to this and stay in a bad mood, and  it's oh so much fun to belt out the lyrics.  I'm really looking forward to  the next CD.  I have a feeling it's going to be awesome.

0316920045|1.0|Reading this novel, I constantly felt I was engaging a powerful, phenomenally imaginative mind. This guy has like 300 footnotes. The footnotes have footnotes. One footnote to a footnote consists of a 17-page  small-print filmography of a (deceased) character. Phew.<br />About 200 pages  in, the disparate themes and plot threads started to coalesce, and around  page 800 I could feel that it would come to a remarkable, cohesive  conclusion around page 1100.<br />Unfortunately, the book is only 1000 pages  long. <br />It just plain STOPS. All the main characters are on the brink of  major resolutions, all are coming together for the final conflagration (or  whatever). And it literally stops, seemingly at a completely random  point.<br />Now maybe this is an infinite jest, dragging you through 1000  difficult pages then dropping you, but I didn't get it. I just felt like  the author got tired and quit, or the editor said, &quot;it's time to print  this baby,&quot; or the printer forgot to print the last 100 pages.<br />Damn  shame, this.
6303471714|5.0|I agree with the earlier writer.  This tape has gotten a ton of very unfair and undeserved bad press -- the actual workout itself is sensational!  Yes, Cindy is not as safety-oriented as she became in the  later tape and her form is not always perfect but this is a wonderful  workout.  I worked out with one of Radu's trainers for 6 months, and this  is the real thing -- for the price of this tape you can get Radu and save  yourself $100 per hour.  Worth every penny, several times over!
6304795254|5.0|The Game is better than that.  Written by John Brancato and Michael Ferris and directed by David Fincher, of the recent and creepy-Catholic inspired Seven, The Game is an entirely orthodox vision of a man who is forced - by  his own choices - to his own breaking point, which is the only point that  will release him from the trap his life has become. Without the religious  jargon as its delimiters, The Game nevertheless powerfully portrays the  entire human drama of sin, confession, penance, absolution, forgiveness,  oh, and crucifixion and resurrection - all in just over two hours.  The  Game is equal parts Adam, Cain, Abel, Jonah and Lazarus all rolled into one  of the most taught psychological thrillers that I've seen.  Some of the  film's most beautiful moments are the deft touches that seem incidental at  first blush, but nevertheless point to the underlying allegory:  first  communion, a statuette of the Virgin Mary, a reference to the book of John,  and not one, but two resurrection scenes unlike anything you've ever  seen.<br />If only Walker Percy were still alive!  If writers Brancato and  Ferris aren't Walker Percy fans I'll eat my foot.  The author of The  Moviegoer would recognize his ideas unmistakably by the film's exquisite  rendering of a man so lost in the cosmos that he isn't even aware of his  despair. The question that Walker Percy spent his entire life asking - How  do you speak to a man sensibly about ultimate truth in a Christ-haunted and  Christ-forgetting culture?  -- is not only truthfully but beautifully  answered by The Game. Nicholas Van Orton is the man who has everything, and  thus values nothing.  As an insanely successful control-freak investment  banker who disdains all those who should be closest to him, Van Orton is at  once, as Percy puts it, &quot;both the hero and ******* of the  cosmos.&quot;  His wealth and power have sated him to the point of extreme  boredom, and it is clear that all viable re-entry points have either  already been attempted or are simply too base for a man of his stature.   What are the conditions under which such a man could actually see the  Parthenon and not be bored, or in this case, the Golden Gate Bridge?  In  Van Orton's case, it takes the work of Consumer Recreation Services, a gift  that Van Orton receives from his younger brother for his 48th birthday --  the age at which his father before him (like another father and son in  another Percy novel) has committed suicide.  <br />Van Orton is mildly amused  by his brother's gift, and one day finds himself coincidentally in their  new San Francisco office, so he decides to inquire.  Here he meets an  administrator named Feingold who tempts him into trying the game with the  same logic that Satan used on Eve:  first, admit that you're interested;  it's a no-risk obligation.  Van Orton then fills out a questionnaire that  sounds more like a confessional transcription than an application to a  recreational service:  I sometimes hurt small animals,  I feel guilty when  masturbating, etc.<br />But CRS might as well stand for Character Redemption  Services, because the company and its omniscient database immediately  begins pursuing Van Orton like some deranged hound of heaven on steroids,  backing him up against the wall of his greeds, gluttonies and lusts for  what reason neither we nor Van Orton know.  Initially, Van Orton is  intrigued by the attention; he smiles as he walks into the airport and  realizes, with the shock of discovery, that every exchange, glance and  action is imbued with tremendous potential significance.  He is returned to  that state of innocent childhood belief that around each corner the scene  has been constructed just prior to his arrival and will collapse just after  his departure.  But he doesn't know how far it goes, where it starts and  ends, and why.  Like life, he is only armed with the one clue that the  purpose of the game is to discover the purpose of the game.<br />CRS gives VanOrton the full Job treatment:  as his security, safety, and luxury are all  pulled out from under him with astonishing speed, he is forced to confront  the bankruptcy of his own soul and the fragility of his own life.  What he  doesn't know, and nor do we until the end, is that he has his own personal  Beatrice guiding him through the underworld his life has become, and  passively but definitively leading his action every misstep of the way.   The waitress Christine is almost always with him, and there are little  clues here and there, that she is in on it, such as when she mutters to  herself, &quot;Watch out for boards and nails, there should be a fire  escape&quot; as she leads Van Orton through the second floor of an  abandoned building before jumping into the garbage cans in the alley below.   One of the nice touches comes at the end when we learn that his guide's  real name is not Christine, but Clare, who happens to be the patron saint  of television, a perfect choice for a story so completely layered and  selectively filtered.<br />From the allegorical point of view, The Game's  great strength is in its depiction of the relationship between free will  and original sin.  With CRS in place of God, Van Orton is placed into  situations where by varying degrees he is or is not allowed to exercise his  controlling tendencies.  When Van Orton is least curious about CRS, they  are casually there in the form of a bum asking for money or a toilet stall  occupant whose run out of toilet paper.  By the film's end, when Van Orton  believes he has regained his control, he is actually playing as tightly and  closely to the CRS script as is possible.  The climactic scene has Van  Orton discovering that this is his crime, and that he cannot actually have  control.  Facing the mirror of his own soul, Van Orton judges and condemns  himself to death, choosing the inheritance of his father's and  grandfather's death. In the most incredible scene of  free-will-as-God's-destiny ever played, Van Orton jumps to his death and  lands perfectly inside the circled X that CRS has scripted for his game.   Van Orton falls, quite literally, of his own choosing, and lands squarely  in the arms of his savior.  After reviving him and checking for cuts, one  of the medics says, &quot;It's always quite a fall.&quot; At the film's  conclusion, Feingold congratulates Van Orton saying, &quot;It's a good  thing you jumped, because if you didn't I was supposed to push  you.&quot;<br />Ultimately, The Game pulls off in allegory what the majority  of modern cinema has failed to do convincingly or persuasively for as long  as I've been alive. The Game, as one of the CRS decoys says to Van Orton  early on, is all about John 9:25 -  &quot;Whereas once I was blind, now I  can see.&quot;  The Game delivers the old eternal truth in the wrappings of  a new mystery.  Without a single preachy cliche, without any embarrassment  or camp, The Game forces Van Orton and the viewer to recognize the most  fundamental paradox of the Christian faith:  he who would save his life  must first lose it.
6304078102|5.0|It's one of the best movies which I've ever watched. But the movie is a bit too long. I think 1.5 hours is enough. Also, I'm disappointed that the feedback of this movie, from Hong Kong (China), is not good. What about the  feedback from US ? Anyone can answer me :&gt;
0783229526|4.0|Basically, this films functions best as a companion to the book. After reading the book, you can see the film as a collection of moving illustrations and images that help make the book more real. As a film  alone, this movie is funny and well made, but generally incoherent if you  haven't read the original.  Bottom line: Read the book, then see the movie.  The movie works best after you know what the hell is going on. And since I  did, it worked like a trippy charm.
0790729628|2.0|Okay, on its own merits this is an okay film, but the fact that it completely bastardizes Philip K. Dick's wonderful Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, the novel upon which it was based, more or less totally  ruined it for me.  Virtually all of the rich layers of reality, religious  allegory, and *many* significant plot points were completely absent from  the film.  One of the main characters, Jack Isidore, was entirely  eliminated, and the shared messianic experiences and electronic animals  were also gone.  Also, Rick was married in the novel.<br />If you're going to  see this, you should definitely read the novel as well--it's a much richer  experience.<br />Neat-o special effects, though.
0800196341|4.0|This is a good rendition of Hamlet, with some breathtaking cinematography and decent acting.  To be honest, though, Branagh simply did not work for me as Hamlet.  Too old, too blond.  Also, I don't know why he thought it  would be a good idea to cast big-name American actors in minor parts--Robin  Williams is kind of amusing as Osric, but most of them look glaringly  out-of-place.  On the plus side, Jacobi was typically briliant as Claudius  (an intentional joke based on his starring role in the excellent I,  Claudius?), and I absolutely *loved* the guy who played Fortinbras--talk  about radiating menace!  All in all, it's a worthy film, although at four  bloody hours it's a bit of an endurance test.  Also, it does not in fact  feature the play's script in its entirety--I noticed at least one  medium-sized speech that was conspicuous by its absense.<br />What we *really*  need is a Branagh King Lear.  Now THAT could be really something...
B000002UQJ|1.0|This album is McCartney's worst since Wild Life/Red Rose Speedway. It's amazing that someone with so much talent can put out such a bad album. On a positive note, the album does contain songs with great melodies, but  lyrically quite a few songs are really embarrassing. <br />There are a couple  of good songs such as Peace in the Neighborhood, Hope of Deliverance, and  Off the Ground. But these songs are offset by really bad songs such as  Golden Earth Girl, I Owe it All to You, and Biker Like an Icon. <br />The  lyrics to these songs are so bad, that they're unlistenable. Example:  Golden Earth Girl starts out with the lyric, &quot;Golden Earth Girl,  female animal...&quot; This from the most succesful musician in rock n roll  history. <br />Even as a hardcore McCartney fan, I can't stomach this album.
6305232660|1.0|Somebody should really stop Mimi Leder making movies, she really has no idea what's she's doing! Just like with the Peacemaker she has turned out another boring, overlong and emotionless film that so lacks any redeeming  features that it's not  funny (by the way, not one joke in the whole film,  well unless you count the actual film). <br /> I mean this film tries to get  off as being a serious in depth character orientatied flick, but it's not,  its WRONG WRONG WRONG! the characters are so mind numbling boring its not  funny, that mother that kills herself, what kind of rubbish is that, this  is supposed to be an asteriod movie, or those two kids in love, how  pathetic, leave the romance to Cameron will you Leder! Oh and the effects  suck, the camera was locked down and still the wave looked so fake it  hurt.<br />In summary this film is totally coma inducing, my friend fell  asleep watching it. How people like this film is beyond my belief. Go see  Armageddon, that was an excellent film which has much better characters and  storyline.<br />Deep Impact.. I think not
6303014100|5.0|I have watched this movie numerous times and  I  wish they would bring it out in dvd. Tom Barringers part needed some decent dialouge but in all this is the second best civil war movie   I have  seen, next to Glory. For  those of us who have decendents who died there, it is a tribute. When is  Gods and Generals coming out?
1558908420|3.0|I was blown away. Sylvester Stalone is an excellent actor in Cop Land. He is the one that makes this whole movie work. It's just a shame there was so much bad language in this movie. Overusing the F word too much gets really  old. Cursing really doesn't bother me, it only does when it's used more  than the rest of our words in a dictionary. Otherwise, this movie was  well-written, and it's that kind of movie that makes you feel sorry for  Sylvester because of the way he's treated.
B000005AYM|5.0|&quot;Erykah Goodu&quot; as I have so regally named her has spun a web of song's that would cure any black widow's bite.  She combines smoothness with a variety of down-to-earth, and even sometimes humorous topics.  She  swings the listener to her side with the opening &quot;Rimshot&quot;, and  then exposes her broad range of aural colors in &quot;On and On&quot;.   This title is foreshadowing for the rest of the album which keeps the  audience groovin' on and on and on and on.  Until I heard the Badu album, I  was becoming lulled to sleep by the same sounding female R&amp;B singers of  today, but she seems to give a new perspective to life in the urban world.   Erykah shows chivalry in underworld activities when she describes the  predicament a lover involved in illegals faces.  She even shows the  rationale, and almost innocence in the tempting feel of another lover.  The  band she has supporting her give her the perfect basslines, and soulful  sounds that she needs to reign as the new female vocal champion.  The  &quot;Afro&quot; skit deserves extra special mention for pure comic value  in a combination of 20's style singing and 90's style dissing.  Please  check this Goodu album out.
6305291489|5.0|I usually don't like children movies, but this one was enjoyable. Everything in this movie is better than the original. The special effects are better (of course), the girls are better actors, and it just seems more  believeable than the original. Classics are usually not outdone, until now.  If you waited, than you're lucky because you can benefit from a better  version on DVD in a cool &quot;white clamshell&quot; case.
6304198493|5.0|As a fan of many movies and a not fan of many movies, I would have to say, wow!  This movie kept me on the edge of my seat with the action and great story line.  The twist, to me, was know but still not believed.  It should  get no less than top ten of all time.
6304711921|5.0|This movie is amazing because of the special effects and the excellent music provided by Danny Elfman (Batman, The Simpsons). Everytime these guys are involved with a movie, you know it's going to be good with the  exception of Pee-Wee Herman! Anyway, this movie on DVD is soo much better  than the VHS version. I own them both, and what a difference it makes in  visual and sound. The characters are so original, and the plot is the way  everyone would want it to be.

0446605409|4.0|I loved reading this book on my vacation. The mystery of Plum Island was a great idea. I also enjoyed the local flavor. I was disappointed with the ending which turned into a Rambo Styled Boat Chase. In general I find many  of Demilles work to suffer from poor endings. Cathedral was also an  excellent 3/4 of a novel.
B00000AFWW|3.0|I'n not a great fan of this band,but i can say that 'Celebrity skin' is a good album. The greatest songs are 'Celebrity skin' and 'Malibu'.
6305265488|5.0|For all those hopeless romantics that still believe in selfless yet self-assured love, this is the movie for you.  It is reminiscent of movies like the Princess Bride, A Fairy Tale, etc...where happiness prevails in  the end.  A charmer for  anyone who is losing their faith in love.
0399143904|2.0|As an avid Tom Clancy fan, I was excited to read his new book, but was very quickly disappointed.  His repeated phrases and tired plot of commandos against crazed environmentalists was awful.
B0000033RY|5.0|This is indeed the best of Cactus.  The great value of this recording is unsurpassed because of the inclusion of a previously unreleased live version of Parchman Farm.  The live rendition is even better the studio  version.  Get it.  You will not be disappointed.
078388334X|5.0|As many who have read this book, I picked this up after I completed &quot;Into Thin Air.&quot;  I thought that it wasn't possible that I would ever find a book that moved me as much as that novel did.  I was wrong.   Chris broke my heart. To witness to the adventures of such a unique young  man, a true modern day adventurer and dreamer, only to see his life  extinguished with such utter pain and desperation, was nearly more than I  could bear.  Any person not moved by this exquisite life, has truly never  felt the fire in their heart to live a life less ordinary.  Jon Krakauer  should be applauded for what must have been a Herculean task of putting  together the puzzle that was Chris' life on the road.  As he did in  &quot;Into Thin Air&quot;, Jon Krakauer made me cry with the last page of  this book.

6305265666|5.0|First of all, I've NEVER liked Drew Barrymore as an actress an have tried to stay away from this film because of that.  I finally went to see Ever After after a month of my better half begging me.  Let me say that it's  been a long time since I enjoyed a movie this much.  I was saddened when  the movie was over, not becuase of the ending or anything to do with the  plot, but simply because it was over.  This is definitely one to add to  your collection.
6304712936|5.0|Good performances by Tom Hulce and especially Murray F. Abraham and a great music score!  The visuals are also excellent.  Although the film is not a completely accurate portrayal of Motzart's life, it is nevertheless a  great story!  I had no problems with the image at all (at least on my  32&quot; TV -- I wouldn't know about high-end projection systems).  I'd  recommend it to anyone, especially if you like Mozart's music!
B000007VN4|5.0|To the person from Australia, songs 2 thru 11 were the first full length WASP album released, to hear this would make you throw away anything else you have by WASP as junk. The bonus tracks are good, though ANIMAL is a bit  boring these days. It is really too bad every WASP fan does not own this  album, though I am looking for an original myself on CD.
0964385619|5.0|This is an excellent book from cover to cover. I highly recommend it to anyone who is serious about changing their financial position. This book will knock over some sacred cows on it's way to exposing the truth by  teaching that financial independance is a choice, not based on your  upbringing or previously conceived notion about the rich and how they  obtain wealth. I can't wait to read Cashflow Quadrant!
0800139151|1.0|How corny can you get? Seeing sunlight through a man after he's been shot? Come on, wouldn't there be blood? Seeing a bullet hole through a man's head? Still corny because you have no blood, no brains, and th guys stands  there for a while. But someone gets shot in the eye and they do flips?  Dicrapio *****, Stone is a wanna-be Clint &quot;the man&quot; Eastwood, and  Hackman is unbelivable. The preacher, Cort, is played by Russel Crowe of LA  confidential fame. Is he good in this movie? Yes and no. LA Confidential he  is more belivable. All in all, don't see it. See the Unforgiven
6304546386|4.0|This immensely stirring 1938 production is, perhaps, the supreme example of the kind they--sadly--don't make anymore. All concerned--Flynn (at his  most charismatic); Rains, Rathbone, Hale, and other sundry supports (a  plethora of splendidly memorable character performances); Curtiz  (displaying his brilliant knack for keeping EVERYTHING moving); and the  scriptwriters (keeping it all delightfully tongue-in-cheek, and stuffing it  full of cheerfully witty humor);--give it their energetic all. These are  marvelously assisted by perfect music, superb early Technicolor  photography, and high production values. Humbugs may desire the modern  bloodshed, unattractive characters, shabby decor and vesture; but if they  also prefer the modern shallow acting, dull dialogue, inane scripting,  heavy-handed direction, and total absence of that now-extinct infectious  enthusiasm that elevates this classic actioner into one of the outstanding  entertainment experiences in cinema history, then more's the pity for them.  Alas, the days when Hollywood wasn't catered to such bloodthirsty populace!  the days when hokum was hokum, devoid of pretentions of grandeur, and was  so masterly crafted into exuberant fun for delighted audiences of all ages!
0930289528|4.0|I will give this book 4 stars because I found the story to bog down at the middle of the book. However, it was still a good book and one I would recomend if you read graphic novels.
B0000021RD|5.0|I, too, wore this album out in my sophomore year of high school. As awesome as Chicago Transit Authority (the first album) was, nothing could have prepared me for the giant leap Chicago took on their second album in  1970. The first four tunes will blow you away with their vocal and horn  arrangements. But there's more. Wake Up Sunshine and the Make Me Smile song  suite are absolutely brilliant in their arrangements and composition. Add  to that the classics Fancy Colours and 25 Or 6 To 4, plus the most  beautiful vocals you'll ever hear from the late Terry Kath on Memories Of  Love. The album ends with a plea for mankind to come together on Where Do  We Go From Here. This monumental album has truly stood the test of time.  Anyone who associates Chicago with the sappy singles band of the '80s  should pick up this CD. (Would love to hear a Mobile Fidelity gold CD  edition of this album...)
0060920084|5.0|I've just finished The Lost Continent and am still recovering from the experience.  Bill Bryson's devastating wit and keen perceptions are right on target.  I had tears rolling down my face, collapsing in helpless  laughter when reading about tacky souvenir shops in Savannah and Gatlinburg  and pig-out marathons in Pennyslvania Dutch restaurants and boring nonsense  on historical markers.  He never misses an opportunity to zing Americans  for their lack of taste but he also lovingly describes scenic back roads  and the few small towns that are still thriving, or are at least  interesting (especially if they resist the lure of fast food chains and  WalMarts). Anyone who went on endless car trips as a kid will definitely  love this book.  I must read more by Mr. Bryson!

B00000AFHM|5.0|And you thought that melody was extinct.  Not since the Smiths has a group made misery sound so beautiful.  The Boy With The Arab Strap is sheer recording brilliance.  The music reminds you of an era that has long  passed.  It is so pure and innocent that even singing about stroke victims  as they do on &quot;It Could Have Been a Brilliant Career&quot;, seems  pretty.  The music just passes through your ears as easy as a delicate  breeze.  Every song has a narrative and the album leaves you in a pensive  state at the end.  Between the guitars, the strings, and cunning lyrics,  Belle and Sebastian have done the impossible.  They prove to us that even  though life is full of pain and anguish, it is broad and beautiful in  scope.

We do not know that we are going to meet 12 men  around a kidney shaped table and neither do we preach that the drunk of the  street is fullfilling a mission. Some non-Mormons may get some very wrong  ideas about what our church believes. We are not taught that prayers are  flashes of light that the angels rush to answer.  Some of my concerns about  this book is that she wrote the book 20 years after this experience that  she claimed. A lot of details can be distorted after 20 years. Also, she  does not name the city or the hospital or the doctor who was attending her.  I saw her in an interview on TV and she refused to give any of that  information. She claims when she returned from her NDE that four hours had  passed. A hospital would not allow four hours to go by without checking on  a post-surgery patient. While it is beautifully written I would recommend  readers use caution when reading the book
B00000DATR|3.0|I like techno-pop and Mike Oldfield is my favorite composer so I found this album quite interesting. I was slightly dissappointed as two of my favorite elements of Tubular Bells -the variety of instruments, and the  unique introductions of the instruments were missing. The themes are still  there in much diffent format so it still belongs in the Tunular Bells  series. This album should attract a new flock of fans to Oldfield. Old  faithfuls like myself will still enjoy it because it's a new variation for  Oldfield.
6304083777|5.0|An excellent movie that struggles to define Life and Humanity. The characters are full and human. They have massive internal struggles while defending themselves and others. Ghost is not your standard Sci Fi flick  but perhaps does the best job of entertaining and making you think. I would  classify Ghost as pure Cyberpunk, as William Gibson originally wrote  it.<br />The graphics are the best that I have ever seen out of Japan or  Disney; however, the &quot;Ghost&quot; world is VERY dark and  brooding.<br />If you buy one Anime title to start, make it Ghost in the  Shell. I originally picked up this title on a whim before collecting Anime  and now I have over 50 titles. Ghost is still my favorite, although I am  also partial to Dirty Pair, Slayers, Evangelion, and Ninja Scroll.
B000000I0K|5.0|This is a fantastic album of shorter instrumental cuts. The variety and imagination demonstrated by Oldfield is astounding. Among the &quot;instruments&quot; listed is a chair! Wonderful Land will take your  breath away.
0553108034|5.0|Brings grey into the black and white world of fantasy. My favourite series since Lord of the Rings. I ordered this book from England, and like its predeccesor, blew through its pages like wildfire. If your in limbo about  purchasing this book, let me ease your mind by saying, &quot;BUY THIS  BOOK!&quot; You will not be dissapointed.
B000002J6H|4.0|Some of the cuts are lame. What album didn't have it's dogs, but this puppy is worth the price if simply to listen to 'Go Back Home' and get totally uplifted by the Clapton solo halfway through the cut. The  transistions and bridges in that solo are outrageous. There is one that  sort of has a twisted sound, like the mix down tape just sort of  stretched.<br />A classic. How many of you had to go buy some hiking boots  just like Stephen's. They were as common as the Doc Martens of today.<br />The  world is ruled by fat, bald, hippies in hot tubs.
0316920045|5.0|After reading all 91 reviews below, I just have to add mine.  First a comment to everyone whe gave IJ one star: maybe you *are* not smart enough to &quot;get it.&quot;  You all talk of Wallace's pretentiousness, but that  sounds to me like the words of someone with an inferiority complex who has  to attack a person that they percieve to be smarter than themselves.  If  you are one of those people who says &quot;I've got to read a book a week  to maintain my illusion of self-intelligence&quot; don't even bother  reading the book, it won't work.  Believe me, it took me four months of  daily reading to get through it.  I don't like to be so elitist, but to see  a true work of art so belittled by people who admitted to not even getting  through 20% of it can be understandably frustrating.     As for the  novel, sure it may take more effort to read and truely understand the form,  plot and themes of Infinite Jest than just about any other book I've ever  read, but what I got out of it so overshadows the effect that any other  work of art has had on me that I shudder to think of what it would have  been like to put down the book after 100 pages like I first wanted to.   That effect was nothing less then the complete re-thinking of my whole  frame of reference.  This novel has crept into every part of my life, my  writing, my syntax, my personal philosophy, my relations with others...       Do yourself a favor and read it, think about it, pay attention to the  subtleties and if you don't like it, have a good reason why before posting  it on this page.
0553108034|3.0|I waited impatiently for this - read it as soon as I received it.  I am a little disappointed, but it may just be the usual problems with middle books - the set up is familiar, therefor not as exciting, and there's no  resolution.  I am disquited to hear that the number of planned books has  expanded to four - shades of Robert Jordan.  I've been telling friends that  this is not a series like Jordan's, but I am beginning to suspect that  Martin has lost control of his material.  Clash of Kings reads more like  genre fantasy to me -  too much magic, among other things.  I could really  do without Melisande - her whole thread seems manufactured, although I like  Davos.   I am also disturbed by the many descriptions of the rape and  humiliation of women.  Some - Sansa - are valid plot points, but some used  as background detail seem gartuitous to me.  I await the third book, but  I'm not as certain it will the the top-notch book I was expecting.  I hope  to be proved wrong.
0671502336|1.0|Some of the passages in this novel made me chuckle a little. No much, though. The kind of humor employed was strange and I have never seen it before but it just wasn't that funny.  The novel had no plot.  I don't  think it was ever meant to have a plot.  But the thing I hated most about  this incredibly boring novel was the author's style which when he wanted to  refer to something he repeated what the think was completely and used no  pronouns.  I cannot tell you how much I hated reading the same thing fifty  times.  He could have literally cut the book by a third then I might have  actually finished it.
B000002WU9|5.0|Once you buy this CD you can throw away the rest of ur collection.  THis is the slammest stuff wu tang has out with if u smell what im cooking.
6302638771|5.0|Considering most American's inability to comes to grips with their own history, Oliver Stone's admittedly fictionalized account of the JFK assassination and associated Senate inquiry and subsequent information  regarding the case, does exactly what a good movie should do: prompt  discussion.  Whether the Warren Commission's initial  finding and the  Senate's later review were correct, or whether the FBI, CIA and Mafia and  god-only-knows who else conspired to assassinate JFK for the Bay of Pigs  situation, no one, including Stone, will ever really know because all  parties have a vested interest in keeping the issue quiet, the film is of  historic significance in that it, if nothing else, reflects  an artistic  questioning of the times.
B00000DMJF|3.0|The album itself is weak, when compared to other Beatle work (for any other group it might be the best album they ever made), but I happened to enjoy receiving the new disc for Xmas.  I always wanted an import with the  stamped # and the name in raised type.  I thought that the american version  of the cover took away it's subtlety, and made it no longer a brilliant  antithesis to the busy Pepper cover.  And getting exactly what you would  have gotten when buying the LP (i.e. the poster and pictures, just  minaturized) is more like what I want a CD to be, exactly like the original  LP, artwork and all, just smaller.
6304681011|4.0|If you like low-budget chills, this film is the ultimate. It's one of the rare films where budget doesn't matter, and the low budget actually makes it creepier. Herk Harvey filmed this b/w early 60s film that borders on  camp, centered in an abandoned &quot;Old Pavilion&quot; in Lawrence, KS in  theearly 60s. What makes the film so scary is not gore, but the  psychological suggestions of death.A woman is killed when her auto plunges  off a bridge but somehow seems to survive the wreck. She is strangely cut  off from society and sees a scaryspector who disturbingly trails her. A  spooky organ score accentuates scenes where zombies dance at the Pavilion  in fast motion. If you have everbeen alone, and feared that no one has  noticed youand hears you, this film replicates the experience. Perhaps once  we get down to it, death may be a similarly campy experience.
6300216268|5.0|I first saw this movie when it was released in the theaters. It played at the same theater in Minnesota for a year and a half and I saw it more times then I can count. It was a cult film from day one.   Harold and Maude is a  masterpiece. It touches on every emotion and leaves you walking on air. If  you haven't seen it - you haven't lived.
0792151712|5.0|This movie is an exelent movie!!  It is right up there with Gone with the Wind.  It is a true creation of a cinematic masterpiece!!!!!!
B000002952|5.0|I'm so glad Gloria finally did this album. Of her two latest Spanish releases, this is my personal favorite. Both of the releases received much critical acclaim. She defines &quot;mi tierra&quot; in the CD liner notes  as &quot;my homeland&quot; and musically it certainly is. This is her  niche, and this CD lives in my changer.
0385484518|1.0|Tuesdays with Morrie is an annoying little book. In spite of what the author, Mitch Albom, says, the book is about him and not about Morrie.  Unfortunately, I did not find either of them particularly interesting.  A  more interesting subject for the book would have been an analysis of why so  many Americans of various faiths or no faith who are dying and have time to  consider death, such as Morrie, want to become Buddhists.<br />The only good  thing about the book is that it is short.  The biggest problem may also be  that it is short.  The book fails to stand on its own merits.      A good  book, which this is not, has the ability to captivate, interest, entertain,  and challenge a reader.  Unless one brings one's own recent tragic loss to  the reading of this book, the book is incomplete and, what I call,  &quot;thin.&quot; It astounds me that the book is as popular as it appears  to be.<br />After reading the book, if I mourned any loss, it was the loss of  the innocent trees that gave their lives to become paper for this book.   Save your money and save a tree.
0553108034|5.0|I'll keep it simple: real characters that really interact. Real conflicts with highly unpredictable outcomes. Arguably the best fantasy series EVER.
078401213X|5.0|This movie, in my opinion, was one of the greatest... great acting, great plot, great score.  It makes you think, but you do not have to have a PHD in math to understand it.  It amazes me that such a movie can be made with  such a small budget.  I highly recommend this movie.
B000002H5I|5.0|I could listen to this CD on repeat for days straight.  Couldn't ask for a better CD to belt out songs with!!!
006016848X|3.0|The basic ideas are interesting and ought to be taught to all young people especially those about to be married.  However the book needs a strong editor to cut down on the repititious examples and redundancy.
0385493800|5.0|The Testament. John Grisham. His books have been turned into box office hits. The Testament filled with lots of action and adventure. Grisham goes out on a limb here and tries for something different. He does not  disappoint. If ur a fan of John Grisham then this is for you. Even if ur  not a fan(and why wouldn'nt you be?)you will be hooked on this book and not  be able to put it downand will turn you into a Grisham fan for life.John  Grisham is the #1 author of our time. All his books have been on the New  York Times BestSellers List for 20 weeks and The Testament will be the next  one. Buy it today. Before its to late or wait till 2000 when it hits stores  in paperback.
0780020685|5.0|I've seen this film many times over the last 30 years.  It's the only film i can think of where i have been tempted to restart it as soon as it finishes.<br />As for the many, many remakes: the latest in the list is  Disney's BUG'S LIFE.
6304806442|5.0|I have to say that Trainspotting is a very intelligent and visually stunning film which beautifully (if that's the right word...) depicts the lives of heroin addicts.  Some may find certain scenes too much, but if you  are looking for truth on screen... this is where to find it.  A worthy  successor to Shallow Grave for both Danny Boyle and Ewan McGregor!
0312853238|5.0|This is possibly the greatest book ever written. The reason &quot;some people&quot; gave it one satr reviews is because the don't understand it at all. Period. The mock what they don't understand. Do NOT let this interfer  with your judgement. Go out and buy this book.
0887309372|5.0|A fast, energetic read vital for anyone involved in marketing products or running a business. Ries makes an elegant case for the Brand as a simple idea in the mind of the customer, and shares his wisdom on how to get and  keep it there. Stimulating concepts backed by real world experience. Highly  Recommended. A good companion to Jack Trout's New Positioning.
B000002U8A|5.0|As a long-time fan (since '84) and someone who likes everything they've ever released, I have to say that this is their 2nd best album (after Rio).  It's worth getting if for no other reason than the tropical/mystical Tiger  Tiger, the haunting Seventh Stranger, and the defiant New Moon on Monday.   The album is a definite precursor to Arcadia's album &quot;So Red the  Rose&quot; and easily stands the test of time.
0790729628|5.0|Tell me all the good things that you remember about this movie...  We watched this movie repeatedly on cable tv back in 1984 while we were in college.  I vividly remember it as one of the most haunting and captivating  films I had ever seen.  Late at night, the whole picture seemed to flow  right out into the always darkened room, meeting and penetrating a  spellbound audience.  It was, and still is, almost impossible not to grab a  glass and join Deckard when he pours that drink in his apartment.  I  thought I had scene everything in the movie over the last 15 years, until I  bought the DVD version.  STUNNING!!!!  It was like watching an entirely  different movie, scenes behind scenes, behind scenes.  Do Androids Dream of  Electric Sheep?  I think they do.  Get it, watch it.
0767817443|1.0|The effects were good. But a movie needs a good story to keep my interests. Special Effects without a story is a pretty boring thing.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I bought this CD almost a year ago, but I listen to it almost religiously.  This CD is one of my top 5 CD's of all time in my collection (of 153 CD's)
0783225849|5.0|One of the finest movies ever made, and definitely one of Hitchcock's top three, viewing &quot;Psycho&quot; is an experience every film buff should have.  The DVD transfer was excellent, and the additional features,  including a ninety minute documentary about the making and aftermath of the  groundbreaking film (not just for the first toilet shot in cinematic  history), make this a DVD that belongs in everyone's collection.
6300151379|5.0|My Dad rented this for me when I was a little kid; now at 21, it remains my favorite movie.  It symbolizes my youth, and youth in general.  The story is pure poetry and romance.  The movie contains the most fabulously  goofy characters and creatures; not to mention those memorable songs! I  fell in love with David Bowe and Jennifer Connely and I wish I could own my  own copy.  I've spent a fortune renting it over the years!  It's so nice to  know how much others love it!!
B000007UEY|5.0|If anyone wants to know where Genesis gets it's sheer power, one only has to listen to this recording to find out. While TONY BANKS is the gentle and lighter side to the band, RUTHERFORD brings the muscle.With tracks like  CATS AND RATS and MOONSHINE it is no wonder GENESIS can kick some serious  rear end when they get into their power mode. This is one of the best  progressive rock albums ever recorded and it should be noted again that  Mike brings the full load when he plays. A collector's classic
0696204800|5.0|I have been working on making a quilt with 225 of the 4 inch squares in this book.  Each little square is a masterpiece and after over 200 in a two year period I am not looking forward to the end of this project.  I've made  3 other quilts in the interim, but when I really want to have fun, I pick  up this book and make another little square.
6305265488|5.0|God knows I love Drew Barrymore.  Ever since The Wedding Singer, I've been entranced.  She does indeed seem to be living up to her Butterfly metaphor.  &quot;ugly and awkward&quot; to start...though she was never ugly, she was  hardly an angel.  But recently, she has evolved into a truely great  actress, person, and I had to admit my heart took an extra beat when I saw  her in her wings in this movie.  The lovely Angel Barrymore.  <br />Ahem...but  the rest of the movie was also great.  Hehe.  DaVinchi's protrail was  excellent and humerous, and the entire movie had an air of entertainment  and fun mixed with a plot and dialouge that an older audience will love.   Romantics from every generation will smile, and cheer.  A very intellegent,  fufilling movie.  Rated on the Internet Movie Database as a TOP 10 MOVIE of  1998.  It deserves it's high status, too.  Check it out!
B00000DLUV|5.0|This is for everyone who watched the HBO concert and wished that it would never end..... now it doesn't have to !!! All you have to do is put in your CD and close your eyes and you are there, baby !!! A personal favorite is  &quot;Islands in the Stream&quot;, but I love them all. No BeeGee fan will  be disappointed with this CD.
6305265488|5.0|Awonderful movie. Its a modern interpretation of cinderella and a very good role model for young girls. I was pleasantly surprise that she was quite resourceful and totally different from the traditional Cinderella.  Instead of the victim she was very independent and resourceful. A good  movie for young girls to see. I loved Drew Barrimores interpretation.
0788805843|5.0|If you like Disney, than this is a must see!
0767822900|5.0|My four-year-old daughter loves this movie.  When I returned the rented version to the video store, she was so disappointed that I've decided to buy the video.  I rarely buy videos, but I think this will be one of those  movies that she'll want to watch again and again.  (She watched it four  times while we had it from the video store.) I highly recommend this movie.
0790739909|5.0|&quot;City of Angels&quot; opens up the doors of possibility while reflecting upon the realities of life. Every day we walk upon the earth, and most of us move about oblivious to the higher powers that guide us. In  the movie, angels are everywhere, mostly unseen.One of the most profound  aspects of this film is the portrayal of every range of human emotion, from  laughter to grief, love to desperation. Nicolas Cage excels in his role as  Seth, the unseen protector, whose desire is not just to observe, but to  experience, life.Meg Ryan's Dr. Maggie Rice is driven, but struggles with  the tenderness underneath. She feels she must be granite for her colleagues  and patients alike, but inside she battles the reality of having emotions  and reactions to them.This movie will make you laugh and cry, and if you  contemplate its events, you will find that life is as it should be....maybe  not fair, but it is real.May the angels watch over you.....
6305076995|2.0|i know it's only the early seventies, but the audio, video, and production were not good.  this should NOT have ever been put on dvd.  what a waste...
0451196716|5.0|This tale of a future marathon where the runners who stop are killed in front of millions is the best thing King's ever written, hands down. Unrelentingly dark and powerful, it holds your attention from the innocuous  beginning to the end's bizarre twist. Not everyone's cup of tea, but if  your taste in literature overpowers your desire for an uplifting story,  read this book. I gave it 5 stars simply because there was no 6. Or, for  that matter, no 10.
B000000OSE|5.0|UYI  I &amp; II are the best rock albums ever (behind &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot;)  Every song is awesome, from &quot;kockin' on heaven's door&quot; to &quot;November Rain&quot;.  If like Hard Rock, BUY THESE  ALBUMS!
0312853238|5.0|I can't say that I've ever read a better book. This book had it all. Many people said that Ender was an unrealistic character, too adult -- no. They missed the book's entire point. Every few generations, someone is born who  can totally alter the course of human history. Ender was this someone, but  the world knew he was coming. The military used him as a tool, trying to  squeeze all his potential out before his maturity. He was betrayed by the  world, and treated like an unthinking weapon. Simply an incredible story.
6305180261|5.0|GN'R made the best rock videos ever.  &quot;November Rain&quot; was voted MTV's music video of the decade!  If you are a GN'R fan, u should buy this video.  It has all the hits: &quot;Sweet Child&quot;,  &quot;Welcome.jungle&quot; &quot;Patience&quot;, &quot;estranged&quot;  &quot;Paradise city&quot; &quot;the garden&quot; &quot;Live..die&quot; plus  more hits
B00000DFTG|5.0|This is one incredible album. After nearly thirty years, Sabbath sounds like teenagers again. They're playing the greatest songs they ever wrote (with the exception of &quot;A National Acrobat&quot; and  &quot;Supernaut&quot;, but nobody's perfect), and they're playing them  great. If you're new to Sabbath, this is where to start. If you're not, get  it anyway.<br />The world of music today is stagnating, and Sabbath is going  to set it straight. Every good band of the 70s and 80s listened to the Sabs  as teenagers, and the Sabs have just returned. They're as good as ever. And  that's GOOD.
0385493800|3.0|This book was touted as the author's course correction, a refutation of materialism worshipped by earlier characters. But the idealism of Nate is no different (or deeper) than Mitch in The Firm, or The Street Lawyer, for  that matter.  Testament is a passing grade adventure book, but it did not  live up to its billing as a foray into things spiritual.  It certainly  started to do just that, but it just didn't know how to convey how Nate  might have really been transformed by the proverbial Grace of God.  The  goodness of Rachel is marred by the innuendo of knee-rubbing and  back-touching...we don't know if Nate was really touched by her spirit or  just by his fantasies.
B000002KHH|5.0|I bought this album from a friend about a year ago. I paid fifty cents. I got a thousand dollars worth of music. This is IT, the definitive metal album and the standard which all others should be judged by. Nothing has  ever come remotely close.<br />This is music the way it was meant to be  played. From the opening notes of the masterpiece &quot;War Pigs&quot;, to  the anthemic crunch of &quot;Iron Man&quot;, to the final moments of the  hallucinogenic &quot;Fairies Wear Boots&quot;, it grabs you by the throat  and doesn't let go. As if you would want it to. I have never gone three  days without listening to it. I don't think I can.<br />If you like any hard  music, from Nirvana to Ministry to Judas Priest, you will love this. Crank  it up high, stare into a candle, and think &quot;This is where it all  began.&quot; Because it was. You might not be able to buy it for fifty  cents, but this is the one that you have to buy. Pay any price. Because, no  matter what, it'll be worth it.
B000007239|5.0|I own all Megadeth releases. My ears have become accustomed to the most beautiful and talented musicmanship in the business. For one thing, we all agree and can realize Marty's manically incredible guitar style; for he is  one of the world's most respected musicians and guitarists. Dave, being  originally a lead guitarist himself, is by far the most formidable of  vocalist/Rhythm guitarists in the world for he has the song writing ability  and the ability to play lead and the ability to play complex riffs behind a  vocal phrase. This brings me to why i post my review. RIP does not fail in  Lyrical and Vocal content as others have suggested. Dave Mustaine has  matured as a vocalist, and while RIP is not quite Frank Sinatra material,  Dave has exemplified the art of shredding and singing with tonality in his  voice even if it isn't quite spectacular at the time. The album, lyrically,  is superior to any Megadeth nor any band has ever released. The power of  the anger behind Holy Wars and Take No Prisoners is beyond evident. The  examples are endless. it's definetly an album to own and love. Not for it's  gutness or blatant defacing of a political system that has apparently  failed in the eyes of Dave but mroe so for it's Musical prowess in both  it's pure musical nature and in it's vocal and lyrical display. The most  incredible album by the Most incredible band.
6301966562|5.0|This movie is so charming I rent it once a year for Valentines Day, when I can find it on the shelf! Would buy it if the price weren't so high.
6305229449|5.0|A movie to see with the entire family, and friends. Mulan proves to all people that a young woman could do a mans job just as well as a man could; maybe even a bit better! It's a movie you can't get tired of seeing. Ties  in with The Lion King, Simba's Pride, and also The Prince of Egypt! I  recommend it to everyone!
0385493800|1.0|We know what to expect from Grisham -- more mind numbing stuff for long flights. And more suspense followed by no plot or climax.<br />Will he have had the respect to his readers to have the book edited? Doubtful -- we'll  be subjected to the same repetitive phrases.  Will he have had the courtesy  to have it proofread for the  simplest misspellings?  Doubtful -- he's too  busy cranking out pulp for cash.<br />Supposedly this book has only the barest  of physical descriptions of the characters -- don't want to spoil things  for the Hollywood casting people!
6305171769|5.0|Dont listen to some of the idiots above! This one is even better then the first Halloween! The musik is better,the mask looks a little better and it is scarier. Se it!

0688158129|5.0|I read this book last summer on the beach.  It was one of the best books I've read in a long time!  It really makes you stop and think -- about how far you would be willing to go for someone you loved.  To an extent the  characters were selfish -- but then again -- isn't most of today's society?   A girlfriend of mine  gave me the book. Once I finished reading it, we  found ourselves discussing it for hours on end. <br />It's been almost a year  and I still catch myself thinking about that book!
0140188711|5.0|What an amazing book.  I can't think of many books that can trace the story of a love affair the way this book does.  Like an arc, it starts with animosity and goes through flirtation, infatuation, love, obsession, and  descends into distate, resentment, morbidity.  This book exhausts  emotionally and absorbs intellectually.  Solal and Ariane are so  complicated and interesting as characters; and what an utter twit Ariane's  husband is!
0060920084|2.0|I was hoping that I would add dozens of interesting places to our vacation destinations for years to come. He could have presented the towns in a humorous manner without being so synical and negative.. The United States  has many wonderful towns with very caring and interesting people.
0140186409|2.0|I have to disagree with most of the reviews on this page. The book is no great American novel but it is not piece of sh*t either.  I had to read this book for my 11th grade AP English class and in general I like the  book. It has strong themes, great characters and lots of symbolism. The  Grapes of Wrath is more important as a political work that gives an  overview of the Great Depression than as a literary one. The details do get  very tedious. I had to read some chapters twice because I kept forgeting  who the characters were. Once the Joads start their journey all the  characters tend to blend together, especially the male characters.  Steinbeck also tried to throw a few to many symbols in. It got so bad that  I got a headache trying to find the deeper meaning in Tom using his own  urine to heal a cut. In the end though all you can do is get through it. I  doubt very much theres an American highschool student who hasn't read this  book&gt;
B00000ADG2|2.0|She has a good voice and all, but she really needs to think before she goes and starts talking.  For example, in the song&quot; Doo Wop, That Thing,&quot; she's basically dissing women that have &quot;hair weaves like  Europeans.&quot; But if you notice her hair in the video- guess what? She's  wearing a hair weave too, or else a bad wig. I can't tell. In the song  &quot;Superstar&quot;, she's dissing rappers who sample 70's music. But  what's that in the background of the song? A retread of the Doors'  &quot;Light my Fire&quot;! Somehow when I was listening to  &quot;Superstar,&quot;  the words &quot;KILLING ME SOFTLY WITH HIS  SONG&quot; took on a great deal of significance. And her rapping is  obviously jocking Lil Kim's style (without the cussing, of course) I could  have sworn I heard the line &quot;It's all About the Benjamins.&quot;   Look, she's a good singer and all, but on this album she's overly  opinionated to the point where I didn't really like this album.
B000009ED0|1.0|This CD was a dissapointment to me.  I heard it on the radio, and thought it was good, so I got it for a good price.  I listened to the song I liked, for about 5 minutes, then threw it in the trash...because thats what it is.   white trash tryin' to rap... this isn't like vanilla ice white honkey rap,  this is white honkey crap.  I thought it would be like r.a.t.m., but  frankly, it sucked, if you like country rap, get this cd, if you like  r.a.t.m, or korn, or any other hard/metal/rap band, get their CDs, this one  really isn't worth the money.
B000002H33|5.0|This is an absolute, defining album for Metallica. Probably one of their finest moments in the &quot;old&quot; Metallica and a must for anyone looking into Metallica.  This is it!!
6304994540|5.0|This movie got a tremendously bad rap by the clods who review movies for a living. This movie, if I may echo another review, ia an experience. One cannot put into words the comic appeal as well as the appeal to the soul  this movie had for me.  This movie, when appreciated by those who refuse to  believe that &quot;beans &amp; franks&quot; or sophomoric slapstick is  what's funny today, will enlighten you. I came away feeling: &quot;Life  isn't as bad as the news media makes it out to be.&quot;
B000001IPL|5.0|This is the best Offspring, and the best album of all time!! it is so up-beat and wow! thats how i have to explain it! :) IT IS THE BEST!!!
B00000DMJF|5.0|I wouldn't remove a single song from the White Album.  Some have said that it would make a better single album, but then it wouldn't be the White Album.  Every song on these two discs adds to the mood and mystery, the  lure and the lore!  This is a wonderfully recorded/produced album - its  tracks shine with amazing crispness.  It is also the Beatles' most  emotionally raw album.  It is mind-boggling just how diverse these  recordings are.  The Beatles were a the height of their powers when they  recorded this, and it seems that every style they attempted they hit a  bull's eye.  From the deleriously fun Beach Boy's send-up, Back In the  USSR, to the proto-heavy metal frenzy of Helter Skelter, and everything in  between, they could do not wrong on this legendary double album.  There are  simply too many great tracks to start discussing each of them, but I'll  list a few of my favorates:  Dear Prudence, Glass Onion, Happiness Is a  Warm Gun, I'm So Tired, Martha My Dear, Why Don't We Do It In The Road,  While My Guitar Gently Weeps, I Will, Sexy Saidie, Helter Skelter,  Revolution 1, Cry Baby Cry and on and on and on...  This belongs in every  Rock and Pop fan's music collection.  No &quot;ifs&quot; &quot;ands&quot;  or &quot;buts&quot;!!!
6305265488|5.0|For ONCE someone has portrayed Cinderella without making her a total ditz! Drew Barrymore was fantastic in her portrayal of Danielle! Where most people make Cinderella desirable solely based on her looks, the character  of Danielle is intelligent! I will stop now, because it would take more  than the 1,000 word limit to say everything!!! I LOVED this  movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000000W5L|5.0|This is a messy album.  It sounds messy, and it seems oddly sequenced.  But, that is part of what makes it so pleasurable.  It's the perfect sloppy rock album!  Besides, it contains some of the Stone's most memorable tunes.   Just listen to Rocks Off, Rip This Joint, Tumbling Dice, Sweet Virgina,  Let It Loose, and All Down the Line.  And, perhaps my favorate Stone's tune  of all time - Shine A Light!  Yeah, there's some filler on this double  album (single cd), but that only adds to the atmosphere and accentuates the  beauty of the truly great tracks.  A must for any fan of true, gritty rock  and roll.
6302814790|4.0|The real joy of this movie doesn't lie in its fun special effects, its twisted, albiet cheerful view of the afterlife, or Michael Keaton's Robin Williams impressions, but in its witty send-up of the New York art scene.   No community is so desperately in need of skewering but it's rarely done --  and even more rarely done well.<br />     Burton was kitschy before kitschy  was cool and he figured out early on that Robert Goulet's best work would  come in spoofing himself.   The film is aging nicely and along with 'Ed  Wood', it stands as the best example of Burton's whimsical, if slightly  malevolent world view.
B000001E18|5.0|This is a gorgeous album.  It it not U2's greatest album, but it is one of it's most sonically astonishing.  Except for the last track, which is a little weak, all these songs move U2 in a forward direction.  This album  has a very futuristic sound, (whatever that means).  You'll know what I  mean if you really take the time to listen to it - without distraction.   This album sounds like a movie soundtrack without a movie.  It has some of  U2's most beautiful melodies and carefully crafted studio wizardry.  If you  are not a U2 fan, this will probably convert you, and if you are a U2 fan,  give this one a try - it may not have the social/political force of their  80's albums, but it can be appreciated on its own merits.
0553573403|4.0|A terrific beginning to a series (but then I said the same thing about The Eye of the World by Robert Jordan. But as long as Mr. Martin takes the high road and puts out sequels that continue to advance the plot or develop his  characters, he should safely avoid the quagmire in which Jordan is  sinking).<br />Mr. Martin's ability to draw up characters who are unique and  distinguishable, who stir up and spur on the plot, helps to deflect  attention from the fact that the book is nearly 800 pages long. Very hard  to do and very commendable.<br />I am disappointed to hear that Martin plans  to write 6 volumes in this series because I fear Jordan-itis setting in,  with volumes of filler meted out over the course of a decade (or more)  before reaching catharsis. I'm willing to give Martin the benefit of the  doubt, hoping the remaining books will be as engaging as this one. If they  are, I welcome him to write sequels until the Day of Reckoning.
B000002UWF|5.0|Riding my jeep, listening to Louis Prima is my idear of fun. The cd never left my car, and now i listen to it whenever I am stuck in the traffic. That is: Twice a day...on the way to the agency and on the way home. Just  couldnt do without him.
0679720200|5.0|Believe it or not, This book is exactly what Zen life is supposed to be.  You eat, sleep, live your  ordinary life, and then you die alone. Accepting everything as they are without agreeing or disagreeing, that is the key of  this novel.
0767817478|5.0|Godzilla is the perfect movie.  It has sonething for everyone.  Its got action, suspense, romance, great special effects, humor, and it even has cool guys from France (who would have thought the French could be cool).   The casting is perfect.  Matthew Broderick is perfect as &quot;the worm  guy.&quot;  Maria Pitalo is perfect as the ex-girlfriend.  She's also cute,  totally cute.  Jean Reno is perfect as the head of the French Secret  Service. The ending, like &quot;old Yeller,&quot; will rip your heart out  (if you cried after they shot Old Yeller, you'd better grab a Kleenex,  you'll cry when they shoot Godzilla) unless you are in control of your  emotions. The DVD format is the perfect medium for a movie of this caliber.   The extras, however, are far from perfect. Its difficult to navigate on  the menu and you have to click your selection several times in order to get  anywhere (at least thats how it was with my DVD player). In conclusion, you  should buy the DVD for the movie and forget about the extras (unless of  course you're a fan of the Wallflowers and you haven't seen the video for  &quot;Heroes&quot;).
0440224764|1.0|This Grisham paperback is now in my wastebasket and I feel I've done my good deed for the day, saving someone else from reading this drivel.  To me, the kiss of death for any book is my ability to summarize it in one  sentence.  Although many books can thus be summarized, I find that I do it  only for real clinkers.  This is one of them.  My summary is: &quot; A guy  disappears and is found.&quot; I admit to a preference for happy endings.  This is one of many reasons I so love Dean Koontz's books.  But I don't  think I dislike a less-than-happy ending IF the groundwork has been laid,  or the reader can otherwise say, &quot;Yep, that works.  Sad, but it  works.&quot;  In this Grisham potboiler, NO foundation is laid anywhere for  the ending, which I assume was meant to be surprising or ironic or  something.  &quot;Oops, we'll just turn things upside down for a memorable  ending.&quot;  Memorable indeed.
0345347951|5.0|This is one of the most entertaining and imaginative science fiction books I've read.  Clarke uses suspense masterfully and keeps his diverse story segments brief.  The initial theme is fascinating and you find yourself  wanting desperately to find out what happens in the next  chapter.  It will  not end in any way you might imagine.  A wonderful book.
B000003BES|5.0|TALK ABOUT A ROCKIN' ALBUM, MAN!!!!!!<br />Need I say more. But anyway, get this album. Every song is a classic. I'm sure you'll recognize a few hits such as 'Satisfaction,' 'Time is on My Side,' 'Get off of My Cloud' and  'Play with Fire.'

6300263673|5.0|Patrick is fantastik in this movie. Women all over the world fell in love with him. The ending is the best part. The most erotic scenes are when he is teaching her how to mambo.
078322804X|5.0|Blues Brothers is simply the best film made in the 80s.It has everything: car accidents, cool jokes, exciting musicians (except the &quot;Good 'ole Boys). Simply said: a must-see. And, do not forget: They are on a mission  from God.
6301647734|5.0|Jimmy Stewart's portrayal of Doyd and the supporting cast make this comedy of errors wonderful.  The tippling Doyd and his 6 1/2 foot pooka companion are a treat for the senses.  A must see for Stewart fans and the movie that  will make anyone a Stewart fan!
B00000DHTF|5.0|I am a long time fan, I had Born to Run on 8-track tapes. I am thrilled with this box set. I constantly listen to it.  I always said that I would have a Springsteen song as my wedding song and now I do &quot;Happy&quot;  encapsulates my life now and it will be my wedding song in June. Solid  material throughout album. My favorites are &quot;Happy&quot;, &quot;Sad  Eyes&quot;, &quot;Dollhouse&quot;, &quot;The  Wish&quot;,&quot;Thundercrack&quot; and &quot;Take Em as They Come&quot;  I  cannot wait until they tour in the summmer.  Buy the set, it is one of the  best ever!
B000000WJZ|5.0|Billy Corgan really had a way with this CD, so much that I could feel the music. I get caught up in it, becuase the lyrics have so much meaning to them! Buy it!
6305229449|5.0|Mulan is a brave and loyal herione, who sends a good message of honor and love of country and family to young audiences. In comparison to other Disney movies the songs were not quite as catchy, with the expception of  &quot;Be a Man&quot;, which is accompanied by a great visual sequence. The  animation makes up for the songs, particularly the battle sceen, and the  black and red burned village, absolutly striking!The last two mintues were  definetly a dissapointing end to this touching and amusing animation.
B000002AGM|5.0|This is Miles at his most lyrical.  Beautifully tight, restrained phrasing make for a stunningly emotional &quot;cool&quot; jazz recording.  My favorite jazz CD.  Period.

B0000024SI|5.0|Hyperbole rules in customer reviews, but I honestly believe that this is the greatest album ever released. It almost certainly influenced the history of rock and roll more than any other single album made, even more than SGT PEPPER. Why? The greatest influence on the Beatles after their initial fame was listening to Bob Dylan. The influence of the single \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" alone was staggering. (It was released as a single months before the album.) Upon listening to Dylan and this album/song, Sam Cooke wrote a masterpiece in trying to imitate him (\\"A Change is Gonna Come\\"), as did Otis Redding (\\"Sitting on the Dock of the Bay\\"). Both Lennon and McCartney abandoned the pop love songs that had been the staple of the Beatles success through 1965 to write the more complex lyrics found on REVOLVER and RUBBER SOUL. Virtually every rock songwriter on both sides of the Atlantic had to rethink everything that they were doing with their music.  His previous albums had found a wide audience, but primarily in the folk scene.  This was true even of BRINGING IT ALL BACK HOME.  Primarily because of the success of \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" as a single, this was the first Dylan album that was primarily a rock album rather than folk.<br /><br />There are so many remarkable aspects to this album. The lyrics are so incredible as to seem beyond the capacity of someone as young and uneducated as Dylan, full of deep cultural resonances and references while maintaining a poetic perfection. Every fan can name his or her own favorites: mine are \\"Like a Rolling Stone,\\" the title song, \\"Ballad of a Thin Man,\\" \\"Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues,\\" and \\"Desolation Row.\\"  The success of the album made his earlier albums equally essential for rock performers, instantly providing rock with a verbal palette that dramatically extended the simple love song to almost any subject.<br /><br />One thing that sets this album from so many Dylan albums that followed is the excellence of the session musicians.  As great as Dylan is, on many of his albums he employs musicians that simply aren't among the best.  Take the guitar work alone.  Although Robbie Robertson would provide superb work on BLONDE ON BLONDE, no Dylan album after HIGHWAY 61 would feature such stellar solo work as what Michael Bloomfield would provide on this one.  The filler lines he provides at the end of the various lines in \\"Tombstone Blues\\" is just one example.  But as fine as Bloomfield is, he is matched by the astonishing playing by country guitarist Charlie McCoy on \\"Desolation Row,\\" who achieves the near impossible by playing eleven minutes of acoustic guitar in counterpoint to Dylan's strumming, and manages to make it compelling throughout.<br /><br />Above all else, HIGHWAY 61 REVISITED created the potential for rock to be difficult and challenging.  Before Dylan, no one listening to rock had to use more than just a tiny fraction of their brain.  After this album, rock became intelligent, or at least had that potential.  Take \\"Desolation Row.\\"  Apart from Chuck Berry telling Beethoven to roll over, rock contained in its first decade virtually no cultural references to speak of.  But in that song alone Dylan sings of Cinderella, Bette Davis, Romeo, Cain and Abel, the hunchback of Notre Dame, the Good Samaritan, Ophelia, Noah, Einstein, the Phantom of the Opera, Casanova, Nero, Neptune, the Titanic, Ezra Pound, and T. S. Eliot.  Rock had never been so literate before and has only rarely been this intelligent since.  Somehow in an eleven-minute song Dylan managed to sum up huge hunks of modern culture.  In conjunction with the other songs on the album, in particular \\"Ballad of a Thin Man\\" and \\"Highway 61 Revisited,\\" Dylan seemed to sum up all the alienation that the youth of the sixties was feeling in regard to the consumerism that had exploded in the fifties.<br /><br />It is hardly conceivable that any serious fan of music in general or rock in particular isn't already familiar with every second ofthis album, but if not, you must get it. On its own merits, it is one of the supreme cultural achievements of the century, and its massive influence on every single songwriter who grew up in its wake only makes knowing it all that more essential.y second of this album, but if not, you must get it.

B000003RCY|5.0|Tipped by a friend of mine who saw the film &quot;Lost Highway&quot; i bought the CD and it rules. Ok, the lyrics are in German, so the average English speaken person can't understand a word of it but the music kicks  *ss
0140177396|4.0|I read this book on vacation in Switzerland.  My aunt bought it for me and I read it through that very same night.

0380002930|5.0|It truly is a classic. I did find the religous stories of the rabbits to be boring, but other than that it is a solid five star read. Don't miss it!
B000000OUW|5.0|All that I can say is that you have to purchase this album if you like metal at least a little bit !!! Really good.
B00000FCBC|5.0|Some say they have lost it, others say they are a thing of the past, but in my mind Metallica is still the best they're just getting better.
0790739909|3.0|This movie has awed lots of people. Probably, most of them are yet to see Wim Wenders &quot;Wings of Desire&quot; and better yet, &quot;Faraway so Close&quot;, films on which this one was inspired. Basically, City of  Angels gets some of the best aspects of the original, and removes all the  poetry from it, and makes sure it's more Hollywoodian. The emotional  aspects are treated in the usual artificial manner, which greatly detracts  from the experience. Do yourself a favor, and watch &quot;Faraway so  Close&quot;, you can't go wrong.
B00000HZFP|5.0|The CD doesn't arrive until next week, via express UPS, but I have to echo the comments below.  &quot;Hedwig&quot; is in my top five all-time theater experiences, and believe me, I've seen a lot.  GO GO NOW TO NEW YORK TO SEE  HEDWIG, even though J.C. Mitchell has now departed the cast.  Not since the  Broadway cast of &quot;Chess&quot; have I so eagerly anticipated a CD  release.  Brilliant, daring, funny, heartbreaking, wonderful, more.  Buy  this CD, see the show, buy the T-shirt, kneel to the genius of John Cameron  Mitchell and Cheater and Trask and company.
B00000GAMD|5.0|I first heard this album 15 years ago, and find myself returning to my now worn-out cassette again and again.  For me it is a perfect introspection album, the music and the lyrics have the power to transport me back in  time. While some critics accused the lyricist of pomposity and  heavy-handness, I appreciate the way youthful exuberance, anger, and regret  all meld into one sweeping epic.  I'm excited to finally get my hands on  the CD!!!
0671867369|5.0|The best war book I have read.  I finished it in two days and then had to go back and read it again.  I really enjoyed the final chapter where you learn what happened after the war to all the men in E company you have come  to know.  The book has given me a true appreciation and awareness of the  sacrifices made by the veterans of WW II.
B00000AFWW|5.0|After hearing the first single released in Australia, Celebrity Skin, I liked the new sound of Hole straight away.  Courtney and the band has hit their all time best with this album.  After purchasing the CD, it took me a  few times through the whole CD to appreciate the combination of sounds.   Each track screams it's own identity. From hard rock guitar rifs with high  and low tempo combinations to the acoustic somewhat reminiscent Nirvana equ  song, THE ENTIRE CD ROCKS!
0385493800|3.0|I always read Grisham's books the day they're released.  The premise was excellent, and I hoped for more than I got.  After the first captivating chapter, the book dragged.  The bad guys had no redeeming qualities  whatsoever, and the good guys were not developed very well either.  Still,  I did think the book had a nice message worth pondering. For better plots  and characters, try Richard North Patterson and David Baldacci.

0920668372|5.0|Wow.  This book physically moved me.  Here I am, a busy professional woman, squeezing a book in between picking up my 6 yr old son from the sitter and picking up lumber samples for my architect husband and cooking  dinner--when all of a sudden I am hit with a torrent of emotion (okay, so  I'm a frustrated cheap romance novelist wanne-be).  I started reading this  book and darned if I didn't have to almost suppress a sob.  Pretty soon I  was turning away from my son to hide the tears.  By the time we finished  the book I was outright sobbing. <br />This book is just plain touching.  How  can a man put into words what only a Mom can understand?  And I thought it  was entertainment for my son.  Hah!
0788811363|5.0|This is a movie that takes you on a cinematic journey most akin to a modern Dr. Zhivago of any modern epic.  The English Patient is rich with texture and visual sensations.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who  experiences movies with all of their senses.
6305265488|5.0|I took my boyfriend to see this movie at much protest.  He didn't have any desire to see it cause he thought it would be romantic, sappy and not have enough to keep him interested.  He was pleasantly suprised.  We saw it  twice in the theatre together and he even went to see it again.  He has  even already ordered the video, and he is normally an all action flick  kinda guy. It's a movie that anyone can enjoy because the story is so tried  and true and it was so beautiful portrayed in this version.  Its a must  see!
0060916540|2.0|this book is highly overrated by fellow readers.  i could barely finish it.  compared to &quot;into thin air&quot; this was a drag.  the prose is boring and didn't hold my interest at all.   i had no &quot;feel&quot; for  the characters whatsoever, quite frankly didn't care one way or the other   what happened to them.
B00000DFRS|4.0|This album is an overall success. Whitney's voice is strong and clear and it displays alot of emotion. Diane Warren wrote three songs off this album which adds a more commercial quality to it. Although this is a powerful  album with great qualitys, It still doesn't add up to albums like  &quot;Daydream&quot; by Mariah Carey or &quot;Ray of Light&quot; by  Madonna. I also think that Mariah and Madonna are respected more for  writing their own material.
1567407757|5.0|I remember going into a bookshop and a certain book looked at me. At first I ignored it. A few days later I chanced to go into the same bookshop and I had this book beckoning at me for attention. Ever since I opened the first  page on the bus I admit I was looking forward to going back home from work  in order to lock myself wherever I could not be troubled by my kids and  imbibe it. A certainly fascinating book. So much so that Mitch Albom has  managed to turn me into one of Morrie's friends. I consider myself as such.  Thanks, Mitch for this delicious book.
B000001EL7|5.0|This is the last of the really great studio Kiss albums!   This one is full of classics that sound as original today as they did then!    Ace really steps up and blows everyone away with &quot; Shock Me&quot;!     In  addition to being an excellent guitar player, he is also a very good singer  ( Much better than Paul or Gene for sure)!   I only wish that Ace would  have sang on more kiss songs and saved us from  hearing paul's annoying  voice all the time!    Christine Sixteen is an instant Classic and the  wonderful politically incorrect lyrics are refreshing to hear these days!     Youll love this one!
B00000FCBC|3.0|I really like second CD in the set because now I have all my fav. B-sides on one CD. But I was kind of disappointed in the first CD. I was expecting more of the original Garage Days; you know, virtually unproduced so it  would retain that &quot;garage sound&quot; will the yelling and humming  that would tell us that it was recorded on one track with one take. The new  songs were over-produced in some cases. I really liked Astronomy, Turn the  Page and Whiskey in Jar. And I hate to admit it, but Tuesday's Gone would  have sounded SOOOO much better had it been produced. I say, buy the CD  whether you are a longtime fan, or a newbie.
B000001EKX|5.0|This may very well be their best album ( definately one of  their top 3 best albums)!   This is the shining example of Kiss in their prime!   Every tune on this one is killer!   My only complaint is that the sound quality  could have been better!    This album is often overlooked by many people!     If your a human being and have a set of  ears, then you will love this  album ( if not, then there must be something wrong with you)!    This album  is an Absolute Must have for your collection!
6300151379|5.0|It really is sad that people are charging up to $70 a copy for a used rental version of this tape.  Great movie and almost deserving the cost.  Jim Henson Studios has to see the need for this to be re-released along  with Dark Crystal!
B000000WFU|5.0|Songs of Sanctuary is the first of three Aiemus albums, featuring Miriam Stockley on vocals, the London Philharmonics, and Karl Jenkins as composer/creator.  The music is absolutely fantastic, and can be listened  to over and over again.  The later two Adiemus albums (Cantata Mundi and  Dances of Time) are equally worthy of listening.  Probably the BEST music I  have ever heard.
0140277447|4.0|The treatment of Japanese-Americans, on the west coast after Pearl Harbor, prompted me to look further to try to understand why our great country had to deal with them in such a heartless manner. I bought three books. Two,  written by family members who were subjected to internment, and Iris  Chang's, &quot;The Rape of Nanking&quot;. In &quot;Rape&quot;, Miss Chang  captures the outrage of the atrocities committed by the Japanese Army on  the Chinese solders and civilians of Nanking in all of their gory details.  Even if some of the details may be unverifiable, there is enough substance  to the book to make it a &quot;must read&quot; for anyone interested in the  history of World War II and the events that preceded it. For myself, it may  have provided some answers to my own interest in American actions  concerning  internment camps. Miss Chang's book makes it clear that the  American government was fully aware of the rape of Nanking. Could it be  then, that this knowledge of the brutality of which the Japanese army was  capable, could have had a bearing on our government's dispassionate  treatment of both the American born Japanese-Americans, and those that were  born in Japan and chose America for their new home? The only conclusion  that I was able to reach, was, that while the internment was extremely  unfair and costly to the Japanese-Americans involved, it was a colossal  inconvience by comparison to the rape of Nanking, and the bombing of Pearl  Harbor. The Nanking affair, which happened during the Roosevelt  administration, as did the attack on Pearl Harbor, must have influenced the  government's decision to act as they did.

Unlike his first books which attack and take shots at money laundering law firms with high billing rates, Grisham has shown once again he has developed a social conscience.

I thought THE STREET LAWYER was his best,  this is the best plot since THE PELICAN BRIEF.I can't wait for the movie.

It was truly an eye-opening look into the country of  Ireland's history although it was a grim look.  If you are looking for a  happy bright novel this is not it. If you are looking for a true to it's  time period no holds-barred novel, I highly recommend this book.
6300151379|5.0|When I was a child, this was one of the first films that I ever saw(and can still remember). I have always loved Labyrinth. I have the soundtrack CD and one of the original theatrical posters, but sadly, not the movie. I  have been EVERYWHERE, and been told the same thing-its not coming back.  Embassy entertainment is making a mistake!!!! I have it copied onto a tape,  but thats no good, I must have the original.
B000002L7J|5.0|This is the Smiths' best album.  Although not as popular as their debut or &quot;The Queen is Dead&quot;, &quot;Meat is Murder&quot; has a more primitive and dark feel than their other releases.  Morrissey's legendary  depression sounds real.  A forgotten masterpiece.
0780622553|5.0|I'll make it simple:  This is the best film I've seen in the last 5 years.  It's brilliantly directed, perfectly written and FULLY realized in every aspect.  If someone doesn't like this movie it's usually because they have  no appreciation of the genre (the pretentious sorts who look down on  horror/science-fiction).
0345350472|4.0|This book was great, and I had an enjoyable time reading it, but I felt that the plot was weak, just like the movie.  A detective who goes around hunting for &quot;replicants&quot; just doesn't make much of a story  anymore.  I can almost guarantee that if a book such as this were released  in the late 90's, it would certainly be passed, but as it is, this book was  awesome.   (The movie and game both put themselves in shame when compared  with the book.)
B000002KCC|5.0|I've found that my favorite records end up being the ones that take the longest to warm up to. &quot;Exile on Main St&quot; and the White Album were initially off-putting because the artists were dishing up something we  weren't expecting. It takes repeated listenings for the strengths of some  music to sink in.                           Though not quite up to those  albums' lofty standards, &quot;Tonight's the Night&quot; follows that same  pattern of rewarding the diligent listener. Here's one hint: this record  sounds best late at night. Don't try listening before midnight at least.
B00000AFFF|4.0|It's finally happened: Elvis Costello has turned into Frank Sinatra.  Actually, this album sounds to me like it could have come between &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot; and &quot;Punch the Clock&quot;: lushly  produced but surprisingly poppy.  But it's the sheer quality of the songs  that saves the day.

6303921248|5.0|I have seen at least 3 versions of Pride and Prejudice, and this is by far the best.  Not only that, but, as much as I love the recent award winning version of Sense and Sensibility, I believe that this mini-series is the  best production of a Jane Austen novel ever produced.      The writing is  crisp and entertaining, performances are extremely well done.  The actors  in this piece actually embody the fully rounded characters that Austen  intended, I believe.  Jennifer Ehle manages to find just the right delivery  of several lines that are taken verbatim from the Austen text that I have  never seen another actress be able to deliver with the proper lilt and  tongue-in-cheek humor that Austen is so known for.  And Colin Firth's  D'Arcy is the first that I have ever seen to manage the difficult shift in  character that the role requires--he makes it easy to see why Elizabeth  falls for him. I have watched this piece again and again, and still  discover new nuances.  A really great production!
6305066345|5.0|the great parts are the sex scene
6300151379|5.0|I, too, watched this movie first when I was about 8.  It was a rainy night, and I was home with my older brother and sisters (babysittying me, of course).  We ordered pizza and watched this great movie.  It's still one  of the few movies we can agree on as adults.  Please please PLEASE  rerelease &quot;Labyrinth.&quot;  It's one of Jim Henson's Creature Shop's  finest achievements (and David Bowie looks *fabulous* in tights!). It's a  &quot;must have&quot; for anyone who's ever enjoyed the creations of late  Jim Henson.  Things like this cannot be reproduced because of his death,  but need to be passed on to inspire imagination and creativity in our  children.
6303014100|5.0|Gettysburgh has become one of my favorite movies of all time. As a high school history teacher, I have come to respect the and admire the valor and bravery of the soldiers of this terrible war, accurately displayed in this  movie. The music adds so much to the passion and intensity of almost every  scene - a truly sad movie..a truly sad war.
630518299X|5.0|This is a must see movie that shows that reality is not always what it seems to be.  Coming off of mild reviews because Jim Carrey actually gets to act (brillianty) this movie is too deep for some.  I recommend this  movie to anyone who ever questions what kind of world we actually live in  or to anyone who thinks for that matter.
0800196341|5.0|Branagh's Hamlet is an extraordinary film. Branagh was brilliant in portraying Hamlet, as was Winslet and Jacobi. My only complaint is the hiring of actors like Jack Lemmon and Billy Crystal and Jack Lemmon.  Zeffirelli's Hamlet was better in some aspects. I believe it may be more  entertaining for people that are acquainted with Hamlet. Branagh is the key  to this movies greatness.
6304675348|3.0|This movie is very scary and is about a women who is an investigator. She then meets another women and they get married and two years later they have two children.
6305265488|5.0|I loved this movie, can't wait for the video to share the story with my daughters, age 9 - 15.  Angelica Houston was the PERFECT wicked stepmom.
B000006EBK|5.0|I still remember when it was originally released and the speculations that went on about how (the late) Bolin would fit the group - should he be a guitarist trying to sound like 'the man in black' or what. The album is  very different from any other Purple work and I find it the most  underestimated. The genius move Purple made with choosing Bolin was the  same as when they choose Coverdale to replace Gillan: a totally different  musician. The kind of funky guitar work is so far from Blackmore and, hold  your horses, Blackmore has NEVER had the same kind of groove in his  playing! It is also interesting, after nearly 25 years, to hear what  Coverdale sounded like in those days: on this album he delivers his most  agressive singing ever. Just listen to Drifter, The Dealer and Lady Luck;  in these songs he has a marvellous 'to-many-cigarettes-and-whiskey-voice'!  Glenn Hughes shines trough with his exellent singing in This Time Around -  a bluesy, almost gospel like thing that really makes you shiver. The album  ends off with the mighty You Keep on Moving. This song is an example of how  tremendously well Coverdales/Hughes voices did match each other. In this  killer they take their singing to unequalled hights. This album still  tastes great after 25 years of agening! Tomas Lange
B000002UZ6|5.0|There are so many Tina Turner albums to pick from, but this one has such great tunes.
B000001Y9I|5.0|The first new Deep Purple album for some time, with a new guitarist to replace a legend - could it work. From the first listen - YES and YES again. I'm fed up with these &quot;dinosaur rock&quot; idiots, it seems if  it was the 70's it's bad. Get real and listen to a band that can play and  mesh together like very few I know. The album ranges from rock (not as  heavy as some in the past - maybe about Stormbringer level) to a touch of  latin to beautiful ballads and some celtic/country. How many of today's one  note wonders can do that!!!!!!!!! Vavoom opens with typical Purple blast -  it's good and hard with some nice riffs and brilliant rhythms (shades of  Highway Star). In no particular order from there - Sometimes I feel Like  Screaming and Cascades are beautiful ballads and show (again!!!) that Ian  Gillan is not just a screamer. My personal favourite is The Aviator (like  Sky Pilot) - a great celtic/country piece that really shows off all the  talents of the band. How about a single!!!. Rosa's and Hey Cisco add a  touch of Latino rock to the offering and bring to mind Mexico and the old  westerns - brilliant. Somebody Stole My Guitar and Loosen My Strings to me  are very similar and probably the weakest of the songs but they do get you  in and are very listenable. A Castle Full of Rascals, Soon Forgotten and A  Touch Away are really gentle type songs that show the new group off well.  It finishes off with the Purpendicular Waltz. I didn't know what to expect  with that title but it's a great closer. The band still has the same skill  levels and that INCREDIBLE undefinable ability to feed off one another and  become more than the individual parts. I like it better than Abandon (their  latest album) and recommend it to anyone who appreciates real ability in  musicians.
0671015206|5.0|The negative reviews here strike me as unfair.<br />First, the book is primarily descriptive (hence the title), not a compilation of how-to-live advice.  The authors suceed in describing in great detail how the group of  wealthy Americans they interviewed lived their lives and made financial  decisions.  <br />Second, they do have opinions RE what they found, and these  are not hard to discern.  But they don't tell anyone not to enjoy life, or  never to splurge.  <br />Third, they don't claim strict scientific rigor.   Indeed, in the interests of full disclosure, they reveal their selection  methodology in the back.   Fourth, they are wise enough to recognize that  many of their findings can be interpreted in different ways.  When that is  the case, they let the reader draw their own conclusions.  <br />Fifth, HOW  ARE THEY REPETITIOUS?  Obviously, there are a few unifying THEMES  throughout the book:  millionaires tend to live below their means, they  focus on ownership not consumption, etc.  But the book does not repeat the  same data or findings.  <br />Sixth, there is no question that some of the  themes covered here amount to financial &quot;common sense.&quot;  But the  interest of the book lies in how, concretely, people live out these  principles.  No book I've ever seen comes close to doing this as well.  <br />As someone who is frequently consulted about financial matters, I have  recommended this book to several friends, and all of them have felt it well  worth their time.  If you approach the book with an interest in personal  finances and an open mind, I very much doubt that you will be dissapointed.
B000005RS6|5.0|Deep Purple built their reputation on their live shows - and 30 years later they could easily start again if this is any indication. I saw them in 1971 in Sydney and would have loved to be at this concert. They make a  habit of blasting out of the blocks and Fireball is just that - a blazing  mix of soaring guitar and the start of a tour de force by drummer Ian  Paice. Who needs Blackmore the legend (okay he helped make the group) -  Morse can give the group what it needs now. The great thing about this is  that the stale decades old (it seems) set has been cleared out, renewed and  some brilliant new numbers brought in. There's some mixups but this is LIVE  ROCK and that's part of the gig. The group is able to give us some REAL  ROCK AND BLUES CLASSICS - Maybe I'm A Leo, Pictures Of Home, Perfect  Strangers Noone Came, WABMC - these 5 songs to me are classics that should  be recognised as such by rock fans. They evoke all the emotions that great  music does and shows a band that is so talented it's freakish. There are  some other old numbers and some new ones that just confirm that talent and  show the world that music is emotional and not just clinincal or one note  wonders. The star of this album is Ian Paice. If you couldn't feel the  emotion and passion in his work you would almost say it was a drum machine  - how can any man play like that. And his combination with Roger Glover  gives the band an unshakeable rhythm section that anyone should envy.  Jon  Lord's organ work shows his classical background - note perfect and his  interplay with the others must be telepathic. Steve Morse and Ian Gillan -  they complement each other and together manage to bring greatness back to  live rock music. If you want head down, one note thrashing - don't buy  this. If you want classic live rock (with some classical stuff thrown in),  ballads, country, latino, celtic, brass and just about everything all  topped off with what is almost perfection of performance - this is the live  album for you. One of the all time live classics. Up there with Made In  Japan, Hot August Night, Grand Funk Live and the other live rock  masterpieces. I just wish their audience was as wide as some of the lesser  bands. They deserve better response.
6305229449|4.0|I remember last summer when I took my daughter to see it in the theater.  I seem to have more fun than she did.  But we both love it.  Disney contiunes to out do themselves.  It was a formulated story plot line, with  the songs neatly placed in between to set the mood and tone etc.  But it  was very well done, and I loved the fact that a girl was the hero.   Something long over due in cartoon films.  And my favorite song is Donny  Osmond singing I'll  make a man out of You.  Plus I love all of Disney's  Villians they have the best villians that I have ever seen in cartoons.   Frightening and menacing just the right touch.   The Huns were bad!!  So  buy it sit back and enjoy it with the kids.  You'll love it!!
B000002KIE|5.0|Everything else (money, talent, McLaran, Spungen, etc., etc.)aside, this album is hillarious. The  Sex Pistols were, and are, mass market art at its most glorious apex of self-parody. The fact the Pistols can't play, their  lyrics are infantile, and they're just plain ugly is the point. We,  consumers, love it. Hell, I've bought the CD at least four times: it always  seems to be stolen. I'll buy it again. And Johnny Rotten et al can laugh  themselves right to the bank.
0385486804|4.0|Into the Wild was suggested as a good read by A.W. as a parting gesture and in realization that our relationship had ended.  There could have been no more appropriate read to which I can forever look back and  reference as  my darkest life experience, losing the woman who gave it to me.  This book  is a masterpiece of sadness, and even its animated, lively moments are  portentious of the despondent conclusion.Krakauer seemed to both absorb the  life of Chris McCandless and relate deeper moments of his own to glean out  this young man's motives.  McCandless was a tragic figure, whose demise was  brought about by a desire to step outside, push the envelope, and leave as  many of the trappings of civilization as possible.  He seemed to present an  almost indestructable resiliance, yet ended with such a sad, almost sweet,  weakness.  The story is  a human tale of the first order, loaded with an  expanse of interesting characters and locations with character.  McCandless  journeyed with his journal, and left a record that made the book  possible.This story revolves around the last years of Chris McCandless, but  it feeds the achy wunderlust in all of us, and saddens the careing, family  people that represents most of us.  In the end, Chris was a nice, good  person, who died and left us with a rich story, but far poorer for his  absence in the long run.
B000001ELL|3.0|Im a musician and a serious music fan!    Many people seem to dislike this album!   Ive been listening to all types of music for 20 years and Im telling you &quot; THIS ALBUM IS NOT THAT BAD&quot;! I agree that it is no  where near their previous albums in quality, but it is much better than  every album they released after it ( except &quot;Creatures of the  night&quot;)!    One of the most common complaints that  humans use to  describe it is &quot; Too Disco&quot; ( what the heck is wrong with disco)?      It used to be cool to put disco down and some people still do not  realize that disco is just a different type of dance music!   Why shouldnt  Kiss add a new dimension to their music!   And the only disco songs I hear  on this album are the 2 best songs on the album (&quot; I was made for  loving you&quot; and&quot; Sure know something&quot;)!  Those 2 songs are  timeless classics as well as 2000 man!   The rest of the album is not as  good!   I agree that this album is not a &quot; Great album&quot;, but it  is by no means a &quot; Horrible album&quot;!   After this album they  really went down hill fast ( with the exception of &quot; Creatures of the  night&quot;)

0385493800|1.0|I have been a Grisham fan since A Time To Kill. Before every body got on the bandwagon with The Firm (still Grisham's best work to date). His recent work has sucked. He has gotten lazy. I will not be buying this one ( but I  will check it out at the library). Notice how all the reviews are good  BEFORE the release then SUCK after the release? Take a hint from a fan,  save your money! Let's send 'ol Johnny a message with our wallets to get  his tail in gear!

B000003S2K|5.0|I may not be frightened of flying, but I certainly have enough fears and stress in my life to warrant something soothing.  Music For Airports elicits calm in a way that only the best musical compositions do.  It  transports you to a peacful state, yet it's still highly listenable.  This  work has come in and out of my life several times since it was released and  it always seems to fit the prescription.  I suggest trying it during a  traffic jam, an anxious moment, or as a precursor to romance.  You won't be  dissapointed.
B0000062Y2|5.0|I adore all of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Plays and this one is no exception. JCS is perfect for the musical lover and rock'n'roll fan alike. The original broadway cast is good too but I definiatly prefer this version. A  must have!

B000002UDV|5.0|This is the most fully realized record in rock's history.  Fully rich in melody and counter melody, Brian Wilson clearly just wasn't meant for these times. People often speak of its theamtic merits, and while this is wholly  valid, it's also not as interesting as it would be to break it down.  Quite  simply, &quot;God Only Knows&quot; is the greatest song ever recorded.   Each song has it's own personality, from the self obsessed melancholy of  &quot;I Just Wasn't Made For These Times&quot; to the sheer adolescent  angst and rage of &quot;Sloop John B.&quot;  If &quot;Caroline, No&quot;  doesnt bring you to tears, than no pop song ever will.  This record is as  close as pop ever got to classical and complex style arrangements (without  fouling things up).  The fact alone that it was monumental enough to  inspire &quot;Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; gives it a certain  weight.  &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; is perfect, something you can very rarely  say about a rock record anymore.
B0000028RR|5.0|This is by far one of the best CD's ever made!  It features amazing guitar, original lyrics, and of course some of the best bass I've ever heard.  This album is so much better than Evil Empire, it's not even funny.   The begining of Killing in the Name and  the haunting guitar of Know Your  Enemy have been in my head ever since I bought it!  If you get one CD,  definetly get Rage Against the Machine!
B000005IU2|5.0|This album is truly greater than the sum of its parts- take any one single song alone and its ferocious power is lost, but together it creates the one and only punk rock opera.  As for the Stooges themselves, they may have  been stupid, but this stupidity was a vehicle to imbibe you with their  feral intelligence.  Completely capable songwriters and players, they were  at the height of the late- 60's, early- 70's avant garde.
0394586735|5.0|I found this excellent piece of work some years ago, and have probably read it five times since.  I've also given it as gifts, and I have the video, which starred Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson.<br />It dipicts an era  in England's history to which we rarely -- if ever -- are exposed.  I am  sorry those readers who didn't care for it were not able to see that, in  it's own way, it's a very exciting story.  It was the NATURE and  PROFESSIONALISM of &quot;those in service&quot; to make everything run  quietly and smoothly.  THAT was dedication to one's job, and it was a proud  servant to did it well.<br />I LOVED this book.  Try it again, with a differnt  attitude.  Not every book has to be murder, mystery, and mayhem.
B0000020C4|5.0|Colm Wilkinson is, without a doubt, THE Valjean. Philip Quast is, without a doubt, THE Javert. Ruthie Henshall is, without a doubt, THE Fantine. Michael Ball is, without a doubt, THE Marius. They are all found on this  recording. Need I say more? I loved Lea Solonga's Eponine (although I am  partial to Frances Ruffelle). Michael Maguire is tied with Anthony Warlow  as my favorite Enjolras (who is also my favorite character). I also  (personally) thought Judy Khun did a fine job though not many seem to agree  with me. In short, you will find many of the most talented actors of Les  Mis. performing on this CD. It is simply breathtaking and is a must-have  for any fan of Les Mis (or any musical for that matter). You will most  likely never again find such a talented ensemble performing at one place at  one time. Special mention for Hannah Chick for not being startled by the  popping balloon.
1573225517|5.0|A great book, the intertwining of pop culture throughout made it a very human book.  It shows how not only music and movies affect us but how they affect everyone around us.  The story of the relationship between Rob and  Laura is bitersweet.  Everytime Rob makes another attempt to regain Laura  you want him to succeed, no matter how illogical the plan.  All in all a  great book that reads fast.
0792151712|2.0|When people review this movie they usually either LOVE IT or HATE IT. What happened to the middle ground? I think why a lot of people hate it is because of the hype. The heard it was the best movie ever but were treated  instead to an alright movie. If the hype was gone, the haters might have  enjoyed it more. Think about it: You rent or see a movie because YOU think  it looks pretty good. You see it and it stinks. O.K. You leave thinking it  stunk but you don't HATE it. But if you went to see a movie because  everyone was singing it's praise and you didn't like it, you feel like  you've been robbed by the movie and the people who added to the hype. Most  of the people who loved it were girls I believe. They went to see Leo. If  Cameron did what GEORGE LUCAS did for STAR WARS (cast new faces) one would  wonder if the film would've done as well. I personally think THE EMPIRE  STRIKES BACK and RETURN OF THE JEDI  were much better films. The bottom  line is: If you LIKED it, like it for what it is, NOT because of Leo or  because it made you cry. If you HATED it, hate it for what it is and quit  making excuses for hating it just because it wasn't worth the hype. The  movie was by no means the best movie out there, but it really wasn't some  God-foresaken Satan-spawn.
0767811038|1.0|Okay, I'm biased; I'm a huge fan of the book and have been for the past 13 years since I first read it. I knew Hollywood wouldn't be able to get this film right and the celluloid trash that was finally produced only proved  it. It could have been so much better...I don't need to make a laundry list  of all the problems, especially with the military aspects of the film, the  ridiculous physics..it just goes on and on.<br />SFX do not make a movie all  by themselves. The second time I saw this film on video and paid attention  to it I couldn't believe the horrid dialog, almost anyone could have done a  better script.<br />Powered armor, a key concept of the book was absent and I  don't buy the producer's excuse of &quot;It would have been too expensive  to have 300 suits made&quot;  Uh..did you even read the book? A platoon of  CAP troopers was only about 10 men. The reason they were trained the way  they were is that they had to rely on their buddies who they couldn't even  see. They can CG thousands of bugs but no powered armor?<br />And I'm sorry,  but anyone who's had any military experience had to laugh at all the  grab-assing the characters did in the barracks (which looked more like a  clubhouse).<br />Somebody could do a remake, call it 'Robert A. Heinlein's  Starship Troopers'. Mix in the terror of films like 'Platoon', the  de-humanizing of 'Full Metal Jacket', PAY ATTENTION to the book and the  characters in it, and they'd have a great movie.<br />Verhoeven's Starship  Troopers should just be blown out the airlock.
6304539258|5.0|The Star Wars saga is Cinema at it's peak. I say saga because you can't watch one without watching the others. However contrary to popular belief, Star Wars is not sci. fi. It falls into the action, drama, adventure, and  fantasy genre more than it does sci. fi. So what if it takes place in  space? Has everyone forgotten that it also takes place A LONG TIME AGO, IN  A GALAXY FAR, FAR AWAY? If thats not fantasy what is? Besides Lord of the  Rings of course. Anyway if you're worried that Star Wars is &quot;Just  another sci. fi. flick&quot; why don't you try actually watching it?
6305079900|5.0|What more can be said than what already was.  However, people should be aware of the fact that the orginal film was release with a MONO sound track.  So the complaints that someone screwed up on the transfer are just  examples of peoples ignorance!<br />I would not want someone dinking around  with sound track just to make is sound prettier.  It would be just as bad  as those God Awful colorized movies that cause such a big stink a few years  ago.  I am glad that this movie still retains the integrity and character  it was released with.

This album is great and so greatly put together that I would have died if she hadn't won the Grammy for it. But, the  amazing thing is that I don't speak a word of Spanish, and I still love  this album.  Esp. the fantastic rythems behind the title track &quot;Mi  Tierra&quot;.
0783225903|5.0|I'd just like to correct one misconception: the version of the movie on this DVD is *not* the original European release.  (I have the European version on tape, and the annotated screenplay. I've seen &quot;Brazil&quot;  more times than I'd care to admit, so trust me on this.)<br />Basically, this  is the &quot;definitive&quot; version Gilliam made for the Criterion  release. It's very similar to the European release -- the only obvious  change is that it starts with clouds and music, rather than just the time  on a black screen.<br />Anyway -- in my opinion, this is the second greatest  movie ever made.  (#1 is &quot;2001&quot;.)  Like most good movies, it  polarizes the audience -- you'll either love it or hate it.  Either way,  you owe it to yourself to watch it.
B00000DFMM|3.0|I loved &quot;A Secret Wish&quot; when I first owned it in the mid-eighties.  Catchier, smarter, and more lushly-textured than a lot of other pop music of its time.  The first song on the disk is &quot;A Dream  Within A Dream,&quot; in which they set a poem by Edgar Allen Poe to music.
0553212737|5.0|I read this book for the first time when I was 12. Liked it then, love it now.  After every movie adaptation, I feel compelled to return to the sour ce and have always found Austin's presentation the best.
B000002INJ|5.0|There are no many words to say about this lofty work by Eric Adams and Co.: it's simply the real, true, unmistakable milestone along the neverending road of epic metal. They ARE the fathers of epic metal, we  can't deny it and I think there are no others groups that can reach this  intense and frightning power although during these last years thousands of  epic metal projects appeared and although they could be considered  &quot;old&quot; by fans of the modern false metal bands. I don't think so,  maybe because I'm a defender, maybe 'cause I love the beautiful music. What  else? If you like the power and epic atmospheres, well, buy this album and  remember to help us fighting the false metallers...DEATH TO THEM!!!

B00000AFWW|1.0|The raw energy this band once possessed has really gone. The music sounds hollow and contrived,almost plastic. Really sad.
0060392584|5.0|I hated Marilyn Manson before I read this book. I thought he was evil, stupid, gross, dumb, sick and, inhuman. But his words in this book changed my heart toward him and it will change your thoughts and beliefs about him  too! READ THIS BOOK!!!
B000002UAC|5.0|This is a fun album. There's an undeniable energy to these songs and an overwhelming sense of innocence.  &quot;All My Loving&quot; is one of Paul's catchiest, most endearing songs.  The rest is nearly as exciting and  uplifting to hear.  An interesting tidbit:  &quot;I Wanna Be Your Man&quot;  was originally written by John and Paul for the Rolling Stones - and it  became the Stone's first hit single!  Also, is it just me, or is &quot;Hold  Me Tight&quot; one of the sloppiest Beatles' recordings ever?  The song's  timing seems completly off, as well as Paul's bass playing and singing.   And the lead guitar sounds awful.  It almost sounds like the master tape  sat in the sun to long and became stretched and distorted.  Strangely,  though, I still enjoy this song - probably because it's such an extreme  oddity in the Beatles catalogue!
B00000DGUG|5.0|This is an awesome album. anyone with taste should buy it!!!!  The lyrics are really terrific.  Great follow-up!!!
0152438181|5.0|The Little Prince is simply one of the most profound books ever written. It incorporates simple truths, which will make us rexamine our life, our values, and our outlook. I would reccomend it to a mother, to read to her  infant and to the business man, as a must read.
0385493800|3.0|This is the first Grisham book that I've read in a few years.  I read it on a long flight, and it was impossible to put down.  The legal stuff was the usual interesting twists and turns.  The characters were likable - and  I could see the movie being wildly successful.  I vote for William Hurt for  Nate O'Reilly, just tragic enough, with a glimmer of hope in his eyes. The  thing that bothered me was that the book was supposed to be centered on one  man's conversion to God.  The sections covering the conversion were  astonishingly thin.  Take it from me, life changing, miraculous spiritual  experience are challenging to describe, but that is the writer's task.   Grisham spent an enormous amount of time describing the South American  landscape, the characters, the diseases and wildlife.  Much time was spent  describing and redescribing the shifty, ugly heirs to the  fortune at hand.   Only about five paragraphs covered the religious conversion of a really  troubled man.  I wonder if that's the one experience Grisham could only  imagine, having never personally experienced the merciful and healing love  of God.
0399143904|1.0|First of all I am a big fan of Mr. Clancy but his latest novel Rainbow Six was absolutely disappointing. It seemed like someone elso wrote this book or maybe Mr. Clancy finally burnt out (after all he is writing too much  anyway!!). These are the main reasons why I was so disappointed: 1. The  set-up of a NATO anti-terrorist unit - why were about 80% of the members US  soldiers (so far I haven't heard of any successful military anti-terror  operation by US forces). By the way there are 16 nations in NATO (soon to  be 19). Why was there an Israeli operator - didn't know the Israelis are  part of NATO yet? The French are only political members! 2. Why on earth  would souvereign states like Austria, Swiss and Spain call in a NATO force  and not use their own highly specialised anti-terror forces. 3. I've never  heard of any SpecForce that went after the heads of terrorists rather than  the body itself. Even with the emerge of body-armour there is no need for  head-shots 4. The abuse of my native language (German). I've read many  books in the English original but I never discovered anything like Rainbow  Six 5. And finally there was no life in the characters of the story unlike  in the Rest of Mr. Clancy's highly rocommendable work. This - my opinion -  is of course open to discussion.
6305229449|5.0|I just love this story.  I never get tired of watching how Mulan replaces her father in the army so that he will not have to fight in another war.  I think she is so funny when she has to make everyone think she is a man.  Eddie murphy is a great MuShu. His voice was perfect.  She has the strength  and courage that I hope I see in my daughters when they grow up.
B000002UVX|5.0|Hendrix is the only guitar player who I can listen to every time and hear something new.  This album sounds much better than the other live recordings from the experience days.  Hendrix's guitar playing is much  looser and he seems more comfortable since he doesn't have to sing much in  these songs.  The only weak point is the drumming.  I feel mitch mitchell  was a much better drummer and he could have added some dynamics to the  songs.
B00000DHRZ|5.0|It is a great record full of great songs. Non of the songs ****
6300151379|5.0|This is an excellent movie.  Please rerelease it because I have a recorded copy but it isn't the same.  It is just about wore out anyway.
0385493800|3.0|It's is amazing to me how many people can &quot;review&quot; this book before it is even published.  And then, perhaps even more amazing, is the change in reviews once it actually hits the streets - the book simply isn't  what people were anticipating from a good writer.  Grisham's works have  steadily gone downhill with the last three books although this one is  certainly better than the Street Lawyer.  It seems as if Mr. Grisham has  gotten lazy about his writing and turns them out based upon the publishers  schedule and not his own creative motivation.  Although this was  entertaining and an easy read, I've come to expect more from the author and  so was disappointed.  This will be the last time I lay down good money for  the hardback edition of his works and will wait patiently for the paperback  version or the local library.
6304539282|5.0|It is so great, but it is probably better on DVD George please put it on DVD I would buy it right away.

B0000060NA|5.0|I wasn't even born when this album was first released, but I can place my hand on my heart and say that not only is it the greatest album ever recorded, but modern music could not exist had it not been recorded. Such  is the power and all pervading influence of this work of genius, that since  the late seventies there has not been a group, an album or even a single  which does not owe something to Stevie. Live without this album if you  like, but you don't know what you're missing.
6302135621|5.0|If you look at the number one spot on the film instutes list of the top one hundred films of all time, Citizen Kane will be sitting there. and rightfully so. This film is brilliant, from it's beautiful camera angles to  it's study of one man, viewing him from so many different angles, to it's  gorgeous editing (The breakfast scene) welles at his best!

6304467583|5.0|The Godfather Trilogy is the most amazing set of movies that could ever have been made.  The third film wasn't nearly as gripping and exciting as the first two, but it was needed to sum of the family history and finish  off the trilogy.  Pacino performed better in this trilogy then in any other  films to this day.  Brando is phenomenal in the first film as the  overpowering Godfather.  Nothing could have been better in this epic  trilogy.
0385333846|4.0|I find the style of this book to be close to that of CATCH 22 , but not as good.  However having said that, it is an excellent book.  Its time jumping is its strongest feature, but if you like that aspect, CATCH-22 does it  better.
0385493800|5.0|I have read the first two chapters of John Grisham book,&quot;THE TESTAMENT,&quot; and I think that it is awesome! I am building a library of his writings and Movies.  Presently, I have to do more reading to complete  this new book and several others of his writing.
0451191153|5.0|I re-read it because I miss the characters
B0000027I6|5.0|At first, this album came across to me as self-indulgent, political, and too complex.  But since I've given it a second chance, it's become one of my favorite cd's.  This album is a combination of &quot;The Wall&quot;,  &quot;The Final Cut&quot;, and even a touch of &quot;The Pros And Cons Of  Hitchiking&quot;. On this record, Roger's unorthodox songwriting, chilling  lyrics, and signifigant political themes shine to their fullest potential.   This is of course due to the absence of former bandmates.  However, the  talents of David Gilmour &amp; co. are very well supplimented by artists  such as Don Henley, Jeff Beck, and even a cameo appearence by Marv Albert.   Allthough Roger's voice has evolved through the years, he still exhibits  the dominant emotional vocals as he has in &quot;The Wall&quot; and  &quot;Animals&quot;.  The songwriting (all brilliantly arranged epics  relating mainly to world politics) most closely resembles that displayed in  &quot;The Final Cut&quot;.  However, what makes this album so special is  that the songs have the spacey/dreamy continuity displayed by Roger's works  in &quot;The Wall&quot; and &quot;Pros And Cons&quot;.  Unfortunatley, this  album (like &quot;The Final Cut&quot;) is too political and too unorthodox  for most peoples' tastes.  And like &quot;Pros And Cons&quot; (also a  suberb record), &quot;Amused&quot; failed to reach the masses just based on  the fact that it doesn't carry the ever-so-important &quot;Pink Floyd&quot;  title, which is a shame.  So basically, in sum, this record will never be a  crowd fave. But, if you are one who enjoyed Roger's work in &quot;The  Wall&quot;, you very well might enjoy &quot;Amused To Death&quot;.  And if  you liked &quot;The Final Cut&quot;, you will surely love this record.  As  Roger sings in his global anthem, &quot;Can't you see...It all makes  perfect sense!&quot;
0684833395|5.0|No Matter how many times I revise my top 5 list, CATCH-22 is ALWAYS on it.  Absolutely Brilliant. A time volley with no compass.
B000003TBP|1.0|Everyone (but a few people) seems to love this album, but I don't see why.  When Beck came onto the scene in 1994, he had an image and a sound.  &quot;Mellow Gold&quot; was an excellent alterna-folk masterpiece that  captured the original essence of the &quot;Loser&quot; himself.  Beck's  debut &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot; captures that even more so.  Untill  &quot;Odelay!&quot;, Beck wrote silly comedic folk songs.  He was just some  loser with a folk guitar who sang loveable innovative folk tunes like  &quot;Pay No Mind&quot; and &quot;Bogusflow&quot;.  Songs as such are the  defining measure of what Beck is.  Songs like &quot;Where It's At&quot;,  &quot;Devil's Haircut&quot;, and &quot;New Pollution&quot; are pretty much  the direct opposite of what Beck once was.  So they may be radio freindly,  who cares?  To see Beck rapping and dancing around in an arena of lights is  nearly blasphematic, considering he came up as a loner singing slow, silly  folk songs, played on an old guitar secured to him by a rope. Basically, if  you like Beck in any form, this record should be easy to learn to love.   However, if you are a fan of the original &quot;loser&quot; (as am I), you  will find this record a mockery of a one-time enjoyable songwriter/stage  presence (or lack thereof).
B000000OQF|5.0|Every track on this one is good. It has 3 of GN'R's greatest hits on it: &quot;Welcome To The Jungle,&quot; &quot;Paradise City,&quot; and &quot;Sweet Child O' Mine.&quot; This is a complete masterpiece, and was  definitly one of the best CDs of the 1980s.
6304118406|1.0|Oliver Stone's attempt at a psychedelic rendition of BADLANDS comes off as an empty shell of a film, and 4 HOURS of it is intolerable.  Sure, if you're into seeing Ashley Judd and Denis Leary in parts that effect the  film in no way whatsoever or see Stone get even more childishly grotesque  in the decapitation of Tommy Lee Jones, then I guess this widescreen  edition is for you.  But unlike his exceptional TALK RADIO and JFK, here  the essentric, paranoid director takes sensationalism too damn far and  never comes back: he has nothing new to say.  Instead of exposing the  hypocrisies of our country or frightening ways the media turn killers into  heros, he just goes into a foray of violence and ends up w/ a big pile of  MTV-influenced, masturbatory nonsense.
0385493800|1.0|B-o-r-i-n-g! &quot;The Testament&quot; has a thin plot that loses the readers interest after the first few chapters. I bought this book on the strength of readers reviews and was very disappointed--no suspense, no  tension.

0312853238|5.0|I just finished Ender's game, and I loved it!! I am 12 years old, and I think that Card did an excellent job on this book. I reccommend this to any parent of a kid, or just a kid at heart, that loves science fiction,  because this book proves that the little ones are the ones that count.
B000002AGY|5.0|This cd contains concierto a 20 minutes long journey for the soul. I used to own the vinyl version (bought it in 1978) and then got the CD. The concierto track is probably the single piece of music i love most. It will  stay with you for the rest of your life.
0800196341|5.0|Anyone who complains about this movie being too long should have his head examined and his diaper changed.  GET OVER IT.  Greatness does not cater to saturday morning cartoon attention spans.<br />As for some particulars: <br />The  soundtrack is noticeably below the Patrick Doyle standard set in Branagh's  &lt;Henry V&gt; and &lt;Much Ado&gt;.  It isn't just intrusive, but  downright wrong at times.  You may have noticed that some trailers for  &lt;Hamlet&gt; use music from the (beautiful, masterful) &lt;Henry V&gt;  soundtrack.  That alone should tell you something.<br />The sets and costumes  are lovely.<br />With the exception of Lemmon, the cast is superb.  Note  especially Brian Blessed as Hamlet Sr. and what's-his-name as  Laertes.<br />But it doesn't get any better than Ken as Hamlet and Derek as  Claudius.  These are two *master* actors, not some Hollywood-choice stars  who are only good for close-ups.  Finally, finally I can forget the memory  of Gibson as Hamlet.  <br />This is an absolute triumph for Branagh.  He is  the greatest living Hamlet of his time: just ask Jacobi, his predecessor.
B000002N2Z|5.0|Adrenaline is the Deftones amazing debut album.  With Abe's incredible beats, Stef's and Chi's awesome rifs and Chino's uncomparable voice this blend of rap, metal, and punk envelopes your soul. From soft whispers to  screams of angst Chino is one of the few artists that sings deep and  emotional.  The songs are constantly having major mood swings with Chino's  belting screams shining through.  &quot;Bored&quot; the first track is  awesome when he sings you can hear the pain in his voice no to mention the  other great songs like &quot;7 words&quot; and &quot;Engine #9&quot;. It's  well worth every cent, you won't regret buying this CD.
B000002KKS|3.0|This album starts off brilliantly, but the last few songs seem like filler. &quot;Walk Away&quot;, in particular, is so lightweight and poppish that you might almost be listening to Kiss rather than Black Sabbath.
0553108034|3.0|Great characters.  One of the only 'fantasy' stories in which I think the author is playing with the idea that in a feudal agricultural society, people grow up faster and 15 year olds can be considered men.  Kudos to Mr.  Martin for the attempt.  How good it is though, is up to the reader I  guess.  Perhaps some people might have difficulty sheding their 20th  century perceptions.  Whatever.<br />Great plot.  Convoluted and daring.  Mr.  Martin takes seemingly random courses, as if the story is writing itself  and he's just there recording things.  I like it.<br />The setting is plain.   The theme has been done.  The usual cast of blackhearts can be found in the  pages.  But that's not why I rated it so low (compared to the other  reviews).<br />I HATE the way the book is layed out.  Every chapter a new  character, as if it were some magic formula.  The flow is broken up and the  telling of the tale is forced into this constricitve format.  This detracts  from MY reading pleasure ALOT, as I don't see how it creates any dramatic  tension as the &quot;cliffhangers&quot; are constructed at unnatural points  in a lot of cases.  Big knock from me, but who am I. It's well worth the  money overall simply because he's a very capable writer (even if the method  is annoying in places).
B00000AD94|5.0|I can't say enough about how amazing Spock's Beard is.  I give five stars &quot;plus&quot; to all three of their CD's.  &quot;The Light&quot; is composed of a few very long tracks, but unlike some prog bands, they never  get bogged down in flash.  The Morse brothers are such gifted musicians and  the rest of the band really rocks.  If &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; or  &quot;Foxtrot&quot; give you chills, try Spock's Beard.  You won't regret  it.
6300183513|5.0|I have been searching for a copy of this video for several months to no avail.  I would love to purchase one if it ever becomes available.  Grace Kelly and James Stewart are superb in this suspenseful movie.  How clever  of Hitchcock to make a movie where the audience feels a part of the action!   It is so much better than the remake.
0385484518|5.0|A reading filled with tears at the compassion and insight Morrie has of, and with, his students and fellow man.A philosphy of life which should be the standard for all.
B000002UCQ|4.0|Finally, George Harrison gets to showcase his musical ability.  &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; is probably the best of all of the Beatles' solo CDs.  The songs featured on this 2-CD set are premarily improvements and  extensions of the songs he wrote on the later Beatles' CDs (&quot;Abbey  Road&quot; and &quot;The White Album&quot;).  I do have to admit the songs  on the first disc are somewhat better than the ones on the second disc.   The music is greatly varied throughout the album.  Songs like &quot;My  Sweet Lord&quot; and &quot;Behind That Locked Door&quot; are beautiful,  soft ballads, while songs like &quot;What is Life&quot; features a more  upbeat, hard rock sound.  I would recommend this album to any fans of the  Beatles, particularly if they enjoy their later albums.

B00000DHTF|5.0|If you like the Boss, buy this box.  It rocks and has great depth.  Tracks like Frankie, Brothers (both versions) Rendevous, and Ice Man bring out what we all like about Springsteen.  If this is the stuff he left off of  previous recordings...  Just imagine what he left off of Live '75-'85.<br />A  great piece of work, and a pleasure to listen to, over and over again.
6304178352|5.0|With such a talented cast, it is no wonder that &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; is one of the most beloved musicals. Rex Harrison and Audrey Hepburn are delightful as Professor Higgins and Eliza Doolittle. Based on the classic  story of &quot;Pygmalion&quot;, George Bernard Shaw updates this tale to  19th century London. Eliza is a poor flower girl who just happens to catch  the educated and haughty Higgins' eye. He takes a bet that in six months he  could &quot;pass her off as a duchess at an embassy ball&quot;. The process  is a fun and delightful one.
630027179X|5.0|All my fellow customer reviewers are absolutely right. This is a great moment in cinema that is always worth a second, third, fourth, twentieth look. One more thing to recommend it is a chance to see the work Patrick  Stewart, Liam Neeson, and Helen Mirren did before they were well known  outside Britain.
0446604844|5.0|I guess that this will have to be the  best written book that I have ever read!  I read a lot and try to avoid first novels, but David Baldacci has made a believer out of me.

B000006NPY|5.0|I don't wanna type much here, but as much as thoughtless criticism goes toward this album by some of you, the Pumpkins managed to put out one masterpiece of a record!  It wasn't a huge-*** production like Mellon  Collie was, but were many of you expecting something even bigger than that  2-disc album?  I kinda think the same way for U2... you think their next  world tour is gonna top PopMart?  Naw... what the Smashing Pumpkins did was  strip down and blend in the cool sounds of electronics and strings.  I  personally think &quot;Appels + Oranjes&quot; and &quot;Pug&quot; are two  of the best songs I've heard from them yet.  &quot;1979&quot; was the  little sneak-preview to what their next album after Mellon Collie was gonna  sound like.  Guess they did it, and I call it the best album of 1998!  Yay!
6305165912|5.0|The Coen's are truly geniuses. Fargo was extremely good, The Big Lebowski was even better.  It tells the twisted tale of Jeffrey Lebowski, the &quot;Dude&quot; as he calls himself, and his weird friends, passing their  time with bowling and goofing around. I won't tell to much, spoiling the  movie, but the &quot;Dude&quot; gets mixed up in a kidnapping. All this  because some thives urinated on his carpet, mistaking the &quot;Dude&quot;  for being the rich Lebowski who also lives in L.A. Because of this the  &quot;Dude&quot; wants a new carpet from the other Lebowski. This is where  the ball starts rolling. The theme is spiced up with comedy all the way  through.<br />This film will amaze you into the next Millenium, guaranteed. Go  see it.
B000005H55|5.0|&quot;Out To Lunch&quot; is a brilliant, brilliant album.  Just because someone doesn't like it doesn't mean that we've got ourselves a case of the old &quot;Emperor's new clothes&quot; syndrome.  This is not just an  influential, important album - it is a very enjoyable one.  And, for your  information, &quot;Out To Lunch&quot; originally drew a three and a half  star review from Downbeat; that knowledge does nothing to diminish my  regard for the album, just as the now common five star assessments of its  merits don't make it any greater for me.  It is what it is, one of the  great jazz recordings.
0385493800|5.0|Another awesome book by Grisham.  This very entertaining book includes suspense, humor, real-world issues,  adventure and religion.  This book will appeal to almost anyone that knows how to read.  Again he has outdone  himself!

I didn't think that they'd make 4 other  tapes of Rocky!  So I had bought all 5 of them in the 20th anniversary  case.  Usually I watch the movie on tnt- when it comes on.  This movie will  be loved by millions 4- ever!

B000002LB6|4.0|In some ways, Erasure's 'oldest' albums are their most original, classic, and best...and in other ways, they're not.  This album typifies that.  Some people probably deem their newest albums the best and other people..vice  versa.  I relate to both paradigms.  While this song is full of originality  and while every song is memorable and emotion-filled, at the same time,  they're overall, simpler and less refined than what you find in succeeding  songs and albums.  Depending on one's tastes, this may be a  love-it-or-hate-it album, but I..oddly enough..just 'like it a lot.'  This  one is a very classic Erasure album worth buying, but not one of their best  albums...
0060926317|5.0|I never ask to my self if any story could be real or merely fiction.  I just hold the book and let flow the massage the author is trying convey.   We, &quot;the mutants&quot;, moved away from the original idea that could  fulfill our existence.  This book is an invitation to meditate about our  live in a very honest way.

6300208591|5.0|Very good.  An excellent B/W film based solely on content, circumstance and dialogue. Excellent settings and cast. When you go to Rome you WILL go by the fountain Anita Eckberg pranced through. (It is a National Monument  now) A not-quite middle aged journalist is trying to make it in a crowded  &quot;mod&quot; sort of market.  He must deal with insurmountable problems,  continuously, but his hair and suit always look great! If you only have one  of Fellini's, get this one.  In Italian, of course.

6303522440|4.0|Quasi-autobiography of Fellini's youth in Pre-war Facist Italy.  Great variety of characters, scenes and circumstances including family tragedies. Centered around his mid teen years. Obviously reality is exagerated, given  it's Fellini's interpretation of his family and environment.  Very funny.   Get it Italian if you appreciate the sound of the language.  Review based  mainly on content and dialogue rather than bizzare visuals like some of his  films.  Good music also.
1881273156|5.0|A wonderful book that provides insight about the various love &quot;personality&quot; types between men and women.  Common sense presented in a format that anyone can relate to.
B000002KAT|5.0|I had this on tape first, and it moved me so much I got the CD so I could hear it at its absolute best.  It's an ethereal synthesis of jazz, blues, soul, and something uniquely Van that adds up to something compeltely  unlike any album that has ever come before or since.
6301025083|5.0|I found it off-putting at first, but Federico Fellini's eighth film (the \\"1/2\\" represents a short) seems less offensive in retrospect. Basically, Guido Anselmi (Marcello Mastroianni) is a bit of a jerk when it comes to women, and the women in the picture are painted with pretty broad strokes (Anouk Aim&eacute;e is the Uptight Wife, Claudia Cardinale is--literally--the Dream Girl, etc.). But I think we're meant to see them as he does and not necessarily as the director feels we should. The elegantly world weary Mastroianni is probably the only actor in the world who could have made this kind of character sympathetic. Not much happens either, but I guess that's the point: 8-1/2 is a film about a man--a filmmaker--at an impasse in his life. Women frustrate him, he's getting old, and he just can't seem to get his latest production off the ground. It's all one long bad dream. For what it's worth, director Jonathan Nossiter (Sunday, Signs & Wonders) has said he didn't like the film when he first saw it either. Some viewers may find that it takes a combination of time and successive viewings to fully penetrate this self-enclosed world--but it's worth the effort.<br />As a special bonus, the carnival-esque soundtrack is one of Nino Rota's very best and just gets better the more I hear it. Gianni Di Venanzo's luminous B&W cinematography is also quite stunning.
0790736926|5.0|I first viewed The Searchers as a film major in college. In the last twenty years I have seen this film at least forty times.  &quot;How can you watch the same movie over and over&quot; my wife always ask.  My reply is  simple...this is the greatest western ever made.<br />What makes it so great  is of course John Ford's direction and his signature as an auteur.  His  economy of frame space, the majesty of Monument Valley and the internal  struggle of a man's racism and his inability to become a viable member of  the Ford definition of family.  <br />The family is a centerpiece in many of  Ford's films.  The Grapes of Wrath and How Green is My Valley are two that  come to mind.  The Joabs and the Morgans struggled as a family.  Although  the struggle in The Searchers is for Ethan to find his daughter (I know it  says his niece, but take it from someone who has seen this film as many  times as I have--she's his daughter...I can prove it, write me).  This is a  portrait of a dysfunctional Ford family.<br />I urge everyone to read this  movie.  Yes, I said read.  One of the first lessons in film school is that  we do not watch a film, we read it.  You must remember that time and space  of any film only exists as the film is being projected.  Every piece of  furniture, every prop is all in the frame for a reason--placed there by the  director to add to the untold story and to the characters' personality.   Look beyond the dialogue; look at that picture on the wall; look at the  custumes that the characters are wearing-- then ask yourself why are they  here and what are they trying to tell me.  When you do this, you have  graduated from watching a film to reading a film.
B0000033IS|5.0|Great, great record.  Anyone who loves music will dig this.  Should be required listening for anyone who aspires to be a rock 'n roller.
B000000OSW|5.0|When &quot;Digging In The Dirt&quot; came out, the first time I heard that great funk-tinged bass, it was sneaking out of a car speaker as a boyfriend and I  had just moved in together in the summer of '92, were returning the  van, and were arguing about something; that's when Peter cut in with the  lyrics, &quot;Don't talk back, just drive the car.&quot;  Two years of  stormy relationship later, we'd separated; and a year after that, while  Peter sang to me about &quot;Making it up in our Secret World,&quot; I  finally forgave him, and myself. The rest of the songs spoke to me at other  times, too; &quot;Fourteen Black Paintings&quot; is still one of the most  haunting and powerful songs I've ever heard (I wrote down the lyrics in  their entirety and have them framed over my desk).
0385493800|5.0|Grisham has fashioned a modern morality play for American society.  There are lessons here for all of us, not merely the lawyers.  The setting for Nate O'Riley's meeting with Rachel Lane Porter is straight out of Conrad.   In order to cleanse your soul, you must first pierce the heart of darkness.  Grisham's tale does, and holds a message of redemption that we all can  benefit from.  Finely written and a fun read.
6300182355|5.0|Forget all the &quot;camp&quot; stuff and appreciate this film for what it is. A great and original story with interesting characters, one of the best soundtracks ever recorded, and stunning, unforgettable visuals.

6304117302|5.0|This movie reaches deep inside of me and touches my soul as few stories ever have.  As much as the love story of Hawkeye and Cora moves me, so does the sub-plot of the desire by Uncas for Alice.  The cinematography, score  and complex plot keep me spellbound, and I watch this movie again and  again.  A masterpiece!

B000002J1S|5.0|I remember the first time I heard this album I thought I had died and gone to heaven. The whole of the album is written with a elegance I had never seen in rock music before. Instrumentals like &quot;Hairless Heart&quot;  inspire and capture you, while songs like &quot;In the Cage&quot; and  &quot;Colony of Slipperman&quot; send your imagination spinning.
6302293553|5.0|So many people watch it until their TV wears out; when will this madness end.  For the betterment of our society the sale of this video must be stopped or many more will die of laughter.  I have witnessed this  phenomenon many times myself and have somehow survived...Beware!  I can't  think of a person who hates this movie and everyone that I know that has  seen it still loves it.
B000002G6J|5.0|This album, outside of compilations, is possibly the best  introduction to the fusion of traditions that is Bossa Nova.  I have been exploring this genre for two years and there is no doubt in my mind that Mr. Jobim was the  finest exponent of Bossa Nova.  May his legacy live long.

B000002UAU|3.0|This album was written by a freak in Lennon and a retard in Mcartney. I mean who care about Lucy with her damm diamounds in the sky! What the hell does that mean anyway. Face it it was also over rated even as a concept  album, The Best album of 1967 was THE WHO SELLS OUT it had power volume and  it made a sense. Yes it was on the acid side a little but it always stayed  as a good rock album. The little radio commercials were a great concept by  Townshend and Entwistle. Plus THE WHO had a better drummer a better guitar  player a way better base player and a great front man . So all im saying is  that this album and the beatles suck and are over rated. I mean WHO lasted  longer?
B000002572|5.0|This is one of those rare albums out there where every song on it is a classic.  I could listen to this album over and over and not get tired of any of the songs on it. It should be in any serious music lovers  collection.
B0000062GE|4.0|Considering the power of the music, the straight forward (if not unimaginative) writing style, and the true grit of Christopher Hall's voice, this album completely rocks! Several tracks on this CD are radio  worthy, and not even the best ones have been released. Listen to How Can I  Hold On and Waking Up Beside You and be amazed at the true emotion Hall  brings out in them.
0385493800|1.0|The first 50 pages were entertaining and promising.  Once the trip to South America began, the book became less entertaining than a trip tp the periodontist.  The characters were wooden..a poor takeoff on RAIDERS OF THE  LOST ARK.  Please skip the intervening 300 pages and read the last  chapter....if you even care enough to find out what happens.

Wanta Love Somebody moods...Until You Come  Back,and You'll Never Stand Alone. Candlelight mood...Oh Yes....AND THE  TITLE TRACK IS THE BOMB!!!!!! My Love Is Your Love. I didn't mention the  rest of the songs but they're also great. When you put this CD on there  will be no need for skipping around because every track is slamming!
6304698623|5.0|A Little Princess happened to come on the channel I was watching while playing with my computer this past Super Bowl Sunday (no, I don't care about the Bowl), and captured my attention for the next two hours. It is  the superbly told tale of a little girl enrolled in a strict girls' school,  and how she changes the lives of those she touches there. The story is  highlighted by the tales she tells of an East Indian fable, which is  interwoven into the story of her life, unbeknownst to herself. There is  much emotional fare here, and though it is rated G, it is a must see for  everyone. The special effects, especially those of the fable sequences, are  yet to be surpassed. I am very pleased to find it here at Amazon.com.
6305165912|5.0|This was an ingenius film starring Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, and my favorite actor, Steve Buscemi.  The movie was hilarious, and at the same time had a complex plot (something very unusual to see in comedy)  It was  without a doubt worth seeing over and over again and I recommend this to  anybody with good taste in comedy.  In other words, see this movie if you  think you know a decent comedy when you see one.  The only down side to  this movie was Steve Buscemi's character dying, but I guess it added  something to the plot that was necessary.
B000001FTS|4.0|Great stuff to make out to. Leaves you wondering why they didn't go on to greater things. Some might say it is over-produced, but that's the hallmark of most of Trevor Horn's work. If you like Kate Bush and Peter Gabriel, buy  it.
0783229526|5.0|This movie was anticipated to be a discrace to HST's brilliant gonzo book.  IT WASN&quot;T.  This movie followed the novel step by step very well and thrived with original directing.  Being a very big fan of Hunter S.  Thompson I was very pleased when I saw the film and let out a big sigh I  had been holding in ever since I learned that Fear and Loathing was going  to be made into a film.  My thoughts were that they could never do it, a  book as ingenius and twisted as that could never be made into a successful  film.  I was very wrong.  I was blown away with the camera angles and  affects.  I didn't think they could make it happen but with the brilliant  directing, it was almost as funny and twisted as the book.  Oh yeah, one  more thing, Jonny Depp did a brilliant job playing Raol Duke.<br />p.s. I  wonder what Hunter thought?
B000002KHF|5.0|Van Morrison's music is not for everyone.  If you're lookin' for Top 40-type predictable music, he's probably not for you.  His music can sometimes be difficult and obscure.  However, his art has the ability to  touch me more deeply than almost any other musician.   <br />&quot;Moondance&quot; is one of the foundations of my music collection.   Twenty plus years later, it still has the power to move me.  I like every  song in the collection. It is hard to pick my favorite song, but right this  second it's got to be &quot;Into the Mystic&quot; -- listening to it brings  me as close to an epiphany as I get.  The whole album can be summed up by  words from the first cut:  &quot;It stoned me.&quot;
B0000025T6|5.0|&quot;Nebraska&quot; was a great risk, a great challenge, and in the end, a great masterpiece. Be warned however: you can't play it as background music, you have to sit and listen to it and do nothing else but that.  &quot;Nebraska&quot; draws the listener in like no other album I've EVER  heard.
0670880728|5.0|Simply put: Read this book. I can think of no funnier book ... ever. And it is true what everyone says: this book WILL make you laugh out loud, so only read it in the presence of people who know you, because everyone else  will think you are a stark raving lunatic when you start cracking up  uncontrollably. By the way, I am male, so this book does not just appeal to  females.
6305229449|5.0|A terrific movie.  All the martial arts in the film  (too brief -- my only complaint) was drawn from real videos of two martial artists here in the USA.  The two lead characters, Mulan and Captain Li Shang, were modeled on  Sifu (teacher) Mimi Chan and Sifu George Kee of the Wah Lum Kung Fu Temple  in Orlando, Florida.  Both are students of the incredible Grandmaster Chan  Pui who brought Wah Lum to this country.  The tale itself is fabulous, the  animation deeply detailed and rich, and the story not too scary even for  relatively young children (my 5 year old did just fine at the theater).  I  highly recommend it.
B000000WCA|4.0|I used to be embarrassed that I liked the Spice Girls, but I am no longer ashamed.  Sure, deep as a puddle, but does everything have to be deep?  As my sister said once, they are a happy group.  You can't be depressed and  listen to the Spice Girls.  So take them for what they are worth and enjoy  the ride.  They are not the anti-Christ, they are making money doing  something cheesy and fun.  Why not?  As for me, I love them and even my  &quot;too cool for school&quot; husband is starting to come around--he just  won't let me tell anyone.
B000002HEM|5.0|After listening to Natalie's voice and music from her two solo efforts, I'm hooked.  I decided to listen to her earlier works and bought the MTV Unplugged CD as a start.  I'm now hooked on the Maniacs.  Similar in style  to her solo career, Natalie's voice on this CD is mesmerizing.  The music  is upbeat and &quot;catchy&quot; and makes for a very enjoyable listen.   Highly recommended.
0812524586|5.0|Mister Scott's tale is the most interesting book I have ever read.  I have read it well over 10 times and it still isn't old, I still find something new everytime.  This book should not be read as if it were science fiction,  but as if it were a modern tale.  Tragic and triumphent in the same moment.   It displays the power of man to overcome anything, and the horrors we are  capable of.  This is a book that should be mandatory reading in school.  I  call for a movie to be made of this movie so all can experience the  adventure that is Ender's Game.
6305229449|5.0|Excellent movie by Disney after two or three disappointing outings in recent years. But when will Disney realize strong female characters don't need a man to complete them in the end. My kids loved it, my HUSBAND liked  and so did I. Definitely one to watch for the 100th time.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Radiohead have recorded the definitive post-punk record, a thematically whole and satisfying album.  &quot;Karma Police&quot; is one of the three or four more beautiful songs of the decade.  Comparisons to &quot;Dark Side  of the Moon&quot; are interesting; they are both of the same  genesis, but  this record's arch sensibilty and cinematic feel place this record as an  achievement beyond that enormous rock masterpiece.  One for the ages.
0385493800|2.0|John Grisham is one of my very favorite authors, but I was disappointed in his last book and even more disappointed in &quot; The Testament &quot;.

B000002AQQ|5.0|The music selection for the motion picture &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; was excellent, and this excellence has been brought else onto disc.  What else can I say?
078401213X|5.0|The makers of &quot;Pi&quot; have achieved what I would have thought was impossible: They have made a tense SF thriller about mathematics.  The movie has a little of the graphical flavor of &quot;Tetsuo&quot;, but with  a far more gripping plot; a little of the strangeness of David Lynch, but  without the feeling that it's being weird for weirdness' sake.  Definitely  the best film I saw in 1998.
B000007RV5|1.0|Corn is probably the worst band making records today.  However, these guys, LIMP Bizkit, give them a real run for their money.  The album is full of grunting, which is nice if your an ape in heat, but not so great if  you're expecting melodies and harmonies.  But what is most noteworthy about  this ridiculous bunch of garbage is their unapologetic butchering of George  Michael's &quot;faith&quot;.  And so in summary, if you're a corn fan,  you'll love these morons.
B000002UB3|5.0|Abbey Road is the pinnacle of the Beatles achievement. Recorded in their last days together as a group, it shows them at their most mature stage. The songs are like a summary of their career together. There is Rock N'  Roll (The End, I Want You, Oh! Darling, Come Together) ballads (Because,  Something), guitar pieces (Sun King), orchestral pieces (Carry That Weight,  Golden Slumbers) and even Sgt. Pepper style tape loops, strange new  instruments and studio tricks (I Want You, Sun King, Maxwell's Silver  Hammer) <br />All members of the group contribute songs to the album, and  every one is an excellent example of their individual talents. Particularly  outstanding is George's contributions, Something and Here Comes The Sun.  Probably two of the greatest songs ever written. Even Ringo's composition  skills impress, Octopus's Garden being one of the most catchy tunes on  Abbey Road. <br />Performance wise, all four members excel. Ringo's drumming  is innovative, prominent and adds real depth to the sound. George's lead  guitar work is outstanding, as is John's rhythm guitar. Paul's bass often  forms a tune in its own right. In addition, John, Paul and George play  other intruments, including a Moog synthesiser.<br />Side One is excellent,  but Side Two, which is a medley of songs, is truly outstanding. Paul and  John contribute songs for the long piece and the transition from one song  to the next is perfect. <br />Abbey Road is a remarkable farewell for the  Beatles, and is a must have for anyone, no matter what their musical  tastes.
6305268843|5.0|A beautifully filmed literate story of passion and the decisions which are made based upon desires.  Stephen Dillane and Sophie Marceau positively sizzle as an Englishman and the Swiss woman he pays to be the surrogate  mother of his child.  All is supposed to be done in businesslike anonymity,  but of course emotions soon enter into the proposition.  Marceau gives away  her newly born child as agreed but never recovers from the decision.  When  she shows up on Stephen Dillane's doorstep as his new governess, things  heat up pretty quickly. With a fine script, great direction and attention  to detail by the art director and cinematographer, Firelight is a treasure  of a movie which was missed by most people when it was screened  theatrically last fall.  I really loved this movie and plan to purchase it  the minute it is available.  If you liked the Jane Austen movies, the  Bronte movies or any other period piece with substance, you should truly  enjoy this film.

B00000FCBC|5.0|The first CD in the set is either totally worthwhile or complete garbage, depending on how long ago you became a Metallica fan. Personally, I happened to already like &quot;Turn The Page&quot; and &quot;Tuesday's  Gone&quot; a whole lot, and consider Metallica's renditions worthy of  respect, the rest of the disc is forgettable. The second disc however, is a  bargain at twice the price. I spent over six years collecting rare imports  and B-sides to get ahold of such rarities as &quot;Killing Time&quot; and  &quot;The Prince&quot;. In a way it's kind of sad that anybody who became a  fan after hearing Load can get their hands on all the &quot;arcane  treasures&quot; that longtime Metallica buffs have always considered  private knowledge for the true fan. But it shure is nice to have all those  songs in one place and digitally remastered to boot. What are you waiting  for... buy it! BUY TWO!!!
6300151379|5.0|This movie is magical.  It is one of the few movies that, even as a child, has the power to captivate its audience based on its appeal to the universal imagination.  I have searched high and lo for this movie on tape.   Everyone has sent it to the moratoreum.  It should truly be re-released  for the sake of kids and adults, alike.  It makes watching movies simple  and dreak-like.  &quot;Labyrinth&quot; manages to capture an aspect of  everyones' inner core... the ability to make believe.  Charmingly playful  and innocent, this movie is an underrated masterpiece.

0399143904|2.0|Rainbow 6 started well enough. The action and pace is typically Clancy, but after that, the book goes downhill. Characters are shallow, and we never feel for John Clark and Ding as we felt for Jack Ryan. The plot is  not as believable as Clancy's Ryan novels and the bad guys even less so.   As a Clancy fan, I felt a little cheated. From anyone else, this might have  been a decent enough book, from Clancy, this is a let down indeed. I keep  flipping the pages thinking it will get better, I was wrong.
B000001FI7|3.0|You've just pulled up to the club and as your standing in the parking lot. Some really great music is being played inside.  The Portishead songs are like this. They won't let you inside to hear what is really going on. I say  shoot the Recording Engineer and try again Portishead.  I'm sure you play  great music if you'd just let us hear it.

0385474547|5.0|Chinua Achebe really brings you into the feeling and life of tribal Africa.  This incredible novel gives you a new appreciation of primitive African culture.  Although not the type of literature I usually read (being  a caucasian teenage girl), I found this novel to be highly entertaining.  I  would recommend it to anyone; to diversify their literary and historical  knowledge.
080010367X|4.0|I can't believe that a viewer from California thought that this movie was stupid! I loved this movie! It was so funny!
0812550757|5.0|This book was so much fun to read! I enjoyed it for many reasons, including its many novelties: the concept of hard-core Catholics thriving in a distant world 4,000 years from now, the way the far-off planet of  Trondheim sounds an awful lot like Greenland, and the notion that  light-speed travel between such places allows characters to  &quot;live&quot; for millenia. But for me the really appealing part of the  book was the character of Ender, who is far more interesting as an adult  than he was as a child in Ender's Game. Because he lives a dual identity -  as the hated Ender the Xenocide and the revered Speaker for the Dead - he  is both a wise, sad and, ultimately, an admirable figure. To me, Ender's  well-crafted character easily carries a story that might have seemed too  high-minded or sentimental with a less compelling lead figure. As it is,  both the plight of the pequeninos and the tragedy of the human deaths on  Lusitania are conveyed with a real sense of pathos. Similarly, the  interplay between Ender and the people of Lusitania was, for the most part,  deftly handled. There were some scenes near the end that I thought were a  bit overwritten, but for the most part I found the book suspenseful, honest  and surprisingly moving.
0790729989|3.0|truly a brilliant, *dark* piece of filmmaking.  in particular, the small details of the Dt. Sommerall character (he sleeps with a running metronome, he has a switchblade fetish) make a great impact.  <br />as much as i liked  the film itself, i have to say that i was disappointed with the transfer to  DVD.  the video image, while crisp, would occasionally &quot;stutter&quot;,  as if the projector were skipping a few frames.  also, in the scene in the  killer's apartment, the audio drops out for a moment.  both of these  problems got in the way of enjoying a magnificent film.<br />don't even get me  started on how annoyed i was at having to flip the disc halfway through the  movie...
6301942647|5.0|In this late film (1994), the brilliance of Kurosawa's vision--both what he sees and his translating those sights into film--shows itself more simply and powerfully than ever before.  His wonderfully subtle touch with  the camera informs these beautiful and sometimes frightening vignettes.    Most memorable of all are those moments, so rare in contemporary film, when  Kurosawa allows the camera simply to capture the light of a beautiful  image--a peach orchard or a running brook.  For all the wonderful and  exciting cinematic thrills from Hollywood, this film reminds us that, in  art, beauty is still the best and the most difficult of artistic  achievements.
B00000DBXL|5.0|I got this CD for Christmas along with Fashion Nugget.  The first time I listened to it, it was great.  Each time I listened to it after that, this Cd's quality increased exponentially.  All of the solos are astounding fun  to listen to.  The songs just grew on me and I could almost not go through  a day without listening to it.  I was so hooked that when I found out that  they had yet another CD, I had to go buy it.  Cake makes an excellent mix  of songs with great beats and interesting lyrics.  For every song, I find  myself singing along with all of the songs on this CD.  Don't just buy this  CD; buy the other two also!!!
6302256615|5.0|Point Break is one of the most entertaining films of its kind.  It has great action, hilarious quotes, and a decent story.  What more could you want from a Swayze film?
630505116X|5.0|The first twenty minutes of this film may indicate that you are watching grade - b cheese, and that assumption is correct.  However, the action and terrific special effects make &quot;Deep Rising&quot; an excellent thrill  ride with enough gore to satisfy horror fans.  Treat Williams does an  adequate job as the top biller, and Famke Janssen is surprisingly effective  as the leading lady. (Her acting is at a par with her beauty.)  Honorable  mention goes to the comic relief of &quot;Joey Pantuccho&quot;,  (unfortunately, the actor's name escapes me now.)  He is very funny. The  thing that makes &quot;Deep Rising&quot; a success is the subplot involving  the terrorist group.  This gives them a reason for being on the boat and  armed to the teeth and is capable of supporting the story until the monster  shows up.  This movie  has made its way to my collection and I strongly  recommend it.

B00000634L|4.0|This CD is just fabulous!  I first heard of them through the one song they had on the &quot;Practical Magic&quot; soundtrack.  I bought the &quot;Glee&quot; CD and was really surprised to hear all the diffrent type  of sounds this group is capable of.  I have never been a fan of hip hop but  this band has helped me make the cross over.  There are also great tracks  that have some techno, reggae, folk and even country influnences.  I know  it sounds like a weird mix but BV3 makes it work very well.  You have to  give 'em a try.  Trust me you'll like it. This is a great band with a lot  of talent and a dynamic sound!
B00000APLB|5.0|It's a real live album, and almost sounds like a high-quality bootleg.<br />For those of us who like our stones raw, dirty, and improvisational, however, it's a landmark recording. The spiritual  successor to get your Ya Ya's out. And while that gem defined and  encapsulated the real glory years of the Stones, Love You Live holds it's  own against the monolith. Ron Wood has succeded Mick Taylor, and eclipsed  him. Listen to the brilliant riff trading with Keith in Sympathy, and  you'll know what I'm talking about.<br />This recording co-incided with the  rise of &quot;speed guitar&quot; in the late 70's. It tickles me to no end  when I hear Keith's insane solo in &quot;Can't Always Get What You  Want&quot;, and realize that the old war axe can play as fast as Eddie Van  Halen ever could.<br />The only dark spots lie in some of the material from  &quot;It's Only Rock and Roll&quot;. Clearly, the songs here are a fair  regression from the earlier stuff.<br />If your the kind of stones patron who  throws on &quot;Exile&quot;, knocks back a bottle of booze and falls into a  rapture, time after time, then buy this album. If, however, you never stray  far from &quot;Hot Rocks&quot;, or if you really only like The Stones after  &quot;Some Girls&quot;, you'd do better elsewhere.
0553328255|5.0|If there is any book that made you forget the author, it is sherlock holmes. Poor Conan Doyle! Brainy but sensitive, lazy and energetic, detective and thief(in a couple of cases), this mass of contradictions  (holmes) is truly THE DETECTIVE par excellence. I got this complete work in  november and I have read all the stories about 20 times without getting  bored, and I am still at it. I cannot say enough about the great holmes in  such a short space as this, so I stop here. Go get the book!

0782008119|5.0|HYPE! is the most comprehensive documentary on the subject of&quot;the Seattle sound&quot; that there is. It shows how good a thing is until it is done in excess. Exploitation, greed, and commercialization  are the enemies  in this documentary. A story of howsomething so pure and torn-down such as  &quot;the seattle sound&quot; was manipulated and destroyed by the very  people who helped to introduce it into the mainstay of American culture.  Remember, anything in excess destroys.
B00000F1D3|4.0|I'm 37 years old and I was raised hearing and watching Cher perform. She has always been her own woman and I've taken inspiration from her. With this new CD she's proven that you can take from the past and incorporate  into the future. This album is similar to her disco hits but with a 90's  flair. I listened to the entire CD at a local music store and I could  barely contain myself. BELEIVE makes you want to dance in the aisles. I had  to rate it a 4 because there was not any diversity in song selection. I  feel that the beat was similar in most songs. I consider this a comeback CD  and it makes me believe that age is not a factor, but its the passion in  your soul for what you love to do that keeps  you young.

B0000026NC|1.0|The entire double set is very boring and the songs are all played very tight.   The only part I like is the guitar solo on Time but I don't think that it is sufficient reason to get this double album. I'd rather pay twice  as much to get a live set from the mid-70s(which I did) then get this  again. You'll see the difference.
630516889X|5.0|This is one of those action movies you can't miss. It's a classic for those who like guns, action, suspense, and violence. It should be up there right next to Terminator 2. &quot;Movies for guys who like movies!&quot;
0385493800|5.0|I got this book 3 days ago and am already on page 230. I have neglected my school work to read this book and I love it. I just wish John Girshman would write enough books so that I did not have to read books from other  authors!!

1573226521|5.0|I found myself, when I was at work, unable to wait to get home to continue reading. I purposely did not take it to work with me because I was afraid I would be interrupted! Just an incredible read. I have a very good friend  who went to Indonesia as a backpacker, and stayed. He is now, after  traveling around, teaching english in Jakarta. I love this book.
0060254939|5.0|This was my favorite book as a small child.  At the age of 14, all my of childhood books were boxed up for storage but were mistakenly taken to a yard sale instead of being packed away.  I spent a year of my life living  the 'college experience' before coming back home.  Upon my return, a copy  of this book had found its way onto my nightstand.  Maybe it's that I  hadn't seen it in years, but I'd forgotten how amazing this book really is.   It seemed to perfectly fit as a metaphor for what the past year of my life  had become... when I had gone off to live where the wild things are, only  to find the light to still be on when I came back home.<br />I realise this  book has been around much longer than I have, but I know it will live on to  touch our lives for many generations to come.
6305252521|3.0|While this is cerianly an interesting movie, and one could argue that this is Jim Carrey's best role to date,  on the whole the movie is just an average movie.  What is disturbing though,  is Paramount's blatent false  advertixing of the producr.  I bought this movie believing it to be in the  wide screen format.    The packaging clearly states that this movie is  supposed to be  wide screen,.  let me assure you though that what you get  is the pan and scan version.  This is a new format,  but this sort of foul  up is not acceptable.
6303122647|1.0|I really enjoy animated movies, but this one just didn't work it's way into my heart. The songs are stupid and uncaring. The scenes are sometimes terrible and uncalled for. I did not like this movie at all. I'm sorry, but  I wouldn't buy this video.
0782008119|5.0|Great overall Nirvana video. If you are a Nirvana fan, you must own this
0790739909|4.0|This was such a great movie. Cage and Ryan really pull you into the story. It shows so well what some people will got through to find true love. At every point in the movie, Cage looks like he's about to break down and cry  but that just makes you empathize with him even more. The only thing that  really surprised me was the ending. When Meg Ryan was riding her bike back  home I was thinking that this was going to be such a great ending to the  movie and it was really going to lift me up. I was devastated when I saw  what happened. I was crying histerically and my friend had to console me.  However, like Cage said in the end, it's better to have one hour with the  person that you truly love then live an eternity without them.  This movie  is all about true love and the lengths that someone will go to to reach it.  Difinitely spend your money to buy it.
6302638771|5.0|It definitely makes sense for one to sit and watch this movie. It presents a very clear picture of the circumstances surronding and stemming from the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Although some insist that the  dominant argument presented in this film is not true, it definitely makes a  whole bunch of sense and it will get you thinking. If you are just  interested in a good mystery/court drama then you'll be happy about  watching this movie too. Very interesting movie. Great job, Oliver Stone!  (Point of advice - get the video because on cable there's no bathroom break  and you won't want to miss a thing).
B000006045|4.0|The album puts me in a trance at times. The fluidity of the melodies are so beautiful yet attenuated across a fine line...Crisp yet deeply textured. Be prepared: Do not concentrate fully but allow the music to  &quot;happen&quot;. The experience just &quot;is&quot;. If you enjoy the  stripped-down nature of bands like Tortoise or Stereolab yet tune in to the  soulful style of the Digable Planets, buy this album.
B00000FCBC|1.0|That's right, what happened...After &quot;And Justice For All&quot; Metallica went right down the tubes.  I'm disgusted at the mere thought that Metallica is remaking classic rock songs.  What a disgrace.  These  money hungry losers used to be my favorite band, but it seems that they  have lost what they started out with in the first place.  And furthermore,  I don't care what anyone says, they shouldn't have cut their hair!!!!
078323077X|5.0|The characters are rich and you care about what happens next.  The action fits the as the puzzle slowly come together.  It criss crosses and leads you upon a sharpe edge.  The word for this movie is suspense to the end.

6303327974|1.0|This movie has to be one of the most boring and disgusting movies ever made. It is hard to imagine that a person responsible for the making of a sensible classic like JFK would also be responsible for the making of this  - what? It is, from the outset, not clear what this thing is trying to say  and then it gets worse. The characters are incredible and the plot  possesses in itself nothing to hold an audience.
6305107122|5.0|Coming from a person that has not watched many horror films, this was the best film I have ever seen.  It is a classic that will be on the top of the best horror films ratings for a long time. I would definately recommend it  to any horror fan.  With the combination of the music and the calmness of  the main character as he stalks his prey, I have yet to see the same effect  in any other film.

6305263248|5.0|De Niro kicks ***!  This movie was action packed with plenty of surprises
6304057709|5.0|This adaptation of the Jane Austen Classic has proven itself worthy of her name. The screenplay, written by Emma Thompson, pays close attention to the heart of Jane Austen. The joys coupled with the many sorrows of these girls  carry the viewers along on a heart-felt journey that captures the soul. The  strength of Elinor Dashwood is something I, to this day, cannot apprehend.  It is so moving, so challenging, the way she carries the burdens of  everyone in her household upon her shoulders, to the point of  forgetting(rather, neglecting) her own very pressing needs. Emma Thompson  is brilliant and makes this movie a laudable classic fit to be applauded  for generations to come.
0385493800|2.0|The best way to describe my reaction after reading John Grisham's latest book, &quot;The Testament&quot; is one of disappointment. There is little or no &quot;court drama&quot; in this book; not a surprise, since little  drama occurs in the probate courts of this country, no matter how much  money is at stake. In addition, I have searched the entire text and cannot  find any basis to characterize this book as an &quot;action thriller.&quot;  Indeed, whatever action is portrayed during the journey of the protagonist  Nate O'Reilly down the Paraguay River is repetious, tedious and even  discounted by the author in his postscript. Finally, the fact that this  book may properly be characterized as a &quot;tale of redemption&quot; is  at the crux of why the novel fails to come up to the first two promises.  The entire subplot of the novel involving the mysterious renewal of the  protagonist after a brief meeting with a Christain missionary and a nasty,  but ultimately non-threatening illness, could have been developed as a full  novel itself, apart form the purported legal drama. One wonders whether  John Grisham's disillusionship with the legal system has now seeped into  his career as a writer of legal thrillers. I wouldn't be surprised,  especially after having read this book.
B000003NA4|5.0|I purchased this CD a few days after Christmas of 1998 on a &quot;risk&quot; basis (I was using a gift certificate).  To date, I have played it almost exclusively.  Can anyone recommend a good shrink?  For  years we have heard of new &quot;jazz lions&quot; that will set the stage  for years to come - Marsalis, Hargrove, Connick, etc. etc. etc.  Generally,  what we are treated to is a display of technical prowess and the music is  often written or chosen to demonstrate this technical proficiency.  Diana  Krall and her group, while certainly as technically proficient as they  come, serve the music, not the other way around.  To hear Russel Malone  strum his guitar with such deceptive simplicity as I melt in front of my  speakers as Diana kroons me into contemplative adoration is an experience  that everyone should enjoy.  It is nice to hear musicians who honor music  and seemingly view themselves and their divinely inspired talents as  servants of something outside of and more important than themselves.  My  problem now is that, after listening to Diana and her group, in comparison,  it is difficult for me to find anything in my CD collection that can  satisfy my expectations.<br />Get this album.  In 30 years, you will be  sitting with your grand children telling them how you bought one of Diana  Kralls very first albums.  She's that good.
0812550706|5.0|Ender Wiggin in Ender's Game became a part of me-no- in fact, he is me.

I could not  have asked for a better ending, all of my(Ender's) hard work paid off and I  finally got to relax.
0783229011|5.0|The dvd is great for Spanish as well as English speaking households.  Both languages are well dubbed and the cinematography is magnificently beautiful.  The Spanish version contributes a quirkier, more ethnic humor  that just cannot be translated into English.  Highly recommended, you will  want to see it over and over again. Wish there was a widescreen version.

B0000057C5|5.0|Rammstien's second CD makes even greater use of the lead singers unique vocal talents to create a distinct mood that lasts the entire CD. The guitar licks are interesting and consistently enjoyable after several  listenings, making this a must have for any fan of the genre.

B000001OAA|5.0|I have all praise for this excellant album.  I consider it the first perfect album ever.  With songs like &quot;Supervixen&quot;,&quot;Stupid Girl&quot;,&quot;Not My Idea&quot;,&quot; and &quot;Vow&quot;, all musical  tastes will be filled.  Verison 2.0 is just as good, also.  Garbage is  going to be the hottest band of the future.  I have absolutely no doubt  about that.
6302482585|5.0|There's a reason that everyone loves Casablanca.  It has every element of a great film:  star-studded cast (Bogart, Bergman, Lorre, Henreid, Greenstreet, etc.), mystery, drama, romance.  This edition features the  original theatrical trailer and a great documentary following the movie  narrated by Bergman's real daughter, Lauren Bacall.  This is a must-see for  any and every generation!
0893860220|5.0|As Nisargadatta grows in popularity there are more and more books that are being published which make reference to this relatively unknown but extraordinary spiritual teacher. At my last count there were about 7 or 8 books which included dialogues with Nisargadatta. Just the other day I heard that  Wayne Dyer, the author of Your Erroneous Zones, The Sky's the Limit and many other popular books on self-growth, has been strongly influenced by Nisargadatta and makes reference to him in his latest book. Many others influential teachers, including Stephen Levine and Ram Dass, have also been influenced and affected by his teaching.<br /><br />I Am That is an eloquent book--largely due to  the beautiful translation of Maurice Frydman. It has been around for many years and has become a spiritual classic due to the simplicity and clarity  with which Nisargadatta talks about Truth. He talks from the absolute  vantage point of one who knows. The book consists of dialogues between various seekers and Nisargadatta. Many of the questions are poignant and challenging, making for some very thought-provoking and inspiring replies.  While the book offers no pat formulas for attaining enlightenment or simple prescriptions for how to live, I found that the words struck a deep  spiritual chord within me, resonating with the ancient truths of the Upanishads in a modern language that is both comprehensible and uplifting.
6305265488|5.0|If you've come across this film because you're a Drew Barrymore fan and want to see all of her work, you will NOT be disappointed.  &quot;Ever After&quot; is the sleeper film of 1998 -- I saw it four times in the  theatre and am getting the video ASAP.  Clever, beautifully filmed,  touching, poignant, bittersweet, suitable for all family members and  especially for parents who'd like a good role model for their little girls.   Wonderful casting all around -- you'll shriek with laughter at some of the  scenes between our heroine and her evil sister and stepmom (the other  sister is not quite so dastardly -- watch and you'll see!).  Let's all buy  a copy of this one and make it the best-selling video of 1999.  Let's show  the film industry that this is the kind of film of which we'd like to see  more!
B000005IKX|4.0|With but a hint of their former bouncy selves (Two For The Price of One), ABBA finally brings down the curtain on one of the greatest pop bands ever. This album is a must for ABBA fans, and really bears listening to if you've  ever heard Super Trouper and loved it. The tracks like The Visitors  are  really quite good - but the ABBA's era had ended, and they knew it with  this album.
B00000DGUG|4.0|For all the bad reviews on this CD, it seems that you are not Alanis fans. This CD is not for people that are not fans of hers. It is a pretty good follow-up, I loved the first one and still own it today. &quot;Front  Row&quot;, the first song is very good and probably my favorite. She sings  of spirituality and finding herself. Give it a chance, it is worth your  time.
B000000WJZ|5.0|This will be my second copy I've purchased, I played the first one so much that it's just about blank now but to me the whole band is fantastic &amp; they each compliment the other...D'Arcy can't be beat, James is past cool  &amp; as for Billy, his vocals chords must drip with gold..I own almost  every recording they have put out including the boots(I KNOW I COULDN'T  HELP MYSELF)&amp; I would never part with any of them.We've only seen them  4 times but if I could afford it I would be a Pumkin Head &amp; travel to  every show they put on. People give Billy grief for leaving shows early but  I have to say that being a true fan of the Pumkins you either get it or you  don't &amp; I'm glad to say that yes, I GOT IT!!!!!!We even sent them  flowers the last time they played Memphis &amp; my 11 year old daughter  loved every minute of the show &amp; has seen them again after that in  Dallas.

The return of Timothy Hutton to his home town(small town) is an exact replica of what i go through every time i return home to my small town. The friends never change  and neither does the town.

Also presents both the typical male and female perspectives on  the opposite sex. A very funny movie with quick-witted dialogue.

B000002LB7|5.0|The first time I heard Electric, I was a freshman in college. I had heard Wildflower on MTV and thought, &quot;Wow, I haven't heard such a raw,  powerful, sound in years!&quot;<br />As often happens with great Rock 'n'  Roll, Wild Flower also reminded me of a girl I wanted to get to know  better. I was inspired to approach to her; and, of course, I told her about  the song. It intrigued her, if nothing else, and we became great friends.  (If you ever read this, January...)<br />I bought the cassette (remember  them?) and listened to it end to end. It left me energized. I couldn't wait  to listen to it again, then again with all my friends. We all loved it!  <br />Actually, one of my friends, Rives, said he was disappointed that it did  not sound like the old (Death) Cult. He was right. I never really liked the  previous efforts of this band; but, to me, Electric was an instant metal  classic. The Cult has released good music since that time as well, but none  of their later efforts capture the raw essence that true Rock 'n' Roll  exudes on a primal level. Electric reaches deep down inside, into the  gut--and pulls us into it's sexy, sonic groove.<br />It's the only Cult album  I absolutely have to own. It should be your first choice as well. But I  warn you, you'll be spoiled--any of their other stuff just can't measure  up.

B00000BKI4|5.0|i love this album.  it sounds to me like it could've been recorded in the early 70s.  it's not a &quot;party&quot; record, though--you'll have to be patient.  but once it gets under your skin, you'll love every second of it.   how many modern records can you say that about?
B00000253N|5.0|With all due respect, Music Fan from Seattle: i don't know how you have actually listened to this album and written what you did:<br />&quot;What I don't like about the album is how most of the characters are these macho  types who treat women in the old American stereotypical fashion of  &quot;women are weak and therefore need to be protected and  sheltered&quot;. <br />Please listen to If You See Her, Say Hello again. Or  Sheltered From the Storm.  It is not the women who are &quot;weak&quot; on  this album - it is Dylan.  For that reason, the album is timeless.  I  predict we will be listening to Dylan much longer than we will be reading  Kerouac.

B000002UJQ|5.0|this is the millenial soundtrack; the score to Y2K. this music excited me in a way i thought was lost. truly important music when most all &quot;new rock&quot; is sophomoric and redundant. thank you, radiohead, for helping  me to continue to believe in rock and roll as art--as something much bigger  than its collective parts.
B000002MG1|5.0|11 studio albums is quite an achievement in music today... that they are all very good (YES! even Monster!)is an even better achievement. It certainly isn't R.E.M.'s most consistent album. The instrumental is nice  but not essential, 'Ignoreland' is full of good intentions but a bit  clumbsy and while '..Sidewinder..' is a great single it's totally out of  place on this album. The remaining 9 songs however are beyond good. It's  hard to define it but in a way that's the point. It's simple, sometimes  even direct but this isn't music to stand back and admire, it's music to  pick you back up. I don't know if technically it's the best album of all  time but if I could only take 2 albums with me to a desert island I'd take  this......twice. It explores the darkest themes but sounds uplifting.  'Sweetness Follows' is the unappreciated classic, 'Star me Kitten' is drop  dead gorgeous and only Michael Stipe could sing 'Everybody Hurts' and make  it sound so sincere. 'Man On The Moon' is still wonderful and forms the  first third of the greatest finish to any album ever made. As the last  guitar strums begin to fade and Michael Stipe whispers &quot;All of this is  coming your way&quot;, you start to think that everything will turn out  alright.
0790725657|4.0|I had never read the story, nor seen the movie in the theatre.  One day, while flipping channels, I came across it and with my luck, it had just started.  Within the first five minutes, I was mesmerized.  By the end of  the movie, I was in tears!  I'm sorry that those who loved the story so  much didn't like the movie, but having nothing else to base it on, I LOVED  IT!!!  (And later on, so did my husband when he saw it).  Our daughter is 4  1/2 now, and I can't imagine her growing up without this wonderful film!   Enjoy!
0790734060|5.0|The underlying theme here is that genius is given by God sometimes to those who may not deserve it. I pitied Salieri in this film. Excellent acting by F. Murray Abraham. The interaction between Salieri and Mozart  during the composition of the Requiem is fascinating.
6301969588|5.0|Despite others' comments, I cannot see this movie as humanitarian.  While claiming, both in the opening credits and throughout most of the film, to expose the humanity under the mask of circus side-show freakdom, it merely  perpetuates different stereotypes and fantastic exaggerations than its  predecessors.  Instead of relying on the old image of repulsive \\"monsters,\\"  Browning paints a picture of a vengeful cult of extraordinary people who  have begun to resent the society that rejects them.  In a sense, it is more  of a prototypical Browning horror film than it is a humanitarian project.  However, the film is still extremely fascinating as a historical artifact;  it illustrates America's struggle to come to terms with its past.  In the  words of Rosmarie Garland Thompson, &quot;The extraordinary body is  fundamental to the narratives by which we make sense of ourselves and our  world.&quot;
078401115X|5.0|The cinemaphotography is breathtaking, the plot is thought-provoking, and the effect is lingering.  Not bad for a movie that your friends have never even heard of! :-)
0385493800|3.0|Why is it that all new books by popular authors are written as screenplays?  While the format is not of a screen play, this new books is bound to show up on the screen.  I am really tired of my favorite authors  writing simply for the money and a possible movie deal.   While I enjoyed  the book, the story was too far fetched to get into.  The heirs are taken  from the movie &quot;Greedy&quot;, and the idea that Phelens leaves all his  money to some unknown illegit daughter in brazil, is just too much!  This  book was written for one reason - To make a movie out of it.  Grisham is  not the only guilty one here, Clancy, King &amp; Barker have fallen into  the same rut with their new books too.
0571179924|5.0|I totally enjoyed this book it is a great read. After completing it I was compelled to watch the movie, and I admit the movie was good but it just don't give the insight of the book. Also the movie changes all the names of  the actual people involved and leaves certain parts out. All in all if you  are looking for an enjoyable read go the the library or the bookstore and  check this one out.
0790733226|5.0|Contact was one of the best movies that I have ever seen in my life. It is not just a thrilling science fiction movie. It extends beyond the limits of science fiction making the audience think about the human nature and the  relationship between science and religion.  Contact features an interesting  relation between an astronomer and a &quot;priest&quot;. In the end, it  shows how these two opposite sides can easily contact. The audio  commentaries by Jodie Foster and Rob Zemeckis are also very interesting  since you get an insight on the background of the movie.  I highly  recommend this movie and I'm sure you'll never get bored watching it.
6300214826|5.0|Nothing like The End by the legendary Doors could be so prophetic in the case of this movie. If Coppola did not make this movie, some people would never know what could happen to a man, psychologically, while this kind of  fighting was going on around him. Marlon Brando gives a shocking  performance of the insane Colnel Kurtz, who uses native Cambodian villagers  to do what he says, and to die for him
630518299X|5.0|A wonderful film about breaking the barriers society and other people have set for you. Excellent performances from the entire leading cast, especially Harris and Carey.
B00000AFHM|3.0|I rushed to the store the Tuesday &quot;The Boy with the Arab Strap&quot; came out with high hopes.  When I got home to listen to it, I was both shocked and disappointed.  Not only had Belle and Sebastian lightened their  already deathly soft sound even more, but they were slipping!  The songs  weren't as catchy, as funny anymore.  After a couple days I tossed the CD  into the corner in favor of its more worthy brethren, &quot;If You're  Feeling Sinister.&quot;  A couple weeks ago, though, I decided to give  &quot;Arab Strap&quot; another chance, and for some reason it started to  grow on me.  The songs on here aren't all great - &quot;Seymour Stein&quot;  sounds really, really whiny to these ears - but they all add up to a pretty  good album.  First-time Belle and Sebastian listeners, however, should opt  for the earlier, better album until buying this one.
630522577X|5.0|The staging, music, casting, and production are all wonderful. Probobly my favorite movie I own. The restoration is amazing!
B000002IZ4|5.0|First the good news, STP will be back in the studio (with Weiland) in March.  <br />Now, this is a great album (all three are).  STP, despite the ignorance of the critics, does have a distinct sound.  Weiland sings a hell  of a lot better then Eddie Vedder (just to address that asinine thought).   Basically, this is an evolution of their musical style, a very nice  evolution too.
B000002JOH|5.0|Not many groups could dream of being this heavy and still sounding good. I'm glad to see that over 1,000,000 people realized the pure power of this CD and bought it. &quot;Mouth For War,&quot; &quot;A New Level,&quot;  &quot;Walk,&quot; and &quot;No Good (Attack The Radical)&quot; are just  some of the amazing songs on this CD. VULGAR DISPLAY is a must-own for any  fan of metal.
0792838637|5.0|This was my first time seeing a DVD so I was impressed by the picture, sound, etc.  I thought the format for this DVD was great though.  It had lots of special featers and inside information.  I especially like the 007  behind the scenes clips.
B000003TA4|5.0|This is musical genius Kurt Cobain's legendary CD that revolutionized music. &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit,&quot; &quot;Come As You Are,&quot; and &quot;Lithium&quot; are some of the best songs of the decade. If  there's anyone who doesn't own this yet (which is doubtful), you should buy  this.
0451160916|5.0|I have read Stephen King's novel for a long time. Above all, &quot;The Shining&quot; was very exiting, and frightening novel. Its atmosphere s so absorbing, and that's why I have read this novel three of four times. I also recommend you to watch Stanley Kubrick's movie based on this novel. Although Kubrick made very strange adaptation, but it also has chilling atmosphere.
B000002HMH|5.0|This is simply an incredible CD. It contains my favorite Metallica song, &quot;King Nothing,&quot; plus the hits &quot;Until It Sleeps,&quot; &quot;Ain't My Bitch,&quot; &quot;Bleeding Me,&quot; and &quot;Hero Of The  Day.&quot; There is not one bad song on this CD, and it's definitly worth  getting.
0060977493|5.0|This book was one of the most richly worded books I have read in a long time.  After passing my middle of the book reading glance at the book store, I took this home and have been in love with it ever since.  Of  course, it didn't win the Booker Prize for nothing.  If your a language  buff this book will keep you reading and re-reading just to listen to the  poetry in this well crafted prose.  Rivals Garcia-Marquez.
