B007XS2FPU|2|My mechanic says it happens that not all parts work as they should. Will have to replace this part, idle is running too high and can't be calibrated.  Faulty part.  Was shipped out in a timely manner.
B000ZMHNK8|5|This protectant really works. I'm really impressed and will definitely purchase again.
B0031WGQBQ|1|While trying to install the passenger side rear window. The tension of the top split the zipper-teeth seam and then the Metal Zipper itself, became stuck in the opening.  While trying to get the Metal Zipper back off the whole Metal Zipper Broke OFF!
B00GCU281G|5|Fits like a glove in my '14 Summit and does a nice job reflecting the rays.
B000B8JUNY|5|Does the job! cant get any better for this price. A++++
B00MRC61DY|1|These do NOT fit the Jeep Cherokee (1984-2001) they fit the Chrysler KL.
B007SVYXUC|5|Easy to attach, rolls around nicely!
B001EP0HSK|4|works but WAS not a easy install on a 2014 Sierra 1500 ext cab shortbed. Very tight without a ratcheting 3/4 wrench. Really noway to torque it. Just have to tighten as tight as possible. I am quit mechanical but this was a task on the drivers side (gas tank).
B003RGIWO0|2|*UPDATE* Product fail on Sept 2 2015, motor may be shot......  I am old school, so I was very hesitant of not doing it the right way and replacing the head gaskets on my 2000 Ford Explorer XLT with a 4.0 SOHC I followed the directions on the HG-1 bottle to a tee, it's been 4 weeks and the engine runs beautiful!!!  Outstanding product. 5 Star!!! David W, Northern MI
B003SS62PS|5|All good!
B00UYDF0QC|5|Was headed on a 4 day 1200 mile ride in August and wanted protection but knew my leather jacket would only be worn in the early mornings at the most, so checked around and decided on this and it worked very well!  Was able to wear it up into the low 80's and was comfortable except when stopped.  I wore it all but maybe 70 - 100 miles of the trip.  It is comfortable, adjustable and did the job very well.
B0058WXNOK|5|I got this to replace the $100+ disaster that is Magic Mender.  I especially like the specific press and heat cure process unlike the MM room temp cure.  The 3M kit also contains a paper texture method that is really good.  The Magic Mender claims to be color matched but I found that to be inaccurate and the exchange process slow and costly.  This 3M kit is actually really easy to color blend because exposure to air does not immediately start the curing so you don't have to race the clock.

B000QBA51M|3|Dry rotted and cracked in a few years would recommend weathertech visors instead.
B00JW1W3P8|3|UPDATE: (May 2016): After a couple Emails to New Parts Warehouse, they had Dorman send me a replacement switch. I installed it over the weekend, and everything is functioning correctly (headlamps, turn signals, windshield wipers, cruise control, hi/low switch).  UPDATE (February 2016): The windshield wipers don't function on some speeds. Occasionally, only the highest speed will get them to wipe at all. The vendor asked if I wanted a replacement. I said that I did, but that was over a month ago and they haven't contacted me since. Looks like I'll have to replace this item again, and also pay for the part to replace this one.  UPDATE: Now that it's rained a few times, I've discovered that this multi-function switch has a downside--the windshield wipers don't always work on all settings. Some of the speeds won't work, or will work and then stop. The highest speed always works, but the lower speed comes and goes, and some of the delay settings don't work at all.  This multifunction switch/lever arrived in four days. It replaced the OEM part almost exactly. One pair of wires was shorter than the original, but that portion of the harness was still long enough to reach the connector. I went with Dorman rather than another couple sources because: 1. The reviews for the others said that some wires had to be spliced due to being too short, 2. I have been pleased with the other Dorman repair parts I've purchased.  This repair was needed because both the high beams and low beams stopped working...no headlights! The headlamps work now. I also checked the turn signals, wipers and cruise control. (The cruise control functions are on the steering wheel, but the on/off toggle is on the multifunction switch.) It's been working perfectly for 10 days.  The repair took about two hours, mostly removing covers and panels to get at the failed part. It was easier than I expected. Some connectors were a little hard to reach. There are lots of instructions online...I followed the one that does NOT require removing the steering wheel.
B001KODX4A|5|Great quality, everything fit as the original. Seals well.
B00HQZB4I4|5|Much better than original fan. Easy install. Hardest part is cleaning up around the old fan before install.
B005SSJEZQ|5|Worked great in a 2000 VW Golf
B000ONZNV4|5|Wonderful Product. operates as described
B00REJXFM0|4|Over all, I'm really happy with this cover. However, On my Nissan Frontier with the bed rail moveable tie downs, I had to modify the clamping points to be able to slide them onto the track. (They're too wide by about 3/8 inch.)
B0043063JU|5|Nice size & quality
B0009NUG66|5|First time I used it, it was pouring so hard I had to pull over for 20 minutes. Everything held up and nothing was wet!

B00MJDTX54|2|Cheap knockoffs that don't fit well at all. Spend the extra money on spyder if you want an actual upgrade.
B000C9JPO6|5|still working after 4 years
B00GOFNP7A|5|Good quality! Stuck well to my rooftop carrier
B00S0U09R6|1|Wrong part.
B00VIIAT9K|5|Don't bother replacing the boots anymore. Just bite the bullet and replace both shafts because they are most likely bad anyway plus replacing the shafts is so much quicker and a whole lot cleaner.
B005LXTOHQ|4|Glad to fix my Honda Pilot 2004 rear passenger window for this low price instead of the autoparts price ($20-25 more), plus the labor of a shop.  Look up on YouTube to fix this.  It took me 60-90 minutes, but was more patience work than difficult.
B0014YJFCK|1|One was bad I took to long to install and it could not be returned
B00RM327NG|5|Works great! very strong magnet!
B00FOSSPGO|5|Same benefits, but with the tools to be able to add whatever amount you need.  Exceptional product
B0022ZI0JY|2|Was too small for my hands: 10&#34; middle finger to thumb. I preferred Titan Mini Scrapper.
B00N0H958I|5|Great product
B00SBXJ1P8|5|Easy installation.  Took less than 30 minutes.  One man install.  He is happy as a calm. Gives you  that  sleek look while providing you with more interior space with added security  (whem in use with locking tailgate)
B004MDEV38|4|Appears to be a solid product.<br /><br />Tips:<br />It took me a long time to install this because the passenger side nuts were rusty and one bolt would not fasten all the way in.<br />I tried to clean the thread using a wire brush, but still no luck.<br />I ended up adding extra washers as spacers so that I can still tighten the bolt.<br /><br />On top of this, due to the exhaust pipes on the passenger side, there wasn't enough to room to work with the bolt and wrench.
B00L6NTI58|1|Many problems with light's staying on
B005PSPD22|5|Works like a charm, for much less than the dealership.
B00BK86J9M|5|I ordered these for my Nissan Quest 2011. Easy to install and looks great on our van. Make sure that you prepare and clean the area before you apply them to ensure a proper fit.
B00CC5EBNI|1|the ones in the picture were not what I received. they were scratched and unuseable
B00GJJ088U|5|Perfect OE replacement part.  Easy to install.
B004PX1F9S|4|Pulled my big block with this, works great, and reasonably priced.
B004BHZR1A|4|The emblem looks alright but when it arrived the sticky backing wasn't attached to the back of it so I had to glue it back on myself.
B002Y20KWA|1|Fell apart a week after I got it. Faulty design. I tightened the little screws using an eyeglass screwdriver, but it fell apart later that day. Couldn't get it to stay together. Junk.
B00927AYDA|5|Great turn around on the shipping. OEM muffler with gaskets. Easy bolt on fix.
B00KOD8W7Q|5|fast deliver and good product
B002XM5G70|1|. Ordered this to replace pump in my motor home. I didn't feel a need to read directions since I have replaced similar items many times. Pump is shipped with loose barb fittings in the box. My current  system has threaded fittings.When connecting the pump the outlet connection cracked at the base rendering the pump useless. I have tried numerous methods to repair to no avail. After then reading the directions it is stated this might occur because the pump housing is made from a cheap thin plastic.Would it have cost that much more to have a brass connection or at the least a heavy gauge plastic. I should have just sent it back as defective instead of trying to correct the problem. so much for being honest.
B000GU24HG|2|Very thin.
B005FNKSMW|5|Came in on time and in great shape. Very reasonably priced. Charged for 24 hours and has worked like a dream ever since!
B00AGM9FHQ|1|Picture shown is not the product received. Flap on driver side mat is not there. Left foot will dirty your carpet with the mats.
B00332GMXQ|5|This is my second set. Bought them for my new truck. Installed in ten minutes. Perfect fit.
B00FYX2FQK|5|Great Quality!
B008CEQK7S|1|Amazon said it would fit my truck but it was too small. I had to ship it back.
B0009IBJE4|4|Charges well and shows what % of charge is completed.  One complaint is it does not shut off when fully charged.
B00AFBXQNC|5|My favorite chemical guys soap so slick and smells so good works prefect in the foam Cannon
B000YCAM70|5|Love this pad in back of car....
B0024E6QX0|5|again, exactly what I needed
B0094IZ3BA|2|Really dont like this stuff. Application is crazy with a terminator machine gun spray tip thingey that sprays uncleanable graphite all over the place and it looks like you shot a robot bug with a bug a salt. Leaks like crazy in storage. I keep it in a cool dry basement in Colorado and on both cans I owned the spray cap starts to leak. Its the propellant that leaks, not the lube. It makes a mess when it dries and allows a whole bunch of lube in the can that goes unused because theres no stinkin propellant!
B001I4C61S|5|Fits perfectly
B000L50ZVI|5|Very satisfied
B001D9E41I|5|exactly what I needed
B002M5IQRU|3|Not much to say, they're air filters, work as they should, low price, BUT, the pictures shows activated carbon and received white ones (non-carbon activated)
B00TJ2F5H8|5|Looooove it!!!
B0053NX6W8|5|perfect fit
B004OI3OWK|5|these are excellent filters, although I don't like the Volant CAI.

B00G6KGPFM|5|Sealed up my rv roof very nicely!
B000ET5TFI|5|best plug
B00E5OUOCQ|4|Works as expected. A lil hard to get it to stay in place at times
B00480GY0S|2|Sorry; don't know whether to rate the product bad, or if it was Amazon; said it would fit my 2007 Mazda 6 but did not, so sitting here unused...  (unfortunately opened though I didn't touch the bulb, but for the price I guess I'll just toss it)
B00OGS3OHS|5|Very nice. Delivered quickly. I'm happy with purchase.
B000WOB4OA|1|Does not fit correctly. Upper holes drilled equally too high. Lower edge rubs fairing. Thicker acrylic will require longer screws. Bike is 1986 Venture Royale. Absolutely  never dropped and original windshield fits perfect. Contacting Slipstreamer for possible correction. If no satisfaction will return and go with different brand. Return is last resort as this seller makes you pay return shipping, regardless of problem origin.
B009S2WVJE|5|Perfect fit and great price.
B00WFB3RWA|5|Perfect fit!
B00IZS9AVE|5|I was way overdue for a plug change on my ML350, with 110,000 miles on what was possibly the original plugs. When I purchased the vehicle at 85,000 miles, I was amazed at the power of the V6. I am once again amazed at the power, now that I have installed these plugs.<br /><br />Honestly though, as worn as my plugs were, any plug would make a big improvement. That said, these are certainly good plugs, and the pre-gap is well protected from getting knocked around inside the packaging.<br /><br />Sadly, I can't comment on any improvement in fuel economy, due to new tires and hauling my boat occasionally.
B003POL47Q|5|Great product
B00NGOS810|5|The mirror fit perfectly on my 2009 Subaru Legacy. Shipping was very fast!

B005MZYWKM|3|not bad, pretty small
B001RJN56Y|5|Good！👍
B004C46ISS|5|This is the second time I have purchased this set. I love it!!
B0098M5LUK|5|Awesome value. Got exactly what I ordered.
B00J62Z8OQ|4|This item is priced well below its competitors and claims high resistance to corrosive agents.  I purchased and installed on a 2013 Xterra (circa AUG2015), and found a few points perspective buyers should know (at least Nissan Xterra owners).  There will be several excess washers (largest sizes in your kit).  Also, though stating to put the attachment arms together first, don’t tighten fully as adjusting will be necessary.  The middle attachment arms had to be placed on the opposite side on the vehicle indicated (middle driver’s fit on the middle passenger’s side and visa versa).  Otherwise these step bars went on w/o a hitch.  Sizes of the washers may not be what’s indicated either.
B0042HFGQU|5|Most excellent. Worked out great. Thanks
B0083I36YI|5|works great sounds great
B0009TAOG2|4|Ball is nice, but the nut is not stainless steel.

B00B1VBQRS|5|ROYAL PURPLE is a great product. Recommend to everyone.
B00LX6GIAG|5|It fits and it works. If it didn't I wouldn't say that it did ya got me?
B00067BVKK|2|Short lifespan, I only owned the car they were placed on for 10-months and one light failed before then.  Not sure if they produced illumination beyond factory lights.
B0000AY2Z6|4|Arrived on time in good shape. Good air flow has some noise on high will check back after using awhile
B0002SA3XE|5|Made almost exactly the same as the last one I bought for my YJ… back in 1988. That's how long the first Bestop lasted. I expect this new one will outlive me.
B00REORNUU|5|Wonderful heavy duty item. Has held up super well and looks amazing.
B004YC3VW4|4|Great item.
B00A9T28S4|1|I received bottle with loose cap. Cleaner leaked out of bottle. Luckily, bottle was enclosed in a sealed plastic bag.
B004YTOJ78|5|Fast shipping  A++±+++++++
B00MUCPJ4I|5|Exactly what I was looking for. Every other Volkswagen we get into our dealership has a worn out boot, this is a great replacement for the money. All you need is a pair of crimp pliers to remove the old one and install the new one.
B00KV6O34M|5|proud to have this on my truck
B0065S6S8Y|5|Perfect
B002UC6OYC|5|Excellent product, easy to install!
B00B3O4AW6|5|100%

B00EYK58EU|3|Works pretty good
B00EZY337E|5|Good product.. would recommend.
B004HIKJI4|5|I love my subaru and this net just makes the trunk more versatile and useful! The net is a great buy and it only took my husband a few min to install.
B00S4LIR2U|1|Got here in time, but switch is not yellow, its orange, and only 1 switch out of the 4 I bought work
B00JGJGIKW|2|This cable does not fit on the post of the Marinco 701 battery disconnect switch as the hole is too small
B0067UE9FE|5|Works as it should
B002EJWRLU|1|I bought this because customer reviews here said this fit their 2007 Mini Cooper S! WRONG!! It does not fit and you can't safely drive because of mis match.. now I get to tango with the dealership to get a full refund and return the mats. Thanks a lot..  can't even trust customer reviews anymore..  real bummer!
B00RUDZ2N0|4|Good stuff. Had one of the brakets snap on me which angered me but probably my fault. Lock washers and junk though. Have a set on hand just incase and the waffle springs didnt work so i had to go to a HD dealer and get peg springs. All in all good highway pegs and very nice looking on my FLSTC
B003CX6QQE|5|Great fit, and so far the elastic around the bottom has kept the cover in place. It seems like it gives great protection. I plan to buy the same model cover for another car.  Excellent for the money.
B001CEG90I|1|Fit check doesn't work! This does not fit my 2011 Scion xD. The shape is completely different. I waited to long too long to try it and now I can't even return it.
B00YTXKKDQ|1|Arrived DOA. Did not have a chance to evaluate it. Returning it.
B00RUDEI4E|5|good
B00L888TVA|5|This is awesome. Better than that plastic insert you get. Gas station attendants all ask me where I got it. The company provides two o-rings to ensure a great fit. The tether works great to avoid losing this spendy item.
B0024ECIP0|5|Delivered as described and promised
B00GG9FE7I|5|Bought a quart a couple of months ago loved it so much a just bought a gallon. Use it on 3 daily drivers tires & trim looks fantastic.
B007LIBWU6|5|Nice and sturdy.  Awesome!
B000N9VF6Q|3|I bought this after being told it would quiet my RV water pump, located under the bed, it did not.  Really could not tell a difference in the sound. It did give you a little quicker water.  Personally not worth the time & cost.  Find a quieter & more efficient pump, If such an animal exists in this throw away world.
B008R63HJU|2|They work really good but if you place them in a certain spot where they can be reached or touched or bumped they brake real easily. I bought two sets and am down to the two small lights on the back of my two small windows in my car.
B009W3PU06|5|Good quality, well crafted.
B00T2VSHBM|5|it fit perfectly.  works very well.  most people dont realize how high that first step is and enjoy the fact there is help to get on board.
B000KYZRXQ|1|Horn button was pushed in. Delivery was fast. Works but like I said. Button was pushed in.
B001PWFPE8|5|Great item, easy to instell and works well.  I bought it so that when my 8 yr old opens the tailgate he does not get a broken nose.
B00QPQD1NQ|3|Used it today, 1st day, to jump start myJohn Deer riding mower. Had been jumping it off my pickup. It usuall took an hour or more. Today it started wright  off. Could not have done better. I wanted to try it out on my iphone 5. The connections would not fit. Sure would have been nice to use it on trips.
B00QN14N3A|4|For the price, I really like them. They were a little stiff, but as I am breaking them in, they seem to be very comfortable. I love that it comes with the rain covers. I did an hour ride the other day at probably 55 degrees, and my hands stayed warm enough, wiggling them occasionally, to not bother me horribly. Driving an hour at 50 degrees (feeling like 45 according to the weather app) my hands were cold enough that I stopped to get handwarmers about a half hour in.  The only thing I don't like are the rain covers. They are made of a very slick material. I couldn't even get the second one on with the cover on the first one, and they definitely didn't work for doing anything such as lifting my visor due to the slickness.
B00Y5M9KHI|5|Looks grate!
B004I0YK2C|5|Great!
B00HE67HEA|5|Easy to use blends in perfect !
B004HCOE8Q|1|I'm extremely disappointed with this product. I followed the instructions from beginning to end and even after a second application in the same area I can still see the light scratches this product is supposed to &#34;erase completely&#34; (and my car is only 1 year old!!). Don't spend your money on something that is worthless.
B00029J3AW|5|Very nice looking muffler fits great
B002GUELBQ|5|EXCELLENT
B000BYELQY|5|Replacing the windshield wiper could not get any easier than this.  It took less than a minute and I didn't look at the instructions.  It worked perfectly for my VW.
B000F5ECUY|5|For the price, this was perfect. Did all the valves on a six cylinder Subaru engine very quickly with this tool. The instructions state that you should tap the valve spring caps with a hammer, i used a piece of 1&#34; tubing i had laying around. Definitely do this part for every valve, it loosens up the keepers and makes the whole job easier.
B00523AMBC|5|takes care of taste problems with water in park.
B003BZIN1O|1|This does NOT fit my R53 2003 Mini Cooper S.<br /><br />To be clear, it does actually snap in place, but the frame is significantly different, and it is NOT free to swivel properly.  It also looks very different from the OEM wiper.  Can if function?  Barely, but not well, because it doesn't freely swivel level to the window.<br /><br />To make matters worse, I attempted to instead steal the rubber wiper and transplant it to my old frame, but this is not possible because they have a different size mounting rail.<br /><br />From my limited additional research, it appears there are two different rear wiper versions, This wiper *should* work on 2005 and later R50 and R53 Mini Coopers, but at some point in 2004 is when the design changed.  If you have a 2002-2003 Mini, this will NOT work.  If you have a 2004, it *might*.<br /><br />The seller needs to do the proper research and clarify for us... until then - 1 star.<br /><br />If you are in doubt, check the photo I added with both versions side by side, and match yours properly before purchasing.
B00IEKNGAE|5|I bought these to replace the factory rotors on my 2004 Camry that had finally rusted out and warped after 175k miles. I went to a local brake place, who was going to charge me 180 for new rotors. I decided to go on here and get them myself. Even though they shipped from Canada, they got to my doorstep quickly. Once I broke the old rotors off, these went on with no effort. Finally I can stop my car without being shaken to death. The only thing is that for the first few miles, if I were to apply a lot of pressure to my brakes, the protective coating on the rotors smells like burning plastic, but that's to be expected. Otherwise, awesome!!!
B00KHUQ9NK|5|I am happy with this product and am enjoying it every time I drive my truck
B0035XGPNA|5|Used this on silver and grey alloy wheels and it works great. Started using it on black wheels and it leaves a cloudy film. The purpose still works but the film isn't worth the trade off on black.
B002JH7PEQ|5|We love this for the car!  It's already been on a few trips and we just love it. The fan on the charger can be a little loud at times, but worth it.
B0048G3L3K|4|High quality and perfect fit
B00J070T3M|3|The Good: The covers fit well and had very good directions on how to install them. They don't look cheap. They also were easy to install.<br /><br />The Bad: The center console cover was not made well and was not the same size as my console.
B0055DO2W4|5|Amazing additive, Increased my mid range and High end power. Noticible power from the 1st time I started the engine
B00KTHWJ08|4|Just what I needed.  The original type
B001YJ2G62|1|Not enough for complete fairing installation and bolts are very soft aluminum and strip or break off very easily
B0095OIU68|4|Looks impressive on. We were surprised that it's not completely solid, however does go on nicely.
B007KPJIRE|5|This product is a great replacement for the original factory parts.
B0050NGB6O|5|Works great, good price
B0089LTG3Y|5|Saved a bunch installing these myself.  I used  a YouTube video to put them into my 2010 Honda Element. Very easy and I saved a bunch over a dealership install.  I had no idea these existed in my car until inquiring about the main engine air filter and now my AC is running better.  I live in a dusty area and plan on replacing these regularly.
B00TDOH53O|5|Both scents smell great!
B000ED09I6|5|Great product, good price, almost perfect direct bolt-on (the tips touch the exhaust shrouds, probably needs some trimming). Hangers all in the correct place, length is just right (tips are an inch or two further out than factory, but that was expected).<br /><br />My package was shipped solely with the catback installation hardware, but not the midpipe hardware (midpipe-manifold gasket, and the three bolts/nuts/washers), which is only a minor issue.<br /><br />If noise is not your thing, this is not the exhaust for you (at least without some silencers). According to the 'Sound Meter' app on my phone, the car is as loud at cold idle now as it was a redline on the full stock system.
B005C1Y9D6|1|Each second bulb is defective
B002E3FXB2|5|1 hour install. Perfect fit, quality piece. Worth it.<br />Factory appearance, very pleased
B00ABYVT64|3|The sprayer worked great . But the bottle melted .<br />I was using a chemical paint stripper.<br /> I used a different bottle;To finish the job
B00901NCVO|5|Good quality.. It gets the job done
B00173U7D4|5|Smells fresh but not over powering. Does the job. Even happier that it's natural.<br />Could not take the other air fresheners like Lysol any longer.
B00YVHGTBM|4|This works great with both the Carista and Torque android apps on my '15 Audi S4 6MT. The Carista app is a little flakey on configurations (doesn't seem to read correctly for some features but fine writing) but can be made to do the job. I'm sure future revisions will correct and improve features, a satisfying $40+$20 spend. The adapter delivers 0.1sec logging times with Torque which is more than adequate to satisfy my curiousity as to what the Audi S4 esc is doing with my mediocre up and downshifts.
B0013U6Z6O|5|Easy to install, matches vehicle interior
B001C6Q7HG|5|Fast shipping and great price. It's the same as the OEM part so it fit and works very  well.
B00SW8TI14|5|So far so good, very bright and moisture has been kept out after 2 huge storms 5 stars
B005WTPBZ8|1|Is it a set of two or only one ? i got the delivery of the product yesterday but when the box was opened there was only one blade
B00F9XNF3W|2|too few terminals in the bag.  this is a price rip-off.  also, be sure to note the size of the wire it accepts; very small wire.
B00R750UD8|2|Not thinsulate lined! Very cheap lining and cheap gloves.
B008ECC2Z2|1|This didn't fit in my 2005 Corolla (as was stated). I pushed it in, but it didn't snap in snugly. It's more or less bent in place and stuffing the hole.
B009B9PXT4|4|Not perfect - but the best one I have been able to find.
B00ZCCMTA0|4|I like the light, comes with horrible tape and no instructions tho.
B00HJEGQQ2|4|I bought these to replace the stock break lights on my car. They are brighter than before, and I like the deeper and more brilliant red light that is produced. The only problem is since these lights use so much less energy than standard bulbs, the computer on my car reads the low current and thinks my taillight are out. This means my taillight outage indicator is constantly on, which is a little annoying. I have checked a couple times to make sure they are working, and they have, and still are working. Overall, I am happy with this purchase.
B000E7D394|5|It's what i expected. The wire was pretty tough to flex though.
B00HTOB0NG|5|excellent product from an excellent buyer
B00TDOGY04|1|Awful. Doesn't smell like anything other than chemicals, and even that scent doesn't last more than 10 seconds
B000F5LKNQ|4|very easy to install on my F-150 with factory trailer light outlet.  Only complaint would be the shim is somewhat difficult to get right to prevent the rattling.  I have a loud exhaust, so I couldn't hear it rattle if I tried anyway.
B008Y2L6W2|5|Great stickers from this company..
B00M9MHH08|5|Excellent!
B000C39C86|4|I've been using it for months and no leaks
B00407RRFA|1|Terrible terrible terrible stuff... Just take it to an auto body shop. If I could rate it 0 I would. Do not buy, just put your money towards an auto body shop.
B0041E8VZ2|5|great product and great price
B00IOBSZJK|2|First, for those maybe wondering, this seems to be almost exactly the same product as the tire dressing; I bought both and have used both and the results are pretty similar; the trim dressing MIGHT be a little less thick than the tire dressing, as I used the tire dressing on the hard plastic trim on the windshield and it seemed to drip down and leave &#34;trails&#34; the way it dried almost like a thick coat of paint would; I used the trim dressing on the rubber trim around the windows and it seemed to seem almost TOO thin of a coat; the gloss applies evenly but the black coloration seemed to be spotty at best; unfortunately once the first coat dries however it looks thats basically how it's gonna look, so if a spot or section just has the gloss part of this formulation but didn't get the black acrylic part for whatever reason, that's it, you now have a nice glossy coat sitting on top of grey rubber, and applying another coat will not change it to black; if it can't &#34;absorb&#34; into the rubber, it doesn't really make a difference on the final appearance.<br /><br />I originally gave this one star but I guess it's worth two because, hey, it does create a glossy shine to everything, but I really do not like that it left many spots and whole sections of trim as being glossy but NOT black at all; in the sun or from a distance it's not really easy to see that the application is uneven at all, so I guess it's &#34;tolerable&#34;... I just wish that it absorbed better into rubber, which seems to be a &#34;thirsty&#34; material, so some spots might benefit from a second coat but since this is both paint and gloss in one application you can't go back and get &#34;under&#34; the coating to try to blacken the rubber again.<br /><br />I liked that the tire dressing was a 2-part kit; it has a cleaner for prep and then the product to apply afterwards... this kit should be 2-part as well: one bottle should just be the black acrylic without any gloss in the mix, that way if some gets &#34;absorbed&#34; into the rubber and it turns back to grey when it dries, you could apply more until it's FULLY black... then once it's COMPLETELY black, the gloss which acts like a &#34;clearcoat&#34; should be able to be applied as the second step, THAT would make for impressive results... as it stands though this is shampoo+conditioner in one, and we all know how well that works.
B001DKQNUC|5|AAA+++ just as ordered!
B003EAOSME|1|Very bright but can't see very well
B000CN76Q6|4|good fit
B0012PE184|5|Very good shock to be considered used.
B00032KBFE|5|AAA+++ just as ordered!
B0000UUU9Q|5|Very nice looking but had to be made to fit the way I wanted it look, that was no problem though.
B000MS5T42|3|Ok
B0083G3AXC|4|It works very well, but I wish the cup slot was a little bigger.  Most of my mugs do not fit in it.
B000C7RV5I|5|Great price! Speedy delivery which is a big plus when needing auto parts for repair! Beating the parts store by price and delivery. Will buy again.
B000NCI854|5|The charger exceeded my expectations.
B00P1TDM28|5|good product
B0001L0DFA|5|Love it, its the real deal not the cheap knockoff.
B00C53K6MW|5|Perfect.
B004ME11FS|3|Does the job. The raveled coil it arrives in is a struggle to deal with. It's like fighting with a spring. It threatens you with kinking if you try to straighten it out.
B00V5Q4BF8|5|Work and function as expected
B001OXZ1IS|5|Works great, fits my old style Sirius radio
B0027K41QU|5|Worked great.
B001U522GO|2|I love the Chemical guys products - they all work amazingly! The bucket with the grit guard is genius, and the wash pad is great. Unfortunately my car wash soap bottle has a hole in it. I noticed some leaking and thought it was just leaking through the cap until I moved it and noticed a huge crack/hole in the bottom and the soap came pouring out. All in all a great starter kit, but it's very difficult to clean my truck when the shampoo is all over the garage floor. Great product, poor packaging - will update to 5 stars if they can replace the car soap that I've lost. I have multiple other items of theirs and no issues getting those in tact.
B00KTHYAUU|1|Doesn't work...
B000C9426W|5|I like how it works after the installation
B0040CWYUI|5|These are for the lower trim piece for my 2006 Pontiac Vibe ( Toyota Matrix) fit perfectly and were cost effective. I even have some left over if I ever need anymore!
B001U7MXW0|4|This is our second set.  The 1st set lasted at least 5 years. Very satisfied.  I wish there would be a25&#34; size.
B00DOHFLTQ|5|Very well made rear luggage cover.  It's doing the job.  I would recommend it.
B0062VP45M|5|This decal is cut to fit a Baby on Board sign that you can get just about anywhere for about $4. Perfect fit!<br />I can not even begin to count the numbers of comments we get about this decal.  People love it. Except for grandma who was offended that I would speak about my pregnant wife (her granddaughter) that way. Lol.
B001PWA0IO|5|Worked great...
B00AYEVRWW|5|Solved OBDII code issue
B00J3NPOI8|2|very bad quality
B00DUUYNW8|5|Unbelievable price  comparison to any local autoparts store
B00D8DR0AO|5|Some times I only get to wash my car at night and this is perfect for washing it in the garage in the light away from all the bugs. Was nervous about swirl marks and scratches but my paint looks the same as with normal car washes.
B006OQ35GU|5|An essential addition to the RV for draining the tanks using a waste water pump.
B008B9OMPG|4|not bad but a little light weight, not a lot of support
B007WMEJFQ|5|A little difficult to remove but it sticks great. Got it on the windscreen of my bike
B00GZG7X9Y|5|great for testing lots of different voltage and current circuits at my work bench. Would buy again
B0024E6ZW2|5|Just perfect for steadying our step on our little 14ft camping trailer. Strong and easy to adjust.
B00GDM2SRC|1|The part was installed but lasted a week.
B001TFE38A|4|tried it, works good so far. need time to see if it keeps the tarnish from reoccurring. time will tell. will post results in a few months.<br />they need to lower the price to $29.99
B000CRAZBU|1|Ordered for a 2003 Dodge neon and it didn't fit.  Went to the local auto parts store and asked for a mount for a 2003 dodge neon, then one they had fit perfect.
B00KTI06AM|1|I was initially very happy with my purchase even though I could tell the plastic housing was not as sturdy as the factory keys.  However, in less than 2 months, I now have a dead key that in no longer recognized by the ignition systems and according to the dealer (additional cost) it is not the programming.  This left my wife stranded.  No worries I thought, I gave my wife the spare...this week, my the FOB itself completely fell off my wife's key ring, leaving her with only the cut key.  UG!!<br /><br />Would very much have like to return the items and try again based upon other reviews but I have nothing to return at this point except a cut key that I need to get into the car.  Good thing I have my original factory FOB that still works in the ignition.
B002EE55B4|5|Nice shirt......True to size......Love it.
B004GNAI5Y|5|My wife and i both love it we got it for her but we both use it and works great
B000AP8DZY|5|It is the best car wax on the market
B00J7RB72M|3|great space and design. sleeves for CDs are quite thin.
B00QA0V3YG|5|Looks decent
B004ZLF65Y|4|Fit is fine - a little wrinkly - hopefully will smooth out.
B0063CU5CM|5|This product was easy to install and looks great on my 2013 Tacoma
B000GV90DQ|4|Would buy a socket n drill hole in it, rather than spend 70 on it.<br />Had to uninstall and tape socket pieces together  to get bottom piece out after tightening the compression release
B000W1XX4M|5|The spacer worked great
B002UC18HU|5|Great
B00LI1LK90|5|perfect, just as described. looks great in my Armada
B007R6JI1M|5|great started, no problems bolted right up, and at half the cost of an original HD starter.
B00LXJXE1O|1|Didn't fit my car, a '97 Honda Prelude. This intake was listed as fitting '92-'01 Prelude; the manufacturer's representative admitted that modifications were necessary to fit the '97-'01 model. It should be listed as such.  Sent it back for a refund; at least there was no problem there.
B00H4JKQJU|1|Doesn&#34;t fit the bike.
B000Q753B8|5|Great for the guys lunch
B000BGK080|5|great
B000OUUG9G|4|Nice set, but did not have the short pins I hoped for
B00MJNU5MY|5|Great around town helmet. It is light with excellent peripheral cut out. It is noisy but, for short blasts around town not an issue. My head is more oval then round and it fits like a glove.  Visor works as advertised and vents provide great air flow.  I chose the hi-vis in spite of the chance it would target fixate drunks but, I feel that  I'm more at risk with the majority of folks in cages using their distracting devices while driving.  I need to be seen by them.
B000E7WLJW|5|Very happy with product, built better than I had expected it to be. Easy fold up for easy storage when not using.
B000SL4AA2|1|Used it a few times over a 3 month period and the compressor died.
B000JZZ8YE|5|Like it
B009AOIGPI|5|Installed it in my ka24e hardbody,works better than expected,almost seems like I'm running a wideband. Pretty close to accurate,spark plugs prove it. If yours ain't working right,you either hooked it up wrong,you have a factory wideband and don't know it,or your o2 is no good. Sometimes you just get a lemon!
B0019I9SV4|4|Right part.
B00CPVBH0E|5|This part was the right part and am happy with it.  Thank you
B000BRJURG|5|Worked great.
B007WR66NY|5|Very good product
B00Z7ZXR3K|5|Put it in my 95 del sol: easy install and fit. Works great and I love having cold air blowing during eastern Washington summers. Two months and running well
B00ARAN7ZI|5|The battery had a complete charge when it arrived and the vendor provided prompt delivery.  I chose this battery, as part of a system, to adapt my Dakota driveway alert system to solar power.
B008I7RFZA|5|Great quality, easy to install
B00ZKL9VU4|1|Piece of crap locked up after 15 min
B00WTCQCIQ|4|The included screws are too long and there is a crack in one of the lenses. When I contacted the seller, I was told replacements would not be available. There's no hyper flash and no CELs. They're pretty good, but don't fit perfect and have defects.
B000FSZF5M|5|Ok
B0043M6BX6|5|As described, worked great for my Z400<br />customer service is also great.
B000A8JLIY|5|Great product.
B004SEXOFM|4|Works great.  Fast arrival.
B00KTNR43O|5|very big! super pretty. Can't wait to put it on my car someday.
B00CEXKAK6|5|very happy with product and so easy to install with never a problem
B000BLJHUM|1|Did not fit my CJ5 as advertized
B000VTZ17M|2|The cover fit okay, but it was not chrome (as described), just polished bare aluminum.  The product stated all gaskets and seals are included but only came with the front crank seal, which leaks.
B00W4COLUC|1|Didn't fit at all, not even close
B006B2AB8W|5|Great grip, so far long lasting. I am quite hard on my breaks, on and off road.. these are working great. When dusty they can get a bit squeeky, but still work dusty, wet or muddy!!
B005J6JRMM|5|Fits perfect in a 2013 ford explorer and of a 2014 chevy silverado.
B000637TE6|5|Another great product by Lexol  to use in conjunction with the leather conditioner.
B004K6R4WC|1|this does not fit my 96 Lexus LS400 as verified on Amazon.  The connector is different and the fan itself is smaller than my Denso lexus blower.  The screw holes do lign up, but airflow would be less than Denso blower.
B000C55T18|5|as adv
B009I6ATJO|5|Good
B000EQQYNW|5|It was a factory OEM part and worked perfectly.
B0073MF7QA|5|Very good.done what I needed it to.
B00B1UYSEW|5|great fit
B00ZX1ZTJ8|5|Looks great on my car. What you see in the picture is exactly what you get. Even comes with additional gems if needed to replacement.
B001ABPKUS|5|Fit my 2009 Silverado perfectly!
B002IBQQZC|4|Good and fit as expected
B00AR9SOS4|3|Poorly packaged. Fule tube was bent and distorted due to USPS. The brass nipple is very small, will need to get adaptor for fuel line for the ex500. It's ok. But what do you expect for such a low price China part. I will use it for a temporary peacock until I rebuild the original vac operated one.
B00LVHU0KG|5|Easy to install,  perfect fit,  hubby very,, very happy...looks good.
B009S2ZQNM|5|Excellent quality. Real metal. Don't buy plastic.
B00IRPPZQO|4|works great! looks and build are cheap compared to OEM.
B0002MA056|5|I have installed six of these Hella &#34; fixed '' base map lights in 6 heavy trucks over the past  15 years. They are Very well made, not china junk. If you are mounting for off-road use consider adding large &#34; fender &#34; washers on the backside to spread the load over a larger surface. I open the mounting bores up just a bit so I can use 5 mm socket head ( Allen )  head machine screws.with large washers & nuts........Sheet metal screws with these longer Hella map lights is asking for trouble .....  Make sure to drill your 3 rd hole for the  two 18 gauge wires  larger so you may slide some tube in place to protect the very thin  18 gauge  Hella runs up the goose neck when it passes into your mounting surface. Ships with Red & clear lens, changes with small pick or screw driver .
B006GJLE4A|5|Saved me 20 bucks.
B004HMBK5G|1|I could not get this to work as it is supposed to. It slid and the seat belt still rubbed and irritated my neck because the adjustment wouldn't hold. I would not recommend this item. I bought a seat belt pad and that solved the problem.
B0066QT33C|1|Lasted only 10k miles before it disassembled itself into 2 pieces beginning with a very loud chirping upon startup in the mornings and after work.  2 pieces being the metallic center spacer behind the pulley separating itself from the pulley itself.  If this had anything to do with the noise itself I don't know, but replacing this pulley cured the noise so the pulley is definitely at fault here 6 months / 10k miles later.
B00LX3PPZS|1|We can not get these to fit on our 2007 Odyssey arms.
B00276AAFA|5|Expensive, but look much better than the 38 year old originals.
B000C7XQ5M|5|Great OE replacement
B00W68ALWQ|5|All of it fit, this is the first time I bought seat covers and it came with all the right parts
B003PERH9K|5|looks great on my back window of my car and good quality vinyl
B00515QZ94|5|Does the job it was bought for. Looks good on the bike
B003ECULUU|2|poor design and straps are not ease to tight. the  visor extension isn't stay properly and it is difficult to maintain it in a good positions.
B00H6ETIWY|5|Put these mirrors on a Pioneer 500 and they work perfectly! Look good too!!
B00ATEB6A0|5|These worked great, I would strongly recommend this product.
B00HD9U3DU|5|Excellent replacement mirror, its identical to the Honda OEM side mirror, excellent quality and build. I'm very happy with the purchase and able to save quite a bit money. It's textured, probably meant not for paining on it, but is identical to black plastic on OEM Honda side mirror it replaced. The surface is sort of semi glossy. Again, excellent product and seller..
B00ZOT9NNW|5|works just like the videos you see of the really expensive foam cannons!
B00BCOON42|1|These broke within 2 months of installation.
B000COS8LW|5|Perfect. Don't really know what happened with the first order because I got the right box but a lot of parts that weren't right. Amazon made it right in just a few days. They paid for S&H and had me the right part in just a few days.<br />We installed this on my son's 302 engine in his 68 Cougar because we had just upgraded the radiator and the pipes were different than original. On the bright side, this pump looks a lot better than the original and for the price, it was another good upgrade to his engine. On the bad side, front main seal started leaking so we get to pull it all back apart this week end to get behind the timing cover...
B00M9IJJKI|5|Love it !
B0002X7T5Y|5|good
B00466V9AY|5|Great product.  Took a couple of trys to sync but it was easy and has good range.
B000IG20RW|4|good price and product.
B00062YUY4|5|Purchased for 1986 Ford Ranger 2.9 V6  I had a standard replacement coil installed for the last year.  Was experiencing an uneven idle and mediocre acceleration. I installed the coil and a new connector. The idle smoothed out, the acceleration improved noticeably.  I have always used Motorcraft Platinum Plugs.  A year ago I installed new cap, wires, etc.  I know the coil was well worth the money spent. Technology has improved in the years since the engine was first designed.  It was an easy installation. Taking less than 5 minutes. Use a 5.5 mm socket, same size as the ignition module on the side of the distributor, to remove and install the coil.  I also, spliced and soldiered in a new connector.  Also from Amazon.
B000CJ2URA|1|I had non overheating 2001 Disco 2 I maintained religiously for past 10 years which I don't hesitate to drive 600 mile long trip (one way) and back in a single day before this thermostat.  In fact just drove my rover from MA to NC and then back in 2 days about a months ago.  Due to the age of the vehicle, decided to swap out the working thermostat and got this as a replacement.  I had used many aftermarket parts for many cars for the past 20 years of doing my own wrenching.  Boy was I wrong for choosing this part for the rover.  I may have received defective part but this is the part that needs to work 100 percent of time every time but the one I had didn't.  Let's be honest, when was the last time you bought an extra identical replacement part just in case what you picked up wouldn't work.<br /><br />This thermostat overheated my rover multiple times.<br /><br />When the engine is cool, I would drive about 10 minutes then the engine will overheat into 130 degrees Celsius into the red.  I would turn the engine off for 5 minutes then turn the engine on, it will go from 130 degrees to 94 degrees in 1 minute without driving.  The system is burped multiple times and at one point I thought it was the aging radiator so I replaced the radiator as well.  The actual culprit was that the thermostat was not opening fast or quickly enough to cool the engine down at the right temperature.<br /><br />The genuine LR replacement is only 20 dollars more retail from the dealership which has better track record than this.  Not much saving at all with a risk of seizing up the already tired and difficult to maintain engine.  This thermostat I got does not open at 180 but more like 260. I would NOT buy this nor recommend anyone to get it.  I am now worried for the dear life because I know my rover has seen the &#34;red&#34; overheating light twice in past 3 days of writing this review.  I am certain it has shortened the life of my headgasket unless it already has damaged it.<br /><br />Bad call on my part for choosing this brand.  Motorad, Britpart, they all comes from the same factory FYI.<br /><br />In case you are wondering, LR factory replacement thermostat fixed my overheating problem as soon as I replaced this Motorad and the temps stays around 96 degrees C.ad call on my part for choosing this brand.

B0076HSVFQ|3|Proper fit, decent construction, great price.<br />As an experienced mechanic, I machine all new brake rotors before installing them. These were severely warped out of the box. If not machined, they would have caused a severe brake vibration.
B00NIK98O8|3|The calibration listed is NOT even close to accurate.  Everything else appears good.  The correct calibration is 0.5V at 0 psi and 4.5V at 150 psi.  It works correctly now.
B001G8AIMU|4|Exactly what I wanted and needed for my trail cam battery
B004APM12G|5|After several months of use and many tread depth/tire pressure measurements, this device has worked flawlessly.<br /><br />My only (minor) complaint is that the auto-shutoff is pretty fast and it is difficult to perform multiple measurements before shutoff occurs.
B00G9W9WTS|5|Used on trip to Big Sur. Worked very well
B00XBM4J9M|1|Yeah - the product might be fine, but the fact that the reviews are all straight out of their Marketing consultant's office means I'm not buying.
B00BTGSIA8|5|I received these towels and although they look great in the packaging, I was upset to see that they shed horribly (little green pills were all over the place)!! My mom is going to wash them to see if that helps and I can hopefully upgrade my review to 5 stars after I actually use based on their performance<br />(9/3/15) update, towels were washed and don't shed anymore so here's a good tip that should have been mentioned. WASH THE TOWELS BEFORE USAGE.
B0094A6UUQ|1|Sent me 2 passenger side they do look really good but wish I received both correct
B008A5Y0HG|5|matched perfect worked perfect
B00FJW600I|5|So far so good. Installed on my '02 Ford Ranger edge and it fit perfectly. Truck feels much better and should last quite a while with this durable part doing it's job.
B00LX28WAO|4|Work very good
B00Z5QQZXU|5|Quick shipping. Seems like they are made well. I use them in my pop up camper. Not as bright as I thought they would have been but still a really nice light. Great price too. 5 of these at the rv/camper store cost 5 times more.
B00PHTXWQS|5|Very Bright - works in my 05 Cadillac XLR Front turn Signal Don't forget the Resistor to keep them from Hyper flashing.
B002ZXHGWK|5|Absolutely love this product! It gave me the look I wanted at a great price and it was an easy install!
B007MM9HNU|4|Pros: do the job easy, maintain battery and charge it.<br /><br />cons: if the battery its below certain charge, it will not charge it at all.<br /><br />my solution a pair of auxiliary cables and connect in series with another functional battery.<br /><br />I have 6 motorcycles and work.
B000SL4AA2|1|I bought this just 5 weeks ago.  It worked to blow up a bicycle tire 2 weeks ago. Today I was blowing up an inflatable pool and it stopped working and has not restart despite several attempts.  It got really hot and started smoking.  These are the only two uses of this compressor.  I guess you get what you pay for sometimes... I recommend supervising the compressor, given mine started smoking and got really hot after just 5-7 minutes of usage.
B007HRND44|4|Perfect fit.
B0007M30BW|5|Heavy duty hitch - quality expected from CURT.  I use CURT for all my trailer accessory needs.  Nice welds and great paint job.  I do not know why Amazon shipped this item in a huge box when it could have shipped in 1/10th the size.  And they threw in some paper products from a separate order - so the mount was flopping around and smashing the paper goods by the time it arrived.  Most of the time shipping from Amazon is perfect - but then there is the rogue case.
B007QV0R7W|5|I saved a bunch of money by buying this handy device. I found my electrical problems in a hurry and fixed them myself. I especially like the wire probe and extra long cords.
B007LICQ9M|5|This is great! It's not too dark where you would get pulled over, also it's dark enough where you can definitely notice it's there. It's very sturdy and it won't break! I have it formed to the front curve of my bumper.<br /><br />This will Not act as a camera blocker, it's just for looks and protection of your plate.<br /><br />This is the best picture I could take without showing my whole plate or blacking it out which would defeat the purpose of a picture.
B000VKT0AK|5|Perfect fit. 100% satisfied.
B002E5DSVW|5|Excellent items
B00JIEX722|5|Super bright light for tags. Replaced another no name led I got in a pre made car led pack that started flickering a couple months after I got it.<br />These are both brighter and have already surpassed the length of time before the others burnt out.
B000CGV7UO|5|I have gone through several pads for my 2001 Land Rover Discovery including the factory, the Green pads, and some of those house brand from Advance Auto.  I was very skeptical of this brand but I finally found a set of pads that I can settle with for my Rover.  I am not easy to please and pretty harsh with ratings.  This set works great and I was able to feel the immediate change in stopping power.  I was replacing the new pads (600 miles on it) that I got from Advance Auto. It dusts much less than the Green pads yet stops about equal and cheaper.
B000EVYGZA|5|AAA+++ just as ordered!
B005LGURG0|4|Exact fit and color, no problems except in getting the product. First package lost in shipping, received replacement promptly.
B000XSGL2K|1|Did not fit and was extremely loose
B007HRNDJ4|4|Prefect
B004GCHNZI|5|LOOKS MUCH BETTER
B003WM8VYA|5|Go Tigers! Simple but looks great!
B00JDPXMWQ|5|Good price; love the hex nut for ease of changing.
B00FJJAHXW|5|Very reasonable price for OEM-quality belt.  Perfect replacements went on without a hitch.  I will order more to have on hand for next belt change.
B00BTLEJXI|5|I just got these for my Honda Civic and they look fantastic with the red color of my car. It really makes the car stand out when looking at it in a group. The seats are that bad, comfy but I see them more as a cover than an actual cushion, so if you want a padded cover, this is not for you. Besides that, this is a great by, and the installation isn't that hard once you see the installation videos!
B0000AXNJS|5|Im not into polished metals but Wow this is awesome If I run out I will buy more. Its funny because I was looking for things to polish around the house.
B000RXNLK6|5|Great product
B0023VIFQ0|5|Awesome purchase
B00171VT8I|5|Best product I have ever bought.
B002N1J5IM|5|Replaced the stock fan-in-name-only with the  Heng 90043-CR Vortex Exhaust Vent Kit, and love it.  The Vortex actually moves air, and is much quieter than the wimpy stock fan it replaced. Now our RV's bathroom isn't a moisture filled room when one of us takes a shower.  Plus, the Vortex has the added bonus of being a whole-RV fan to pull fresh air through therig when we need to clear out aromas from a fragrant meal or overdone microwave popcorn :)  Sure it is basically a fan, but the case design makes this a darn good one.  A super addition (replacement) for the bathroom exhaust vent.  This is an example where keeping it simple is best, and that applies to installation: a Phillips screwdriver is all I needed to swap out the old screen and fan for this kit.
B006E0Q7FC|5|Product is as advertised
B00L3NM3R6|4|Very good hids and the warranty and customer service the best
B005U30NTU|5|Easy to install after watching YouTube video
B0057FK08A|5|It's a cabin filter. Put it in fit as expected and is a good product. Thanks
B004CLK3WS|5|Nice product, quick shipping, easy to install..Happy...
B00CP6L8WQ|5|Perfect fit
B001UOKWMG|5|Protects very well leaving a great looking finish that doesn't fade or wear quickly. A little goes a long way. I'd recommend it.
B007Y4XREQ|5|Great fit and quality.  Would buy again
B00BC1G2M6|4|worked great but does not come with shaft boot if needing that piece also
B00KTI0C56|5|The original ones were tattered and torn. These replacements were perfect. Thank you!
B00S1KH964|5|Great product. Fit perfectly fast shipping
B007LQHJ4Q|1|Starter gear is made of plastic and lasted about five minutes.  No where did it say that!  Wasted time and money on a part that's suppose to match the John Deere  HP riding mower.  Very dissatisfied.<br /><br />If I had the option on the start rating it would be a minus five  (-5 starts)
B00FQ1VBHO|4|It looks good quality but does not fit a Chevy 2500hd with a 6.0/4l80e/np261hd.<br />I believe this one is for the duramax with the 261xhd
B006X8BR8C|5|Good
B00U1U65HQ|5|This is a good size, and good quality
B00QMWQK2M|4|Looks as it should. One problem is that i find myself readjusting the driver's side while I'm driving
B00TEG37Y2|5|They are what I ordered.  Be careful upon application, there is no support from the lower part and upper part of the decal besides the little part of the mid &#34;s&#34;.  Other than that they were perfect.
B00I81OY2I|5|I love it. It's so cute. ❤️❤️❤️
B000C4AR0M|5|did everything  it should,worked fine so far.
B00U5GQEN6|5|Great fit, when messaged them, tgey said it would fit my specific car and it did, they even send an extra part for each of them
B00BYH6C1E|4|Great product -  no more lost coins or anything else that can disappear down between the seats.
B001AI3KSU|5|Awesome product popped right on my 2005vtx 1300 no problem amd looks fantastic i do wish they sold them individually bacause i only needed one side but other than that it was perfect
B001NGB57M|4|Does not react with petrochemical fuels. Covers well, however it is best to clean out the fuel tank first with a degreaser and then use a rust removal product such as Naval Jelly, rather than just covering  over the rust and tank residue with this product. Takes several days to cure or dry.. Time will tell how well and for how long it seals.
B00514CAJE|5|Easy to install on the frame of my Honda NC700XD. Gives me s great alternate foot position on long rides. Would highly recommend.
B00C5TJ4QA|5|Very good just what it is supposed to be
B0089M9T6W|4|I installed these pushrods in my Ford 351W boat motor in July and so far the engine is still running. These are stock pushrods so they will be just as good as the original. Engine had a seized valve and the pivot ball snapped off and pushed itself into the rod. Pretty good that the ball end didn't fall down the oil galley... This is the part that you do want to snap if you ever run into a seized valve like me, or it will probably do more damage.<br />I recommend these rods if you want to keep it stock. Be sure to measure the overall length of the original you are replacing.
B004EDCR0U|5|Goood replacements
B001HX9WVM|5|great
B0042HTS6O|5|This was exactly what I needed to fix my side mirror,  dealer told me I would have to replace my entire side mirror with housing and have it painted to color match my truck a cost of more than $600.
B002H8FYTU|5|The decal arrived quickly and was very easy to apply to the window. It looks awesome in the middle of my rear window.
B011AOBCPG|3|Cover works great however the zippers have broken already in the first month of use.
B000EQ8Y30|5|Good replacement and simple to install.  Would buy again.  Was 75% cheaper than buying from dealer.
B008T4YOSS|5|great helmet!
B00CDD9EC2|5|Thanks for the quick delivery, great price and fine product.  I love the assortment.
B008VIBTT4|4|Over priced, but they are my fave
B0049DRJCQ|5|love it perfection
B00GU31172|2|The decal arrived quickly and was easy to apply. However,  after only about 2 months,  it is already cracking and peeling.  I hate that, because it is an incredible Star Wars decal.
B005UQQ74C|5|Cut it to fit 2011 Prius. I did leave it outside in the sun on the deck for a day before cutting/installing because the rubber smell was initially strong.  A couple of days after installing wasn't noticeable.  Very durable and looks like factory issue!
B00SXZDKTW|5|Works great.
B00U6QY3TC|5|Very good price and good pullers
B00NN444CA|5|Looks nice on my 88 silverado
B001GRTE08|2|They fit good and all but the gray mats look so worn after just a few months. They are tough to clean even with only minor use.
B000EDUUJ4|4|now we can take more grandkids bikes<br />wooowhoooo.......maybe<br />LOL
B00AQFE7I0|1|I thought that they were going to be screw ins but when they came in, they just had a pin to put in on each side. Easy to steal.
B0007D20R6|4|MATCH MY 71 SUPERBEETLE
B007TYF72G|5|Fast shipping  Fit perfectly. Wish it had come with the two mounting bolts.
B0001EVXEW|5|Have these shades on all my vehicles, so much so, that I didn't realize how much I missed them on the Mustang. I wasn't as careful as I should have been attaching them to the car, so the driver side ever so slightly touches the window whenever I close the door. My mistake. The clearance is VERY tight because of the design of the car. But they work great, and look good. I thought they might look bad on this design of car (there is no door jamb attached to the door) because the shade stays attached to the upper roof jamb. But, they blend right in to the window area, and look great. They also have a lifetime warranty. On 2 other vehicles I own, they have replaced the shades after many years, due to breakage , free of charge. Good company, and a nice product.
B005KOZ25Y|5|Excellent
B0036G97DG|5|Gnarly!
B001GJ3FIS|5|THIS 8 WAY NOZZLE IS IDEAL FOR LIGHT WORK AND EXACTLY WHAT I NEED FOR MY POTTED PLANTS. IT DOES A GOOD JOB OF WATERING AND IS HEAVY ENOUGH TO CLEAN BUT NOT KNOCK THE PLANTS OVER. I DON'T THINK IT IS HEAVY DUTY AND WAS NOT EXPECTING THAT FOR THE PRICE. I LIKE IT VERY MUCH AND HAVE NO NEGATIVE COMMENTS
B00C1GD2T2|4|Overpriced like all HD stuff but installs easily with provided screws.  Also there is an extra set of longer screws if you have windshield mounted bags
B00W8YA7IG|5|Great piece
B006T232QW|4|I have not complaints about the quality or appearance of these tiedowns, but I question whether they are priced right.  Home Depot sells what appear to be identical D-rings in a four-pack for $5, making these about 3X the price per D-ring.  However, the Home Depot D-rings claim a much lower weight rating.  Despite looking identical, if these D-rings are indeed 5X as strong as the Home Depot D-rings, then I would say these are worth the extra money.  If they're actually the same, then obviously the Home Depot D-rings are a way better deal.  In any event, these D-rings have worked well for me.  I use them to anchor a 1500# ATV side-by-side inside an enclosed trailer, which I have taken on everything from interstates to rocky trails without the machine shifting out of position. In that regard, I am very pleased with their performance.
B00EA0ZB7I|5|I got them quickly, wired them up, and they've been shining bright ever since.
B000C55LLQ|4|This price is only for one shock. When I ordered the rear they came as a pair. Had to reorder.
B00JZRP6VC|5|Looks great on my truck. The finish seems to be holding up well, time will tell.
B001B0VCBE|4|Good product
B00C7S9K8Q|5|Great light
B00GR2W6CU|5|love it
B0099RKG1S|5|It seems to work well so far. Haven't had the opportunity to try it on anything other than GM vehicles.
B00BYH6C1E|5|I saw it in my Aunt's car and I wanted one! It's great.
B008L17JRC|5|Easy install, bright LED lights.
B005JQNPG6|5|very easy to install, have not taken a trip
B0039HD4RM|5|I have have bright blue 2015 and the black door handle recesses really look great by adding a little more black contrast.  Went on easy.  Only about one moth in hopefully they look good in the long run.
B0035RZ280|5|Now I can clear the nuisance codes before the State inspection.
B0049CSZKC|2|Did not fit as advertised.  Does not fit 1963 Buick Skylark rear axle outer bearing..
B001F0LW0Q|5|Great price!
B00FCE4Y8S|4|Overall great decal. Only issue is the sticker was white lettering, but I expected It to be black lettering like the photo.
B000C5DUN2|4|Parts showed up on time and in perfect condition. Installation fixed my issue of not being able to set the cruise control. Totally satisfied.
B000C2SAR6|5|great value and prompt delivery
B00JTACH4Y|5|Great item. works well. Sizing was a bit off, but I cannot remember if that was my error or misinformation from the seller. This item was larger than the OEM halogen festoons. Did not take much convincing to make them fit though. Giving five stars despite this because it's a great product.
B002OMUG3S|5|Great price. Quick delivery.
B00VR700QY|5|Great black matte frame for the price.<br />I was looking for something with 4 screw holes, and this had it. Also it has a clip on the flip to hold in your license plate instead of just laying over it.<br /><br />I was able to layer a plastic frame over my original license plate and it looks great on my Accord.<br /><br />Great item!
B000L9P63Q|5|these are the best pads
B00X4AXGCC|5|thanks
B00CNUUU5A|5|Exactly what I needed to make my tractor more useful for some heavy yard work. Was able to pull 10 foot trailer to the back 40 to clear a fallen tree and convert it to firewood. Great price too.
B00199IE0O|5|Fits perfect can't go wrong with this.
B0050SFVO2|5|It's works very good
B000C59XKG|5|These bushings were so easy to install, and what a differance the ride is like new.So quite cant belive the inprovment thank you Amazon,and all the feedback from all you people out there ,save a jeep ride a cowgirl.
B00J5KRUHM|3|This is the right size to put on the floor of the back seat in front of your child's car seat. It also holds a lot of what kids throw around in cars. The lid can be left closed, in a position to lift it from the front seat, so that things that don't belong in the trash don't go there. But it should be easy to put a disposable liner into the container. Yes, this basket has a built-in plastic liner. But you can't remove the liner to empty the basket. And whatever icky stuff goes into the basket stays in the liner, and you have to take it inside to wash it. And it's not easy to wash, plus it takes a while to dry. So you get to choose between a smelly trash basket and a messy cleaning job. I use a plastic shopping bag to line it, but it doesn't fit well. If I am the one putting the trash into the basket, I always get it into the bag. Other passengers, not so much.
B00JPOFYDK|5|Works like a charm.
B006IIN0U0|2|These turned a goldish color after only afew months. I actually kind of like the look but be warned. I'd prefer them staying black.
B003S8IHVK|1|Did not work after being set
B003MAG004|5|35 years in the automotive aftermarket, and I'm no fool.<br />I have an 05' Tahoe 5.3L with Chevy lifter tick that is the worst I have ever heard.<br />I pulled the valve covers, cleaned the pushrods, and lifters.<br />Replace a few rockers thinking that was the problem.<br />I tried flushing multiple times because I refuse to pull these heads with close to 200,000 miles.<br />Sometimes it CLACK's Hot sometime Cold, but always CLACKS..<br />I Tried, Seafoam, Rislone, Marvel mystery oil...<br />After reading a service bulletin from GM, I purchased GM Enos, with 12,000ppm zinc and<br />it helped after a few days..  but the fact that it helped little gave me hope.<br />I tried the Crane Cams assembly lube because it supposedly has more zinc that the others<br />but that didn't help at all..  Eventually, I timed it right, and got my ZDDP when I was ready to change the oil.<br /><br />At first, it sounded the same..  CLACK CLACK CLACK..  after a few days, (about 450 miles) it<br />was only CLACKING after about 30 minutes of driving...<br />About 10 days in..  SILENCE!  I swear  SILENCE.<br />150+ miles a day 4 to 4.5 hours in LA traffic daily.<br />I drove it from LA to Seattle this summer..  SILENCE.<br />I will even drive it to SEMA again this year..<br /><br />The engineer I work with asked me when I fixed the truck, I laughed and told him the truth.<br />I am due for another oil change, and my new bottle showed up yesterday!<br />I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this product..  its a winner
B001DF9PSY|5|Installed in 2013 CTS 3.6.  Computer says I am getting 0.7 better mpg in the city,  Getting 1.2 mpg better actual on the highway.  I am happy.
B00HRSOMRK|1|The part didn't even work on my car. Waiting on replacement...hope the next one works.
B000C9SP4W|5|its a radiator cap, its metal, it works great, what else can I say, oh, it doesn't malfunction like a generic parts store one perhaps?  Worth the wait....
B0031GTXQW|5|This locking gas cap works just as advertised. It fit my 2012 Dodge Ram Laramie Longhorn and the lock and key work great. I am very pleased with this purchase. 5 stars.
B0037N40EY|5|does what it's supposed to do. And fits great.
B00OAJ5V4C|5|Great product
B000F15914|3|Hook and loop fasteners were missing.
B0002JMIEK|5|I believe this is the best auto-polish on the market.
B00FRM8LPC|5|Works perfectly in a 2006 Jaguar XJ Vanden Plas
B00B4AOK3S|4|Well , though i read some comment thats its nit good but for me it was really good<br />I like it<br />It make my car look really special
B00HJ15AFS|4|I LOVE dogs. Love, love, love them! I've been looking for a license plate frame for my new car and I fell in love with this one!<br /><br />The reason why I gave it four stars instead of one is because it looked like a butterfly after I put it on. Everyone thought my frame was a very blinged out butterfly. Oh, and if you like sparkles and shiny stuff, this is it! I'm not very girly so the rhinestone was a little too much for me but it was mostly because it looked moreover like a butterfly than a bone.<br /><br />The good thing about it is that it doesn't cover up the state name (Georgia) or the county that I'm in. Kudos for that!
B009F10RVC|5|This product is very nice and the service too.
B003CKJDW6|1|I don't if it is my battery, but I doubt it. It doesn't hold charge. This suppose to be an acid, but something is wrong.
B001QVFD4K|5|I own many of the Adam's products and they are all amazing, but I think the Detail Spray is my favorite.<br /><br />The last couple of times I washed my car, I noticed the water really beading up.  I haven't waxed in many months, so it HAS to be the Detail Spray.<br /><br />Whether I do a heavy duty wash or simply a quick rinse and spot wash, the detail spray is the icing on the cake.  Smells like cotton candy and makes your finish SO SLICK and shiny.<br /><br />You can easily go thru the 16 oz bottle after just a couple washes.  I recommend trying the 16 oz and if you like it, go for the big Gallon Refill.<br /><br />I feel like such a guy, fawning over a car care product, but I really love this spray!!
B0014FGSA6|5|Looks like good quality, great welds, well packaged with hardware.  Purchased for a 2007 Tundra.  It would be best to cut out a hole in the skid plate for access to the oil filter or relocate the oil filter with a relocation kit otherwise the skid plate and Hitch need to be removed for an oil change.  The bolts are really not made to be taken on and off so the filter relocation or hole solves that problem.  I bought this for a front bike rack.
B00ATEB6A0|1|Misleading information about compatibility and expensive. A total waste of money.
B000U0Z2L2|5|Wanted this to split my single 12V to charge a car USB hub, my Radar Detector and still have a spare for anything in the future, and it does the job marvelously. Quality and build seem good for the price. I would recommend.
B000KTE04I|1|Advertised to custom fit my 2007 Odyssey.  The holes in deflector did not line up with holes in hood.  I had to pay $ 42.30 to return to company....Not good buisness practice!!!
B002OUMU66|5|sturdy but took a little time to install due to small spacing
B00FH43F3I|5|The helmet was a bit tight for the first 2 rides but now it fits perfectly.  Dont let the initial tightness scare you.  Its great looking and has good ventilation as well.  Much better than my 2004 vintage HJC, although the older model has softer material inside.
B0062UB6NC|5|Thanks
B00HUBZ3QI|4|It is the correct part, got other levers before this one.  However it looks correct for a 2014 Suzuki V-Strom 650
B0045WBVUM|4|Great addition to firm motorcycle seats.
B0052XLBMG|4|Replacement part fit as is should and worked as it should..
B00BG9235E|4|Easy installation and looks great.  There is a gap between the factory wiring harness and the connector.  Water will get in and corrode the connectors causing the ECM to go into hyper flash as if a bulb was out.  I sealed the perimeter in silicone to prevent this and to help hold the connector onto the light.
B0010Z4MDK|5|Great battery at a super low price.  I paid $12 for this battery, last one I bought for our alarm system cost nearly $30.  It's been installed for over a year and has never caused a problem.  Stays charged and is ready for action.  I test the system periodically by unplugging the charger and causing an alert.  This battery works flawlessly every time.  Perfect fit as a replacement, same size, same terminals.  Highly recommended.
B000CSIRYG|5|very good
B00J6DIEIW|5|Good product It works like expected.
B000VBGZEI|5|The unit is exactly what was represented. No need for seal it comes with one.
B000AME50Y|5|I am not purchase here but this pretty good. I am so happy with this.
B0072W5PFO|5|Happy
B00KMD3IB8|1|Took twenty days to arrive, and then it didn't work. I live in a major city so it's not like it went to the middle of no where. Tried to contact the seller multiple times with no response. In the end the product never worked and I still cannot get a response from the seller.
B007HRNDEE|4|Perfect
B007ZHZ7EK|5|Plastic, not hardly durable, I bought it for my Nux (Mad Max) costume.
B00GJ1H31I|5|Worked great and a good price
B002UYTZKK|5|Positive buying expegrience
B00YOOS9VK|4|So far this is quite nice.  I bought it to supply some power in case of a power outage at my cottage.  Also needed a light air compressor for toys, tires, etc.  The compressor really could not handle a large piece of equipment, but otherwise all seems good.
B00RCA2EX2|2|Light should be held on like the OEM lights. Don't care for sticking them on with double sided tape.
B00PKFANFC|4|Nice smooth material. Seem to be made well. Great installation videos.
B0012ETJ1O|3|The light output is outstanding, bright, and with a cool toned hue.  Unfortunately they burn out relatively quick, the longest this particular bulb has lasted has been 9 months. Also, the light performance curtails steeply just before the bulb burns out. Compare overall cost to a regular bulb (which last seemingly forever but do not have as bright or as clear of an output) and the price is ridiculous!  However I, like so many others are willing to sacrifice the life-expectancy for performance of a clearer and brighter light.
B00XCANO4O|5|Such a great company.  Even before delivery, I received a nice e-mail from the co-founder of this company.  Thanking me for my purchase and encouraging my feedback.  This is unheard of in this day.  And I appreciated that they value me as a customer.<br /><br />I did provide feed back.  And also some suggestions to make the product even better.  And I get a return e-mail saying they found my suggestions worthy of a design change.  And they will be implementing those changes in future production runs.  Nothing big mind you, because this is a great product, now.  But some small changes that might make it even better.<br /><br />The features of this Tire-Tek Truck Pro are perfect for my needs.  The 360 degree access, the bleed-off button,  the rubber case, needs no batteries that would fail when you need it most, A nice large dial gauge for easy reading, A very good chuck that seals with no air leakage, etc.  I also like the fact that it states clearly that it meets the ANSI standards, for accuracy.<br /><br />I bought it primarily for use on my 110 PSI RV tires.  But also for my 80 PSI truck tires.  And sick of replacing batteries in my digital gauge that only goes to 99.9 PSI anyway.  Not high enough for my new RV tires.<br /><br />For the price, I don't think you will find a finer tire gauge that is so feature rich, and accurate up to 160 PSI.  And backed up by a great company, with the best possible customer service.<br /><br />You will be delighted with this product.
B004MSJ7C8|5|Works well. Damper valve included. Makes balancing carbs easy. Used this on a Honda Shadow VT750 Shadow ACE, worked well.
B000CI8XQS|5|Works perfectly. Time will tell how it wears/performs. Great product. Great Price.
B00BJCN80M|5|Good for the price.
B00Q44TPDE|4|Fit a little tight so there is a little bit of rattle and it's the only reason it's not a 5 star but it sounds excellent very loud and deep just what I was looking for!
B0002MBR7Q|4|These are installed on my 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee and are sturdy, and very well made. I only provided 4-stars because the instructions were not very clear and I noticed during the roll windows up and down part of the install the deflectors would hit the window. Sometimes stopping the window from going up all the way. With further research this is normal and you just push the deflector out to let the window close. The rears came with double sided sticky tape, so they will adhere to the window channel, and hopefully not be a problem with preventing the windows to close all the way. Other than that install was a cinch. I do wish they made these available in the darker smoke, though.
B001Q4OXHU|1|Does not function as a receiver hitch, i wouldn't recommend it at all.
B004W0QJ68|5|Works well. Would buy again
B00NGOR0VE|5|Excelen
B00DTXOB5A|5|Looks and works great
B00DNKPQ62|5|Good product for the price.
B007PIZ8SY|3|This antenna was very low profile, which is the main purpose for my purchasing it. It was very simple to install, you simply screw it in. It looks good, but it isn't anywhere near as effective as the antenna that came on our van. As long as I'm in a wide open area, the signal is great. After driving to another part of town that has more trees, the signal cut out repeatedly. I'm not talking a forest here, just a neighborhood with many mature trees. I accidentally discarded the packaging, which is the only reason I still have it.
B00E6M2BN2|5|Fit as it should,  Fairly easy to get old out and new in.  Took maybe 5 minutes.
B00K24JG90|5|Great helmet at a great price, my daughter loves it!
B005IXPZHW|5|great
B0044GB6MM|1|This product has been installed less than a month and is already torn up. My husband opened up the product to find the problem (see pic). Maybe he can salvage it...
B00OC8TXFO|3|Got here in a timely fashion & it looks so good on my car:)
B008MISBP8|5|great oil
B00S8JQNR4|5|I love the intercooler very much. its a good size, very durable and good looking. I really love this item
B000AM8C62|5|I have been using this product for about 15 years now in many vehicles and small engines that I have owned.  I can say that there is slight increase in gas mileage when you first add it, but I think the real value of this product is reduction of wear on critical surfaces in the engine on cold start ups.  The testimony to this is that I have never had to add any oil between oil changes on any of the vehicles that I have used this product in, regardless of the number of miles on the vehicle.
B001HKZHIW|5|Drains black water tank quickly and thoroughly.  Propels the waste through a 5/8&#34; 100' hose with no problem.  Only problem with the unit is the short DC cord, which will not reach he battery compartment when the drain is on the opposite side of the trailer.
B007JSGR9Y|5|Easy to use and works like a charm. Code resets are easy.
B00B9LM64M|1|Not even close to fitting!!!! Not happy for the money paid.
B003HBUU90|3|Have not put on<br />But not sure of 3m tape on paint
B00HVHGQ6M|5|My remote kept falling apart and I would often have to look for the pieces all over the place. I have had this product for about 3 months now and it has held up perfectly! I no longer have to worry about the remote opening and falling apart. It is just what I needed. I would recommend this product to anyone that is looking to protect or keep their remote together.
B00E5OUOCQ|5|Great shade. Easy to fold and use.
B004X5QMY6|5|excellant
B001C63ZZ8|5|Perfect fit for E90 (2006 325i).
B004FG5LT0|4|Takes a lot of fussing and experimentation to get them to go on properly but once on, it really give a completed look to the interior. Very pleased with my purchase.
B00JFQLGQW|4|Handy tow rope.
B004IM4MK0|5|An exact replacement . Arrived in three days!
B000NGIPP8|5|AAA+++ just as ordered!
B0082LFAI6|4|Repaired rust spots and some places where it had rusted thru on a 94 toyota truck.  Worked like a charm, easy to mix and apply and looks good when dry!
B003WOZOUM|5|Worked great because we dont have a top rack. We pulled the straps through the car and it was fine. You have to get the padding so it doesn't slide. A bit noisy but that's to be expected. We fit quite a bit of stuff in there too.
B0050DBKWO|4|Not as nice as Harley Davidson,but half the price and the attachment strips are A-1 quality.I do like the accessory mirror.
B002OQ8PV4|4|I'm fairly happy with this light. Somebody vandalized the original taillight on my beloved 1971 Honda Passport C70. If you've ever owned a bike of this vintage, you know that getting parts in a hurry can be a real nightmare, particularly since they use 6v electrical systems instead of 12v.<br /><br />I ordered this with same-day shipping and was able to adapt this light to fit the original 6-volt bulb, instead of the 12-volt one the light comes with. All the wiring clipped in normally, except for the Ground wire which had to be bolted down to the frame like the old one was. The bolt pattern in back didn't match up but I was able to bolt it down at an angle on the sides of the light mount using the included nuts and washers.<br /><br />So - all in all it's a good temporary fix while I wait on my OEM replacement.<br /><br />That said - I'm not sure I'd use this as a daily. As others here have mentioned, it's definitely not waterproof, and I do not see any DOT compliant mark in the molding. The backplate is not nearly as reflective as my OEM light and as a result it does not look as bright, reducing my visibility. The quality of the construction is not too bad, so perhaps these things could be adapted if you really wanted to use this as a permanent light (Some have suggested using silicone to increase the water resistance - this might work).<br /><br />Also - this may have been my fault, but it's important to note - when you take the backplate off to change the bulb, note that the whole light is actually tapered at one end - so the lense only fits onto the backplate one way. The screws at either end look the same, but upon close inspection, they're actually two different lengths. Make sure to keep track of these and put them back in the right places - I did not and so I managed to strip out a couple of the holes. I'm not taking off for this because it's due to my own stupidity.<br /><br />All in all I'm pretty happy with this since it got me out of a pinch, but if I had to pick a light for permanent use, I'd probably look elsewhere.d to pick a light for permanent use, I'd probably look elsewhere.
B00BHJBQX8|5|Perfect pairing with my original 5 injectors. delivery was before anticipated day.
B00UBIMB1C|5|We used to use the Mr. Clean but they don't make it anymore. We have tried product after product that doesn't leave water spots on my black sports car. We have now found the perfect car wash with Barrett-Jackson!
B002OUIXU8|5|Great quality. Can be used with other brand attachments. Served it's purpose!
B005DJFXY6|3|I haven't worn these yet in the rain, so I can't speak to their durability or water proof abilities, I have tried them on though and can speak about their fit. I ride wearing 8&#34; side zip military boots. They do go up the ankle and are what I would assume to be no more bulky around the ankle than any other type of riding boot. I also typically ride with jeans on. So with that setup, when I put the rain pants on, and then put these boots on, I can hardly get the top button to fasten. The elastic is at it's absolute limit, and it just makes it. Also, as you zip the boot up, the last 3&#34; or so of zipper is under stress because the circumference of the boot, is in my opinion, not big enough to accommodate riding boots, rain gear and jeans.
B000WJX4BQ|5|Excellent battery -- good price -- great service.  Thank you.
B00Q9PZBBI|4|Crime would have been better, now have to wait for a while to get cromes  at cheap price😊
B00HZCFKZG|5|good sign
B00K9TD0CW|5|😄
B00UHOTS5W|1|Product was supposed to be cut for specific application, but was to small. Even after applied and spread out did not stretch to fit tail light.  I would have thought they would give you a little extra to trim.  I have had past experience with tint so I knew what I was doing. Save yourself some money and pass on this product
B003554TB8|4|Did the job...left it out in a storm overnight, and there was some slight dampness by the zipper. But overall it was good value.
B007V1S0OO|4|working 4 me just fine
B004GD0R9Q|5|Matched up exactly.
B00L3LEEYS|5|Worked great!
B00DTEFSWY|5|Used this on a small block chevy I am building. The seasoned block I got had some jacked up threads this tool saved me so much time and $$$. Worth every penny I am recommending this to my friends who work on older motors.
B00CBYRKCY|5|great product
B00FW1JP9O|5|These light up the interior cabin very nice. Same as the exterior ones.
B00VWKYPVC|5|Perfect match. Great price and quick service
B006NZTZLQ|5|The app is not the best, but the tool works great, i have it plugged in all the time
B00EKNMBLO|4|Looks great, have to trim a little plastic off door assembly to make it sit right.
B004ES592S|3|The big mounting hole for the light was a bit small to get the light in it.  I had to ream out the hole to mount the light fixture.
B00OPDNRA8|5|Perfect fit. Just perfect
B00AZXBDUS|5|Perfect match. Blades a little less solid than original, but they fit and work.
B001UMZ07A|5|Very good product
B009YRI64C|5|These were fantastic!
B00S8KQCYW|5|I was well pleased with the item I ordered and received two days earlier than scheduled.
B003BZX4I6|5|Weld in for adding an 02 sensor for FiTech system.
B00S483IL8|5|Good stuff
B0040CU1XK|5|Worked great!
B000JFHNEC|3|Not the best quality but they work.
B000C9QEXG|5|As described
B008F8Q8WS|5|Love them
B001Q4XIHG|5|Work great! Was surprised to see they didn't shake around while off roading over rough terrain
B00BSZ6PVY|5|good i like
B00IDW4404|5|Solid. Well made glove
B000CIJ308|4|Works well but the application process can be messy. Make sure you are using an applicator pad or towel.
B000KC41FS|5|good to go
B0007RDVHA|1|CAME LEAKING ALOVER NEED REPLACEMENTS.
B000C2SJ9A|5|I prefer Gates belts.  I have used them for many years.  I like to replace fan belts on my vehicles about every 2 years.  I've never had a problem with Gates belts.
B004J0SNVK|5|Awesome product at a great price....simple install, perfect match
B00537FIRU|5|Very good quality for the price.  The installation took less than 45 minutes.<br /><br />Included instructions included a table of all tools necessary since its mixed standard/metric it was nice to know upfront so I didn't have to return to the toolbox constantly.  One negative on them was the pictures were of poor quality so if you couldn't decide from the text what to do the images were of no help.<br /><br />Couple of additional thoughts regarding install specifically<br /><br />1) Lifting or Jacking of the vehicle isn't absolutely necessary; however, I found it easier to have my room to move around underneath so I opted to back the Explorer up onto a pair of ramps.  This allowed ample space to move around as well as additional clearance for dropping down the exhaust<br /><br />2) As mentioned above; this install can be done by a single person but I think you'll save at least 30 minutes on the install if you have someone else there to help hold things steady.  The hitch only weighs around 30 pounds but when working overhead it quickly could become difficult to manage by yourself.<br /><br />3) Watch one of the install videos at the Curt website for how to install this hitch.  It takes less than 5 minutes and clearly walks you through the process.  After understanding how everything connects it is really an easy install.
B004IM28GA|1|the piece does not work I get bad
B002UC4SWM|3|WAY too big for my use.  About the size of a shoebox.
B00M9IFVOQ|5|Well built not cheap plastic i used vernier calipers to set the tool to proper depth but i'm a little overthinking it.
B0010DN0QW|5|love it its perfect
B006BUPW7E|1|They look good, but that's as far as it goes.  This item is listed as a direct OEM fit....  IT IS NOT!!!!  Make sure to get your own schematics, splicers, and hiring an electrical engineer wouldn't hurt.  I have no idea how they work, or how bright they are because they are not worth the RE-WIRING that you need to do in order for them to work.<br />Going to my Dodge Dealer, and have them replace my fog lights.
B0002SPH44|5|Works well for cleaning car windows
B0022ZYZWA|5|Good quality tubes arrived on time
B00K5A9CQI|5|Very satisfied.
B0002UHVAA|5|Really nice product. Rinses the tank better than the onboard black water flush
B002JFQFNA|3|These are not bad for a pair of plastic shades.  I use them as a 'back up' pair in my glove box.  My nose bridge is a little wide, and these do not have the adjustable nose pads, so for me they are a bit uncomfortable and sit a bit too high on my nose.  But for the price, I am OK with them as a good reliable back-up pair of shades.  Because of the wide nose bridge, they will never be my everyday 'go-to' shades, but work fine for times when I drive off without my main pair.
B0000DGAMO|5|Worked great for securing our rolled up memory foam mattress that we took camping. They held up no problem during the 4 hour drive. Would only use for light to medium duty. Will buy again.
B007KPTST2|5|FIT WELL. GREAT FINISH. WORK PERFECT ON MY 2009 DYNA GLIDE CUSTOM WITH FACTORY CABLES AND BRAHE HOSE. REROUTED CLUTCH CABLE IN FRONT OF HANDLEBARS FOR MORE SLACK. BETTER SEATING POSITION WITH MORE BACK RELIEF THAN I EXPECTED. GREAT ALTERATIVE TO TALLER BARS.
B000ARPVOI|5|Use all the time.  Took away engine knocking.
B00G6KGPFM|5|This works great! Just make sure it is miserable HOT when you use it.
B00FBRKV0Q|5|Installed, and my pump is pumping its brains out like it was brand new! Good unit, seems to be well made.
B000AMLWH8|1|This was a big disappointment.  It did not do any of the things I had expected after having used a competitor's product long ago.  Using it seemed like a big waste of time and made no visible difference.
B007OWGA4C|4|You get what you pay for. The lights are sound activated so if you want them to go with the &#34;bass hit&#34; then you might be a little disapointed. also if you install them in your car (which i would imagine you would do) then any other sound will be a factor, such as wind (if your windows are open) or even engine noise like shifting, start up and any other sound it can make. The product is a great product for the price you pay, but if your looking for a more professional look and feel i would recommend a different product.
B000EQN2FA|5|Looks like the the oem part but I haven't changed it out yet.
B00O0DAPTO|1|Worse than my almost 2 year old car wiper blades. It's not safe to drive a car in the rain, the wiper blades don't clean the windshield at all. I threw them out (I couldn't return them) and bought Rain-X.
B004PX8BC2|5|very sturdy and reliable, may need additional anti-seize grease applied if used alot or left out for long periods of time, but that's to be expected in a scissor jack.
B00KTIUNPU|5|Had this only about 2 weeks, but so far it works like an original. Easy to program following the instructions supplied. Nice to be able to choose a color to tell one key-set from another.
B000M61KKG|1|Dont waste your money on these guns, they fall apart and dont work right.
B007RY1B2S|5|Put these in my 1990 FXR, along with 412 rears. The combination worked out beautifully. The bike rides a dream and handles even better than before. First rate stuff.
B00P8FP2BY|4|These are super bright, but have a very directional throw pattern. If you get off-axis, they fall off really fast. As a primary light, they aren't great, but as secondary, they're alright. If you're just looking for something for show, they're totally worth it.
B0002MBKAA|5|Fits perfectly! I used it on both of my Ford cars - Taurus and Windstar.  The diamond grips are comfortable and it was easy to slip it on and off.
B00KTHZISI|5|good
B003VP5D6W|2|Did not fit, would not go over the head rest,the head rest is not removable. I had to cut it to get it over the head rest then sew it together.Does not look good. Not happy, but what can you get for this low price.Wanted to send back but its not worth the hassel for 20 bucks.
B009XA977A|5|There was a big rain storm for four days and the driver's side power window wouldn't roll up. So left the car in parking garage and ordered switch from Amazon on Wednesday. Received the switch on Friday and it snapped right in place in seconds.  Flat blade screwdriver was all I needed. So now, I could drive out into the rain with the driver's side window up and not get soaked.  Works like a charm, at least for now, so probably will order another one for back up purposes, since switches for cars all have circuit boards now, which moisture can foul up at the most inconvenient time. The price for the switch was very reasonable compared to others and way less than original equipment that I would have had to wait two weeks for.
B001KS2QYO|5|I already installed!
B009PN9JXM|5|Worked great, good price, would buy again.  Matched the old one very closely....
B000N4UQL6|4|Enough oomph to jumpstart a V8 SUV dead battery & is easy portable enough to carry.  Just a note of caution, it does NOT come with a charging cord.
B000C11JEI|5|Worked great just like original very pleased.
B000BZIDP8|5|Bosch quality at an unbeatable price.<br /><br />These are 2x from a Mercedes-Benz dealership.
B0052FRYOS|1|My husband ( who has worked on cars his whole life)  spent  A lot of time taking the car apart to put the handle on and it fit perfect but it doesn't work, were very disappointed .....
B0077LQNHY|5|AAA+++ just as ordered!
B002ODLVB8|5|Switched to 3m for finer grade abrasives.  They seem to far outlast the cheaper versions & give a consistent finish.  For me worth the cost in saved time changing out worn out or clogged paper.
B000C541OE|5|Good price. Great product.
B008G2CPZC|4|Meet expectations
B00CS5V17Q|1|will have to take your headlight apart. not worth the trouble.
B001IF2BG2|5|great product, works as expected.
B004MEA456|5|Great quality silicone hose couplers.  Perhaps a little overboard for a standard intake, but the quality and construction of the multiple ply silicone couplers make the price worth it.  I would recommend these to anyone building their own aftermarket systems.
B00DSD74K0|5|:)
B0040HOMVC|5|Exactly what I wanted..great product..great service !
B004K84AVI|5|You must get the front and rear at the same time - Great Struts !
B00K7HEJ62|5|Perfect replacement for my old worn out hinges. These saved the day.
B000SNK7HK|2|Will not fit vehicle with backup camera
B000JFJLG0|5|They sent black covers but they worked just as well. Nice price and quick shipping.
B0010E00T6|5|4 minutes and you save $55.
B00TEH0582|2|Was hoping they were abigger size
B00YFOPJ6W|5|very good battery for the money arrived on time
B010OT6FX2|1|I dont like how it attaches at the bottom of the seat.  I am not able to move my seat forward and backward because of the strap. Makes it annoying
B00LHFOT3Q|2|not so useful as I thought, it is an article really expensive that does not function
B00873J0YY|4|Holds the kayaks just like what we needed
B003PHY2YU|5|Outstanding product.  Obviously specifically designed for the Honda Insight.  The installation video was very helpful.
B001DRNNEO|5|Mann- Cabin Air Filter. Fit perfectly and was much less than the stealership wanted to charge for replacement. Did not require much skill to replace.
B00IMUC9YA|5|Love the material, got here in a timely fashion and looks awesome in my car!:)
B002X6VXL4|1|Compressor crapped out after using it a total of probably 10 times. Airing up a tire and it wasn't even at 32 PSI when something snapped. Compressor motor still runs but no air... I like the power part of this unit but the compressor is just as important to me. When it doesn't work at all it deserves NO stars. Update: emailed Amazon and got a same day reply. Keep the unit, we will reimburse your account but you need to order another one. IOW, we'll give you a new one at no cost to you. Fair enough, hopefully the next one will last longer. Update: Found the problem, took the compressor apart and the pin that connects the rod to the piston had come out. Nothing broke apart, the pin vibrated out of the press fit. I received the new one.
B00FEUA2BI|5|Awesome product. You can't beat the price for this quality.
B00HBZKSPE|4|Great shifter. Removed all the slop from my factory unit. Very solid; reduced throw by about a third and its adjustable to do even more than that. Arrived very quick. Only reason it did not get 5 stars is the lack of instructions. Easy enough to figure out but I have parts left over. No complaints at all.
B00D1TQOAC|5|nothing like a new spark plug every year for the power equiptment
B0064E8Z30|5|Worked perfect in my 1984 Honda ct 110 motorcycle tail/brake light!
B000IG7PM2|5|Fantastic
B00FJUEO12|5|This is great.  Looks good as well.
B0010G0G3Y|5|Excellent product and prices.  This product was half the price through amazon as other websites.  The cadillac dealership could not believe the price I paid for these parts.  Hands down this was an excellent purchase.
B004VGAJOG|5|Good
B007BLMWZW|5|Fits and performs great!
B001DKPYH0|5|Good stuff
B000IZ1JD4|4|value for money
B002GTKAHQ|1|Worth the money. Be prepared to JB weld the mirror when it falls off. Looks great tho. Better then spending $60+ on other ones
B00AQ4VL0I|5|Expensive but worked great
B00H2Q139M|5|I love it- gave one to my daughter as well. We both have pit bulls and love love love our fur babies
B00H2VVL0S|4|Same as first can couldn't open like a normal paint cAn
B00SJXE9R0|5|Perfect for what I want it for.  Thanks again.
B00651CLCS|1|DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. My radio quality stinks with this antenna. I am already looking for something better. This is a scam.
B0023VE0O6|5|Worked perfectly, got attached to car in 4 minutes
B000COC67E|5|Tool cart and stool
B0001CLFU6|5|Everything fit perfectly. I rebuilt the carburetor and fuel pump. Because the motor was lacking power. Before rebuilding I was getting 8 mph. Afterwards I now get 13 mph to 14 mph. On my 18 foot pontoon boat.
B000H7CKAY|5|very good
B000FQ7UOI|3|QUALITY NOT UP TO PAR.
B000OUW7KC|5|Works for my ford and mazda radios with double din
B00189ANBS|5|Excellent seat. As others have posted, the hight seems different, but is actually the same. The difference is the front of the seat is angled up. It will move your knees up and bring them closer to the steering wheel. Overall, much better than my original jump seats. My 8.5&#34; wide center console still fits and is about 1/2&#34; from the two seats and doesn't rub even when I am sitting in the seat.<br />Be warned, these seats are NOT cloth and vinyl, they are completely cloth, which I preferred anyway.
B004I0L6AQ|4|as expected for $10<br />bit dinky but vs $40 for ac delco part-why not<br />safe bet the $40 AC Delco part would be better
B003H6R46M|4|Perfect match for factory plate bracket.  However, in Ford's infinite wisdom, the plastic tabs on the lower portion are secured by RIVETS inside the bumper that are probably put on before the bumper is installed on the vehicle.  I could not get at them using a drill unless I did hours worth of work to remove plastic fascias, etc.  My point being, you will have a perfect factory replacement, however, it will not be an easy swap as it should be.  Aftermarket solutions may be a better alternative.
B000C9FEF0|4|The only reason I am not giving this product a five star is that there was a warning that it would not fit my 2005 Chevy cobalt.  I bought because another reviewer said it worked.  It not only fits perfectly, it works like a charm.  It took my husband less than 15 minutes to install and saved a lot of money on buying a whole new heater unit.
B00KFVDULA|5|Exellent product! !
B00PHSEHXQ|5|Love it
B00D8DR0AO|5|Great for travel using the 2 Bucket method or in between really washing your car with a hose and mitt
B00EA0ZB7I|5|Nice little spotlight
B00X5EO716|1|I returned this product and had another sent in its place. Thought it was just a fluke but the second one did not work either. I borrowed a tester from a neighbor that work perfectly.
B00C94EYVQ|5|Easy to install, looks great and great quality for the price. Definitely would buy this again.
B00A5BY8O8|5|Blows a lot of air works great for what I was needing ..it is a little loud
B00CR9WVPE|5|Excellent replacement air filter for my Mazda CX-5.  Fit right in and took about 5 minutes to install. Immediate improvement of gas mileage.
B00U5OKH22|3|Liked the look but lost one the first day driving. Might not of got them on right.
B00W81R4B2|5|Direct replacement of the original.
B0013AI9Y0|5|Fits nicely and keeps the heat down.
B00LBIUQ8Q|5|good
B001C04WLU|5|Perfect fit
B005CU56KM|5|Great product
B00FN4PFQM|5|VERY LOUD
B00C5S6OHS|5|Excellent. Great deal.
B010RLAMF4|4|Worked fine but would be much better with directions. Your pretty much on your own but thanks to BMW X5 links I was able to figured out how to use.
B00826OVWW|1|This is an absolute piece of junk.  Put it together, first roll in lying down position, bearing explodes. I weigh 170 pounds.  I put it back together, 2 weeks later I sit on it and another bearing explodes.
B004OJZU12|5|This product is very nice and the service too.
B0087XOTWW|5|So bright great light so far
B00CEZJBQS|5|the key chain,was given to a newly commissioned 2nd lt.<br />it was give for his 40th birthday.<br />he loved it......
B0000AX24P|5|Glad I bought this one instead one from the John Deere dealer. John Deere dealer wants too much.
B000C5YD42|5|just right
B001VKO91Y|3|Installs relatively easily.  Grips very well so it's best used with patterns for precise fit the first time.  Only drawback, and it's the big one....cost!  You can get the same product much cheaper elsewhere.  Look on the internet for Super Soundproofing Co.
B001F212OK|5|Nice product.  Would buy again.
B000MSI5LG|5|Excellent quality, direct replacement.
B002PQOACQ|5|Really pleased.  Perfect fit and easy to install on my 1998 Toyota Tacoma.  Works perfect - just like original lights.  Very good price/.
B003VXRPL0|5|Very good product.
B0080HJL7S|5|This is so nice to have in the car. I use a plastic bag over it so it won't get dirty easily. We test out to see if it does hold the liquid. We put in water, and it does not leak. I have another car trash can, that one is also sturdy but it can't be close. This one is different, the top can be close and open. A nice feature to have.<br />I got it at discount in exchange for an honest review. Like!
B00D945ZNQ|4|Easy replacement instead of buying and installing the OEM counterpart! Just stick on and go. Please note this does NOT have the mounting bracket nor headed mirror thingy.
B00QU10IH8|5|very good
B000C9TV90|5|Replace old one with no problem
B005KDOAGC|2|NIce. Very bright , good color.  2010 prius  UPDATE 1 BULB FAILED. NO bueno. Gonna try the PHILLIPS diamond
B00XIMJG84|2|Not sure how this works....
B00DJ7ON2W|5|A must have for carb cleaning.
B00BLGKQEC|5|Exceeded my expectations
B00J5ZKBEG|5|Just as expexted
B00KTHY91K|5|Worked like a charm!  Programming took less than two minutes on our 2006 Camry.
B00N26ZW4S|5|fair price still starting !!!
B00N4HT9Q2|5|look great
B008G2424O|5|Didn't come with any bulbs. Looks great!
B000HEBR3I|4|the price on Amazon is best I have found for these little pumps.  They are very very handy things to have around.  delivery was prompt and i ordered more than one as i have found several uses for them.  I especially got it for cleaning out my aquarium.  if you have little stones in the fish tank or what ever you are pumping little debris can stop the impeller. Usually I can clear it out easy enough but if there i a lot of debris i like ot put a little 'netting over the businesss end of the intake kinda like a piece of nylon hosiery or such material. that is the only problem other than they can break if abused. my cat has knocked a couple of them down from a shelf and broken them.
B0024NSGYS|5|Didn't come with any bulbs. Looks great! Noticed cups over the bulbs on the replacement assemblies. Original ones from 1999 didn't come with any.
B00NMWW28G|4|Great product and great price.
B00T36HLYU|4|serves the purpose.
B00T6J9TL2|4|Work great love the look.
B000CNJ4A2|4|Good quality and you can reuse these if you need to pull the covers off.
B00GMNUB30|3|High quality.
B001DCN1UK|3|Satisfaction  appreciated.
B00VAIF2QS|5|very nice gloves
B006WQSD1O|3|well after a year it failed again
B007A8IBJC|5|Installed on a 525 chain and had no issues afterwards.
B00EVMT6A8|5|Just got my mirrors.  The time was short only a week.  These are the best mirrors yet.  The area of placement is up for grabs.  I put a piece of folded scotch tape on the back of the mirror and placed in on a couple of positions before exposing the 3M backing.  It really does not matter with the 360 deg. view.  I placed my mirror in the lower left corner of my driver's mirror.  This position allows a fuller view on your outside mirror
B0033XYBC4|5|my husband loves this product
B002OUF3TM|3|Great quality, but I was very disappointed that it wasn't really universal to fit on other brand hoses. I got it because it's a great brand. The price was good, but I had to guinea rig it with tape to do the job.
B002M72K98|5|Works and fix as it should, not much else to say.
B00DJ5KE9A|5|Perfect to keep in the tool bag on my bike!!
B000EW0KHW|5|Great for bringing up error codes if you have an older ford.  I also bought the extra extended cable to be able to read the codes will sitting in the vehicle.  Much prefer the advantages of the newer OBD readers but of course they have nothing to connect to in older carrs.  Very happy with this unit and would buy it again.
B000CM0X5I|1|It didn't fit my 1993 Toyota driver side mirror.
B00FP0G5EK|5|excellent product from an excellent buyer
B0051RTCM4|4|The product was as described and arrived promptly.
B00407V4JU|5|fast and cheap to make some small repair
B00AQZBZ9E|5|Exactly what I needed
B00EVFPNEI|5|These are hard to put on but well worth.  Fit is great.  Color great.  Keeps my original seat covers clean.
B008G32B1O|5|Compared to dealer prices, this are a steal... not that hard to install.
B001O19INO|4|fit my 2011 dodge avenger, my check engine light went out within a day, and I saved a lot of money compared from the dealer. I also drilled a hole to push in the holder. works great.
B001KS0NB2|5|Great Product Does it job!!
B00NM8CPFA|5|exactly what the dicription says it is.
B00IKKS4W8|5|just as advertised ... very well constructed.
B0041FVH6Q|5|Easy install and work fantastic. Only problem is having to stop and demonstrate everywhere you go, even when you are in a hurry!
B0006H8BGC|5|Fit fine
B008R259WC|3|this alternator works great but the problem is this is not for a 1998 through 2000 escort had to make custom bracket to get it to work.at least the connectors fitted. i also cant verify the amp out put .but its powering a 4000 watt amp with very little light flicker
B00YMWY5GW|5|Good anode and the price is far better than many I priced. I put this on my Volvo Penta 250 outdrive and it fit perfectly.
B006QXDTQC|1|Was not impressed with there customer service at all I will be finding another company to go through when I want fender flares again. Nothing wrong with the egr flares I love them but when a company is not willing to help, won't respond to an email and pretty much calls you a moron then they don't need to be selling parts.
B00BUQMQYQ|5|Accurate replacement, made install easy. Mahalo!!!
B000C34KHY|5|its a belt works great
B001ABPKUS|3|they fit okay but there is a vibration caused (I believe) by the aerodynamics
B00F0BSCAE|5|Product description is accurate and does what it is designed to do.
B00XM7JAV8|1|Stop keep looking!  You don't even get what you pay for! Poorly counterfeited pegs.
B00ESLBRU4|5|Just as described
B00K889FCI|3|It is an improvement, but there's more to do than just wipe it on.
B00JNEB670|5|Proper size, great look, spline key fits perfectly. A very fair price and a very good product!
B0053P69IO|5|The tow hitch fit my 2015 Toyota Sienna SE very nicely. It looked like it came from the dealer after my hubby installed it. It also took about 1.5 hours to install with just your regular jack stands from the garage. Maybe under an hour if you have a lift in your garage. Love it. Now we can enjoy biking along the beaches.
B00VNBDWPK|5|Quick shipping.<br /><br />The headlight bulbs were extremely easy to install. As advertised it is as simple as plug and play with all the required connectors if the default doesn't fit. If the polarity isn't correct the cables to reverse the polarity are also included.<br /><br />The instructions that came with the headlights were also simple to follow.<br /><br />The lights are bright and white. I wouldn't expect them to be as bright as some HID units; however, they are just as bright as standard headlights.<br /><br />I would recommend this product to anyone looking for that crisp white light look. Just make sure to purchase the correct size for your headlights (found inside your car manual).<br /><br />The attached picture:<br />The light on the right is the OPT7 LED light bulb (White)<br />and the one on the left is the Philips - Diamond Vision Halogen HID Super White 5000K (Still looks yellow)
B0009IQXCM|5|This my 3rd can of &#34;GOLD CLASS&#34; wax! This was goes on easy; comes off just as easy and no powder! I absolutely use this wax on all of my vehicles and I just love the results; ALWAYS!
B00D3298A0|5|GREAT for the price!
B004TRKBOK|5|I have not had to use it, but am happy I purchased and placed in my car in case I ever need it!
B008ZVNM88|5|Excellent trim and fast shipping, thnx you
B009DJWRKA|1|It fits but you can tell it's aftermarket and not exactly oem fitment.
B00KD5Z2EG|5|I bought this spark plugs for my vrod and it runs like a champ!!! I felt the difference  right away and I highly recommended these spark plugs
B00L842NSY|5|Perfect fit for my Chevy Silverado 1500. I highly recommend to anyone who has the same truck. Great price!!
B00192JGDU|5|It was a birthday gift to my son and his wife.  They are campers and that met their needs very much.
B001KSCQOE|5|great product fit perfect
B00ICSD4G4|4|No flat washers as shown in picture.
B0055QOKC8|2|Not worth spending the money. Firstly, the product does not look the same as shown in the pictures, it been modified. Secondly, it is difficult to roll the knob on the handle bars or silicone rubber band (provided with the product), it takes a lot more effort than you think while purchasing.
B007D03R3W|3|You get what you pay for it was very difficult to install there is a video available from the company you have to email them for it and if you return them you will be responsible for shipping charges
B0075MREHI|4|Doesn't have a drain otherwise it would be perfect. However as with all these other reviews you can not go wrong with this product as a replacement for the cheap plastic one the dealership broke and wanted to charge me $211.64 to replace. $25 and had it less than a week later.
B0046DQTQQ|5|This is so cool if you like sparkly things! Just be aware that the screws that come with it are large but easy to go in but the 'jewel' is not attached and you have to adhere that separately. I didn't apply mine as thought it may fall off eventually, guess you could use super glue. It is a good weight of metal, not that cheap plastic. I am in remission for cancer so wanted to adorn my truck in pink - also my favorite color.
B004YNEQOK|5|Works.  (used it for a 1986 Chevy K5 blazer though, but worked and fit perfect)
B0002JM69W|3|I had a skin infection.<br />the seat was necessary to keep my skin cool while I was Driving. it worked very well but the metal was a little hard on my back. I  think I would have sprung for a more expensive one if I had known how well it would work. this was well worth what I paid.
B000COTT1U|1|THE SPRINGS SAGGED VERY QUICKLY AND BECAME WORSE THEN THE ORIGINAL SPRINGS WITH 100K ON THEM,  ALSO, THE ENAMEL ON THE TOP JUST WASHED AWAY AND THE WHOLE THING IS RUSTED.  I WILL POST THE PICTURES SOON.  DOES MOOG HONOR LIFE TIME WARRANTY ON THESE PRODUCTS?
B007S0H5DU|5|Best product I've found for our RV holding tank. Absolutely no ordor - not even a hint of an odor; even in extremely hot conditions.  I won't be using anything other than this from now on.
B00NGIE1TE|1|Cheap plastic. Can be pried off
B00C85DJJ4|4|it works find and I like it, but it falls out sometimes when I am putting something in while I am driving.
B00U0UUUVO|5|Fit like it should with no operating issues
B0034ROE76|5|Exactly as described
B000X90YUO|5|VIAIR... the only way to go for an offroad 12 compressor!  SO much faster than the junk normal compressors!
B00HNBPLSK|5|I could not locate one of these through the local auto parts stores. One trip to Amazon and it was a &#34;done deal'. My wife installed it on her vehicle. It took her about five minutes. It works great
B001OZU3DO|4|It matched the application on my 07 armada perfectly
B0037STD6E|5|Good product, good price, good seller.
B005LAJ9TM|1|I only recieved 3 not 4
B00M1OUBES|5|Excellent
B00A7EU81A|5|nice
B00GFAIA2Y|5|great product and little surprised however that this tank came without any manual or paperwork on how to install.
B0038DD9AY|5|good
B008M4RFKE|5|Installed in my 74 Dodge powerwagon.  A hard to find part but Amazon had it for $22!.  Best of all, it is not made in China, even better made in Canada and works great.  A pleasant surprise, I don't give too many 5 stars
B002DU3TTO|5|Perfect, just what was needed to extend the cable on my Battery Tender.
B009OBVS2K|5|I am very particular about my vehicles - park away from all structures, wash (and wax) regularly.  Unfortunately while parked at work on a warm day was hit by the sprinklers - running off schedule, covering my car with very hard water and baking into the finish.  Tried to wash off that evening - no luck, and even tried dishwashing detergent - knowing it would strip the wax but I could simply re-wax.  No good.  So the following day I washed my car again, then waxed - the hard water spots remained.  I purchased this product and used as directed - I have an orbital polisher but like the control of hand rubbing - and that's the route I took and this product took out the water spots on the first pass!  Our other car - purchased new last year, sat on the lot for several months prior to our purchase - is a white vehicle but has had stubborn water spots since we picked it up (hard to see on a white vehicle but I noticed them). It took 2 passes with this compound - but it safely removed them all.  I am a believer!!!
B01015FVI4|5|They installed very easy and look great  !!
B001763SRI|5|AAA+++ just as ordered!
B00Q13SSL8|5|So darn cute for the Queen in our Red Hats Group.  Sure to bring a smile to everyone who sees it and you can't miss it on top of the antenna!
B0040LXM1O|5|AAA+++ just as ordered!
B00CZS1JRS|4|Fit perfectly, looks very nice, and not too hard to put on.
B000HPWPP6|5|2004 Chevy Avalanche
B001DKQXXO|5|Perfect replacement for the driving lights on a 2003 Chevy Tahoe. They arrived on time and in the perfect box.
B0009V4FS8|5|Excellent product. Very well made and also very useful. I recommend this product to anyone looking for an item like this to buy. This is also a good company that shops very quickly to you...
B001JT34NQ|5|Works as expected. Very good distance. Strong magnet.
B00B2ASLMQ|4|These look great on my tt and do exactly what I needed them to. Very easy to install as well. Only reason for 4 stars is the hardware supplied didn't really work for me. The screws were too long and I screwed thru the wall on the inside. Should have checked better before I installed. Either way great product.
B005JJ0D22|5|Perfect
B00I2Y2YRS|5|Exactly what I ordered and works great
B003V57NUQ|4|Works great for the low price.
B008WT9TVW|5|works great!  thank you
B002G1PBW8|3|Schraader valve stems are same size, so was only able to use one. Ford uses a larger one on the high pressure line.
B000JQEOUW|5|Exactly what I needed. Quick shipping. Thank you...
B0045K2Q9Y|5|Worth the price
B003S72W3U|1|It didn't even fit my back seat and it states that it fits my year make & model I am not happy with it I will never buy one again on here
B002UZGCNC|5|Replaced my fuel pump and fuel filter on a 2004 e46 bmw 330i. Mann fuel filter and VDO Siemens fuel pump oem. DO NOT REPLACE FUEL FILTER WITHOUT 6 NEW HOSE CLAMPS, 8MM DIAMETER FUEL HOSE, 3.5 X 2 DIAMETER VACUUM HOSE. After replacing both components, I felt little to no difference. Must be a psychological thing. Anyways, both parts are working as they should, will keep you guys posted if anything changes or malfunctions.
B00DJ8MUJO|5|Good
B002INZHZK|4|Was a lot of measuring to get the fit right.
B004DRSQD4|5|Bright as hell. Love it.
B00J7RB72M|1|This product came to me damaged! It had been wet at some point since it was COVERED in water marks!! The zipper was broke and the handle was sewn on wrong and a large worn area on it ( it may have been used or returned and resold to me?) This seems to be a VERY cheap product and NOT what I was expecting! I would send it back, but I am in need of something to hold DVD's on a trip and a new one will not get here in time before I leave. I may have to return it after I get moved.
B00CJ69YNC|1|I had used this item before. This pack was not the same quality half of the pads fell apart from the very first panel I used them on.
B008G20G30|5|The mirrors fit and work like original equipment. The price was more than reasonable.
B002ESS9YK|5|Worked for what I needed it for......Fast Shipping.
B003V3V61K|5|product works great with quality towels
B000X20CHQ|5|excellent
B00E9HT0DS|5|great product and no problems with anything!
B00IWGLNJ6|5|Very nice saddle bags for the price.  They are very spacious and I particularly like the rigid plastic pieces on the bottoms of the bags.
B00GBP9JSW|5|great product and very easy to install no problems with anything
B00DNX6G2C|5|Tried to install on my scooter. To much feed back. Put into my truck with so very basic wiring.  It isn't too l
B004AF7ELE|5|Part came quickly, plugged it in same day and a/c is back to blowing like new! Saved me a lot of money as well as I was being quoted hundreds of dollars to test and fix the a/c but sometimes it is worth doing your own research and taking a chance, this was also a fraction of the price compared to any part store I have been to so all in all I am one cool happy customer!
B00DOZC4N4|5|These glasses fit perfectly over my prescription glasses.  Really good for the person who doesn't want to spend hundreds on prescription sun glasses!
B00067BW6S|5|Excellent product! Keep up the good work!
B0128CE0LM|1|I was assured that these mirrors would fit my ZX14R but the base bolt spacing is way off and they cannot be installed
B0049MGCOI|3|I previously purchased the white bottle cleaner (K&N Filters 99-0635). This worked extremely well.<br />I purchased this product thinking &#34;Heavy Duty&#34; meant better.<br /><br />This is quite the opposite. This product is for use on semi truck filters. These filters do not require oil, and therefore this solution is much weaker.<br />It may work well for its intended purpose, but on oiled filtered there is not enough detergent.<br /><br />Wish they specified not ideal for oiled filters.
B00FZQ6QT8|3|Picture shows 2 gaskets, which are required for any manifold replacement, but listing is for just 1 gasket. Price is high for just 1 gasket, and time is lost waiting for second. This is a deceptive product listing in my opinion, unusual for Amazon. Product itself is fine.
B008G3CSZ8|5|exacly
B000VAXLXM|1|I'm sure this is a good sensor if it fits. Amazons Vehicle check said that it did fit my 2001 Nissan Frontier 2.4L engine, but the harness plug is not the same and it does not fit, so I am returning it.
B000NVW1LM|3|Did not stop oil leak on my 2008 Dodge Avenger. Gave it 3 stars because I believe it does work if the leak is not excessive. The Avenger went downhill on me pretty quickly so I am not sure if any additive would have fixed the leak. I have had friends who had great success with this product and I certainly recommend giving it a shot for $10-15 before spending hundreds if not thousands of dollars on repairs.
B000CINVA6|5|Good
B000DT7SX0|5|Great!
B004W8ZI58|1|It sound graet but poor quality on the chrome. I requested warranty and still waiting for any answers.
B006B2A9O8|5|Very happy with these.
B00120FDJU|5|Great quality, good price, and fast delivery!
B00BJL29QM|5|this is what new car is supposed to smell like ... at least the closest thing to it.  have tried others, this is the one I'll stick with.
B001GCDX46|5|Did the job.
B000B8WMAW|5|Nice chair well built comfortable to sit on thick cloth material doesn't stretch or get out of shape. No assembly!! Remove from box unfold and lock. Sit down and enjoy.
B00432S99U|1|Not much light for a open space. Great for direct lighting. KWB
B00VBN4II0|5|Yes really good
B00S1DUBFW|4|fit as described
B00SCDC7LC|5|Great Product!  Truck looks awesome!
B000GTZ3U2|5|Great product thanks
B0008D6NK0|5|I highly recommend this item.  Makes life easier.  It's easy to install and when we bring the car(s) into the car, we just look for the laser on the dash and know when we are in the correct spot.
B00008RW9U|4|A little heavy,but it does  a good job.
B00Y1HQ45I|5|Fast shipping, worked great on my 2012 F250. No complaints.
B0002SR8AK|5|made adjusting headlights a littlt easier, but only for top adjusters....needs a swivel head and a larger slot to madjust the lower ones
B00P99KKAM|5|Good product
B00KPZECVI|1|It does not work! Spent 2 hours with a lock smith and it still couldn't get alarm to work properly. Very disappointed in this product . I would like a refund
B000M9NEIY|5|this stuff works great
B00CBW66H6|5|Perfect fit! Glad I was able to find this on here
B00RD982MO|5|These work plain and simple. I used two of them in a cold cellar that I recently added a dehumidifier to. Before the dehumidifier, there was always moisture and a mold smell. After the dehumidifier, the moisture was gone but the smell remained. One day of these in the cellar and the smell was gone completely.
B000P6WQB0|4|Maybe to light weight for filling large areas.
B007KCYZIY|2|These came and are two different colors on the outside rim paint. Looks fine behind a brush guard but def not OEM quality
B00CMH5TBY|5|Well built alternator..make sure to check for specifics before ordering. Company is great to deal with
B003ISEFKW|5|It woke up my lazy single wire O2 sensor. Computer goes right into closed loop now. Better gas millage, more power!  Worth every penny!
B00GYTEDRW|1|as others are saying... DOES NOT FIT 2014 MAZDA 3 Sport Hatchback!
B005WKJEZ0|5|Items like this, that are made to match your car are great,easy installation5minutes done,work's great
B000BB8XLG|5|Works as advertised
B00UCO9P50|4|Like them. they seem kind of flimsy. But I have never installed these before. Friends say that they will work. We will see next year when I paint my truck and install them.
B00BE7QR64|4|I LOVE the product except that I had to super glue the magnet back on. Guess the summer heat got to it.
B000UIQ4MK|5|Right part for a great price
B00IITPJSI|5|Work better than the OEM BRAKES and ROTORS.
B00A69992A|5|This part worked Great, it helped my car pass my state inspection.
B006OE1AUK|5|It is exactly the part we needed for our 2012 Honda Pilot. We took it to a body shop for them to install it, since it was quite involved to take everything apart. We are pretty handy and have good tools, but the location of this light was very difficult to access. So the part gets a 5 and the engineers who designed the Pilot get a 1.
B00VSDZAXK|5|Super cool - easy application!
B004AIHQKA|5|The Dorman window regulator and motor make my power window go up and down like new.
B00C1WK4K6|5|I used these lights on a custom gauge panel for my son's 68 Cougar. The original panel was plastic, brittle and fell apart when we started his restoration project, so we made a new panel out of metal.<br />We used (3) color lights - Green & Red for turn signals and Blue for high beam lights. They worked out great and are very bright.<br />I did have to take one light apart and resolder the lead to the LED but that was partially my fault - I soldered pig tail wires from these lights and over heated one of the connections, which melted the plastic the spade connector was encased in, & etc.<br />I like the lights and would use them again but wish the manufacturer could send them out with a small piece of 18 AWG wire (pig tail) already attached.
B00GHTNDO8|5|Great!
B00FN1ZGT6|4|good vision
B0074NQOMO|5|Excellent buy.  Very nice.
B00DMFAAK0|5|This is a very well priced part. Especially considering it's only about 10.00 more than just the black post that you can get anywhere else and this setup comes with that as well. Both for a great price, and it's perfect for the job of joining 2 cable ends together. Very happy to have found this product.
B000BZEHZ8|3|It worked just fine until I used  BG products K44 injector cleaner to clean my injectors.  My mileage went from 30 to 20 miles per gallon when driving to the same destinations, the week prior to adding the cleaner and the week after adding the cleaner.  Please note the cleaner did correct the hesitation when starting from a stop and the rough idle but appears to have affected the oxygen sensor even though I had no codes.  (I did not have a code before I changed the sensor either)<br />My fuel level sensor also failed before I used the tank of fuel with the injector cleaner.
B00J4PAMFU|5|Awesome looking set. They fit perfectly with my 2010A4 and looks so sweet peeking through my wheels. Great product.
B00H3LMDO0|5|Easy to install, good fit, Look great, Great buy!
B001C4OB58|5|installed a few months ago & it's working great.
B0030IMXG8|5|Finally a cell phone mount that will work on any phone in every car....As long as you selected the option to get vents in your car. It easily holds a heavy iPhone with battery pack. The clip grips tightly to your vent. When not in use it is almost unnoticeable.
B00ZABYKYQ|4|It wouldn't peel off, and I had to peel it off letter at a time. Not exactly even and perfect looking now, but still works I suppose!
B00FX6N7DI|2|did not work as describe
B000L9AD2K|5|Very slow, but works great
B000DCN98A|4|Bought to replace the burnt one for my dual fan setup on my camaro works as advertised.

B001D566IG|5|Easy to install. Came on time. Good value. Made in USA.
B000C8NTEY|5|I let the sun heat this thing up and it slid onto the crank with out any complaints. It's been spinning around in there for a month without any trouble. I have a 86 F-250 with the 5.0 v8.
B004BT8DJG|5|Great wiper blades.  Really takes water off windshield and doesn't leave streaks.
B00EO56FS8|5|Fits perfect on my 1997 Audi A4 Quattro. Factory latch needed to be modified but this came with an adapter piece. Drilled two holes, bolted it to old latch and it works perfect and looks great too.

B004PL4H0O|5|Used to mount my sub in the bed of the ranger

B002ESEHF0|5|it worked perfect,i highly recommend this product to any one.
B0002U268W|5|This product is outstanding, I had my car repainted and they cleaned the headlights, I asked what they used and the rest is history. The plastic is like new.
B004J30G7G|5|This was the correct jet set that I needed to replace the oem jet  that were clogged and corroded

B00SVEQPRE|5|the most amazing sticker I've ever bought
B0031GYP6K|5|Works great.
B00KVZOKH8|5|I was VERY pleasantly surprised when this arrived. It's actually a relatively thick rubbery material. I like the quality. It looks really nice on the bike and looks very durable. Perfect for my white ninja 250r!
B000C7RZWC|5|Good part and got here fast!
B000EORRXK|1|Smelling nor useless failed product
B008CE0R5E|4|very heavy, which is exactly why they work.
B00E5OUOCQ|1|Looses ability to stay in place on the windshield after two months of use. Also, difficult to fold back to set aside when not in use.
B003YNCPPS|5|Perfect fit for E90 (2006 325i).
B003NBFKDK|2|Cheap material. Used once and it is bent

B000BYGF18|1|I entered all the data for the truck but does not fit but it is well built ( What's the sense if you can not use it anyway!) It is just a waste of my time & money.
B000GUYNYI|5|Brilliant upgrade for my 1990 FXRS. I installed these, along with Progressive fork springs. The result was a wonderful ride and significantly improved handling.
B00B0WZJIU|5|been using this brand for years . theyre the best
B004ABO8BW|5|great product
B00DW6S4Y8|5|Super comfy.
B00XII7IBA|5|I love, love, love this cute lil thing. Four by three inches looks smaller in person than in the images for sure but it's still just as splendid. It goes on with ease and I'll update later if it doesn't hold up, although I don't foresee that happening as it has a nice seal.
B00BGEO7DK|5|Fit perfect in my 2014 Grand Cherokee Overland! Easy to clean and look great! Great purchase
B007CISU6Y|5|For $155 this CAN'T be beat. This leveling kit, as they call it, is really a lift kit because it does more than simply raise your Jeep's front end to the level of the rear end. The over all increase is 1.5&#34;. I know that may not sound like much but bear in mind that to achieve that amount of lift your Jeep's front end has to be brought up 3.5&#34;. That's 2&#34; to get it to the stock rear height and then another 1.5&#34; to get it to the height of the lift you just installed in the rear. It looks great. The ride is unchanged and it allows you to put a slightly larger tire on and keep the stock rims if you want. If you go for aftermarket rims with the right backspacing this kit is all you need to run 35&#34; tires. Since the Jeep is &#34;technically&#34; my wife's she wanted to stay with the OEM size tires but just run something much more aggressive and it is perfect for that. It just gives your Wrangler a whole new look....the way Jeep should be selling them in the first place. Instead of a nose down rake, the Jeeps sits perfect now with the just the right amount of lift to look tough. The install took about 3 hrs, I only used simple hand tools and only got one skinned knuckle. lol. The directions are great but for added perspective there are some good vids out there. There are other kits (Mammoth) you can buy but they cost a few bucks more and you don't get the sway bar links with them.

B002SB03IS|5|Toyota product, fits perfect what else can I say...
B00FOOV40W|5|Arrived as scheduled.
B0045YLH8Q|5|Matches perfectly with my old 1995 Ford Taurus.  I used it on the hood, roof, and trunk where there was the most sun damage.
B00XYIROC2|5|Perfect for those of us that hail from & love Michigan!
B000COS0PG|5|Good construction. I like the way I can insert it straight on the valve stem without any interference with the wheel cover.
B00HYI2C8O|5|Great product!
B00HRY61D2|5|Came as a set which was awesome for the price.......delivered on time as promised..
B00OYR43LM|1|Did not fit
B00JY07PRI|1|Installed the lights exactly as instructed. The first evening of install went to turn on lights, they flickered twice and went out. We checked all connections to the control box front and back and couldn't figure out problem. Then we wiggled the cord that extends from the end of the light strip to control box and they flickered. When I got up on a ladder with flashlight I noticed they had torn away from the light trip at the first connection. there was no adverse weather or install issues that could have caused that. Very poor design at that end where it is most critical and should be reinforced. Returning lights and now have an inoperable light strip stuck to our awning. I will say the adherence tape they use if very durable. Now if we can only figure out an easy way to remove it without tearing up the awning. Extremely disappointed coming from a brand we have trusted.
B0146RK3I6|5|These boots feels great for the price!!! I brought 3 pairs!!!
B00IZGY43U|5|fast delivery and fits perfect, starts easy.
B000E7SY16|5|All good!
B000C2OAYI|5|Perfect fit after trying from 2 other sources and getting the wrong clutch.
B0083WEVMA|5|Very impressive, well made appearance.
B002XM39M4|5|Easy to enstall , all works great I filedoff limiter on the key so it can be removed in the unlock position. Works great
B005P5DO76|4|Solid sturdy durable step that's always there when you need it. I am happy with this but my only gripe is that when the step is extended it goes downward and looses quite a bit of potential height, it might not be enough for a shorter person, I'm 5'10'' and it's just enough. Otherwise great
B00IS93TI0|5|The bumper fit perfect! Easy install both the bumper and lights. It came very well packed.
B00GJX1NYE|5|works great!
B00W67T1Y6|5|Good product and good price!
B006CF5O6W|1|same crap.good quality part. but boxed wrong or something . I needed rf . NOT Left front . More of my time wasted.
B00K35SSUQ|5|wanna stay in my car all day long, feels like went I first bought my car new, love it
B00080QHMM|3|Really, just OK, there are better ones on the market that are easier to use.
B00CGVFGAU|5|Great fit just as advertised. I would recommend.
B007NJOEAI|5|I needed some anti-seize for dis-similar metals for both the car and the boat. This works very well preventing nuts seizing and being a pain to remove. I should have bought a larger size.
B001UCIKR2|5|Great AaaTtt  on my 86 E30 if is wasn't I would say so.😊
B000BQWLE6|4|keep in the back seat and works out great, just the right size
B0079QHYU2|5|Works great and is quality part. Installed about a month ago and no problems.

B001GJ3DZS|5|Great Service and Product
B00IKPTF6C|5|Perfect! It is durable and it matches the rest of the handles.
B0001L0DFA|5|Great Service and Product
B009JUYGKW|5|Really nice jacket for the price.  Thick leather keeps the wind out, perfect.
B00BMPFI6I|5|Awesome product wish it was a tad bit lower and also that the handle extension connected a little differently but all in all great jack
B00HZY6SBY|5|Fit on, leaves no metal parts showing and they're nice
B00BK85II0|5|Protection for the back of your Nissan Quest 2011 t a very resonable price. It is huge and heavy but offers a greater egree of protection so that you will not damage the back interior of your van. Two weight help keep it down in the front on each side while two elastic bands fit perfectly over the provided clips. Easy on easy off.
B00W9EBF0Y|5|Works wonderfully for our large SUV that barely fits in the garage.  I can get within a few inches of the wall without bumping into it.  Great, accurate product.
B00UBIMGSK|5|If you own a black or red car, have had wax swirls after waxing, you need this wax! It even works with orbital on 2 or low speed light pressure. Absolutely gorgeous shine and best water repellant I have seen since 70's.
B00RW7WRB4|4|Good choice!!
B00XZ9PMTM|5|Very reasonable price compared to the dealer.  Just remember you can program this remote yourself to unlock the doors and the trunk, but a locksmith will have to program it to start the car.
B006WHQ5JA|5|Really nice.  I bought volt,water, oil from same vendor, have no complaints.  The LEDs are not too bright, but can be seen very clearly in the brightest day.  Gives a really modern look.
B006GFLI0O|5|I love it cause fit really good and the quality looks really good.
B001FAK31A|5|Good quality aluminum parts, o-rings stops any noise. Good product, but a little pricey.
B000C9MWO6|5|Takes a little getting used to, but it keeps my neighbors from siphoning gas and it hasn't set off my check engine light. What more can you ask for?
B002XMWAT2|5|excellent product.
B000EBKG5E|5|Works well.
B009SDA65E|5|Fast delivery, a plus product A+++
B000C5CBAK|5|Works well. I used it to create a bleeder for my Land Rover Discovery 2 when I converted it to an inline thermostat.
B00EDMWZZ4|5|Excellent
B008HRX5PU|1|Product was not as described.<br /><br />Description states 17mm bolt head, yet received a 3/4&#34; bolt head. The rest of my car is metric, so yes, I want all my fasteners to also be metric to keep things simple.<br /><br />Bolt head looks like it was custom made by a 12 year old using an angle grinder for the first time; very poorly machined bolt head.  For the price, the head should be CNC milled.<br /><br />Will be requesting refund since item is not as described.
B000N8GDSC|5|I love these......I know they are re-usable, but I put a new set each time and never have any leaks......Fast Shipping
B000COU86U|5|The Monroe-matic plus shock absorber gave car softer new ride.
B00CPL8R8O|5|Great
B0052XFWCG|5|works great just like it is advertised
B00HXC6MNW|5|Best invest for communications on motorcycle. My wife and tested them out on the highway and the clarity was outstanding.
B008Y8TDTY|5|Original GM product.
B00IXXRK8G|5|Perfect fit
B00449HCLI|5|Fit perfectly!
B00HUM5JMA|5|Fits my 2015 Subaru Forester perfectly at much less cost than the dealership!
B00065JM8U|1|I really wanted to like this product, but couldn't live with the high pitched whine it made even on the low speed. I purchased two and they both made the same horrible noise, so we returned them.
B00Q13NWXM|5|I didn't realize this offer was for 2 so I'm doubly happy!  I have a dear friend who is a retired nurse.  This will look awesome on her antenna.
B001V8U12M|4|Works as described....Perfect for my cordless black & decker drill.
B007TYQZVS|5|It was easy to install and works great!
B00RVDW4FI|5|The first time I got this sticker it didn't work out too well because stupid me didn't know how to put the sticker on properly. Then a couple days later after writing a review thinking they were in the wrong and they weren't it was just me being new to putting stickers on vehicles.. I got another one in the mail! I was so pumped because I knew how to put it on. I mean for first timers I would recommend just a little slip of instructions and I purchased another cool sticker and that had instructions in it but I was glad to be able to put this brand new sticker on my car without any troubles. Make sure to clean your window before you apply it helps! And press hard on the lettering so it sticks! The next test for this sticker is going through the car washer and hoping it doesn't rip off! Overall, I'm glad I got sent another one without even knowing it but thanks anyways! Truly approve this sticker and service that was provided! AWESOME!
B00CCIM1YQ|5|Bought a used one and haven't had a single issue. Came with a little bit of superficial damage, but no complaints here! Does exactly what is described and comes with 4 keys so you've got a while to go until you lose them all. Great for areas that only see a minimal amount of bike thefts. Goes through my tire, frame, and bike rack without any problems so I can deter practically any theft other than just cutting the lock itself. The metal, however, is solid and very secure so I don't see that happening ever. I usually just let the lock hang around one side of my handlebar as I ride and it doesn't create an issue.
B00ARJQTYK|1|did not work on a bmw 2006 x5 3.0
B00IJ6INAG|2|So I bought these thinking that they would make my 2012 Jetta look a bit classier. From the back view of my car they did but if you look at it from any other angle you can see that these exhaust tips are very short and that doesn't look good anymore. I wish these were longer but they aren't so I decided to go with the OEM exhaust tips because they are a lot longer and give your Jetta that classy look without revealing the whole tip.
B000C5UFIU|5|worked perfect, fit perfect
B00LECULFW|5|This is a great item! It works like advertised.  I am a professional truck driver and these work just like the seat belt tensioners in my commercial truck. These clips make road trips in my personal rigs much more comfortable. A+ rating! I may buy more of these in the future.
B004FG1HQQ|5|They're perfect! They arrived quickly and we're super easy to put together. They stay in place and hold all my bags too!  Love!!
B0025Y9SU2|4|Works great but have to see how long it last. 88 cushman truckster
B002DU3S9A|1|I am pretty dissapointed.  The first one died within a week, the second one died on it's second use. I am a generator technician and in the past used these on standby generators but I can't see how I could ever trust these on a customer generator again.  Not to mention that I will have to send a second one back to get warranty.
B0021UXUSQ|5|cannot beat the price
B00QR5X0T0|5|Works great, looks great, so far it seems has good stopping power.
B00T3ZUNDC|1|Barely as long as my tv remote , less than a foot when supposed to be 20 inches ! Don't waste your money on this expensive decal that's not what you pay for !
B004M3F5CO|1|DO NOT USE this product if you care about your paint.  I have removed many emblems from cars.  I bought this to remove a hood emblem from my car.  I now have to have the hood painted.  I followed the directions to a T.  I even used a timer.  Do not trust this product.  I am now filing a damage claim with turtle wax.  We'll see how they handle it.
B000CN7W1A|5|Great quality and performance.
B013UQOZHY|4|This is a great product and I'm happy with my purchase. I've had it for a few days and already I'm happier with this than I was with my little old stock one. It works good and looks good too.. the only thing that was weird was the the instructions came in Chinese (not really needed; super easy installation) lol
B000IHIAES|5|excellent
B001NYYREC|5|High quality, same as the OEM type used on all f150, F250, F350 super duty pickups. 40.00 dollars less than dealership
B00BFDG4QU|5|Visually, the design is slightly different than my 2001 Honda's, but it's not unusual to see design improvements even in genuine parts. Works just like the original used to.
B0002RNSG4|5|Best ever!
B00QMV96VK|2|They look nice but don't fit well.. and bunch up in the seat
B000EVU99M|4|Installed Equus gauges in my son's 68 Cougar custom gauge/dash panel. Like the design of the Equus product line - very easy to install - drill correct size hole, insert gauge and put on gauge nut.<br />I originally ordered the mechanical temp gauge set up but after pulling the panel back out, I quickly say the sense in replacing with this electric gauge instead. It was no problem to replace, install the temperature sending unit on the engine or wire back to the gauge. I went will Blue LED's in all the gauges which looks really cool at night. And I always put a couple of dabs of silicone on the gauge nuts once they are installed - just in case they want to come loose in the future.<br />Only thing I can say negative about this set up - it's off by 10f. I checked it with my thermal imaging camera. Wish it was more accurate but within my personal tolerance range.
B00URS6GCQ|5|Fit nice....
B00G49DVGG|5|I picked up the New Car Scent version of this product after noticing an off musk in my vehicle. I couldn't locate the source of the odor so this seemed like the right remedy. Put the ac on high, make sure it's on the recirculating air setting, and place the canister in the middle of the car. It'll spray continuously for about 6-8 minutes until the entire container is gone. The smell is pleasant albeit strong the first week, and 3 weeks after using it, I still get a &#34;refresher&#34; every time the ac runs when I start the car.  People say my car smells fresh and like new.
B00GMRM3KA|5|Item was as described.
B00Z7KIZPA|5|Works good but for large purses
B00PARUCTC|4|Hope double sided tape last the life of the truck, looks good easy to install
B00A2AQNF4|4|I was pleased with the product.
B0002U268M|5|VERY GOOD PRODUCT.
B001AD6T24|5|Great to use on passenger seat.
B00I796HS0|5|Shipped fast, came with drain plug washer, OEM filter, for less than 1/2 what I was paying.<br />Very satisfied.....SIX stars!
B001G7O4U8|5|great for the price and I did nor have to pay dealer price.
B004G44RKK|5|Exceptional emblem, looks great on the car.
B00KTITHNO|2|bought a spare for my son.  went through 2 batteries within 2 weeks and finally died after 4 months of use.  my original one has lasted 9 years and 1 battery.  get what you pay for.
