B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|Despite being believed to be a ladies' book, the story and language of Jane Austen are invaluable regarding language studies, classic British cultural and social research, and overall knowledge expansion. Charcters are enjoyable, whereas their intelligence and findings are quite applicable across countries and times.
B005CA4SQK|5.0|Great show from great source material. If you're expecting &#34;simple&#34; horror (gross outs, scares, etc.) this really won't scratch the itch.<br /><br />Both the comic book and the show are much more about the human toll of the collapse of civilization. The zombies certainly add a fun element but watching how the characters change as they are forced to do things they would never have done in the &#34;normal&#34; world is a big draw of the show.<br /><br />Early in the days of the comics Kirkman talked about having a zombie movie that never has an ending - and watching the protagonist (Rick Grimes) become almost unrecognizable as the man he was when the story started.<br /><br />The BluRay definitely looks better than the broadcast HD and the specials are OK.<br /><br />If you like post-apocalyptic fiction where the people don't look clean and neat (looking at you, Revolution) give this a try.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|I finished the game in only a couple of hours, but I enjoyed it. The environments look great, and the puzzles are somewhat challenging at times, but not impossible to figure out. Plus there's always the hint screen if you do get stuck. The only additional functionality I would've liked is if you could make marks on the map so you know which areas may need follow up at a later time.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Very handy to have around - doesn't provide the same level of edge you could get with a diamond hone and some expertise/practice, but it does the job VERY quickly and easily.

B001XJ1PNS|5.0|This is my favorite cookbook of all time! I have a dairy allergy and it is so hard to find recipes or find bakeries that make dairy-free desserts so it is nice to be able to make them whenever I want. All the recipes come out great that I have tried and my family and friends actually like some of the cupcakes and frostings better that ones with dairy in them! I very highly recommend this book, especially for those of you that have dairy allergies like me!

0307389839|5.0|I have never read Haruki Murakami's book. Somehow reading the summary, it seems they are not for me. I am going to read 1Q84 to see if my intuition is correct or I like him. I was drawn to this reading book and currently reading it, almost 75% completed. I should admit I like his style and is very impressive. His life experiences, running tips, and frank opinions are very refreshing. I am enjoying his memoir which is completely non fiction.

B0034DGPEU|3.0|When I began this book, I enjoyed the story and the historical setting.  However, about two-thirds through, I became annoyed by the naiveté of the main character.  I also struggled with the stereotyping of the characters--both good and bad.  This book could have been more than it was.

B009439HEY|5.0|Music Review Time!<br />I have to start with this: I thank my great friend, Bob for turning me on to Genesis way back in the mid 70's.<br />Okay, so if you're a Genesis fan - the old stuff, not the \\"pop\\" Phil Collins stuff - be aware that Steve Hackett has just released \\"Genesis Revisited II\\". As much as I liked Genesis of that era (Nursery Cryme, Foxtrot, etc.) the recordings weren't great, and I often found myself turning them off because the recording quality was more annoying than the music's ability to overcome it. They were very compressed, and lacking in bass - not to mention they were very compressed, and lacking in bass!!!<br />A little about Steve Hackett - I've always thought that Genesis's best stuff was when Hackett began to have a real impact on their music, during the \\"Trick of the Tail\\" and the \\"Wind and Wuthering\\" years. You might disagree, but you'd be wrong (LOL!).<br />Hackett's release of \\"Genesis Revisited II\\" is a double disc, and it is LONG. In fact, I'm not sure I have any other discs jam-packed with so much music, and that's cool! (BTW, if anything I've said up till now resonates with you, no need to read on, ... just RUN - don't walk - and buy the album!)<br />It's unbelievably well recorded - there is plenty of bass, and it's very dynamic! It's truly great to hear Hackett's guitar lines more clearly and the songs are performed better than I've ever heard them. As a guitarist, I think Hackett is a GIANT - he's one of the most masterful practitioners of the instrument I've ever heard, not to mention his always impressive and imaginative command of the electronic effects he uses. On the album, he's also done a great job musically \\"enhancing\\" the songs in some places and preserving the original feel in others, and I haven't enjoyed a new disc this much in a very long time!<br />One final note. I don't think Hackett enjoyed the commercial success that the rest of the band did. The band dismissed him in very poor form, and in my opinion, to thedetriment of the quality of their music, so if you like the idea of this musical release, the please buy this album - don't copy it from a friend, or search for a pirated version. Spending money on this release was very satisfying (altruistic?) for me. Not that I thought Hackett needed my $1.32, or whatever the royalty is from a $15 dollar disc, but I felt good about him benefitting form my purchase. Musicians work hard - pay `em what they're due!<br />So there!

B003ZSJ212|1.0|Many of the reviews talk about the \\"No, Nooo\\" dialog inserted in Jedi but are missing the insult in Empire.  In the original version of Empire, after Luke jumps and falls through the chute in Bespin, there's a scene which shows Vader briskly walking and in a pissed off, gravely voice says \\"Bring my shuttle\\".<br /><br />In the new version, the voice in the same tone as Jedi, says \\"tell my star destroyer to prepare for my arrival\\".  The very next scene shows what is supposed to be the shuttle landing in the star destroyer.  It's not, it's the opening scene in Jedi of the shuttle landing in the Death Star2!!  I mean come on king George.  If you're going to tinker with your toys at least try not to insult our intelligence.<br /><br />I would like to know why in the original version of Jedi, R2's beeps changed from the first two films and Vader's voice became more digitized.  Why not keep it fluid?  For me, the origianl Empire is the best with A New Hope coming in at a very close second.
B004GFN11A|4.0|I like the app. It's great on the fire, since I can now blog on the go with my bluetooth keyboard, though I wish I wouldn't have to navigate by touch to a new post or down my feed and could just use my arrow keys instead.

1742200206|3.0|I have to say that I would have expected this guidebook to be priced lower than the Frommer's version. The pages in this Lonely Planet guide are not heavy and glossy like those put out by other guidebook writers; instead they make you feel as if you're looking at and turning pages of barely better quality than a newspaper. As others have said, it appears that this guide is focused on shorter NYC trips or on NYC trips for those who have never been and want to cover the major sites in short amounts of time (so as to see as much as possible). That's all well and good, except for the fact that there is some out-of-date and/or incomplete information in this Lonely Planet NYC city guide.<br /><br />Also, while other reviewers keep making mention of the maps - and I agree that it's nice that they're in there - I have to ask, what's the point? If that's one of the biggest features a guidebook offers, to me someone needs to do some rethinking...because to be honest I don't know one person who carries around a paper map with them anymore.<br /><br />All in all, if you don't have a smartphone to use for maps and if you're a first time NYC visitor or just going for a short trip, this guidebook is a decent option. But if none of the above fit you, I suggest checking out Frommer's New York City guidebook(s).

Fantastic performances all around. The story had depth, and authentic heart-moving scenes. I loved the fact that it was based on a true story. Adds a dynamic to the story that you can relate to, and makes it more compelling to watch.
B0091Q82L8|5.0|Despite the similarity to \\"Live at Leeds,\\" and the identical set list (less Magic Bus), this recording is a reminder of just how great a live show The Who put on, and, as such, YES, it is a MUST HAVE for serious Who fans.<br /><br />This was THE premier act in Rock and Roll during their heyday, and the Hull show is just more proof of this.  As commented throughout these reviews Keith Moon is a study in controlled fury as he assaults his drum kits with the fluid savagery for which he was famous.  Yes, the guitar sound lacks some of the bite from the Leeds recordings, but the chords sound deeper and more textured, and, if not as heavy as Leeds, they're heavy enough, especially at ultra-loud volume, the only volume for a live Who performance.<br /><br />To those who experienced a Who concert around this time the visual impact of Keith Moon cannot be understated.  He floated above his set in a blur of movement in an endless barrage of stunning fills that defied description.<br /><br />Contrasted with Townshend's hyper-elegant windmills and crashing power chords and supported with the virtuosity of John Entwistle's bass lines, Keith Moon completed the setting for Roger Daltrey's soaring vocals.<br /><br />It had to be seen to be believed, and at a Who concert the sound shared the stage with the image of that sound being created in a devastating assault on the senses.<br /><br />In a work of pure genius Peter Townshend built a band with a drummer at the center of the music as the lead instrument most of the time, and this recording is a reminder of the incredibly high standard Moon set for drummers going forward.<br /><br />He is still up there with the very best of them, and as a trailblazer he stands alone at the pinnacle.  This is him at his very very best.<br /><br />The ONLY thing about this recording that seems a shame is that so much of the Who's most memorable songs came post 1970, but this is well-compensated by the fact that they still play much of their more well-known early material...regardless, buy this, get into some of your favorite refreshments of the era, and then crank it up to the limits and sit back and ride with the music.<br /><br />Stunning stuff.
0062124293|2.0|Wanted to like it, liked it at first, during a cute story of her as a young teen, angsty and etc., but then it seemed that the author never grew up: her voice remained as cutesy and, to me, contriving to be hip-or-die as that self conscious young person's might. A no.

I started to read it  from a friends copy, but rheumatoid arthritis in my hands & wrists made it hard to hold this &#34;heavy&#34; book.  Eventually, I ordered it for my Kindle.  I highly recommend Kindle books for folks with problems like mine.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I really enjoyed this one. I've left off 1 star because of the Kindle format -- which was fine, actually, nothing wrong.  But with a great big book, I missed the physical sense of how far I was into the book, and how far still to go.  I also missed being able to leaf back through an earlier part, to check a name or look again at a photo. That didn't bother me with Kindle books I read earlier, but they weren't as large.<br /><br />On the other hand, it was really nice to only tote my slim little Kindle instead of a giant book.<br /><br />Oh, I don't know. OK, I'm putting the star back.
B009OYTIXS|1.0|I freely admit I was a huge fan of this show after watching the first few episodes. It seemed to promise action plus just enough human feeling to make the lead character a little more than another cartoon-cutout adaption.<br />I'm now up to episode seven, ...and am almost completely over this whole series.<br /><br />What started as an action packed vigilante against the strong men of crime idea, promising some vicarious entertainment as we watch \\"our\\" hero take out the baddies in highly imaginative ways, ...progressively degenerates into lengthy soap-ridden clich&eacute; scenes of feminine talkfests about \\"caring\\", female relationships issues, support and other assorted warm-fuzzy aspects.<br />This is all done with such over emotional BAD acting that it just overwhelms the original concept completely.<br />It is literally as if whole sections of \\"The Bold & the Beautiful\\" have been spliced into the episodes, ...complete with that oh-so-serious method of \\"acting\\"(?) where they exchange those deep-&-meaningfuls in near whispers with grim faces.<br />Bad, bad, ....and even worse!<br />It's exactly what the writers did to \\"Dexter\\" with that damn plot line of the baby and all those family issues.<br />99% of the viewers just wanted to see Dexter carve up the baddies, ....NOT change damn dirty diapers and go all daddy-fied!<br />Then they had to resort to some unbelievably contrived writing to try and wrest back some of the initial excitement as the fans fell away.<br /><br />I can only imagine these fluffy girly themes are being introduced to Arrow as an attempt to attract more female viewers to the genre, but it has totally ruined what promised to be a pretty good park-your-brain in neutral and enjoy, fast moving concept.<br />It's now bogged down in over-emotional baggage, ....with FAR too many over-earnest female characters all competing for their emotional attention as they emote breathily in close-up.<br />I've stuck it out this far, but the soap is now getting so thick, and the action so infrequent, that it's very hard to see the original concept emerging from the suds.<br />Down to one star now, ...AND FADING RAPIDLY for me!, and the action so infrequent, that it's very hard to see the original concept emerging from the suds.<br />Down to one star now, ...AND FADING RAPIDLY for me!

B009P5S11G|3.0|Granted, Unapologetic is Rihanna's most musically daring album yet; however the album was so rushed to conform to RiRi yearly tradition of launching an album that, the quality of the music suffers. Moreover, the record does not deviate from Rihanna typical approach... sex, that is. Her overstating sexuality and what a bad ass she is, just seems exaggerated.<br /><br />But I'm not a hater of Unapoletic! \\"Diamonds\\" is a soothing electronic ballad; \\"Right Now\\" will make every cell in your body jump repeatedly; \\"No Love Allowed\\" is a mid-tempo reggae influenced track that is just delectable; \\" Jump\\" is not very original, lyrically speaking, but the chorus is seriously mind-blowing.

Unfortunately, my find falls into the &#34;if it seems to good to be true&#34; category - because it definitely was NOT a good deal.  I received poor quality knock off's.  The CD covers are faded and low quality, almost looking like glossy copies.  Some discs have digital pixelization and breaks in sound. And others don't allow you to access all the special features.  Would definitely not buy from this vendor again!!!  Shame on Amazon for bringing them up as a reputable supplier in their search results.

B0084U0IEG|5.0|Like any Ian McEwan novel, this one is a beautifully written joy to read.  The story takes place in the British Secret Service in the early 1970's, with the Cold War on the one side and the beginning of the troubles in Ireland on the other.  Unlike 007 and his ilk, this newly-recruited spy is a very well-read young lady who finds herself enmeshed in a series of circumstances she doesn't really understand. Why did her ageing lover recruit her for MI5?  Why has no one intercepted her disastrous affair with her colleague in the Sweet Tooth project? How long can she continue piling lies on top of lies and not be found out?  There is a throughly unexpected turn of the tables at the closing.  A wonderfully entertaining story!
B008HT4FUW|4.0|Can purchasers of this product (either Blu-Ray or DVD versions) confirm that the discs play without problem in US DVD/Blu-Ray players?  The item title specifies that this box set is the \\"Original UK Version,\\" which from other reviews sounds like it is referring to uncut content of the episodes.  However I'd like to make sure there aren't any issues with playing the discs in US devices.<br /><br />I have watched all of Seasons 1 and 2 on Netflix and Hulu and am a huge fan of the series!
B0091LS07E|5.0|The three years separating \\"Girl on Fire\\" and the 2009 \\"The Element of Freedom\\" have been quiet eventful for Alicia Keys.  She married producer Swizz Beats, gave birth to a son named Egypt, and then collaborated with all sorts of musicians, from Dr. Dre to Jamie XX and so many others.  (Ok, here's the list: Marsha Ambrosius, Dr. Dre, Drake, Jamie XX, Jennifer Hudson, Bruno Mars, Maxwell, Miguel, Frank Ocean, Emeli Sandé, and Kanye West).<br /><br />\\"Girl on Fire\\", likewise, is by far Keys' most collaborative album, with numerous songwriting and production contributions from about twenty different people.  The 2007 album \\"As I Am\\" and 2009's \\"The Elements of Freedom\\" also featured extensive collobration, but not to the extent as \\"Girl on Fire\\".  For the first time in her career, there is not a single solo composition written exclusively by Keys.<br /><br />When musicians who normally write [the bulk] at least some of their own material suddenly become so receptive to co-writers, any number of things may be going on.  They may be searching for the next big hit.  Their career may be in trouble.  They going for a bid at relevancy.  They must be suffering writers' block.  When there are this many collobrators, the albums tend to become schizophrenic from too many competing or clashing songwriting styles.  Fortunately, Keys has the savvy to choose collobraters who not only play to her strengths of classical training and stellar vocals that would make Whitney Houston proud, but also she has chosen people who can push her into new, exciting musical territory and yet retaining her key identity as an artist.<br /><br />Keys had the following to say about her new album and how the past three years have effected her artistically.  \\"These last three years have been the most in every way. The most newest, the most difficult, the most loving, the most dream-filled, the most breaking free . . . an entire crazy dynamic of lessons and emotions to grow into and claim. This whirlwindhas definitely forced me to be who I am, to be free enough and brave enough to just not accept anything else-nor try to be anything else.\\"\\"<br /><br />\\"I've stepped more into my business and really... taken control for how I want that to be. So every way that I've created now is totally in a new space. It's more in a true space of who I am and what story it is that I'm trying to tell, what it is I'm going through, what the world is going through. And it's really important for me to describe that and say that exactly how I see it, period. So, things are just new. The world is new! Everything feels like brand new to me.\\"<br /><br />Part of Keys' evolution is showing just how comfortable she truly is making exception R&B music.  \\"Girl on Fire\\" sports a number of different musical styles within the R&B framework, although the majority is mid-tempo.  However, Keys deftly moves between hip-hop, funk, electric soul, strains of gospel (in a Bruno Mars collaboration), occasional hints of upbeat dance material (\\"Listen to your Heart\\") in particular, and with some distant echoes of rock and reggae.  Keys and her collobartors manage to adorn the songs with off beat melodic and chord curve balls that consistently keep the music and Keys' performances interesting, belying a musical dexterity we already knew Keys had within her skillset.<br /><br />As always, Keys shows off her remarkable piano playing.  De Novo Adagio is a brief piano intro, showing Keys's classically trained playing off for the world to see (in case you had forgotten), which sequeways straight into \\"Brand New Me\\".  Originally in the running to be the title track, \\"Brand New Me\\" is a cathartic declaration of Keys finding herself, freeing herself from poisonous relationships of the past. \\"Listen to Your Heart\\" sounds like an update to that 70s soul.  \\"Girl on Fire\\" is argueably one of the very rare missteps on the album and, although the lead single, is the weakest track here.  Nicki Minage does not help matters,with her rather off putting rap.  Fortunately, Nicki plays the song straight without any of her usual flairs for the overly dramatic, but the song simply does not have any real strength.  Probably better left as an outtake or a bonus track.<br /><br />\\"Fire We Make\\" is a great bedroom get in the mood song, with fantastic falsettos from Maxwell.  \\"Tears Always Wins\\" almost makes you think it's an unreleased Prince track (of which there are HUNDREDS).  \\"Not Even the King\\", cowritten with Emeli Sande (one of three cowrite credits for Sande) features Alicia and her piano, and is an intimate look into the songwriters' souls.  \\"Limitedless\\" has all the hallmarks of an early 1990s Babyface guitar ballad a la Eric Clapton's \\"We Can Change the World\\" (mainly because Babyface cowrote the song).  \\"One Thing\\" starts off on familiar lyrical territory already covered by \\"Tears Always Wins\\" before metamorphosing into a quiet, heartbroken contemplation on a failed love.  Although not musically or lyrically, the song reminds me of \\"Faithful\\" from the 1998 Pearl Jam album \\"Yield\\", which begins as a meditation on religion and halfway transforms into a declaration of faithful commitment to a lover.  101, the longest song here, begins as a minor key, relaxing song but with a strong message of doing everything to the best of your ability, and is a kiss-off to an old ex.  The track ends with a two minute explosion of Keys exubertantly admonishing the listener to \\"Hallelujah / kick in the door!\\" and ends the album on a high note.<br /><br />For the Hunger Game fans out there, \\"Girl on Fire\\" can't help but remind you of the original girl on fire, Katniss Everdeen.  Just like Katniss, Keys is truly a mover and a shaker and has managed to tap into the strong currents of her personality to make some truly remarkable music that is sure to touch the listeners for the positive.<br /><br />The brilliance of \\"Girl on Fire\\" is, although daringly experimental in places, the music never sounds forced.Each track sounds [plays out] tailor-built for Keys, and although there are some divergent threads present, they all fit wonderfully into a cohesive, new R&B classic.<br /><br />For this listener, I first truly started paying attention to her after Bob Dylan named checked her in \\"Thunder on the Mountain\\", the lead track to his 2006 \\"Modern Times\\".  The line goes \\"I've been thinking about Alicia Keys, couldn't keep from crying.  When she was born in Hell's Kitchen, I was living down the line.  I'm wondering where in the world Alicia Keys could be.  I've been looking for her even through Tennessee\\".<br /><br />Dylan told Rolling Stone \\"\\"I remember seeing her on the Grammys. I think I was on the show with her, I didn't meet her or anything. But I said to myself, There's nothing about that girl I don't like.\\"  For my money, that's a top-shelf endorsement, and one that Keys has shown herself quite worthy of, especially with albums as high caliber as \\"Girl on Fire\\".<br /><br />Highly, highly recommended.

B008XBCJ34|5.0|initially, there was a little hiccup, the first avatar sent to me was defective...but replaced immediately, great customer service!  i don't know if was because i had to wait so long for a 3D version or not, but i swear it looked even better than the movie theater.  it really is better than any other 3D movie i have...and i only purchase 3D movies that were FILMED in 3D.  check wikipedia before going to or buying a 3D version of any movie.  they have a list you can sort alphabetically or by release date.  i forgot to check before we went to see the avengers and i was sorry.  the only upside of that was we got a couple pair of children's size 3D glasses to take home.  we have a passive 3D LG flatscreen (it was a &#34;best buy in a leading consumer magazine&#34; at the time) but the children size glasses didn't come with it.

0679720200|5.0|Nothing I can say here has not already been said.  Let it just be known that this is an absolutely great novel, and no one will set it down disappointed.  Camus is a professional and his novel emphasizes the absurd and the mundane is a truly compelling way. READ THIS BOOK.
B009K45Y62|5.0|Anybody who said or is going to say this movie was slow, or drug out, or that it plain old sucked is a moron. First off if you don't like the movie don't buy it. Second, the movie was well paced and pretty full of everything you would expect from a Batman flick. In the theatres I would have been able to watch at least another hour of the movie without thinking about when is this going to end. That's saying a lot considering the length of the movie. But anyway Tom Hardy deserves an actor of the year nomination for his work in the dark knight rises and lawless. You know youre good when you act with your eyes because you couodnt even see most of his face... In a nutshell the only word I would describe this movie with is - INCREDIBLE...
B0013ND30W|5.0|The classics are always wonderful, and this movie is no exception. this combo is wonderful because you have both blue-ray (in our living room) and normal DVD (family room). This is a must buy if you can find it.

B001MTENOC|5.0|I just finished reading it for the second time.  It is the most descriptive book I have read on this subject and done in a very understandable way.

B001AQO3QA|5.0|I particularly loved the &#34;Director's Cut&#34; of Alien 3. I consider it to be a version far superior to the theatrical one.

I love the brush-on applicator that comes with this glue, but after a few people handled my model I started noticing bombs, landing gear, etc. getting knocked off far too easily. Not a very secure bond. weak

B009X2CVXA|4.0|An enjoyable read that soon has you hooked! Some elements are a little predictable however there are enough surprises to keep you thinking, If you have enjoyed other Kate Morton novels then you will most likely enjoy this one too. You will soon be visualising life in England in the early 1900's - your imagination will be aided if you have seen any of the Downton Abbey television series.
1400067820|1.0|Rarely have such powerful and important ideas been so difficult to access.<br /><br />Randomness, uncertainty, and volatility damage modern systems that are fundamentally fragile.  Anti-fragile systems are ones that not only respond to these forces but also get stronger as they respond, change, progress and adapt.<br /><br />Theses are five star ideas in a five philosophical book.  But they are expressed in a one star way.  This is a one star business book. The one star review is intended to get your attention so you know what you are buying rather than what others - not Taleb - are trying to sell you.<br /><br />WHAT THIS BOOK IS ABOUT<br /><br />This book is intended to be instructional argument to consider an alternative way of thinking.  Taleb uses rhetoric, observations and hypothetical conversation to make his points across 25 chapter and almost  almost 500 pages.  The argument in a nutshell is this.  Much of what we see as stability and our efforts to maintain stability actually increases fragility and the cost of the thing we are trying to stabilize.  The remedy is to recognize the anti fragile nature of systems and support it as systems left to their own devices, given time to adjust and free of well-intentioned intervention (iatrogenics) tend to adapt, survive and grow.<br /><br />Taleb takes a longer view than most of us that not only incorporates the existence of extreme but unlikely events - black swans - but also gives complex systems time to respond, adjust and adapt to shocks and retain their antifragile properties.  In taking the longer view Taleb's prescriptions, such as they exist, are to let things run their course, protect the most vulnerable but not so much as to `legislate' risk out of the equation. Taleb emphasizing experimentation and accepting small/individual failures that strengthen the larger system.  The book is explicit in the need to abstain from  heavy handed directed and interventionist policies of the Soviet-Harvard elite.  These fragilista elites suffer from the delusion that complex systems can be controlled, managed and their ill effects reduced.<br /><br />An anti-fragile world is a world where there are winners and losers (suckers in the book) with both required for any  complex systems to sustain, adapt and evolve.  Taleb is not conservative.  ITaleb is more libertarian in his views. In the book, he rails against the idea that our actions should preserve the past, a policy that only hides risk and exacerbates negative consequences.<br /><br />WHO SHOULD READ THIS BOOK AND WHAT ARE THEY READING<br /><br />Business leaders, policy makers and academics beware this book written is not written for any of you, particularly if you are looking for prescriptive answers.  Antifragile is a not a business book and its not intended to be one - that would be the antithesis of Nasim Taleb's objective.  Taleb is a modern day philosopher powered by the web who uses his observational abilities, experience and intellect to explain how modern intervention makes our world fragile.<br /><br />HOW IS THE BOOK?<br /><br />Antifragile is a philosophical discussion. Written in the style of a raw and  engaging dialog, as you labor through the chapters you feel like you are sitting with Uncle Nassim in a coffee shop where he is telling you what is wrong with the world and how everyone else is too dumb to know it.  The stories and examples are local in nature, people in your neighborhood, situations you can relate to.  These are punctuated with facts, research from others and other support that remind you of the depth and complexity of such a simple idea.  It is the best of a dialectic style, powered by the Internet.<br /><br />This is a book that demands to be read, considered, reflected upon before one can take action - or more often abstain from action and let nature take its course. This is a book you are going to want to buy hard cover in order to take notes, pick up and put down - things hard to do with an eReader.<br /><br />It is ironic that this book, which expresses such contempt and distain for intellectuals and academics, will most likely be taken up by that same audience. Pseudo-intellectuals will incorporate Taleb's ideas into their conversations the same way they now talk about `black swans' and everyone will miss the author's point.<br /><br />Overall, recommended if you are going to put the time, energy and thought into reading the ideas, working past the writing and think about what this means.  If you are looking for a quick fix, to be `in the know' then I suggest reading the fawning reviews on this site or the article in the Wall Street Journal.<br /><br />Antifragile is a rare book these days, one that seeks to present an idea in the full, express it without compromise and apply it to the world without the fear of being politically correct.  It is a book that demands and requires your attention and reflection, so if you can give it both then the book will give you much in return.<br /><br />STRENGTHS<br /><br />Taleb's observations regarding the fragility of the modern world and how our actions destroy anti-fragility are powerful and shed new light on public policy, business strategy, economic policy and technology.<br /><br />Taleb's book provides a substantive and complete discussion of the ideas behind what makes systems fragile, forces that build anti-fragility.<br /><br />Rather than creating a narrow definition or description, Taleb illustrates the breadth and depth of anti-fragility.  In the book Taleb discusses how these ideas apply in medicine, financial markets, social development, etc.<br /><br />Taleb uses tables throughout the book summarizing his argument and providing examples contrasting the fragile from anti-fragile. These tables are helpful to re-anchor the reader in the argument and discussion.<br /><br />CHALLENGES<br /><br />Taleb pounds on the central idea of `anti-fragile' throughout the entire book. While the idea is important and has the depth for a long exposition, it makes the book tedious.  If you want to get an idea of what is this looks like read Taleb's article Learning to Love Volatility in the November 16th 2012 Wall Street Journal before taking on the book.<br /><br />The use of isolated, simplified ideas to illustrate points in the argument make the book easier to understand, but leaves the reader asking - but what if ...  Its hard to argue with a piece of paper.<br /><br />The prose is complex as Taleb often gives you half or two thirds of the idea and assumes you are smart enough to fill in the blanks.  While its possible to do it, this is one reason why the book needs to be read and considered not skimmed and cherry picked.<br /><br />There are a whole new set of Talebisms and terms that people will start introducing into common business speech without understanding what they mean.  People will start to talk about the actions they need to take to make their company anti-fragile, for example, to help it respond better to volatility and in that very statement prove that they neither really read the book or thought about what anti-fragile means.ellectuals and academics, will most likely be taken up by that same audience.

It's been quite a transition from little miss sunshine to the young lady she's morphed into, but I have enjoyed every part of the transition.  I would say that I am undecided on which album is my favorite between Unapologetic and Rated R, but both are at the top of my favorites list.  I would say Music of the Sun is nex in line for my faves, followed by Loud and Tal That Talk, Good Girl Gone Bad and A Girl Like Me.  But this album right here?  This album right here?  Is rocking my world right now.  Love it <3

B008I3QZKU|5.0|It took me a couple weeks to warm up to this album. Initially, I thought there were 3-4 good songs and the rest questionable. Honestly, I'm not sure that I've ever loved any album from its onset. So there's that. Now, however, I'm not sure that I can name a track on this album that I don't love entirely. Let's be honest, The Killers are all about them love songs, but it's still great music. They've evolved so much since their inception and its incredibly present on Battle Born. With this album they've established themselves as my favorite modern rock group. This album is incredibly eclectic, per usual, and feels like the absolute best they're capable of at this point. Also, I love how there's 15 tracks and all of them stellar. None of that 11 track BS.<br /><br />Can't wait to see what they come out with next.

B003V1WXKU|4.0|a little disjointed but very entertaining... Points well made about education in science and math.  I have experienced them in this country and was aghast to see how impractical and not related to the real world the teaching was compared to the education in those subjects I received in Europe
0099428385|5.0|I watched the movie with SJP and Pierce Brosnan and thought it was cute.  I was curious to read the book it was based on and I am glad I did because as usual, the movie left out not only important portions of the story, it really scaled back on the sometimes brutal but refreshing honesty of the author as she assesses her relationship to her husband, her father and her children.  Probably the people involved in making the movie thought the audience would not relate to the main character if she was not totally likeable but in fact, I related to the character written in the book much more because it was so much more honest.  As a mom/wife/career woman with similarly dysfinctional thorny love-hate relationships with my own parents, the book really resonated with me.  And it helped that a lot of it was laugh out loud funny.  I am already in the middle of my second reading.  This is like Bridget Jones all grown up married with kids, but much more raw and honest.
B007HACDLK|3.0|While I am a big Vince Flynn fan and have read most of his books, I did not find this one as interesting as the others.  It's more of a &#34;guy book&#34; as there is too much description throughout the book.  Virginia.

0786714875|5.0|extraordinary but overwhelming.. this is a MUST read but not for the squeamish or those who have no exposure to the harsh realities of the African world.. it's raw, relentless reality and it explains how this blot on the Global Community happened.. it humanizes Rwanda and allows to see the challenges that continent faces
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is my favorite show and it keeps getting better every season. The story line is excellent and the acting really pulls you into it and you feel like you're a part of what is happening.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|I began watching this series when I was 11 years old and instantly fell in love with it. Today is now my 22nd birthday and as I was opening my birthday gift from my husband I found this series set inside. I believe that I actually had tears in my eyes when I saw what was inside. The collection was in perfect condition. This was the best birthday gift I have ever gotten!!
B00129H7VS|5.0|This was an awsome purchase. It's a great set of blue-rays.<br />PQ -5 stars , sound 5 stars, great looking case , great price for 34.99

B00914JWSW|5.0|Love this album.<br />Barbra never lets me down. Own almost every<br />one she has ever done.<br />Recommend to all my family & friends.
B0093FNZT6|3.0|I rated the book a 3 because I believe in life after death and this was supportive of that concept however the story was endlessly repetitive and Dr Alexander lost me and all credibility when he started talking about his friend Susan's ability to contact and communicate with comatose people including him. There were also elements of<br />The Hobbitt and similar books in his descriptions. Ok as a light hearted read but not convincing that he had actually been through the experience or thought there might be a dollar in taking advantage of having been in a coma. I won't be recommending this book to anyone. It is $3 read with a $15 price tag!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I totally enjoy playing this game on my Kindle fire.  I have not had any problems with this app and would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys solitaire.
B002XZ0FWS|5.0|Awesome music, haunting words.  Great music to go to sleep with.  Play often.  I would definitely recommend this music to all.
B0006A9FKA|2.0|I feel as though I was mislead when I bought this DVD. Nowhere did the listing say that this was a &#34;HD DVD&#34; and when it arrived it was not compatable with my DVD player therefore I can't even watch it. Since I purchased it used, it will cost me more than I paid for it to ship it back so I didn't bother. Now I am stuck with a useless HS DVD and I still don't one Shaun of the dead!
B003F9G8B8|5.0|This film was a feel good movie with some action. It was one that I started and I was not sure but then I kept wanting to see the outcome.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm 21 years old, 5 foot 1, and weigh 130 pounds. This may not be a lot to some people, but for being short, it's a little much! I started this video 3 days ago with the intention to get toned, and lose a few pounds. I am very out of shape. I rarely exercise, so doing this was a shock. Day one, I was exhausted, out of breath, and almost passed out. It was so intense and it was level one! I also used 5 pound weights, when I probably should have used less. The next day, I weighed myself, and saw I lost 2 pounds already! I was in such a happy mood, that I decided to jump right up to level 2! Ha well that was a mistake, and I thought level 1 was hard! It was insane! I couldn't do half the moves, but worked out as much as I could! Afterwards, I was soooo sore! I couldn't walk up or down stairs, couldn't move my arms a certain way, etc. I was in such pain, and still am! Now i'm only on day 3, I went back to level 1, and I really see a difference in my body already! My thighs are becoming less flabby. My arms are becoming more muscular. It definitely hurts, but its totally worth it! I am definately sticking to this, and ill hopefuly write back soon when i'm getting more results!<br /><br />Get the dvd! Its less then 10 bucks! Come on!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I do enjoy playing this game but when I get booted out of the room while I am playing is frustrating. So, I don't play as often as I would like. I lost points too when I even got a bingo. I would still recommend the game to my friends, but I would tell them what has happened to me though while playing this game. I don't get alot of bingos either! Which sucks! :(
B006LSZECO|4.0|I do not know under what category to slot this novel.  The narrative is extremely compelling: it grabbed me at the very beginning and held me to the very end.  The main characters are three-dimensional and authentic. The book is a mix of mystery, social commentary and psycho-analysis. Gillian Flynn writes with a lot of passion and enjoyment, and takes the reader along on an unrelenting emotional roller-coaster.  The book is tragi-comic in a sense, with a seriously flawed protagonist for whom the author makes no apologies, and whom she does not judge. One question that remained with me at the end, and for which I did not have a clear answer, was whether there was a message the author wished to convey, and if so, what that message was. Do not read this book for the plot: if you are a fan of whodunnits, it will disappoint you.  Read it for the free-flowing narration, the extremely insightful observations, the authentic characters and the delightfully cynical social commentary.
B0007Q6PBK|5.0|I just love to ply this music when the weather is cold.  I sit and hears it to get relaxed.
B004SGWYW4|5.0|Im not an anime fan, but anime like this will soon convert me. Fun tease anime. Good graphix and plot. Only problem is, I want more......
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn continues to be my favorite author.  &#34;The Last Man&#34; continues the development of the CIA group assembled by Flynn.  We also get a glimpse of the future.  I couldn't put it down.  My only regret is that I read these so quickly I have longer to wait for the next book.  Highly recommended.
B009B50QOU|5.0|Another awesome Greenday Release as expected. These guys have been at it for so long, yet they keep making catchy, cool music.
B003ELOQD4|5.0|This Great rock band delivers once again in this stunning 360 degree view of all their greatest hits.  The sound quality is fantastic and the visuals are stunning.  A must own for any fan of U2 and Live Music...

B008QTVNUI|5.0|My daughter, who is away at college, ordered the first season of Homeland on my Amazon account.<br />A teacher had recommended it, she assured me, knowing I'd be critical of wasting time.<br />After Thanksgiving dinner, I thought I might check out an episode.....<br />by the end of the holiday weekend, I'd watched all 13 episodes.<br />It's a good thing the family had plenty of leftovers.<br />I felt a little bipolar myself.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Emmy awards don't necessarily guarantee that a show is great--there have been plenty of mediocre shows that have won awards over the years but \\"Homeland\\" continues to demonstrate the growth in dramatic adult programming and its growth.<br /><br />A warning for those who want to watch the show--there is nudity, sex, violence and plenty of four letter words. If you're not prepared for that, you won't enjoy the show.<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br />Based on an Israeli TV series, \\"Homeland\\" takes us into the life of a CIA operative Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes)who believes that a recently resurfaced American hostage from Afganistan Sgt.Nicholas Brody (Damien Lewis)may have been turned into a terrorist. Mathison who suffers from bipolar disorder and has kept it secret from her former boss Saul (Mandy Patinkin), believes that information she has from an informant points to Brody as the terrorist. She goes on a crusade to get surveillance on Brody with unintended consequences.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS:<br /><br />Danes, Lewis and the rest of the cast give stellar performances in this intense drama. We get plenty of answers about what happened to Brody and what happened to him overseas.<br /><br />The DVD for the series looks quite nice with a sharp looking transfer. Presented in its original broadcast ratio of 1.78:1, the show has the look of a big screen production.<br /><br />We get English subtitles as well as Spanish and French.<br /><br />Special features aren't as extensive as I would have liked or expected but they are quite good.

B007FG9LIE|5.0|I had no idea what this book was about when I bought it. It started off kinda weird, but the story goes deeper and deeper down a crazy path til the very end. I would love to see this made into a movie some day!<br /><br />If you like sci-fi/mystery/thriller type entertainment then you'll love this book
B003CSV7TK|5.0|This is one of the BEST Christmas movies ever made and should be a MUST SEE for all families to watch together every year!  Kids today will enjoy the colorized version better than the black and white, but either version is wonderful.  The 1994 remake is one of the truest remakes ever that did not lose the true spirit and intent of the original, however, I love with watch BOTH versions every Christmas.  You cannot go wrong with this version, and Amazon.com always delivers as promised! I also really enjoying having Amazon Prime this year!  It is so worth it!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I enjoy playing hope you will also. use the coins to your best advantage. also save the shaker for when it will do the most good enjoy.
B007NESBK2|5.0|As a video producer myself, I appreciate when a DVD video record of anyone's show is captured very well, and this Sade DVD certainly qualifies. Good production values, especially the stage lighting (some of the best I've seen, absolutely Broadway/West End quality) combine with sensitive video direction & editing to produce a wonderful concert experience. I had more fun watching this video than I had in person at a recent Springsteen concert; I'm not comparing Sade's music or her performance  to Mr. Springsteen's, I'm comparing the two production values.<br />Sade's music as performed on this tour was tight, soulful, and humanistic/playful, which you probably know already if you're bothering to read this review. I'm happy that it was captured well.<br />Any Sade fan will love the DVD extras, and I think they're fine, but when all is said and done, a concert DVD is either a truly involving multimedia experience or it isn't. For my money, this one was. Good show, great video. Enjoy it!
B0064U8GYC|5.0|While I like to fancy myself an advanced tech user,  I had zero knowledge of Java.  This book so much better than my professor's lectures.  Colorful, easy to understand, and great for the visual learner.
B008518MOW|5.0|My ordered copy of Men In Black 3, 3D came in Saturday and I got around to watching it today.  I fully expected to see a very poor sequel number 3 as I popped the Blu-Ray 3D disk into my player.<br /><br />WOW!<br /><br />Not so..I thought the story original, the acting great, specially Josh Brolin, who played a younger Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones).  Not a slow minute in the movie..kept my attention all the way through, and that is unusual..I am one of those people who fall asleep during movies!  Loved the surprise at the end of the movie!<br /><br />If you have 3D capabilities, I have to say, the 3D effects in this movie, are even better than in The Avengers, which I thought were superb.<br /><br />I will watch it again in regular Blu-Ray and see how the movie stacks up, visually, to the 3D version.<br /><br />If you collect movies on DVD, and are a MIB fan, GET IT, you won't be disappointed in adding this to your collection.<br /><br />I give this one a wholehearted 5 stars!!  A **fun** movie to watch!<br /><br />MC
B009MF5BXK|5.0|The Expendables 2 is a much better, more complete experience than the first film.  A true throwback to the crazy, hardcore action movies of the late 80's and early 90's.  It doesn't take itself too seriously, and you can see the actors had a fun time making this.  They aren't afraid to make fun of themselves with some great one-liners and references to some of their classic movies of the past.  Visual effects are first rate.  The script and dialogue is not going to win any awards, but it is great fun for the viewers.  If you just go into the movie suspending all sense of reality, you will have a great time watching this movie.  If you are looking for something realistic or dramatic, look elsewhere.
B0056TYT66|5.0|I bought 2 of these for my video editing computers in the studio. I had need to expand my SATA to operate additional hard drives and burners. One thing you need to know! Do not give up when installing this. You need to go to Transcend's site to download the drivers for your particular application. It is relatively simple. My HP's running Windows 7 with Intel i-7's. These computers did NOT mount this card automatically. Install the card, and download drivers and poof! your in! Make sure you have the correct cables to make internal connections as well. I purchased a few sets of these cable to split my power source to supply drives and burners and the like.<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0064HZIT6/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00<br /> You will need these if your computer does NOT have additional power supplies already with in it. Be cautious of your wattage use as well. Your power transformer within your computer will tell you how many watts you have and can apply to various onboard applications. So far for me... they work like a dream!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Great movie,beautifully done...fun for everyone but especially apropos for Baby Boomers.  It was a lovely and authentic view of India.  Loved it!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Love this book so much<br /> Very intense. ive read it twice now. Its a must read. God bless America.<br />Buy it now
2070643026|4.0|This was a comfortable story to read, with fairly simple sentence structure.  The reading level is similar to that of other \\"dime store novel\\" quality stories.<br /><br />Most of the vocabulary makes sense in context if your know the plot from the English version.  I kept my dictionary with me because I'm careful to check all the words that seem unfamiliar.  My daughter, who's more comfortable with guessing, said she didn't really need it.<br /><br />If you liked reading the story in English, you'll enjoy the French version if your vocabulary can handle book length works.
B00338QENI|4.0|It was very interesting and gave a humanistic side to her story.  Some of the medical explanations may be a little too confusing for a non-medical person.
B0083SBMBM|1.0|Most of the time I like Marvel movies alright, they're kinda doofy, but decent... that is until THIS (and Iron Man 2, haha). Ugghhhh. It really sucked. Everything looked really fake, like it looked like some normal people were dropped into a video game (maybe this is because I watched a DVD not BluRay...?) but still, that was super distracting. That was'nt even a big deal though compared to how stupid everything else about the movie was. The acting sucked, the storyline was absent, not a whole lot happened. It was just a series of attempted jokes and then some crap getting blown up. Way too long also, I was almost falling asleep towards the end. I just kinda sat there staring at the tv for a  minute when it was over, pissed at myself for actually watching the whole thing. Not sure how people like this.... my parents thought it was bad too.<br />I love the Xmen movies and usually like this type of show, but it was just too boring.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Very, very little story line.  Nothing but very graphic, descriptive sex.  I got to the point that I wanted to just scream &#34;Can't you just stay off of her one minute!!!&#34;

0307463745|5.0|Excellent, I highly recommend. Sort of a take on the 'Tao' of business - very concise concepts that express the 'fundamental truths' of business. Even more highly recommended for the small business owner or person looking to start their own business.
B004SBBDB2|5.0|Worked the first time I plugged it up, but I did my basic research first as to how your iPod /iPad should be set-up or you'll get frustrated - NOT the cables fault -it will be yours !<br />1) Setting up an 2nd generation iPod - open Settings, Video, set TV Out to Widescreen On & TV Signal to NTSC if you live in US. An iPad will not show these settings until the cable is actually plugged into it ( The path in Settings could be different on the iPad so just play until you find it or look on internet ). For other Apple devices & generations, be sure it is compatible for output. Do your research first !!<br />2) Hooking up the cables in the proper order is NOT hard, FOLLOW the diagram on this site, if you can't, you're an idiot (see other reviews). They fit snug - glad about that. Did it under 1 minute - took me longer to get in & out from behind my TV.<br />3) Hook other end to your iPod which mine is a 2nd generation model. Only negative about the cable is this connection is not as secure as an Apple cable, but I have not had a problem.<br />4) Start your video (correct format ) or slideshow & it should play within a couple of seconds. Video may not play it you start it before plugging in the cable.<br />5) Like the USB part of cable as you can plug a charger into it to keep your iPod charged while playing - that works.<br />6) When you unplug your iPod & then the next time you try to use it & don't get it to work, go to Settings and slide the Widescreen to Off then back to ON.<br />7) Make sure your TV is set to component input.

B008TRUDAS|5.0|So much emotion.. loved it.. I had to actually stop and put down the book because my heart broke for the kids!!  What a GREAT book.  I asked my daughter to read it.
B0084IG7KC|2.0|This is just my opinion but if you have read the book I would not watch this movie. There is so much going on emotionally in the books that just never really makes it to the movie.
B000IZ6FLK|3.0|Christian Bale deserves kudos for his portrayal of this character, which undoubtably is 'all in', but it's a little hard to watch.  If you like suspense, mystery, and drama with a very dark side this movie is for you.
B005LAIGSC|1.0|My review is not about the movie itself, rather the disc. My blu-ray player wasn't connected to the internet and we couldn't figure out why it would work. The menu showed up but it wouldn't play as it just looped back to the main menu. I restarted my blu-ray player with the network connection plugged in a voila, it was a totally different look. Thank you Universal for delivering ads (upcoming blu-ray releases) to the disc's home screen. I am thoroughly unpleased that I have to have a network connection just in order to watch the movie I purchased.
B007MGWBU2|4.0|My wife and I rented this movie and we had a great time watching it. Plus Amy Adams is very pretty.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly is a genius. His writing is always fresh and immediate feeling. The stories and characters are whole and believable.  Loved every minute of this story.
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|Loved this set.  This is my favorite TV show and I never tire of re-watching the episodes over and over.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|fun  easy to use makes using the Fire HD camera a much better experience..Mostly use this to make clients hair photos fun and email back to them  happy with my purchase
B004LROUNG|4.0|Funny, exciting and crazy. My first read by John Grisham. I will definitely read more of his books. Happy reading!
0061765236|1.0|I kept wondering why up to page 95 I was still getting the characters mixed up as to who was who and which couple was the parent of which child?  Was there some deep meaning I missed in giving one of the women a man's name to make it all even more incomprehensible with zero dimensional characters mixed up in a go-nowhere plot? A tragic piece of fluff exploiting a seriously tragic social problem.  Flashlight with dead batteries lost in a black hole.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Best and most addicting free app I've downloaded for my Kindle. Sound effects are realistic, and the prizes are really cute.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|I love it....this bag is way more than I ever expected. I got room for my laptop and my juice boxes!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Needed this in order to get flash player/Dolphin Web browser for Kindle Fire HD.  This was a necessary product to use.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|It is what i thought it was a homage to the old action flicks of the<br />80's I grew up with.
B0029ZA3H4|4.0|The way we do business is changing.  It is all about word of mouth and what you put on internet and blogs.  I have been really obsoleted.  This book really opened up my eyes.
B003U2QHB6|4.0|Love corny comedies and this is one. First one was more family oriented this one a lil tiny more pg13 but not much. After watching this you can't take keanue serious in any other movies
B0058VW36U|5.0|I WOULD PLAY IT ALL DAY IF I COULD!!!!!!!!! I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE AND EVERYONE!!!!!! THANKS FOR BEING SUCH A GREAT APP!!!!!!!!
B0090EJR1K|2.0|While I do like cornball Humor this is debasing and lacks creativity. One part I actually liked and I waited the whole movie to see it
B009LUCPWQ|3.0|It's very exciting to hear the first new album from the reunited Rumour, but it doesn't come close to the level of their original albums. That being said, it's a great excuse for them to tour, and live I'm sure it's going to be the GP show we've all wanted to see for decades! So buy the album and support the ongoing reunion! (and also get familiar with the handful of these songs you know they're going to play live!)

0743454537|5.0|If you've already seen the movie, it is nothing like the book.  I thought the movie was great until I read the book.  The book gives different spins, but I loved it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Fantastic read, could not put it down:) I  Would highly recommend reading this book, it will have you in the edge of your seat!
B001P9EQH8|3.0|Bought as an accessary per website recommandation. Found out that it was really not needed and returned. No comments on quality.
B000JMKTLO|2.0|THIS BOOK WAS SO DISAPPOINTING AFTER READING GONE GIRL.  THE CHARACTERS IN THIS BOOK DID NOT DRAW ME IN AND I FELT THIS WAS A SEXUAL, GOTHIC MYSTERY.  EVIDENTLY, NOT A BOOK FOR ME.  I DO HOPE THE AUTHOR CAN WRITE AS SHE DID IN GONE GIRL AND I THINK SHE MIGHT GAIN A GRANDER AUDIENCE
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love the book and wasn't able to put it down so went ahead and bought the other too which was well worth it.
B000SEGUDE|2.0|I think the story would have been better if the language did not get so complicated.  i love reading but, i also like a book to flow easily and the verbage and story did not flow well
0385535147|4.0|Is there more to the Racketeer ?  Perhaps book #2 ?  It left the reader totally up-in-the-air.  What is going to happen once the book ends is left unclear ----<br />Great spin, but not a very satisfying finish.  It's as if Grisham became bored with his own story and decided to end it on a wondering note.  I hope he writes another \\"chapter\\" to it so he can figure out what happens from then on !!
B004EPZ0AC|3.0|Opened the package and found that the jewel case was cracked - I had to replace the case with one of my music cd cases. Hair inside the case and fingerprints on top side of the DVD (Im a particular person dont like prints on cds, mirrors, ect)
B009YP9L7U|5.0|For free, I decided to give this story a try. I expected it to be predictable. It was not. There were a few 'awwww' moments that grabbed onto my heart and refused to let go. I was able to determine exactly when he 'fell' for her and I loved that. Both people not looking for love but looking for so much more.....found themselves at crossroads in life. From there, it just was a beautiful story of having strength and faith in yourself and others. Loved Connor....he is so protective of her & that I just loved. I would have paid $2.99 to read. Would love to know where they go from here.............
B00008EY65|5.0|I love Hellboy 1 & 2, bought both because you cant watch one without watching the other! LOVE LOVE LOVE
0385535147|1.0|I only finished it because I bought it.  Plot does not make sense.  Main character is very shallow  waste of money and my time.
B001F7MSFM|5.0|I bought this with Hellboy 1, dont buy the first one without buying the second. Action packed movie, great movie
B004U8VWLE|3.0|This is really a psychological movie that takes one into the thinking of someone whose thinking is not aligned with reality.  The problem is that the movie actually jumps right into that without the viewer really knowing what is going on, so what you think is happenning is not exactly right.  Its quite well done, but disturbing, and I'm a psychologist.  I'm also amazed that its rating is R - I must be out of touch with the rating systems, but there is a sex scene that I would say would be far too explicit for an underage child to watch (and lots of people let their under 17 kids watch R rated movies), so viewers beware, and pre-screen if your kids are going to watch it.  Again, this movie is a well done, but its the kind of thing that can haunt you for a while if you spend some time thinking about it
B0001O3YD0|5.0|Again, I love Vin Diesel's movies, from Fast and the Furious to XxX. Hes an amazing actor. Gotta buy this!
B0018OIK0E|3.0|This movie had it's moments. British humor isn't always for me but there were some funny parts. If you like zombie movies check it out, not the best but not a waste of time either.
B0002Y69NG|4.0|I love The Matrix movies. This is the best deal youre going to find anywhere. Only thing I dont like is the bulky case. Other than that, best deal around
015206057X|5.0|This is a great book for bedtime and the kids easily memorize the book so they can &#34;read&#34; to you.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Would not have missed this book,  and look forward to book three,  but the first was much better in my opinion;  the older generation,  although they appear,  were better portrayed in the earlier book.  But you should read it!
B001FB55MG|5.0|This shipped super quick, the price was great and it looked like the dvd hadn't even been removed from its case before. Going to be a great Christmas gift, thank you so much
B007THA4FI|5.0|Think a little less raunchy language could have been just as effective, but I loved and adored the characters and it was a super book.  A little hard to get into, so stick with it.
1401937519|5.0|This book arrived before the promised shipping date and was in great condition.  As for the contents of the book, I recommend it to everyone as it is a &#34;life changer.&#34;
B0002DXEPI|1.0|I have to send this one back it was not formatted correctly on the disc to work. I have tried it on 5 different DVD players. I will be returning it and while there is the option for money back there is not for a new product. I was really excited to watch this movie.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It was a bit different than other books I have read, but change is good sometimes and this was one of those times. I'll look for more from Jamies McGuire.
B009IAIC5I|5.0|A must for any IRON MAIDEN fan to collect all 8 of the 2012/2013 Picture LP re-issues in a nice gatefold sleeve.
B00846REIS|5.0|I searched for authors that wrote stories like 50 Shades and really hit the jackpot with Sylvia Day. I like her books better, and will continue to read her work!
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|I don't like the games where you have to go back and forth to find items to use, but this is not too tedious.  It has very good graphics and nice music.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Sylvia Day is one of the best authors out there. Her characters are great and her stories pull you into them.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book is a little different,from the forth coming movie I would think in which takes place in the far east. The story is graphic,just like anything to do with zombies,anyway I'm about halfway reading it and its a very interesting story,very different but a good story line thanks to Max Brooks.If you like zombie movies or that subject,for sure pick this book up,cant go wrong on this one!
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I've read and enjoyed all the HP series books. I read them after seeing this movie. The movie was very magical and enchanting that I decided to read the young adult book at my age of 24. I'm now 36 years old and am currently reading the eBooks.<br /><br />I've seen all the movies on the big screen. And the last few became a required family viewing (Mom, cousins, Aunt, etc). After countless waiting and 7 movies, I was pleased with the movie series. I saw Deathly Hallows Part 2 at my local theaters Thursday opening night at midnight (2nd lifetime movie I saw for opening midnight showing). The movies are brilliant.<br />As a Harry Potter fan, I enjoyed watching these movies countless times.<br /><br />Harry Potter is a very charming orphaned boy who finds out he can do magic. He then goes to this amazing school called Hogwarts. A school even I wish I could attend to. Harry Potter bless you.<br /><br />The actors have matured throughout this series. They've developed their skills and really perform well for their audience. Daniel, Emma and Rupert have really done well.<br /><br />The product DVD is quite good. I've got the cardboard cover 2 disc edition. I recommend both product and the movie series.
0743270754|5.0|This book gives interesting and useful background based on diaries and correspondence between Lincoln and his Cabinet that gives depth to his politcal genious as well as the character of this &#34;rival&#34; cabinet members.  It fills in a lot of blank spaces that one misses in the study of Lincoln alone without his contemporary framers of his administration.  Modern politicians are manipulators, while Lincoln was one who deeply knew his contemporaries and appealed to their highest values and ideals to reach the political concensis that made his administrtion great.  I fear that we will never again see the likes of Lincoln in the White House, as incumbants of that office are mere champaigning rock stars and manipulators who no longer know how to deal with their contemporaries in good faith.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I originally bought this book in paperback - it must have weighed 5lbs... So, I found out that I could download the Kindle to my Netbook - that I can read from.  Sure beats lugging around this huge book.<br /><br />I loved how I could purchase a book on Amazon and it immediately appears on my PC Kindle - for Half the price - Awesome!!!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|The beginning may perplex you, but once you sink your teeth into this adult fairy tale for library loving historians, it will carry you along where you really did not expect to go. Vivid characters pop up all along the way and when you get to the end - you are definitely ready for more...and guess what?  There is a sequel.  Thank goodness.  Details all along the way, but no icky teeth.  Our hero is a yoga practicing academic book collector, which is not really what one expects, but is so fun. Our witch is reclusive and has baggage, and is NOt what anyone thinks a witch really is.  You just have to read it and get hooked.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|What  a wonderful. Tale. I could feel and hear Richard Parker as he growled and stalked about the lifeboat. I will read this book a second time.

0312641893|5.0|reviewed on 10/14/12 on blog<br /><br />My thoughts:<br /><br />ok, first off wow. This is by far my favorite twist EVER on Cinderella. I mean a cyborg? hell, yes. My only problem with this book is that i have to wait for the next installment in the series. I cannot believe it has taken me so long to read it. i mean it was good. I loved the characters. they were so fresh. I mean, sure the evil stepmother concept was not new, but come on, you have to admot even she was complex ad not all bad. i mean, yeah she was mostly bad... but not all bad. lol.<br /><br />the characters. I genuinely loved both of the main characters in the story. Cinder was not incredibly whiny like some of the other heroines i have read about int he past. She was insecure and Kai was just so charming. haha. get it. but not in a superficial- shallow- i just met you for the first time and i love you -disney- type way. lol. If that made any sense at all. ;)<br /><br />I loved Cinder's android sidekick. and i do not wish to spoil the book for anyone and if i keep going i may spew forth spoilers. But seriously, people. read this book.<br /><br />It is am awesome concept. I mean, there is more to this book than a shallow love story. The love story is not shallow, i did not mean like that. i am saying that there is more to this book than just a prince and a poor girl. this book is so- for lack of a better word- awesome/cool/new/weird. and i love it.<br /><br />-----------i wrote the previous part of the review when i was on page 336 of 387....thought id try something new with my review. lol<br />and now.........<br /><br />OMAGOSH this book is amazing. oh, the ending was so good. i cannot wait to see what happens next! ah! this book is sad, cute, funny, weird, and just so dang interesting. ! :D :D :D :D :D love it. &lt;3
B001RIY4WE|5.0|very very good price for this movie, jeje my son love it!!<br /><br />best regards from chile<br /><br />antonio concha<br /><br />saludos XD
B0073LWEXK|4.0|it was a decent game. it had some twists and turns that were entertaining.  Kind slow paced which is probably nice depending on what you were looking for
1450400957|4.0|A terrific lesson in anatomy. Great to see what muscles you're using when you're working out. Plus great workout tips.
B007K3JCAE|5.0|Thank you for the extremely fast delivery and the incredible price! This is another film I was not able to see in the theatre, however, I sure enjoyed it at home on the big screen! Definitely as good, if not maybe better, than the first one!!
B0073LWEXK|4.0|This game has nice graphics which I love. The game play is fairly straightforward unlike other games of this type that I have played. I really liked the addition of the hint guide because it was nice not to have to exit to find a help guide online when I was stuck. However I did get through the game fairly quickly. Wish it was a little longer.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|My thanks to the seller for such a timely delivery! I purchased this product at an excellent price. The quality was certainly there. The movie itself was different than I had expected, since I did not see the movie in the theatre, and this was a new twist to the old story. VERY well done. Happy to add to my movie collection!
B004SUWR2C|4.0|Game is clear and crisp.  Moves right along. Has appropriate sounds for the different actions.Is easy to use and easy on the eyes. I really like it.

B00804W4Z2|5.0|I will never have enough Swing Out Sister, they put a spell on me since the original release of &#34;It's Better To Travel&#34;. I will never regret the fact that living in this part of the world makes it hard to get all their catalogue.. I wish they would release more videos, that is my biggest disappointment.<br />Now, in regards to the album, it contains most of the magic of the original release, with a small change on the bonus tracks that it contained them, passing one of them to the bonus CD,  but still there, so no harm done.<br />The booklet contains very interesting info and memories, and the sound is definitely improved.<br />And about the tracks of the bonus disc: simply sublime: a most for SOS fans.<br />SOS: go back to the studio! Yours is the most loyal fan base!

B007FG9LIE|5.0|I read this entire book in one night.  It was just one of those books you couldn't wait to see what happens next.  The end was a little disappointing, but all in all it was a good book.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I read book one and two in just under a week, some, I hear read all three in two days...<br />I bought these books to read on vacation in Maui and they were the perfect selection, a great escape read in a great escape place!  By the pool, on the beach, in the morning with coffee on the balcony, Christian and Anastasia did not disappoint!
0545265355|5.0|Loved these books! Easy read and enjoyable. I couldn't put them down after starting the first. Read all 3 in 4 days! Better then the movie!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|App is easy to use and works great to make pictures better. Highly recommended for people who use the camera on the phone.
0062206281|5.0|Another brilliantly woven novel by Carlos Ruiz Zafon. Love how you can read these books in any order and it still all ties together. Excellent.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Well for a four disc combo at $19.95, you pretty much have everything that you would ever want to view it. It has the Blu-ray, digital disc, DVD, and the music download. Great value.
B0056BU3I2|5.0|I have seen this movie before and liked it, but got it for a gift because of all the goodies that it comes with. The price and fast shipping was great. Both the DVD and Blu Ray work and look great.
1439152802|5.0|Kate Morton has written another excellent novel. The main character, Laurel, witnesses her mother kill a man when she was a child. Fast forward to present day when Laurel, a grown woman, has traveled back home to be with her dying mother. The past comes back to haunt Laurel and she decides that she needs closure and to know the truth of what happened on that fateful day. As she digs into her mother's past after finding an old photo, Laurel learns her mother has kept secrets, ones she could never have imagined. The chapters shift between time periods as the mystery unfolds. The novel is almost 500 pages but was a real page-turner, with lots of twists and kept me engrossed through to the end. About 3/4 way through, I thought I had it all figured out, but I was wrong. The author reveals one surprise after another, saving a last surprise for the end - never saw it coming and it was a good one. This is an impressive family saga of love, betrayal, greed and forgiveness.

B009KHDT0C|3.0|It was entertaining but I wouldn't re watch it or buy the blue ray.  It was worth the rental though.
B001F12J0C|5.0|Great action movie series.  I've always loved this series when they were on screens.  I'm glad I have all of them and can watch them back to back.
B009VB7P6G|4.0|I have always been a Disney fan but I was pretty reserved about whether or not I'd like this movie. Well, I thought it was really adorable and the story was decent.  it was no Beauty and the Beast, but it was enjoyable.

B00338QENI|5.0|A wonderful story about Black America in the 40s &50s as well as the birth of medicine as we know it.  Very enjoyable and captivating read!
B004GUSG4M|2.0|This book was very slow to start.I was half way through the book before it became interesting.I did want to finish the book to the end,as the story became more mysterious.
B008UZ7MUI|3.0|I am reviewing only the 3D aspect of the film. The movie itself is worth at least 4 stars for me but the 3D is rather non-existent.<br /><br />I am glad I got this movie for $15 though it was hard find. Apparently, Amazon has this movie listed twice on Amazon in 3D form, the one at the top of the search list costs over $40 whereas this one costs only $15. The thing is, both include the 3D film, 2D Blu ray, DVD, and a digital copy.<br /><br />As for the 3D in this film, it is sometimes apparent in a few scenes but its really a blink and you'll miss kind of thing. I adjusted the depth on my blu ray player and it improved the quality a little bit, but not by much. Compared to Part 2, the 3D appears non-existent or at least it doesn't improve upon the movie.<br /><br />Its worth buying only in the $15 selection. I honestly wouldn't pay more than what you would pay for a regular combo.
B006GHA9VQ|4.0|Love Never Dies--the Melbourne, Australia, production--is a beautiful musical with amazing costumes, sets, design, and production. This is all first-rate with the highest production values. Lloyd Webber's music is simply wonderful. Extremely melodic, romantic, and beautiful. I am going to buy the Blu-ray version just for the music and production. The music is characterized by LW's recognizable style, rhythms, and orchestration. He captures all the human emotions perfectly with lovely melodic and tonal music of the highest craftsmanship. I am truly in awe of his musical genius.<br /><br />Although the story of Love Never Dies follows by ten years that of Phantom of the Opera, and this has been described as the sequel to Phantom by LW himself, LND is not Phantom II. The Phantom acts and appears differently here, and the characters' situations and motivations are different. This does not bother me in the least. This musical can stand on its own, and its music certainly does.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I cannot give this musical five stars. What were Lloyd Webber and his librettist thinking? Why was this story set in Coney Island, New York, rather than the obvious choice of London. Aren't there plenty of carnival and sideshow performers there? Coney Island seems to me to be a remote and uncharacteristic setting for romantic musicals. I read that this musical got poor reviews and its Broadway production was canceled (although the Australian production I viewed was a revision and quite excellent). (SPOILER ALERT for what follows; details can be learned in the Wikipedia article if you wish.) The reviews and cancellation were wise decisions, since the worst aspect of this musical by far is that the ending is insufferably sad. Believe me, no one wants to come away from a musical that has this ending. Even though there is a moment of touching consolation for the Phantom at the very end, it is simply cruel to subject the protagonist (and us) to so much unwanted tragedy. What musical theater-going customer wants to pay to experience such sadness and subsequent depression? Lloyd Webber is not Verdi. He should save the tragedy for kings, queens, princes, princesses, and other classical noble figures so we lesser mortals can achieve some sort of catharsis through their tragic ends. Perhaps he thought he was composing an opera instead of a musical. In the nineteenth century, some famous operas were revised by impresarios to have happier endings to better attract the public. Although these operas are thankfully not performed with these endings today, I can see why the popular theater-going public would prefer endings that reduce the tragic and increase the romantic, and I agree. Lloyd Webber should take note.
B009HELT3C|4.0|My wife and I rented the movie with some friends, and it was a fun movie to watch.  Not too serious, and great sit down, munch on popcorn adventure in my opinion.  Will Smith, Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin, and the entire cast did an excellent job, and the costumes/effects were great.  I personally think the big push for physical costumes and effects paid off huge.  This will be on my wish list for Christmas.
0345803485|1.0|This is a book for women who are essentially fantasizing a submissive sexual relationship with higher status, assertive, even aggressive, men. There is no women empowerment here, sorry. Personally I prefer to watch a real porn movie, I waste a lot less time that way and it feels more honest.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|I was hoping for an ending that went beyond the horrific story line of children/teens killing other children/teens - what was its redeeming social value?  Certainly not as entertainment for parents of kids!<br /><br />David Drake<br />Des Moines, Iowa
B0083EW97W|3.0|I love John Mayer, don't get me wrong.  He is a wonderfully talented singer, songwriter, and blues player but this cd doesn't really showcase all of his talents.  There were only a few songs on this cd that I really liked, the rest were mediocre.
B00957T6X6|5.0|A song of Ice and Fire Series A Game of Thrones is one of the best written series I have read to date.
0763644765|5.0|this book is so ridiculously cute and so very simple... we have the Bath Time! book by this same author and it's equally as cute.  Just a heads-up for price-shoppers:  these two books are almost always available at places like Home Goods, Marshall's, etc. for a few dollars cheaper.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Harlequin introduces its new contemporary romance KISS collection with a story by Mira Lynn Kelly.<br /><br />What's a couple to do when they wake up married after a wild night of adventures? Yes, it obviously involved alcohol and sex, but Kelly has chosen to play up the characters rather than the carnal details. The result is a humorous, yet tender look at the value placed on marriage and parenthood.<br />Megan wants a baby, but marriage wasn't on her agenda. Connor has his hands full convincing her that a partnership is best for all concerned.<br /><br />Waking Up Married is a quick read that doesn't require deep thinking or analysis. It's just a fun and flirty novel that offers up romance just this side of naughty. If it catches your attention, you can look forward to four new stories a month in the KISS collection.
034580404X|5.0|Several of my friends told me I HAD to read these books. I am not a big romance novel type of girl, but I finally gave in. Two words- oh. my.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I admit I've become addicted to this series on AMC and am so excited I have been able to find a good price on the DVDs.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|enjoyable story line, predictable in places but not annoyingly so. especially fun if you grew up playing the games and watching the movies referenced in the book.
B004SGWYVA|4.0|I came to the Blue-Ray section to review because of all the the insta-streaming hate. Although I have seen plenty of zombie movies and such, this actually put a chill up my spine at first. The casting is great, especially for a dub.  And the story line along with all of the characters is very strong.  My one complaint however is the thing one would have guessed... perversion....I have seen enough anime to get the gist of it all, but the amount put into this film was nearly outrageous and the reason why I am dropping a star off of this great series.
B005D4YGTY|5.0|Extremely confortable (I have done back packing wearing them), fresh, durable, nice looking, and safe (your toes are nicely covered). This is my second pair: the first one lost it's sole after six years of almost daily use.
B007HACDLK|3.0|More convoluted than his earlier Mitch Rapp novels, but if you accept all of the carnage and complementing subplots, it's an OK read and it fills my quota of brainless fiction for the time being.

B0047WJ12K|5.0|Great story, amazing production/visual effects. I just saw this for the first time and am kicking myself for not seeing it sooner.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|love this game. my daughter won't stop playing it. great fun. I even play sometimes myself. love those ponies. a
0395389496|5.0|This book is a must for every home at Christmastime!  I read it to my son last week for the fist time.  He has seen the movie many times, but I wanted to share the book with him as well.  The illustrations are fabulous, and they make the story just so much even more magical.  You need this book for your family.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Overall, the writing is bad. For a teenage prodigy, Charlie writes like an a 8 year old, and given that it's a book, it should've gone in more detail about some of the more serious topics in the book. The movie by far was more earnest and warmer than the book, but its still a great read.
B008BYXQJY|5.0|Lots of fun and high energy! Listen to it almost every morning.  So many songs that are great to hear on the morning drive!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I may wake up to that awful BERP BERP BERP BERP... of an alarm but least I always get a great night's rest with my ambient thunderstorms.
B0070Y46UY|2.0|This book took a long time to go nowhere. If you like reading fanciful prose about an imagined adventure killing and consuming a whole array of living beings, this is for you. I could do without.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|Love this album,.. not really an In This Moment fan in the past,. but love this one.  Its Evanescense meets strapping young lad.
B004M5HUXE|4.0|I was fascinated by the hype over Fifty Shades of Grey and the last time I remember this much interest over an erotic book was in the Sixties with Lady Chatterley's Lover so I decided to reread it.  I found the book extremely well written, wonderful development of characters and amazed that a man wrote this book over 50 years ago and probably had a better insight into women's sexual psyche than most men today.  A wonderful classic read.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|very cool photo editing app. tons of options and choices to play around with. Great for fixing red eye, blemishes, color adjustments and filters. Recently stopped saving photos on my transformer prime tab. Would be 5 stars otherwisw
B009VB97EY|2.0|This could've had more of a story line behind it. Why did they have an ugly girl as the main actress? It makes it a bit unbelievable with Channing in it but aside from that, I was trying to figure out how they \\"fell in love\\" by the very few times they even hung out!? It made it seem quite unrealistic and to be honest, I was hoping there was more to it than just his dancing.
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|too much specifically graphic violence.  Less would have been more.  Story, actors, and acting are outstanding.  Wouldn't recommend for children at all.
0316069426|5.0|greatest crime fiction writer living today. every book may not have the perfect ending--but the ride he takes you on before you get there is second to none. Harry Bosch is an iconic literary character.

0439023513|1.0|I liked the Hunger Games, but I wish I'd skipped the second two books. The first book has just enough closure at the end, you could probably be okay.  The second book isn't terrible, but it does not have closure, it leaves you hanging, and it propels you right into book 3.<br /><br />I hated book 3.<br /><br />SPOILERS BELOW:<br />--<br />--<br />--<br /><br />A WASTE: One of the fascinating things to me about Book 1 was the way it made me wonder about our own society's fascination with reality TV and violent entertainment.  It made me think of \\"Survivor\\", the Roman Colosseum, of British colonies, of slavery, and the way we follow the deaths of our celebrities.  It was exaggerated, but it seemed like an interesting commentary on us as a society.  It was also a good read, suspenseful, creative, and full of interesting characters.<br /><br />I enjoyed the major characters, but I really wondered about Cinna, the news folk, the people in the Capitol, the people in other districts, the government structure, and so on. How did those people tick?  How could they support these kids -- and watch them die?  How do you become a fashion designer for the games?  Why?<br /><br />There were many other intriguing moral, philosophical, and social issues raised by the book.<br /><br />Unfortunately, books 2 & 3 seemed to turn President Snow and President Coin into cartoon-like villians and let all the other people off the hook. This seemed to conflict with the fact that the games were 75 years old, and that the viewers had enough power to stop Peeta and Katniss from committing a dual suicide with the berries. These facts suggest larger societal forces that go beyond Snow. But in books 2 & 3, Snow and Coin were suddenly responsible for everything. By focusing so heavily on District 13, I think the truely intersting story of the Capitol was wasted.<br /><br />The main characters suddenly changed beyond recognition, and the side characters were lacking in depth and many of them were killed off. Too many to really keep up with.<br /><br />I think that Collins started out with a good set of ideas.  I am not sure why she abandoned the Capitol and her initial characters.<br /><br />POORLY WRITTEN and SILLY:<br /><br />I started getting distracted when President Snow showed up at Katniss's house in book 2. I did not understand Snow's fixation on Katniss.  The whole bit about the berries starting the entire revolution was far-fetched. It could have been the straw that broke the camel's back, but obviously there were big problems --problems much bigger than Katniss's berries.<br /><br />In 70+ years of Hunger Games, no other contestants had ever fallen in love? Or pretended to? Or cared a bit about each other?<br /><br />Furthermore, Snow could have handled Katniss --with all the tools at his disposal (cameras, his knowledge of her sneaking out, any contrived or trumped up accusation, one of his poisons, an accident). But why waste so much energy on her?  His obsession with her seemed childish.<br /><br />I kept thinking of the scene in Austin Powers--between Dr. Evil and Scott:<br /><br />Dr. Evil: Scott, I want you to meet daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers<br />Scott Evil: What? Are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?<br />Dr. Evil: I have an even better idea. I'm going to place him in an easily escapable situation involving an overly elaborate and exotic death.<br />---<br />Dr. Evil: All right guard, begin the unnecessarily slow-moving dipping mechanism.<br /> [guard starts dipping mechanism]<br />Dr. Evil: Close the tank!<br />Scott Evil: Wait, aren't you even going to watch them? They could get away!<br />Dr. Evil: No no no, I'm going to leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, I'm just gonna assume it all went to plan. What?<br /> Scott Evil: I have a gun, in my room, you give me five seconds, I'll get it, I'll come back down here, BOOM, I'll blow their brains out!<br /> Dr. Evil: Scott, you just don't get it, do ya? You don't.<br />---<br /><br />After I got this image in my head, everything just started to seem really stupid.  Why the pods?  Why the really complicated death traps? Why did everybody think Katniss was so much more important that she would be in such a situation?  And who would waste that much money on the Hunger Games? Unless the whole society was really economically supporting it. And why would the rebels spend so much energy--risk so many lives--to get their \\"symbol\\" out but leave the other 50% of the symbol behind in a way that would weaken Katniss? Why couldn't the rebels rescue both Katniss and Peeta?  Why would the game designer of want out?<br /><br />Why could Cinna (a clothing designer from the Capitol) be so heroic, while all the Victors seemed to be falling apart?<br /><br />Why did President Snow bomb everybody -except all the people Katniss cared about?  Especially if he wanted to \\"get\\" to her.  Snow wasn't convinced she loved Peeta.  So why didn't he just take Gale, Prim, and Katniss's mom in for questioning and wisk them off to the Capitol before (or instead) of bombing?  No--he bombed the whole district, but conveniently missed all the key people.<br /><br />And why did Katniss need a soldier's uniform by Cinna?<br /><br />Instead of really exploring the Capitol, we were forced into \\"District 13.\\"  The book suddenly reminded me of \\"A Wrinkle in Time,\\" when they go to the plant controlled by It.  Or \\"Watership Down\\" --but those books had already been written. They didn't need to be rehashed.  And it was a way of avoiding what I really wanted to see--the way everyday folk lived in the Capitol--the way the people of the Capitol would react to Katniss's destruction of the Arena.<br /><br />I really didn't like that Peeta got his mind so messed up, but if you are going to do that do it right.  It was handled in a very sloppy and way. It was far from compelling.<br /><br />As many others have noted, many of the charaters changed significantly.  I didn't recognize them.

She routinely took on guilt for the bad actions of the Capitol, and was unable to see that her inability to stop the cruel, calculated, and powerful forces of the Capitol was not something she should feel responsible for.  Do your best, hope for the best, but lay off the guilt trips, Katniss.  It wasn't her idea to invent the Hunger Games, to start a revolution, to fight for her life, or to fight for her family.

B008BGNMZU|4.0|Easy listen if you love Jazz. I have all the fourPlay CDs and wanted to add this to my collection
B0032UYFA6|5.0|excellent characterization of all cast members; cleverly written; viewers have to watch every second to get the subtle plot twists!
B003O86FMW|5.0|One of the greatest books in have ever read. I got a good feeling I'm going to but the others and read them and this one again as well
6305313687|5.0|Couldn't have been happier. Thanks again for excellent quality and service. An absolutely excellent way to complete the holidays for my family and myself
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Personally, this book keeps your attention throughout the story. There are many twists and turns, and the characters are still irresistibly funny and lovable. I am also glad that Annabeth had a chance to tell her story, and in the way that fit Annabeth's personality and smarts. This perfectly fallowed and up staged the previous books in the series. It did not disappoint and I'm so anxious for the next book!!!!!! Cliff hanger warning!!!!! :D
B0089BSOPA|5.0|As a huge Halloween Fan, I couldn't wait to get this in my collection and is didn't disappoint. Great extra additions to in this dvd so worth the buy
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Over the years, I've bought at lest a hundred Firefly DVD sets to give away as gifts. Every time it goes on sale, I pick up the maximum.
B00122S688|5.0|&#34;Gris Gris&#34; is a distinct sound that I find a little spooky and quite entertaining. Nobody sounds like Dr. John and this is in a class all by itself. I definitely recommend it.
B00881VLCE|1.0|it's a bit simplistic, and the solving image is upside-down...BUT, it gives me a few minutes to finish a simple, stress-free little puzzle before getting back to other tasks.  tx!<br /><br />update, one day later..app won't load, so i deleted it...weird.
B0094U0RJQ|5.0|This is Bob Dylan sounding his age, unfortunately, but it's still Bob Dylan, and nobody can write or perform the way he does. Personally, I'm a never-say-die fan of this man (because he IS the man) and I'm not going to review anything lower than 5 stars for Bob Dylan, ever. That being said, this is a solid album that has some really good songs on it. I suggest that you listen to the MP3 samplers before you buy if you're uncertain. This review is biased but at least I'm putting in my vote. The man is a genius.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Great book - keeps you guessing all the way to the end!  I would highly recommend it - couldn't put it down!
B0065CCM76|4.0|and that includes Metallica! I like quite a few of the songs on this album but I truthfully have to say I bought it for &#34;Turn the Page.&#34; I relate to the song and I love the emotion Bob Seger puts into it - there's nobody who can touch him on this one. Of course, you also get &#34;Fire Lake,&#34; &#34;Against the Wind,&#34; &#34;Beautiful Loser,&#34; &#34;Downtown Train,&#34; &#34;Katmandu,&#34; and a plethora of other classic Seger tunes, so it's definitely worth it. I don't like the more 'pop' sounding songs that got way too much radio play but that's just me; you might love them. A lot of people do. (This is a two disc set.)
B00005JMXX|5.0|This film may achieve more than it intended much sooner than they had hoped because of recent climate changes in the northern hemisphere. That said, I must say that I avoid recent disaster films because they follow too many characters which leads to thinly drawn, cartoonish lampooning of the science fiction genre. Some reviewers find the dialogue trite in this offering, I do not care in this instance. As tired as the plot is, it is an unforgettable, suspenseful ride to bring a dire warning to those leaders who are slow to act. The special effects are awesome and do much to notch up the fright factor. In between the juvenile pining and romantic tugs at the heart, courage, stoicism, competence and ingenuity have their moments. Because the director's heart and intelligence finds a way to warn us and prepare us for a hopeful way out in the end, this \\"Day After\\" delivers a Superman punch to our value system with no sugar-coating. Strictly a sobering, exciting ride to completion with a G-rating. Special kudos for practical science.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I highly recommend for people who enjoy  stories that involve time travel. I only wish it was longer to spend more time with the characters.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|The first two books (the first especially) were very good and told a story of tragedy and hope.  This last book conveyed confusion and a lack of sensibility.  Not as enjoyable as the other two.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|Pentatonix  PTXmas - I wish there were more than 6 songs. Loved it. I love hearing groups that do their own sound effects. They harmonize so well.  I would recommend it to any person that likes vocal groups.

B0051UP5NQ|3.0|I am a Kindle Fire HD newbie, so I may have done something wrong.  But I found that the program to be very slow and seemed to slow my Kindle down a whole lot.  So, I moved it to the cloud and that seemed to fix that.  I have yet to use it, so a review at this time would not be feasible.
B006DHAT5K|5.0|I really liked this movie and knew that I just had to own it! It's a sweet and hilarious take on romance with lovable characters. Definitely recommend for anyone who is a sucker for romcoms.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|THE WHOLE CD IS AWESOME!!!  EVERY SONG!! THE DUETS ARE AMAZING!!!V ROD AND CELO GREENS VOICE MESH TOGETHER LIKE MAGIC!  ELLA FITSGEARLD AND ROD TOGETHER, BEAUTIFUL!!!  I PLAYED IT ON A 400 MILE ROAD TRIP THERE AND BACK, NEVER GOT TIRED OF IT!!
0385486804|4.0|It's a pretty good book, slow start in the beginning but it's not that bad.  I have to read it for class so it was kinda forced upon but it's still worth a good read.<br /><br />Only problem with it, is not the book itself.  The shipping of it kinda blowed.  I had ordered on a Friday with the express shipping or whatever, specifically needing it by the middle of the week roughly, and I had received it the Saturday after.<br /><br />But other than that, the book's great! :)
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|It's a shame great, relatable, quality series like Freaks and Geeks or My So-Called Life have to be cut short. These are real people in the real world with problems we all face while young, unlike shows like Gossip Girl or the likes. Don't get me wrong, I like those shows, but they can never actually impact a persons life, for those character are pretty much unreal.<br /><br />My So-Called life is a personal favorite, and I recommend it to everyone. Despite being almost a decade since its cancellation, it's still current and relevant. Shows you the things we have to deal with in high school, without pushing agendas or trying to sugar-coat them in any way.<br /><br />Definitely one of the best teen dramas ever made.
1607066017|5.0|I've been reading comic books for about 20 years. I am not exaggerating in the slightest when I tell you that this is the best comic book I have read in my entire life. I've been a huge fan of Brian K. Vaughan, largely in part to his talent in creating new and engaging characters in a comic industry that has become a little bit stagnant. His work on Runaways and The Hood really intrigued me, because he has a knack for making over-the-top characters seem incredibly believable and real with his dialogue and exposition. He has a talent that few, if any comic writers can claim to equal.<br /><br />  I picked up this trade on a whim, simply because it had Vaughan's name on it, (and who am I kidding? It was cheap!) I flipped it open and experienced the first page, which literally made me burst into laughter. Comics just don't DO that very often! I was laughing out loud in my local shop, and I'm sure that I looked like a loon, but I didn't care. I immediately purchased this book and headed back to my house to read it. I read it three times in a row; I could not believe the caliber of book I was reading.<br /><br />  Vaughan has created a universe that is completely ridiculous. I mean that in a good way. He has introduced to us a world that is so sickening, gorgeous, bewildering, and imaginative all at the same time. This story is essentially Star Wars meets Romeo and Juliet. It's such an injustice to categorize it like this, as that description doesn't do it justice at all, but it's as close as I can come off the cuff. Now, as you'd expect, the writing is superb. Vaughan has made this world so out of the ordinary, and yet somehow so relatable with his grounded dialogue and narration carrying the story along. Vaughan's writing in this book is maybe his best yet, but he's not even the best part of Saga...<br /><br />  The real star of this book is Fiona Staples. I guarantee you that even if you hate the story, you won't be able to keep your jaw un-dropped when looking at thesimply BEAUTIFUL work by Staples. She is the best artist in the industry. Hands down, her work is always awe-inspiring. One panel will be the most tender, human moment you have ever seen in a panel, and the next is the most disturbing image you hoped you would NEVER see. Her imagination and execution is unparalleled, and I would recommend this book if for no other reason than to simply look at this work. It's from heaven, I swear.<br /><br />  If I had to recommend one comic for somebody to read, it would be this one. The writing is superb, the art is out of this world, and I'm going to go grab my copy and read it again.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I know I'm gonna get my butt kicked (virtually) over this review, but here it goes.<br /><br />Poorly written, uneven, awful characters, no plot whatsoever. Seriously this is the worst book I've ever read. I'm happy this lady is getting all kinds of money over this crap, after all she did her part by writing it. And I'm sure a lot of people likes these books, but in all honesty, this is the kind of literature that makes women have unreal expectations about love, life, men, sex, money...

B004LWZW7E|1.0|I never watch anything mainstream but this title promising something edgy catch my wallet and I bought it used--good move Kawasaki! Movie is straight forward without anything meaningfull. The concept of using time as universal currency is not bad but what happened to all welfare people if even working class dont have enough for tomorrow and half of population dont pay any taxes? This is the question. I kinda expect to see future as is, instead, for no reason males and females share apartments without having connections or sex. We kinda expect to see man and woman engage in bedroom actions--no way this happens on mainstream train.But plenty of standard gun/killing action in public places. Avoid!

B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This was exactly what I needed to recharge my Kindle.  It took wayyyyy tooooo long to arrive.  Waited about 3 weeks.  Therefore, couldn't read my Kindle for that amount of time.  I will think twice about ordering off the Amazon site.  After finally receiving the cable, I found that I could have bought one at my local Staples store!!!
B009UWYFFK|5.0|Adam Sandler movies are a hit or miss, and this one is a definite HIT! We laughed hysterically in the theatres. It was a must for our movie collection!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|What a great backpack at a great price! Very roomy as well. I had enough room for 2 Nikon DSLR cameras and 4 lenses in the backpack and I had room left for other items I wanted to carry along. The interior has velcro so you can move the padding around to suit your needs. Highly recommended!
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|As soon as we saw this in the theatres, we knew that we wanted it as soon as it was released. I had to watch it the same day that it was delivered.
B005NKIQ26|5.0|Great Christmas album by JB! Enjoyable to listen to for all ages. Hang the mistletoe and listen to the cool tones of Justin Bieber!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Gripping as always. Vince Flynn is never a disappointment.  His character and plot development are a home run. Well done!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Takes time to get coins if you run out, but otherwise it is entertaining and simply fun. Reminds me of the fair.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Having already read the Zombie Survival Guide, and knowing the movie comes out next year, I decided to get on the ball to read WWZ. If you've read the description, you know the general idea. The book is a series of interviews with survivors of the Zombie uprising. It reads as a possible postscript to any of the classic Romero films, if someone was optimistic enough to think that humanity would ultimately come together and triumph over the undead and rebuild society. What's most impressive about the book is that Brooks has thought of nearly everything. He paints a portrait of the zombie war as it's fought in South Africa, China, Japan, Paris and North America. There's civilian perspectives, military, medical and philosophical. By the end, you've been through the World War Z, and you've survived.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|First episode in season 3 kept me wanting more.<br />Doesn't make sense taking the only DOCTOR on a patrol through the prison?<br />Rick...  &#34;I understand my wife is pregnant and she'll need a doctor, but lets take Hershel anyway.  I know he's old and slows us down but I can't risk him just sitting around in a secure holding cell, a zombie might get him.&#34;
B009H442DG|4.0|Anyone who buys this album knows what they're getting, and for what it is, a nice little package (it comes in a plastic jewel case, too, like CDs of old, not the current crop of sticky folded cardboard).  Olivia's in fine voice; John Travolta, uh, well, Regis Philbin can easily best him in a singing competition.  The Onion nailed the review.  That cover shot, Travolta's rug and shoe polish dye job, priceless.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|If you are a Sci. Fic.  fan you will love this book.  I got so involved with the characters I stayed up half the night to finish reading it.  I will definitely check out other books by this author!
B0096HIEE2|4.0|The story line is a human interest of a man who sets aside his career to rescue a younger friend from crime bosses. Therefore it is an excellent addition to a DVD collection.
B004EPYZZI|5.0|Soul Surfer should be watched by every young person for very positive re-enforcement principles.  It shows in a positve way that a person can over-come unseen obstacles with a positive drive and decision. Very good movie.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|i love this movie, i hope they make a Avengers 2. i have watched this movie about six times and will probably will six more. love it.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|First King novel I've read in years and it will be a long time again before I read another.  Typical of King's writing with interesting premise drawn out way beyond where it needs to be.  I wonder if King was influenced early on by payment by the word.<br />The initial premise of time travel is interesting but then it bogs down with too many detours and plot twists.  The ending is so incredibly cornball that it needs to come with a GMO label.<br />Wait for the inevitable movie/mini-series and you will waste less time and money for this hack work.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|A Wanted Man did not live up to my expectations.  I always love a Jack Reacher novel but this one ended abruptly and seemed less believable than other Child novels.
B001KZG99A|5.0|Humorous, action and an all around good &#34;escape&#34; from reality film.<br />And Robert Downy Jr is perfect in his role.
B007TK77QE|2.0|The world knows J.K Rowling is an amazing writer, but this one just didn't do it for me. Beautifully descriptive prose to the point that I felt I knew all the characters personally, but sooooo much of it! Just too much extra information tucked away in brackets too often. The plot was interesting, characters well thought out, but to me, this should have been heavily edited down to a snappy short story. It was just too long winded.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Enjoyed this story. Traditional King strangeness! Wanted to keep reading to see how it ended-the mark of an entertaining book!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|it works very well. it is a basic calculator no issues so far. i use it often i like that the numbers are big. goof caluculator
B000FCK42M|5.0|Excellent story, well written. I took this with me on vacation to Mexico, coincidentally, it was a perfect pool side read. I was entertained from start to finish.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|steady engagement with john corey and kate characters as carried over from last book LION. descriptions of yemen a real experience along with attitudes of the bedouin tribes. steadfast interest kept me wanting to read more each night while at the same time savoring it. loved this book and it is as witty and has twists and turns which is true DeMille writing.
B008Y5OW20|5.0|ELO's frontman's tribute to the songs of yesteryear is a revelation unlike others.  From the 1940's to the early 1960's, Lynne's interpretations of classic songs like, \\"If I Loved You\\", \\"Beyond The Sea\\" and \\"At Last\\" are marvelous.  They are the kind of arrangements that your parents would be proud to hear, yet they maintain a kind of timelessness that any fan of good classics and pop/rock would love.<br /><br />\\"She\\" is a standout cut and makes a perfect song to launch this set.  \\"Love Is A Many Splendored Thing\\" will remind you that it was an Oscar winning song and was covered by many over the years, most notably Andy Williams.  These classics contain magic from millions of plays over the decades, but Lynne makes them his own.

1932100385|5.0|I've been reading about nutrition for over 20 years. I thought I knew it well, but I actually began learning when I became a 48 year old diabetic. I know my choices have been better because of my interest in nutrition, but they weren't good enough.<br /><br />We are all mystified by the barrage of marketing, lies and misinformation that surrounds and captivates us on a daily basis. Our capitalist society does nothing for our health. The more pills we swallow the more birthday cake, burgers and fries we eat the sicker we get. Our medical, food and drug corporations profit from this.<br /><br /> I wonder how many of our children know what wheat looks like. I know they all recognize a box of Oreos.  That edible garbage is where we go wrong.  It always begets resistance to even speak out against it.  I can't understand this perceived great need for protein that I hear argued over and over.  So we eat a vegetarian cow.  How disillusioned is that?<br /><br />This book is the best I've ever read because its represents solid research on what is the most important topic for our health and well being.  It points out the amazing truth and most credible arguments of our dissension from good food and nutrition.  We eat products (not food), dairy products , consume massive amounts of  domesticated meats , processed and fast foods, all to our own demise...  and It's so simple Socrates knew it 2,500 years ago.<br /><br />Eat a whole foods plant based diet, buy from your local organic farmers.  A BIG Thank You to the Campbell's  for writing this book.
0395389496|5.0|The Polar Express is a book that the kiddo and I read over and over. She's fascinated by the imagery of the words combined with the pictures on the pages...and is always fascinated that after all these years, mommy still tears up when reading the last page.<br /><br />What do we really love about the book? We love that the children have hot chocolate just like we do! That he has a special bell to ring just like we do! And that he gets to see Santa Claus...and ride on a train! So much fun!

B009NQKPUW|4.0|As a huge Alien(s)³ fan, I had hopes and expectations that this movie would be something that it probably could never be.  It adds a new dimension to the saga, but leaves as many unanswered questions as it starts with.  I don't think there can be a successful sequel.<br /><br />As far as wasting a couple of hours on the couch for a $3 rental, it's well worth it if you are an aging Ripley fan or even if not.
B003VANOFY|4.0|This is a great set of cans for this price range.<br /><br />Love the drop down mic that also mutes when you put it up.<br /><br />Love the ability to have on-the-switch surround sound.<br /><br />The volume roller could be a bit more responsive (faster).<br /><br />Only reason for the -1 star was the better life is a few hours less then what it is suppose to be.
0307592731|5.0|Cheryl Strayed is honest, she's real, she's had enough heartache to be broken and then re-found again. I love her and this book.  She is like Elizabeth Gilbert or Anne Lamott; the best of the best.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|not unlike the old schol ones before graphing calcs.  if it had a solar panel i could put my finger over so it would shut-off I would feel right at home!
B004SIP9B0|5.0|Helen Mirrwn's portrayal of the Queen was uncanny.  The other characters were well done too. I think the Queen's life is very much like she was portrayed. She is a very private person, but warm and loving to her family. Anyone who can keep a dairy as long as she has must be dedicated. She has moved with the times under very trying circumstances. She has served her country well.
B0096DZKZC|5.0|I personally get dizzy when I try to play this game but my grandchildren absolutely love it.  They trade the Kindle Fire back and forth for hours at a time.  The only problem I have is that I have one Kindle Fire and three children who want to play it.
1451613512|5.0|The Untold History of the United States contained a great historical narrative of American foreign policy. You pretty much know what you are going to get with Oliver Stone.
B007L6VR6M|5.0|Part of the Movie was filled in Trinity Church, Newport RI - where I grew up as my father was the rector from 1954-1971.  Saw it in the theatre and got the DVD to see it again in slow motion if necessary - and the whole story and acting grew on me.  Nice to see Bruce Willis and Tilda Swinton in down to earth roles - just a deligthful &#34;little&#34; movie.
B0077ZNCE2|5.0|Breaking Dawn was a really good movie. I don't usually do vampire flicks but these are a new breed. I loved it.
B000007XUQ|5.0|I have owned nearly every manner of playing this...LP, cassette and now CD's. As a huge Carpenter fan this has been for years now my most played Christmas music. Such enjoyable listening during the holiday season.
0316227706|5.0|Amazing photographs and equally amazing dogs. I'm partial to Jack Russell terriers, so I particularly enjoyed the never-before-released photos of Lulu and Duke. The fact that Seth Casteel, with Little Friends Photo, is such a big champion for shelter pets makes his work that much more meaningful and special. I ordered five additional books and a calendar as Christmas gifts.
B002KCNVMA|5.0|Great Lego product, just like all of the other Lego building sets.  It's a great project for the family.  Would recommend.
B005LAIGW8|4.0|I t was good but I could tell when something was coming in parts of this movie I would have liked it better if there was no way for me to know when something was coming maybe next time but all in all it was good Thanks
B006BAEQB2|5.0|This was another great addition,cant wait  for the next, they  seem to get better and better. This is a period of history that I didnt remember well
B009B8YZKS|5.0|This is beyond what I would have ever imagined a live action series/movie to be like, for HALO.  I would love to see this actually become a series on SyFy, or a full fledged movie in theaters. I have watched it 3 times, and it has not gotten old yet.  Buy it!  You will not regret it.
B009E3EY38|1.0|I don't get it. Led Zeppelin, finally together in concert after more than 25 years and this is the video that will mark this event for eternity? Hey, monkey video editors, this is LED ZEPPELIN not Van Halen. This is a concert video, not a music video. Who reviews these videos before they're released? Did someone actually say \\" great job on the editing, didn't think it was possible to get that many cuts in 2 hours, but next time how about a few more crowd shots, and shots of the huge video screens, because let's face it most people aren't use to front row seats and just watch concerts from the nose bleed section and this way they will feel more comfortable.\\" What an absolute shame. This needs to be re-edited by a human now, before more people buy this garbage. I promise to whoever makes all the money on these concert videos that I will buy it and not complain. And, if you want to save time and make real money I would buy the raw footage from each of the 16 cameras and edit it myself. How about $5.00 per camera? If my math is correct that's $80.00. That's a lot more than the $16.99 I paid for this Blu-Ray coaster. I am serious. Just think of all the money that could be made and all of the great videos that could be produced by ordinary people with common sense and good taste. It could work.  Just think, instead of You Tube there would be You Concert with countless versions that could be viewed and reviewed, and most likely one of these versions would be just what you were looking for. Just dreaming but it makes sense to me. And let's not forget it would make lots of money for the company.<br />Finally to all the folks who wrote the page after page of 5 star reviews of this video, are you just conditioned to music videos being butchered in the editing department,or is it when you attend concerts your heads just jerk around spasmodically? Yes, Led Zeppelin is great and justly deserves to sit in the pantheon of rock gods and that is precisely why this video is such a disgrace.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|The Walking Dead's second season left me on the edge of my seat at the end of each episode. There were surprising twists and turns and the drama didn't disappoint. This is a great series that I don't see ending anytime soon.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|This book was alright.  I will of course read the 3rd now too but they aren't anything spectacular.  I think everyone should read these books but not as good as expected with all the hype about them

B0053TMP24|5.0|this is a book my 12 yr old son is reading for school. we have it in hardcover already but wanted it for the kindle also.  that way..no forgotten book at school.  he loves it so i say it is 5 star!
B004WESFZW|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies... I would recommend this movie to anyone. It is interesting and will make you see things differently!
B007WPM7SO|5.0|A well-executed telling of many stories and realities of the times of the Great War.<br />The setting in Picardy, the period of history, the unwavering attention to the grim conditions in the trenches, the scariness of the tunnels.  A triumph of a sparing script.  Memorable performances by sterling artists. Wow - an amazingly well done film.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Typical Grisham, the story moves along well and holds your interest. It is a classic who done it and why?
B003L77G06|5.0|I haven't been watching Modern Family when it's on as there are other programs on at the same time that I enjoy.  This is a nice way to catch up and get some laughs.
B005NFW0U0|5.0|It was a very sad ending but the show kept you interested.  Always a new twist or plot and in the end love prevails.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|I haven't been watching Modern Family when it airs as there are other programs on at the same time that I watch.  This was a nice way to get some laughs and see what I was missing.

B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I love the free books that are offered from Amazon kindle, I don't have a kindle but the app and I was excited to know I can order from one of my favorite online sites. Amazon.
B009E3EY38|2.0|I thought for a few minutes that this might actually be a pretty good film. But after no more than 5 minutes -- the lightning quick camera shots jumping from here to there a million miles a minute unfortunately wears thin. The camera barely stays on one person for more than a second and a half at the most. This has rendered it \\"unwatchable\\" to me. Even though this is a staple of most concert DVD's, there are still plenty of them that have been edited as to not induce seizures and headaches.<br />Performance speaking its fairly good, considering the age of Plant and Page. Not great - not terrible - but somewhat of a missed opportunity. If you like 10 screen shots every 3 seconds...this will be right up your alley. If not...keep a bottle of Tylenol close...because you WILL get a headache.
B0086700CM|5.0|very easy to play, very hard to get 1 million plus...  well, at least for me, my max scrore is 900K.  But very fun to play...  and NO ads at all, and that is ALWAYS a welcomed feature...

B008SVS3FC|5.0|This album was above expectations.  Very melodious sounds and great songs.  I enjoyed it thoroughly.  One of his best in years.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Very addicting, kinda quick though. Think we solved it in about 2 days and finished the game. Loved it tho, and fun with a partner who is also playing.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|This is such a wonderful movie, my son and I love it so much. Arthur is the keeper of the letters that children send to Santa, he also writes back to the children. He is a little clumsy with some Laugh Out Loud humor to make little ones and big ones alike filled with the gigglies. This story is heartfelt and the graphics are great, it shows children that Christmas is not just about superficial things and power. It is about caring for others. I love this movie and I know you will.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|Since the app store has fixed the bug not allowing a reinstallation I can say this is the best multiplayer strategy game available.<br /><br />Good work TBS games.

B0070Y46UY|3.0|A little different than I expected.  Slow to start, but it does pick up.  Tried to read before movie and now I am ready to see it.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Although I remain a loyal fan to the Bond of my youth (Roger Moore), Daniel Craig is, in my opinion, one of the very best of the rest. In Skyfall he demonstrated how he has matured into the character - and the writing and execution of virtually every other aspect of this film are superior to his first two outings. Some viewers are finding this Bond outing a bit slow moving. I didn't, although it is admittedly more restrained than many other films from the series. Nevertheless, I found it engaging from beginning to end. I thought certain parts of the film packed an emotional punch seldom felt in other Bond films.<br /><br />It is interesting how the public's expectations for Bond have changed. When View to A Kill premiered critics blasted the level of violence and even Roger Moore said he thought at least one scene in that movie went too far. The current take on Bond is far more violent and the bad guys are often presented in a much darker light than the villains of old - even if ultimately their dastardly deeds end up having similar effects. I'm looking forward to what comes next in this long running series and highly recommend this entry.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|When I bought this book I thought it was going to be really interesting, couldn't be more wrong... It's boring from the first page to the last.... Badly written and nothing really happens, just the sex parts. I don't recommend it
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Just as good as all the other awesome books I've read from this series! The book could be longer though I read this in two days.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book, it's the best one of the series, you get instantly caught and it's so hard to put down the book, I just wanted to know what happened next.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I felt the book was a bit slow and the senseless children killing children it just a bit morbid to me.
B008CLI3TE|4.0|The spanish subtitles had some misspellings. That´s not something you would expect from a product that is a legal copy.<br />About everything else I am satisfied. The series is awesome.
B009VB7QQA|3.0|I just finished the book, which I enjoyed for the most part (the ending was so-so), and the movie is not very much like the book at all. I would have to say this is the best SyFy channel/TV movie ever,  but I really expect more from a \\"real\\" movie. The stream also pixelated a few times on the HD feed, which was annoying-- nothing major though & it didn't freeze completely or anything.<br /><br />I wouldn't suggest this movie unless you are a die-hard fan of someone/something in the movie and/or if you love awful (think Sharktopus) TV movies. I gave it 3 stars because I was mildly amused by it, but 2.5 would be more accurate.
B0081BU42O|4.0|This is a strong entry, though not the best, in Banks' series of \\"Culture\\" novels.  Still, that means it is way above the level of most sci-fi novels available out there. Strong characters, sharp writing, interesting concepts.  I have tried some other sci-fi authors but for me these days the genre is coming up short of the heights reached by Herbert, Zelazny, et al at their best.  Dan Simmons' Hyperion novels were notable exceptions and his subsequent Ilium/Olympus duo started strong but then became unfocused.  I continue to look for someone with the consistency of Banks.  His Culture novels are always entertaining, some are masterful, others just darn good reads.  I highly recommend all of them.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My co-workerpointed this app out to me and it is r<br />reall cool. it is simple but it makes you<br />think and wan to go for a perfect score each time.<br /><br />e
B000YHG72E|5.0|This movie is great for children and adults. Very funny and clean entertainment for the whole family. Some times Will Ferrell bugs me but he plays his role perfectly in Elf!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I think this series is among the best ever.  My only regret was that it was canceled way too soon.  I have left several others view this series and they have the same feelings as I do, why was this canceled?<br /><br />You can't go wrong if you buy this.
1423101502|5.0|I get a nice feeling every time I think of these books. They were perfect. Mix of action, story, love ... Can't say much about the plot though - haven't read them in years.<br /><br />I just remember these books were awesome... I'm gonna have to read them again sometime.
B009SIE6AA|5.0|James never disappoints.  His calming voice singing the songs of the season is spectacular.  Good things get better with age.
8866130907|5.0|Exactly as advertised.  Despite being in a world of high tech electronics, this item is an excellent tool that will keep anyone on track regardless of career field. I highly recommend this product.
B00979CS50|5.0|Neil Young has been the soundtrack of most of my adult life (it's not giving away too much to let you know we're almost the same age).<br /><br />His latest effort is a joyful reunion with Crazy Horse, and folks, the band is really back together, with all of the long riffs, the jamming, the shouted key changes, the buzz of feedback, the not-quite-perfect harmonies.<br /><br />Neil's latest works have been (except for Americana) a bit more reflective about his life's journey, and this album (2 discs) continues an introspective thread. But his guitar solos have never been stronger, his vocal quivers never better, and his lyrics never more honest.<br /><br />It would be very hard to do a song-by-song review because, frankly, I loved them all. He sang decades ago that \\"it's better to burn out than to fade way.\\" He shows no evidence of doing either in this latest work.
B003Y74AZ2|5.0|This item is exactly as advertised and it fits perfectly.  I recommend this product to anyone with an iPhone 4S.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|I recently heard that the list of rock stars who are around 70 years old  who are still making worthwhile contributions to the genre begins with Bob Dylan and ends with Neil Young.  Tempest has received &#34;uneven&#34; reviews, but the appeal of this album should transcend die-hard Dylanophiles. The tracks may sound similar (a result of the loss of voice (voice? what voice?) he might once have had, but as another reviewer added, he has &#34;great diction&#34; so that the words of this poet are not lost. The band is extraordinarily tight, and each and every song is filled with enough meaning to require multiple listenings. I strongly suggest that every listening is a worth wile expenditure of time.  Not an album for background music. It's one of those which demands you attention. Give it the attention it deserves!
B00000JNOJ|5.0|I highly recommend this album.  This captures the man behind the music.  A must for anyone's Blues Collection.  Try it!
B005SDDB9Q|3.0|As a certified Bruce fan, I had to add this curio to my collection. Containing a concert recording from a small club, you get to hear earlier versions of tunes which turned up shortly thereafter on Asbury Park. Shows the development of several of the songs, and so is of interest. There's also an extended radio interview/performance from the same time frame(where Bruce amusingly calls Clarence Clemmons his brother, and adds, \\"this is radio, they don't know!\\"). Bruce adds a couple of comments, some acoustic work on songs later electrified, and talks about his desires to get out of New Jersey. Also of limited interest to someone who fails to worship at the Altar of All Things Bruce.<br /><br />The downsize is the recording quality. Poor, poor, and worse. One wishes that the production had been cleaned up by some computer language. It's so murky and lacking in tonal quality that I had to give up listening to it after a couple of times. Too bad. Perhaps somebody with a good piece of software could make this a thing of real beauty. This ain't it.
B00846REIS|3.0|Its no 50 Shades, but it was ok. Not sure id recommend it to other readers, it has too many similarities to 50 Shades without the adventure, and too much juvenile drama.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|Great application. I use it for my grocery list, my task lists, etc.  It's a very easy and intuitive app.
B0087OXDDC|5.0|I`m very grateful to Peter Gray for sharing with us his knowledges and creativity. From my point, this is the only book about phrasal verbs which allows me learn it in a logical, contextualized and enjoyable way.<br />I'm into this book!
1573225517|5.0|Loved reading this, if only for all of the Top 10 lists and music references. Overall, a nice story about relationships, and very accurate.
1401922732|5.0|I have most of Doreen Virtue's card decks, but this deck and Mary Queen of Angels are my 2 most used decks. I use them daily for inspiration and answers to questions. Most of the time I ask \\"what can I do today to make this world a better place\\",I would definitely recommend these cards. Also I find the  energy of this deck and Mary Queen of Angels more in tune with today's world
B006CQLGXG|5.0|A holiday staple in my home, I re-read it every year. It's a classic that always reminds me of the true meaning of Christmas and life.
B00471TLZS|1.0|I am in total shock that this movie has such high reviews. It was horrible in every way. the plot was terribly boring and worthy of the harshest ridicule. The overly dramatic cheesy acting served only to make the film even more absurd, which i thought the plot did a good enough job of doing. The terrible special effects, which perhaps where acceptable when the movie was made, were the icing on this already crap cake; they seemed as though their main purpose was to make up for what the entire rest of the movie lacked. Perhaps the other reviewers are simply reviewing based on nostalgia, but i find it hard to believe that it is worth more than 1 stare and a permanent place in the $1 bin at wal-mart. I was under the impression that it was supposed to be some sort of super cheesy horror-comedy but even if that were the case it fails on both accounts. I wont go into specifics on exactly which segments exemplify my previous comments because I think its glaringly obvious.

B000FCKGPC|5.0|This book lends a different perspective to the various plot lines A Song of Ice and Fire has followed up until this point. Martin departs from the typical characters of the previous 3 books for characters we know of, but who have not been the main focus of chapters. Martin says in a foreword that the events in this book are not necessarily in chronological order and may take place at the same time as events in the previous book, or previous chapters.<br /><br />Mr. Martin uses this book to give further insight into the Iron Islands(The Greyjoys) through the eyes of Asha and Balon's Brother Aeron Damphair. He also gives the Southernmost Part of the 7 Kingdoms(Dorne) life through following a number of characters from the region as well as Myrcella and her Kingsguard.<br /><br />With all these new characters and perspectives; the typical characters take more of a back seat in this book but do appear sporadically.<br /><br />This is my least favorite of the 5 books thus far simply because Martin works to tell the story of different characters, rather than the main ones readers are used to. It is none the less a very good book that continues the story while also taking the time to give different perspectives.

B0096MM9GG|4.0|There is something magical about Prince of Persia, Ever since the 90s when this game was first made available on 8088 PCs running at 4.77 Mhz with CGA graphics I fell in love with the character and till date after nearly two decades Prince of Persia has become one of my favorite games.<br /><br />I have purchased various PC versions of the game over the years and The Android version of this game Prince of Persia Game is still a classic and the port is fantastic. The replay value of this game is excellent as you have various modes of play that you can enable to beat your own time or just attempt the finish this game in 1 hour keeping the original Prince of Persia game-play and theme.<br /><br />The Controls on touchscreen tablets can be frustrating to begin with as there are no control key on touch screen that you can hold, Nor there is SHIFT and arrow keys for navigating the young prince. Having said, Once you get used to the D-Pad on your left thumb (Which can be placed at any location automatically) and other fine movements like jump and squat on the right side makes the controls reasonably good.<br /><br />The graphics are good and faithful to the original presentation of Prince of Persia and sound effects are really good. The only reason it looses one star is to do with touchy controls.<br /><br />Price is about correct for a game this huge (You need to be prepared to have more than 225.0MB on your SDcard) and plays beautifully on Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 and Kindle fire.<br /><br />If you love the Prince of Persia series of game this game will not disappoint you once you get the hang of the touchy controls.<br /><br />Long live the prince. Hope you get your princess under the hour :D<br /><br />Cheers!

However, I'm enjoying just having them in the house and flipping through them. Honestly, I just can't believe how beautifully done these books are, and at such a fair price too. When I was a kid in the 1970s and early 1980s collecting Disney comics I would love to have had this and the other volumes. Fantagraphics really is to be commended for this effort. Recommended in every way.

B004I8WD6E|5.0|When I first purchased my iphone 4s I bought the expensive $40 case. That case only lasted about two months before it finally started chipping, also the plastic started to break from just keeping it in my pocket. I dropped my phone with the expensive case and the case broke more and more. Finally seen this item and the good reviews so I made the purchase. I tell you what, from day one this case is just what I needed. It has a nice tight fit around my 4s, and even comes with a protective screen! The case itself, doesn't feel too rubbery, so I doubt it will become loose over time from having to remove phone from case for anything. I like that I no longer have to remove my phone from the case for my car aux. cord anymore. If you are the type of person that doesn't need Fort Knox to house your phone, this is the case for you. The ability to see through the case as well is also a plus, as well as the circle designs on the back. Finally the best part of this case; THE PRICE. If you don't need Fort Knox to house your iPhone 4/4s, this is the case you need. It's durable, and the price is right.

B00AEK9BKQ|4.0|Ever since \\"The Sessions\\" made its smash debut at the Sundance Film Festival in early 2012, this movie has gotten the reputation of \\"that movie with a lot of Helen Hunt nudity in it\\", and while it is true there are a number of nude scenes in the movie, I hope you will agree that, after you will hopefully have seen this film, this movie surely is about a lot more than that.<br /><br />\\"The Sessions\\" (2012 release; 95 min.) brings the (real life) story of Mark O'Brien (played by John Hawkes), a Bay-area poet who lives in an iron lung as a result of polio when he was a little kid. In his late 30s, Mark wonders what if would be like \\"to be with a woman in the biblical sense\\", as he confides to his priest (played by William H. Macy). With the priest's blessing, Mark eventually gets in contact with a sex therapist, who in turn gets him in contact with Cheryl (played by Helen Hunt), a sex surrogate. Over the course of several sessions (hence the fiml's title), Cheryl gives \\"body awareness\\" tips and experiences. I'm not going to spoil your viewing experience by disclosing how it all plays out, but I will say that the last half hour of the movie is bittersweet and very touching, and I welled up more than once.<br /><br />Several comments: first and foremost, John Hawke's performance will simply blow you away. I cannot imagine that he will not get an Oscar nomination for this. Of course, Helen Hunt's performance surely is Oscar-worthy as well, and not only because of the daring and frequent (but never exploitive) nudity. The immediate subject matter of the movie (sex for the disabled) is handled with care and grace. The buzz for this movie has been steadily growing in recent months, and I must say I was quite surprised how poorly attended the screening was which I attended a few weekends ago here in Cincinnati. Maybe it was just a coincidence. I sure hope so, as I very much enjoyed this movie from start to finish. \\"The Sessions\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B0076DELIG|5.0|It's perfect Harry Bosch. His daughter, as many others pointed out, is more defined in this book. Other relationships are purely work/business. I always enjoy these stories because there's no holding back when getting to know the inner workings/thoughts of Bosch. He's relentless and full of flaws but it doesn't mean you like him any less. If you like this series, you'll love this latest. If it's your first, enjoy...then be sure to read the others. There's not a lemon in the bunch...in my opinion anyway.

I've been re-watching some older superhero movies with my son, and while he really likes the battle scenes, he can tell when there isn't enough storyline or character development to keep him hooked between them.<br /><br />This movie has both, AND lots of action scenes for those looking for them.  Really great work and I look forward to more movies in this vein

This is from a girl who also is very into &#34;Grown up&#34; shows like 'How I met your mother', so its nice that she still likes movies like this.  I think its the relationship between characters that gets her.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I got this CD as a b-day gift for my son. He was always playing their music and was pretty thrilled to get it as a gift. I'm a new fan too...unique music as it should be done - originally and with passion!
B006MW3V6U|4.0|i love costume drama and this one nails it. great acting and wonderful story to follow. i highly recommend this series.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|This is beautifully done and very nice to listen to. I play it every time I get in the car. I highly recommend it.
0316044695|5.0|The best book I've ever read.  I couldn't put it down.  It's captivating, thrilling, sad, yet inspirational.  It makes you appreciate what sacrifice really means.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|What is there not to love about Adele's music...LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it! I play it all the time and the whole family is enjoying it. I think this will be one of those historically great works of music.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|This would be a 5-star rating except for the fact that you must be in range of a WI-FI connection.  I wish I could open this book no matter where I'm at.  That was my only criticism.
B00846REIS|5.0|I couldnt put it down! Similar to fifty shades of gray which I loved! I definetly would recommend this series!
B0063IH60K|2.0|I love this game, except I haven't figured out how to cancel it and start another one. Once I get that figured out, I'm sure I will love it.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|About everyone raging about how it costs: Yes, you can buy stuff through game just like half the other online games, you still have to verify pressing &quot;buy&quot;. Not that complex. The game itself is like many others and its well done. Couple small glitches sometimes but nothing that affects gameplay. Overall - Pretty fun.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|so maybe the recipies are the same but you cant dislike them for that because they have different items.  and I like it but I have to admit I like minecraft pe better sorry
B000SEGUDE|2.0|Now that's unusual for me. I always like the book better thanthe movie. Sure hope it lives up to the hype
0756405890|5.0|I found this book in our local bookstore as a staff recommendation. I picked it up for my husband as a gift...and since he's not a huge fan of this type of genre, it sat there for a while. Finally he got around to reading it, and before I knew it he was ordering the second one in the series for his kindle. So I started reading it and fell in love immediately. The characters are wonderful, and the story development keeps you hooked the entire way through. When I finished, I was left with that melancholy you have at the end of a great read, when you wish there was more ahead -- thankfully I was able to move on to the next in the series, and there's a third one slated for the near future.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|The game play is simple and fun, but my only issue is that I can't seem to find the \\"random visit\\" button in the social menu that's mentioned by the help button. Other than that it's over all satisfying and I love that the voices are played the actors from the show.
1451695195|3.0|This is a good book about an astonishing experience. I wish the author would have gone into more detail about his time in heaven. Maybe he will in a future book?
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|and this is what i think of it. but seriously its a good show. this next comment is to fill up the required amount of words needed. ok. im done now.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I love The Night Circus. The character development and plot and setting are intriguing and commanding. I have recommended the book to friends who call to say they cannot put it down. If you like Harry Potter for kids, you will LOVE The Night Circus for adults.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|love this and it's very authentic music and don't have to have seen the movie to relate.....i didn't see the movie
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved this book.  I took it on a vacation and read all 3 books in 2 days......it was that good!  I think that it gave me a lot of insight into the change that can come over people that have gone into war (which changed my perspective towards our veterans).  I also love the story and the characters.  Simply a fun adventure to read.
B001T3RA8M|5.0|This is a wonderfully written book of adventure, magic, love, and dark fantasy that grips the reader from the very first page. I could not set the book down after I started and I even got in trouble for reading in class!  Garth Nix is one of my favorite authors and I highly recommend this series or any of his other books to anyone who loves reading.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|Huge fan of Sherlock Holmes, so you really can't go wrong with any of these books.  I love them. Classic.
B000FBFMZ2|5.0|well written. page turner that is hard to put down. wonderful theme and characters. a detective story hiding a metaphor about the world we live in.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I first downloaded this as a joke but its actually really entertaining. It reminds me of old times when I played with the my little ponies.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I was hooked from the first book to the third!! Great end to a great series!!!  Suzanne Collins did an excellet job!
B00AE9UYJ4|2.0|meh. i decided to finally check this game out, after hearing so much about it. i thought it was rather boring.
B008532S54|5.0|Such a good movie! It's one of my favorites by far! Had a bad day? Pop this in and you will feel better from all<br />The laughing you'll do! I bet you will rewind the mirtor sceen with paul rudd its GREAT!! Love it!! :)
1423136802|4.0|I liked that I was able to order the Percy Jackson books in a set; although, the label for the books was misleading as the books did not actually come in a box. The books just came together in a package. However, the box was not important. The condition of the books was described accurately to an extent; some of the pages in the books were dog-eared, but otherwise they were in great condition. I would recommend this series to anyone who likes mythical stories, such as the Odyssey.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|I'm a big fan of this movie and wanted to add it to my family's Disney collection.  It is great for animal lovers and kids.
B008MEM24S|4.0|I got the free version, which was fun, and decided to get the full version because my husband and I enjoyed it.  The instructions are limited to we had to rely on trial and error to figure the game out but we enjoy it.  Its like an interactive maze.
B003E1G4AC|4.0|The only downside to this is if you have the sound on it play non stop until you remove the usb device. I also used a power adapter on it but it does not appear to be powering anything.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I really enjoy using Evernote. Its like having a flash drive wherever you go. I have it on mh android phone, kindle fire, ipod touch, ipad 2, and laptop. I'm able to access it just about anywhere. I highly recommend it. 5 stars.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|One of the cutest well written movies I have seen in a long time. I did tear up a little because it's so touching.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Great to have Indiana Jones on Blu-ray at last!!! I still love the first Movie the best, but it is nice to have the whole collection.
B004LTA9MK|5.0|I was happy to see this item offered. I actually had the opportunity to be at this concert and it was wonderful. It's always good to be able to get an item that reminds you of a special moment or event.
1401308201|5.0|If you are a WICKED fan, like I am, then this book is a &#34;must have.&#34;  It is a beautifully printed, unique keepsake.  You will not be disappointed with this absolutely stunning book!
B00571F26Y|4.0|Every living person, particularly those in Western society, should read this book, in order to know that what we call wheat in this day and time, is really a genetically modified monster from the depths of the gene pool, and is both making them fat (obese), and more importantly, poisoning them. In following the current wisdom to &#34;eat more whole grains:&#34;, Americans, and others are killing themselves. Read it. You owe it to yourselves, and your loved ones.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book was written just to get the reader to buy the next book.  Absolutely no resolution to the problem--leaving the reader hanging.  No way I'm wasting anymore money on such a come on
0345803507|4.0|I liked the book and the series.  I liked the endning of a famly. It was great and I didn't want it to end.
B007V4530A|5.0|I did a TEDx talk this past weekend and i found this book very helpful while i was constructing my talk. I recommend it to TED/TEDx speakers or anyone doing public speaking. Effective, practical advice. I think my talk was much better from reading this book
0345803493|4.0|I liked the series. It was a good book and I liked the series.  I liked the ending of a family.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Good read, kept me interested. Ending was good, as good always wins over evil in Grisham books, This one does not dissapoint.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|The story was easy reading, interesting. I enjoyed the love story and had a hard time putting it down. The surprise at the end was pleasant and gives hope to all.
B002AWX6UM|5.0|This book is so sad but so interesting.  I really enjoy reading about other cultures in general, and this one is well-described and really helps the reader to feel on his behalf.  It also provides a learning experience for the reader to see the truth in what goes on in other parts of the world.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|It was ok. I had to read it for a reading group. I wouldn't have picked it if not for the group
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I enjoyed the story and telling of the relationship as it evolved in the book.  It was romantic and helped the reader to feel for the characters.
B002L3ARRU|5.0|The story in this film never gets old. This movie ranks as the epitome of the teen age desire for cleverness and an imaginary suave lifestyle.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this book for the first half.  I thought it got a little weird towards the end though.
030758836X|5.0|This book was intriguing and well-written. I finished the whole book in almost one go because I couldn't wait to see what really happened.
B009HV2JT8|1.0|The movie was terrible and did not follow the book at all. I would not recommend this movie period. Terrible do not waste your time. The book was outstanding!!!!
0307744434|3.0|I think this book is worth reading- however, I did not think it was great. 5 stars for originality, but 2 stars for execution. The potential of the story got completely bogged down by multiple subplots that really didn't lead anywhere. Because there were so many characters I didn't feel that any of them were developed fully, even the two main characters. Additionally, I thought the writing quality was all over the place- when describing the circus it was extremely lovely and descriptive, but the interactions between Celia and Marco were all embarrassingly cheesy. If the author writes anything else I'll probably check it out in the hopes that she's matured her skills a bit and learned from previous mistakes.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|The plot lines and characters continue to develop in Season 5 as we roll along in years.  The acting, both individually and ensemble, is first rate.  John Hamm deserves an Emmy for sure.  The direction, although handled by many different people is consistent, nuanced and virtually flawless.  Undoubtedly, the best show in television.  If it were on a paid channel, the intimate scenes would be even more graphic and exciting but AMC has produced a gem anyway.  The opening credits including the haunting music and falling figure through the symbols of the ad world is hypnotizing and quite difficult to get out of your head.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app! It is very convient and the display is large on my Kindle Fire which is great.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|Not so difficult to play....An interesting game, usually able to complete the game within one day.  Good game for a teenager kid.
B002LMV7TS|4.0|If you ever thought to yourself &#34;I love the Grinch, but 26 minutes isn't enough!&#34; then you'll be delighted by Ron Howard's masterpiece, Dr. Suess' How the Grinch Stole Christmas. The extra 60 or so minutes of adventure feature great moments such as the origin of the Grinch and the story of why he hates Christmas. Young or old, it doesn't matter. This is a Grinch everyone can enjoy!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|These were my first adult romance/erotica reads. WOW! I now compare all other books and characters to these. I read all 3 books twice. I missed the characters so much when I finished.
B004LWZW7O|4.0|I really enjoyed the premise of this movie. The thought that you need time to live & stop aging at the age of 21? is a quite interesting draw.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|These books were my first adult romance/erotica reads and I loved them. I now compare all others to these books. I love the story more than the explicit details.
B005G4TJI4|3.0|My family & I are avid Transformers fans, however this movie wasn't as good as the previous movies. I purchased simply to have in our movie line up.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love these books. They were my first adult romance/erotica books to read and now they are what I compare all others to. I loved the story more than they explicit details.
B0098VXE50|4.0|I like the movie, however they could have replaced Kristin Stewart. She just doesn't display any range in her acting ability. She always has that soft spoken portrayal with a subtle lip quiver that I'm over. Besides that I did enjoy movie & the new spin on the classic tale.
B005UA0FLE|5.0|Michael Buble is a world renowned &#34;crooner&#34;.  I absolutely love him and his Christmas CD is exceptional.  Thank you Amazon.com for carrying such great music in Album form and MP3.
B004EPYZV2|5.0|This movie will have you all in it & will not put you to sleep. I enjoy all the action & general story line. I'd like to see Bond meet Tom Cruise character in a movie.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I have loved animals all my life.  I saw this movie on a cable station a month ago, but they never repeated it.  It was a true story, and it made me stop and remember my youth and the great animal &#34;friends&#34; I had.  Great movie!!!
B004EPYZPI|4.0|I enjoyed watching this with my spouse. The storyline is believable & Mccanauhay is a very good actor. I would recommend.
B008C20TDG|5.0|I first ordered the Kindle edition of this book, but it is not formatted in a way that you can read any of the charts or diagrams.  Then I ordered the hardback copy.  The information is amazing!  They did their research homework, but they present even the most technical concepts in a very simple way!  I have begun my own Whole30 discovery, and I feel fantastic.  I am not hungry and the food possibilities seem endless!  I LOVE not having to measure all my food....or weigh myself every day!  Try it!  You might just have stumbled onto the answers to the questions you have been asking.  I have!
B005C9YZKU|5.0|I am so pleased with this series.  The photography is fantastic that you almost feel you are in the ocean.  The Presentation Case is wonderful and looks great on the TV table.  Everyone that sees it ask about the uniqueness of the case.  When I have finished this, I will pass it on to the grandkids.<br />Thanks once again for offering beautiful gifts for the entire family.
B001NEK2GE|4.0|Great baord.  Marked down one star becasue the the stick has a small surface area, and it's a pain to get to run on Linux.
B005HSL626|5.0|I dont know what exactly it is about this game but my husband and I love it. It is such a simple concept and yet probably one of the funnest games I have played.
B00A11AN6O|4.0|Should be a way to encrypt content for amazon photos.  You don't want you pics out in the open for everyone to see. Automatic vs manual sync.  5gb is ok but not very good and will fill up soon.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Have not bought this boxed set yet, but I do want to urge anyone who has not seen this series to go ahead and purchase.  The DVD set is not wide-screen according to Amazon, the Blu-ray set is wide-screen (also according to Amazon.)<br /><br />You will follow a wealthy and landed family that is served by a very full staff.  The drama surrounding the downstairs staff is just as involved as that of the upstairs family.  Fortunately people do evolve and there is clear character growth.  Both traditional and sensitive subjects are covered such as the real cost of war (who pays and who dies), class distinction (of course), education and careers for women, city versus rural competency, the place of women, Irish versus English, Catholic versus Protestant, good and bad, greed and payback, tradition versus change and protection of reputation (in love, business and association with social outcasts.)  I'm leaving something out, I'm sure.<br /><br />There is a small amount of political correctness starting to show, I'm guessing this is a knee-jerk reaction to negative reviews by those who always resent the upper class and insist only on negative portrayals.  This is demonstrated by scenes involving Lord Grantham; he seems to be getting everything wrong recently and this is too easy a way for the writer Julian Fellowes to appease.
B004EKCNMA|4.0|We had the volume up to 100 on our Samsung LED flat screen. Wish it could have been louder. The movie itself is not for toddlers or younger.
B009X00E18|3.0|This case is designed for the new Kindle Fire HD 8.9 inch model.<br />The basic features are:<br />It has side openings for easy access to all ports and buttons, and also two holes in the back for the stereo speakers.<br />The Kindle is easy to place in the case and fits snugly so it will stay in place.<br />The elastic band in the back can be put over the top cover to hold it in place when closed.<br />The front cover also folds in half backwards enabling the case to serve as a stand for landscape viewing only.<br /><br />By design, this case is fairly thin and light weight so not much bulk or weight is added to the Kindle. Many people will like this and feel that these attributes are an advantage, while those more concerned with having better protection may feel that these features are nice but insufficient. Those who travel a lot, have children or pets, or are in other situations where the Kindle is knocked around a bit may want to get a better padded case.<br /><br />This case is made of plastic and the thinness of the front cover does make it appear flimsy. Most people will probably agree that it is certainly over priced at the current cost of $45, and unfortunately this is not unique when comparing the high prices of other cases as well.<br /><br />Personally, I think that the light weight is good but also that light weight padding should be added on both sides for better protection. This will increase the bulk slightly but have minimal affect on weight increase. I also prefer a leather case and will wait for one that is reasonably priced.<br /><br />This is a decent case if you don't mind any of the issues discussed above, so you may want to give it a try and see if it meets your needs and preferences.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|This was a gift from my little brother who also loves the show. I missed the first season and can't wait to watch the beginning of a show that I really enjoy.
B005S9ELQ2|4.0|If you ever wondered where in God's name Trey Parker and Matt Stone got the idea for [[ASIN:B0007LPLMY Team America: World Police]], look no further than Argo, the mostly true story of how the CIA confounded a crazed Eastern dictator using the only weapon powerful enough to ensure justice prevails against even the darkest of evils: Hollywood.<br /><br />\\"ACT, GARY!\\"<br /><br />This is a solidly constructed and handsomely directed picture, and its attention to detail, even to the extent of a period-correct crackly Warner brothers title card, is consistently wondrous. The seventies `taches and comb-overs are spot on. The cinematography is impressive: the grainy, orangey colours look like real original seventies newsreel footage, and you only realise they can't be when a 747 flies overhead tracked on a static camera which must be a couple of thousand feet in midair. That is very, very sympathetically rendered CGI indeed.<br /><br />Ben Affleck has his hands full, co-producing and directing as well as taking the lead role: he is Tony Mendez, a CIA field agent who specialises in \\"exfiltration\\" of vulnerable American nationals from iffy foreign situations. They don't get iffier than the Iran hostage crisis of 1979. In a frenetic dramatisation of the initial storming we see embassy staff dumbfounded that their walls could possibly be breached (\\"but we're technically on American soil!\\") and stunned that the Iranian police wouldn't come to sort the situation out for them.<br /><br />Ultimately 52 of the American Embassy staff were caught and held hostage for 444 days. What is less well-known is that six others had the bright idea of scarpering out the back door as the students stormed the front, escaping to the questionable sanctuary of a foreign city of 4 million people whom would like nothing better than \\"to pour American blood on their cornflakes\\".<br /><br />Having been turned away by the Brits, the Swedes and the Kiwis they wind up as reluctant house guests of the only westerners who'll take them in: the Canadian ambassador and his wife.<br /><br />Meanwhile, back in Quantico, CIA subsection chief Jack O'Donnell (Bryan Cranston) is put in charge of working out what to do now. His best guy is Mendez. Mendez' idea, even though the best by a long shot, is a total stinker: have the six pretend to be a Canadian film crew scouting for locations for a sci fi movie, in revolutionary Iran. It beat \\"cycling 300 mountainous miles to the Turkish border in the middle of winter\\", which was the other option.<br /><br />Early stages are worked as a skilful drama: There is a clever juxtaposition of the Iranian students' trumped up show trial of the American hostages on spying against a public script reading in Hollywood for the titular sci fi film. The preparation for the phoney film is a comedy masterclass from John Goodman and Alan Arkin as a pair of Hollywood old hands brought in to make a credible backstory.<br /><br />Affleck is the epitome of the no nonsense, unflappable field agent. He also rocks superb facial hair that he really should keep.<br /><br />Despite the machinations of the State Department, the film caper never quite gets nixed, and Mendez goes in to Tehran. Now the film enters overdrive: the Iranians have twigged that six diplomats are missing and are running down every angle. We fret that the Canadians' domestic help may have twigged too, and spilled beans. It becomes a race against the clock, with a couple of great set pieces, one of which is in Tehran's grand bazaar (deputised for by Istanbul's bazaar, which with [[ASIN:B0083UHZK2 Taken 2]] and [[ASIN:B006X040NY Skyfall]] has hosted its fair share of blockbusters recently).<br /><br />Affleck's depiction of the Iranian revolutionaries is sympathetic (that is, more \\"Arrec Barwin\\" than Spottiswood), it being made clear at the outset that the real villain was the Shah, his presence on American soil being what precipitated the situation in the first place.<br /><br />There are the odd unnecessary tropes: a daybreak shot of the grand mosque as the Muezzin calls the faithful to prayer makes an uncalled-for appearance, and Affleck can't resist the temptation to over-cheese the ending, but these small faults aside, with a fine ensemble cast ably supported by Goodman and Arkin's comic relief, and assured directing and cinematography, this is well worth its two hours' running time.<br /><br />Olly Buxtonhe odd unnecessary tropes: a daybreak shot of the grand mosque as the Muezzin calls the faithful to prayer makes an uncalled-for appearance, and Affleck can't resist the temptation to over-cheese the ending, but these small faults aside, with a fine ensemble cast ably supported by Goodman and Arkin's comic relief, and assured directing and cinematography, this is well worth its two hours' running time.<br /><br />Olly Buxton
B0032UYFA6|5.0|I was suprised that my package arrived in the same week that I placed my order. I love this show and can't wait to sit back and watch this DVD.
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|I gave it five stars, because, for one, I love the paranormal and for two, I really like stop animation. It's fun. I thought it took a little bit to get going, but when it finally did, it turned out to be a fun movie. The voice cast did an excellent job and with John Goodman having a part in it, it just made it gold. I'm not going to give too much away, but I thought the climax of the film is something unique; I've never seen anything like that. And you really do feel for the &#34;bad girl&#34; of the film by the end of the movie. The movie has a really good message too; that bullying should be stopped. Though, it probably never will. Besides that, it was fun. Need I say more?<br /><br />Would I buy this movie? (I rented it): Yes. It reminded me of The Nightmare Before Christmas and Coraline, and if you liked those movies, you'll like this too.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest I actually use many of the ideas I have found. I love that you can find things save them and just pull them up when you want.

B0053O89RY|5.0|Modern family is one of the top comedies on television...no more need be said.  Everyone should have it.  Support good comedy.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This was my first hidden objects game and I really enjoyed it. It had good storyline and completing puzzles kept the game interesting.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|it always force closes. change that and I will give it a 5 star review. I used to love this app.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I am a die hard Supernatural addict, and i had caught most of the episodes on TV but could never catch the ones i missed.  Once I received the 7th season, i made a whole day of just watching it.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|It would be nice if all our portable devices were built in such a way that we didn't need to get a separate case. In reality they aren't & if you want to keep your devices in good shape you need one.  All cases do the same thing, but this one goes the extra mile. Not only is it attractive but has added functionality in it's standing & rotating features that come in particularly handy for wantching video or in the case of following a page of instructions while you are using your hands. I used it to keep my Kindle an odd position for an auto repair job where my hands were covered with grease but I had to be able to read the instructions line by line. If I hadn't been able to position my Kindle Fire HD to a spot I could read it, the job would have taken at least twice as long. This is just one example but I'm sure there are hundreds of situations where the same would be true. All in all this case comes highly recommended.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I got this game on my kindle forts week fine second week laggy third week couldn't. go to store fourth week crashes my kindle I couldnt get it back on so I had to purchase a new kindle all my saved apps and highscores are gone books gone so this app ducks hairy buttcrap<br />I made sure the fits thing I. did on my kindle was to write this review other than crashing my knidle it a pretty fun game
B005LAIHXQ|2.0|what a let down. waste of time and money. Its if the writers just took the old movie and redone somethings.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|they loved it! My neice and nephew love this movie and will watch it for days! I always got the 2nd one and they go crazy!
B0083SBMBM|4.0|liked it a lot and will keep looking for the next Iron man movie. This series should get doing what their doing.
B0030IIYYS|5.0|The kids love this movie! I got the 1st one as well and they love to have movie watching marathons all weekend long!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|It's not as good as the one I have one my iPhone, but it's still a good game. Mahjong is probably my favorite electronic game, and this one is good in my opinion.
1419701533|5.0|Was a GREAT set that I gifted to my nephew for his birthday.  Am hoping the other Diary of a Wimpy Kid books come out in a Hardback set too.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I am more than satisfied with this app.  It works just like and in coordination with Facebook on my iPhone and my computer.
B003VPWX6K|5.0|This was an unexpectedly good read. I enjoyed it very much.  One sees the progression of the butler throughout the novel, and many times his growth is done in a comical way.
B008458O3S|5.0|The first few levels were a bit easy...but all the prep was worthwhile at the final levels!! It was super challenging and rewarding...I couldn't put it down until it was solved!
B0086700CM|4.0|great free game for new game players and touch screen users. tutorial is easy yo understand and hands on. will definately let kids play.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|ive had this for a while now, it has really protected my phone very nicely. the screen protector is excellent, i took it off my phone a couple of times and it sticks back on like its the first time.
B007Q0OV6Q|3.0|I really love Lego and Star Wars, so does my son. We got him the advent calender last year and got it for him again this year. I'm not real happy about the price increase from last year. We got it this year, but we will not be getting one next year. It has the great pieces like last year and he can't wait until time to open them every morning. As a consumer, I'm just not happy about the price jump, but I guess as long as people pay it they will make it. If your kid(big or little) love Star Wars then this is a great idea for an Advent Calender, or just spend your money to buy a nice building set...
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I needed to be able to read PDF files on a Samsung Galaxy2 tablet and this works just fine. Using my PC I loaded the files onto a micro SD card and that is all that was needed.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|The DVD Came packaged well.  My kids (ages 5 and 3) will love it for Christmas.  It was a good buy.
B008G59IKO|3.0|I'm not one of those Green Day fans who sullenly complain that Green Day don't sound like they did in the 90s and that everything they do these days is powerpop - I loved Green Day in the 90s, I loved Green Day in the 00s, and in the 10s? I still love these guys. \\"Uno\\" was a great little record, way underrated, and had it's share of catchy numbers and enough moments to remind me of why I love Green Day. Unfortunately, the follow-up, \\"Dos\\", is less impressive record.<br /><br />I'll start with the songs I liked. \\"Stray Heart\\" might be the best song on the record. It's ridiculously catchy and has this bouncy, toe-tapping bass that you can dance to and not just pogo up and down to like in live shows but actually dancing. It's very un-Green Day in that its not punk-pop but it's still a really fun and enjoyable tune. Conversely, \\"Ashley\\" is the most Green Day sounding song on the record (\\"Nimrod\\"-era GD) with a catchy hook and driving beat, complete with trademark Tre drums. The closing song, \\"Amy\\", is Billie-Joe's tribute ballad to Amy Winehouse but beside the sentiment is a really great tune and is the song I've come back to more than any other on this record. Great sound, it has a very bare arrangement with just vocals and guitar. \\"Wild One\\" would be my final pick of the good songs on this record. It's catchy as hell with a slow and pounding beat. It sounds like a Noel Gallagher song from \\"Morning Glory\\" era Oasis complete with full on have-it guitar solo.<br /><br />There were only a couple of songs I completely disliked. \\"Lady Cobra\\" is a total rip off of the White Stripes' \\"Fell in Love with a Girl\\" but not nearly as good and \\"Nightlife\\" is this record's \\"Kill the DJ\\". It's just plain bad, slow, stupid, interminable, and has this horrible rap throughout. Really wish this had been left off the record.<br /><br />As for the others, well - you know the phrase \\"damning with faint praise\\"? That's what sums up the rest of the songs. \\"Baby Eyes\\", \\"Lazy Bones\\", \\"Stop When the Lights Flash Red\\", and \\"Wow! That's Loud\\" all have nice moments, a cool riff, but are ultimately forgettable b-sides. \\"**** Time\\" has this really weird moment where Billie-Joe goes \\"aaahhh aaahhh\\" into the mic. You know when someone imitates a large crowd cheering? That's what it sounds like. And \\"Makeout Party\\" is funny (middle aged guys rocking out about spin the bottle and truth or dare) with a great bassline but is still a really average song.<br /><br />After a strong start with \\"Uno\\", \\"Dos\\" is a dip in quality but has a few excellent songs on it that are definitely worth checking out. Here's hoping Green Day finish their 2012 trilogy strong with \\"Tre\\".the Lights Flash Red\\", and \\"Wow! That's Loud\\" all have nice moments, a cool riff, but are ultimately forgettable b-sides. \\"**** Time\\" has this really weird moment where Billie-Joe goes \\"aaahhh aaahhh\\" into the mic. You know when someone imitates a large crowd cheering? That's what it sounds like.

1451695195|5.0|This is a very well written book. He explained his experience so vividly.<br />I enjoyed reading this book.  It was very enlightening.
B004WR125O|5.0|I wish this fun tionality was built into the receiver but it works the way they said it would.  No brainer purchase.
B000ATQYT2|4.0|The Muppetse Christmas Carol is my favorite Christmas movie of all time. The personalities are great, and the song are fantastic. I actually used lyrics from one in my Christmas cards.<br /><br />I do have one COMPLAINT, however. In this particular DVD I purchased is missing a song &#34;When Love is Gone&#34; that I loved. So I have to watch my old VHS copy when I want to see that part. It's my understanding that most newer copies do not have this song in it, since it was not in the original theatre version.
B0015DROBO|5.0|There are so many things I could list that were wrong or just outright annoying with this book, but most of those have already been brought out by other reviewers. Despite its flaws however this book is still oddly compelling and Lisbeth Salander is a fantastic character to watch and read about. The mystery is gripping and is a great opening to the rest of the series. The ending did catch me by surprise, but it was a satisfying. It may be a little over hyped, but much of that hype is well deserved.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|5 stars, great book!  I can't wait for the 3rd book to come out, i'll be sad when it's over.
B001NLKT60|4.0|The book opens with Lisbeth taking some time off and basically doing what she wants where she wants. As usual she doesn't bother to let anyone know where she is and doesn't care much for the consequences of her actions. But she soon gets dragged back into the action and mystery when two journalists are killed and she is framed for it. This book starts the long process of revealing Lisbeth's personal and family history. This is a great book, but not my favorite in the series. Still a solid book.
B00846REIS|5.0|I am so glad I ordered this and Reflected in You at the same time. The book was wonderful and I can't wait to get started with the next one!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I love the way the trilogy concluded and this book had plenty of back and forth tension and drama. The courtroom drama was the best of all and it was good to see how Lisbeth finally settled everything. Definitely a great and satisfying series.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|It had big shoes to fill and it didn't feel them.  Watchable, but if you are looking for the story quality of the Alien movies, you will be disappointed.
B001DPC52C|5.0|This is a great CD/DVD package. Within Temptation is already a magnificent band and is even more fantastic live. Definitely a must have item for any WT fan.
B009FZFONO|4.0|This year has started off as much more brutal than the first two seasons.  Very good show, but be prepared to hide your face often!
B0054R6BFM|4.0|This is a great book that helps you appreciate how comments or actions that you view as small can build up over time and seriously impact a person's life. It's very well done and an interesting way to explain why someone committed suicide. I do like the book By The Time You Read This I'll Be Dead by Julie Anne Peters better, but this is still an excellent novel.
B0095R64AO|3.0|Has some good jokes.  Feels like left overs though.  I also think at just over 2 hours long, there was stuff that shouldn't have ended up in the movie.
B002RKSZS0|4.0|This is my first classic and I greatly enjoyed Jane Austen's sense of humor and sharp wit. Her characters are excellent and the main character is definitely not your typical heroine as Jane Austen is quick to point out at many opportunities. Besides I got it for free so how can I complain?
B00881VLCE|5.0|i love it and my grandchildren have enjoyed them as well were in and out of hospitals alot and this is something to help keep them busy and we do enjoy them as well great picture choices too!
B000JMKTLO|2.0|The premise and conclusion were good, but the sexual content and drug use was a big turn off for me when it came to reading this book. What kind of &#34;adult&#34; not only turns a blind eye to a thirteen year old doing drugs but even does them alongside her? I find it hard to believe that someone could disguise the murders so well especially being at that age. This may be good for some people, but I don't recommend it at all.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|i just love these klnd of movies what can i say!!! if you like red riding hood and that kind of movie you will love this too!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just finished reading the Wool Omnibus, and I was impressed. I had noticed Wool in the list of top rated sci/fi books on Amazon, and downloaded the first Wool 'book' to check it out. While I was disappointed when I discovered that it was only 49 pages long, it was well worth the cost (free!) and drew me immediately into purchasing and reading the entire Omnibus Edition. This was also well worth the price.<br />It was a complete coincidence, but I had just read The Penultimate Truth about a month ago and immediately noticed similarities. In my personal opinion, Howey weaved a far better tale than Phillip K. Dick. I will continue to read Howey's works, and, based on my experience so far, I highly recommend anything he writes.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|After having read the first book, I become fully committed to the second and third generation of characters as their lives interwove in a special time of our history. After reading this book my stray thoughts continue to go back to the characters and the situations they were left in when the book ended. Until the third in the trilogy comes out, I will be missing some friends whom I am unknown to.
B000002GKT|5.0|These guys are fantastic when putting out a studio album. This CD really shows just how powerful a band Humble Pie really was. This CD is among the favorites in my music collection.
B008KW43TE|5.0|This album deserves all the accolades it's receiving. Haven't heard a mainstream R&B Album this good in ages. Highly recommend. Best tracks are Sweet Life, Super Rich Kids and Bad Religion
0399157565|4.0|I have always enjoyed Patricia Cornwell's writing. I look forward to the next page as I amreading and before I know it the book has ende.
0385333846|5.0|Joel Witt and co.<br />AP LIT Group Book Review: Evaluate the Work<br /> The overall purpose of Slaughterhouse Five was to write about antiwar sentiments, covering the fire bombing of Dresden in Germany during World War II. Vonnegut himself said that writing an antiwar book would do as much about war as writing a book about glaciers would to stop their motion. With that said his overall writing style was different and at times unfamiliar. He would talk about the event and then fast forward or rewind in time about stories with a particular character and he maintained that style throughout the book.  In the end his writing style helped make his point effective on why war is bad. It might have been easier to understand if perhaps he had spoken directly about the story the entire time with pre exposition and character build up like books we're familiar with, but his point was made and he did his job. His overall writing format was odd but when looking at the diction and sentence make up, the plot was easy to follow. He was able to be effective because his thoughts were simple.<br />Vonnegut created a pattern when dealing with death, always closing his thoughts with \\"so it goes.\\" This was a somewhat humorous and effective way to talk about an idea as serious as death. It essentially goes back to the theme of the story with the bombing of Dresden and the civilian deaths that occurred. His overall writing style, although different, was effective for making a statement. Vonnegut is able to portray the destructiveness of war through Billy who constantly switches from past, present, and future.<br /> Although it was written in an abstract manner Slaughterhouse Five magnifies the pointlessness of war and the atrocities that go along with it. His final quote with the bird \\"Poo-tee-weet\\" essentially was used as an analogy to war and that it solves nothing, which connects back to the antiwar theme.  Vonnegut was able to make his abstract writing style effective in proving his point.
B000002QWD|5.0|Bing Crosbys most known Christmas is White Christmas. He also did ones like Ill be home for Christmas Silver Bells Santa Claus is Coming to Town Jingle Bells Its Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas among others some of which are not well known. All you have to do to find that out is get his double cd The Decca Songbook The Christmas Collection I think its called. Meanwhile you should get this album too. Merry Christmas.
B0012UOWBA|5.0|Saw the film on tv years ago - just loved it - and now I have it to enjoy whenever.
B003Y5H542|2.0|Decent movie. Upset that I received a damaged dvd causing the storyline to freeze and skip near the end of the film.  I'm guessing 1-2 minutes is lost.  Not worth the hassle of returning, but worth mentioning.<br /><br />Animation and colors are very good.  Story is decent, but there are many parts I would consider inappropriate for younger kids.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|This is a really good series.  I am not too crazy about the zombies, and the blood and gore....but it is just so compelling. Every episodfe is well done and makes you want to watch the next one.
B0038M61JQ|5.0|This is a must have for all Jazz guitar aficionados by one of the all time great guitarist at his absolute best.
B004GTQ4DI|5.0|So good. I loved how the characters ended up.  Such a beautifully done series.  Sad to see it end. I started last night and finished this evening.
1435114949|5.0|Buy this if you like and want to read Sherlock Holmes! By the way, the typos that people keep talking about, aren't even typos. They're just spelled the British way. In Europe and Canada, some words are spelled differently.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I am a huge Angry Birds fan, so of course had to have this one. It's like all the others, just with a different theme, but I still like it.
B007PKSN6Q|4.0|We rented the movie Rock of Ages last weekend and I immediately ordered the soundtrack.<br />We LOVED the movie, we were both born in the 60's so this is the music we grew up with,<br />the music in the movie was excellent and the soundtrack is really good! I crank it up<br />while I do my housework, although I think that may actually slow me down because I have to<br />stop to dance!  If you love 80's music you will enjoy this soundtrack, I was impressed that<br />the actors from the movie actually sang the songs.  I would prefer the original artists but<br />this is several great songs all together.
B0058W74UY|1.0|This app is junk.  I uninstalled it right away.  The first thing that it did was reach out and connect to the Internet which makes me suspicious.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Thanks J.K. Rowling for transcending me back to the crappiest reality of our everyday lives.  I like to escape reality when I read fiction, not have its darker truths shoved in my face. Awesome.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|I came late to this album; I'm sorry I didn't find it sooner,I just can't get enough of it.  Beth Hart is just amazing on this, some of the most passionate & powerful vocals I've heard since the oft compared Janis Joplin (and I did get to hear Janis live!).  Joe Bonamassa even cuts back on his usual excessive guitar overindulgentses  and plays some pretty effective blues but Beth Hart OWNS this album.  I think \\"I'd Rather Go Blind\\" is the masterpiece of the album' just incredible! She even does a great job on the the Tom Waits song,\\"Chocolate Jesus\\", something not many people can do well.  (I'm a huge Tom Waits fan but his material is not easy to cover well-unless you're John Hammond or Beth Hart.) If you want hear the recent spate of saccharine female \\"singers\\" put to shame this is the album for you. It surely is a treat for me.
B007EE564U|4.0|Nothing to disappoint the Mitch Rap followers . Good story, fast moving but missed a bit of detail towards the end.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|The sellers description was accurate, quick shipping, great transaction.  Get this set if you love sex and the city!  The collectors edition make its hard fo you to lose a series.
B00004TS0E|5.0|I like this movie.Thats why i purchased it.I also love the the first one.I am happy that i bought it.
B0071MDA2U|5.0|Good story, I'm on the edge of my seat waiting for the final book to come out. I can not wait to see what happens!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I can't rate this game because it's a gift that we have heard much about...people who play it love it!
B004E0Z4XK|4.0|This is an amazing album. Norah Jones shines as does the instrumentals! Great production quality. Definitely one of my favorite albums.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|A GREAT family movie, great for husbands/guys, will challenge you in these days we're living in to be a better person
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this app for work and it makes it very easy to keep notes even when I don't have access to my<br />computer. I just enter the notes in my phone and they show up on my computer once I connect to the internet.
0060254920|5.0|A book with  adventure and fantasy.  Easy to read and great for bedtime story.  Both boys and girls love this story alike.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|This book was recommended and I did enjoy the first few pages about sky diving and such.  What really turned me off is a part that is inconsistent, after he states he was intubated he later describes that his family and others in ER heard him yell out &#34;Lord help me!&#34;.  One does not speak after being intubated.  Enough said...
B009LA1QW6|5.0|First Lana Del Rey was \\"Born to Die\\", now she is in \\"Paradise\\". This 8-track EP is a consistent continuation of her debut album. \\"Paradise\\" is current but without that glossy, mainstream production. And yet it's old-fashioned but without sounding dated. \\"Born to Die\\" quickly became my favorite album of 2012 and I couldn't wait to get my hands on \\"Paradise\\"! There is only one song that doesn't grab my full attention, \\"Yayo\\" - probably because I've never been a fan of jazz music in my life. Lana does what she can with the ballad, it's messy in parts but Lana's voice is in fine form and I can't help but have a fondness for when she sings, \\"Let me put on a show for you tiger...\\" The first single, \\"Ride\\" - we find Lana reflecting on the darker side of her personality and the depths of loneliness, \\"I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast - I am alone at midnight. Been trying hard not to get into trouble but I've got a war in my mind, so I just ride...\\" On \\"Cola\\" which is her most x-rated song to date, she proudly admits she's got \\"a taste for men who are older...\\" And I love how Lana uses string arrangements all throughout the album just like she did on \\"Born to Die\\". There's even a gorgeous, classy cover of \\"Blue Velvet\\" which proves Lana has a lot of emotion and soul in her voice. \\"Gods and Monsters\\" is the best song on the album which explores the negative aspects of fame while \\"Bel Air\\" is the flipside, it has an airy, dream-like quality about how fame and success are the ultimate pay off. \\"American\\" is a beautiful ballad, easily one of Lana's most confessional songs so far. \\"Body Electric\\" didn't really resonate with me at first, it's strange, disjointed, and a little repetitive on the chorus but I've really grown to like this surprise gem, and I love the line, \\"Whitman is my daddy, Monaco's my mother, diamonds are my bestest friend. Heaven is my baby, suicide's her father, opulence is the end...\\" I really enjoyed this EP. Lana Del Rey is the breakout artist of the year for me. Her music and voice is so unique, there is no one like her...she's in a league all her own and thank goodness for that! I highly recommend \\"Paradise\\".ist of the year for me. Her music and voice is so unique, there is no one like her...she's in a league all her own and thank goodness for that! I highly recommend \\"Paradise\\".
B004V5A7K8|5.0|This game is very similar to the old Atari Pong.  Excellent graphics and very easy to play although it gets harder as you progress.  This is one of those games that I keep going back to after getting bored with other games.
1932735410|3.0|I used this book. Read and reviewed it 4 times but did not pass the exam first time.  Haven't scheduled 2nd yet.  Exam is a twisted word puzzle and so is this book.  Just not match enough to get you through
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. What amazes me is how engrossed I got in the story, and how much I rooted for the main character. The story is creative and imaginative and it just comes across as authentic. It is obvious that the author loved the 70s and 80s and has played more than his fair share of video games. I loved how everything was intertwined. Great story-telling.<br /><br />I give this book 7 stars ... awesome.
B007B5EDEG|3.0|Overpriced for a Kindle edition. If pricing for Kindle developed like this I would rethink keeping this technology.and prefer paper.
B009GIPDQS|4.0|The Racketeer, another good John Grisham read, with plenty of action and keeping the reader guessing right up to the final chapter.
B000QUCNXG|3.0|I personally didn't enjoy it especially starting from the part where he met the girl. Getting hired by Underwood samson was exciting enough I wished he just focused more on that aspect. Like how he had to travel to Brazil and Philippines.
0441020712|3.0|This book took me forever to get through, and I'm an extremely fast reader.  The last 25% was the most interesting for me, and when I couldn't put the book down.<br /><br />I liked the idea of the storyline, but this book really dragged for me.
B002BWQ6H6|2.0|Some interesting parts, but just didn't work for me. A slow and tedious read. Also pretty depressing view of the current state of affairs.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I think this movie deserves 5 plus stars.  I loved the story and the characters worked so well together. Tony Stark was my favorite.
0061474355|5.0|This novel (and series) has long been a favourite of mine, and was the one that introduced me to the author Garth Nix. This is fantasy as it should be, with a well realised character and world, along with an interesting magic system, in this case necromancy - though not even remotely similar to that as I've seen anywhere else, along with a plot and pacing that just compels you to continue on til the finish, and eager to read more. Though often classed as young adult fiction, this is a thoroughly entertaining read for most ages, though younger readers may enjoy it there are some darker themes, and as such care should be taken before recommending to those under 12 or so.
B0095R6OBS|5.0|I liked this because I watched it as a kid.  I loved the newer version but this was a good story.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Love Big Bang and was do glad to find the 4th season! Price was great and so was the fast service!
B009VB7P6G|5.0|I chose this rating because this was the best of Tinkerbell and I really liked the story and so did my ten year old daughter.
B005GRTNVE|5.0|I really enjoy what the four of them can do to make an ordinary song sound spectacular!!<br />The are the inheritors of the Three Tenors!!
B009HEJXFS|5.0|I think this one was the best of the series!  The relationship between Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are great and the great plot twist at the end is great.
B005KDWUFA|5.0|They are wonderful Tenors with a huge talent! There are none better these days!! I buy all their CDs and DVDs!!
B005FRF6PC|5.0|Well written. There are a lot of feelings, situations, internal and external influences and of course the rituals, friends, sponsor, team and familiar relationships that as a general tennis fan we can't imagine but at the end in someway are reflected at court. Also some key points/games of important tournaments are described in a fascinating narration. Doesn't matter which is your preferred sport or tennis player you will enjoy the book stories and learn from this particular process of a professional elite player.
B000056HE9|5.0|I first viewed this movie on television and knew then I had to have my own personal copy.  My fianc'ee and I had just watched it for the first time since my purchase and we both loved it.  This movie is a must have for those who believe in God and the power He has over mankind.
B009FB3XTA|4.0|I always enjoy the soundtracks that have come out for the Twilight Saga and this one is no exception.  LOVE Green Day, The Forgotten and of course, Christina Perri bringing back A Thousand Years (with some assistance).  Even the Nikki Reed and Paul McDonald song is beautiful, along with several others.  I enjoy listening to the eclectic various tunes that are included - I enjoy variety.  Loved the movie - it was an AWESOME ending to the Saga!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love this game. works wonderful on my Kindle Fire. easy to lose track of time playing this game. love getting the puzzle pieces!
B009AZZEU2|4.0|It's nice to hear that Soundgarden put out a worthy release.  I have listened to this CD quite alot and it still is good.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|i have a lot of match 3 games on my kindle. this is by far my favorite one. challenging and fun. worth getting the paid version. works very well on my Kindle Fire
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I wasn't as enthralled with this one as the first one.  However, having family from Germany (late 1800;s) I found the fictional treatment of families in Europe caught in the War plausible.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|although I've deleted this off my Kindle Fire I want to say the graphics and gamplay are fantastic. the overall view is the reason I wanted to try this. very well presented and a plus to anyone that's a fan of these type games
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|app dosen't work properly....too many bugs and issues.  I liked the game, but if it doesn't function properly, what is the point?  I am certainly not motivated to buy the other version of this game, it may have the same bugs....
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Yes, it is a novel, a work of fiction, but it is chock full of history. Why did Europe go to war over the assassination of an heir to a throne? Why did the US get into it? The sex is quite descriptive and actually detracts from the story in places. It seems to be added for the sake of having a shocking sex scene rather than making a contribution to the story. I'm not a prude, I'm just saying. Ken Follet is a great story teller. For a large book, this is a fast read that I recommend.
B006QF61VA|5.0|I think this film showcases Robin Williams at his best! I'll be watching it again. You will want to, also. :-)

0393080269|4.0|Mr. Sharma dissects the growth potential of every country that registers on the global growth scale with the precision of a surgeon.  For long stretches at a time, every paragraph contains a dizzying financial statistic, but remarkably, Mr. Sharma pulls off a readable account of who has done what and what is in their future.<br /><br />The U.S. is touted as \\"the king of the global growth game\\", but Mr. Sharma seems to ignore the debilitating political challenges facing the nation, not the least of which may be manifested in the 2012 fiscal cliff.  The last time there was a standoff in raising the debt ceiling, the U.S. lost its perfect credit rating.  And there are some inaccuracies in historical milestones such as how the U.S. pulled itself out of the 1929 depression that lasted a decade.  Here, Mr. Sharma completely ignored the Keynesian influence, and repeated the error towards the end of the book when he advocated a hard landing from a financial crisis, in effect arguing against fiscal stimulus and government intervention.<br /><br />\\"Breakout Nations\\" obviously does not provide the reader with a set of formulas to predict the next breakout nation.  The identification of emerging market potential is more an art than science, and any reasonably accurate forecast beyond 5-10 years is fleeting.  Even if all the fundamentals of a market economy are in place, it only takes a nut job such as Hugo Chavez to ruin everything.<br /><br />Lots of material to digest, written in easy to understand and coherent form.  I would recommend this book to readers who have an interest beyond investing in emerging markets.  There's a good bit of history lessons since economic upheavals never fail to stir the pot and instigate delectable historical events.  There are some positions the author takes that aren't in sync with popular opinion, but nevertheless, there is much to be gleaned from that make \\"Breakout Nations\\" worth the read.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|THIS IS AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT. ESPECIALLY FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE<br />LIMITED SIGHT, OR ARE BLIND. IT EVEN READS TO YOU.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|Good quality and remaster of the the first 2.<br /><br />The set's box is designed to look like a book out of cardboard. You either love it or hate it.<br />The con is the &#34;discs mount&#34; design, which are actually sleeves in the cardboard book/case.<br />This does cause scratching of the discs.
B00632HWOG|3.0|I HAVE HAD YAHOO MAIL FOR YEARS, BUT RECENTLY I HAVE HAD<br />TROUBLE LOADING UP MY E-MAIL. I HOPE IT IMPROVES IN THE FUTURE.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|Would not rate the story of plot too high but is not bad. I feel it tries a little too hard to explain the genesis of the alien in the Alien series. I guess it is attempting to provoke the posit of us seeded by an alien race, yet leaves more questions than answers. Yes, as many others said, the part on petting an alien life-form is not credible and feel stupid.<br /><br />However, I do still enjoy the movie, be it as the prequel of the Alien series or not.<br />Bluray quality is good.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|I, lately have not been a big fan of the animated films coming out of late.  'Toy Story 3' was my favorite so far.  There was something about 'Brave' that kept telling me to watch it.  So I rented it and loved it!  I like the fact that it wasn't about a girl and a boy, but about a girl and her family, which made me happy.<br /><br />There where somethings that were like all other films but it didn't hurt my vision towards the film.  The only thing I didn't like was parts of the story seemed rushed and didn't stick, and some things could have been flushed out a little bit better.<br /><br />All in all I really liked the movie and I plan to buy it.
B000IDGDPA|1.0|The movie fails to come together with a cohesive tone or theme. The satirical gossip of townsfolk was juxtaposed with Scarlett Johansson's try-to-be-true drama. Marriage is scoffed at one minute, then sanctified the next. Some of the plot tweaks and added scenes from the novel also make less than perfect sense, when taken in context of the plot twist.
B008XFB86Y|5.0|I cannot say enough about this movie.  I saw a preview of it at 'Indiewire.com' and was blown away.<br /><br />What I loved about it was it wasn't like American films, where every little thing has to be explained to the viewer.  I am never a fan of that.  It puts you right into the story it's a really cool but simple story.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Asian film this is a much watch movie
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|My rating is simply for the movie, not this specific product.  My boys 5 & 4 simply loved this movie.  My wife & I agreed that this will now be another Christmas classic.  We loved the new take on the Kringles operation up in the North Pole.  Hahahahhaha
145210655X|5.0|I bought this book for my brother who loves Star Wars. Now I want one for myself to leave on the coffee table. The comics are really cute, and clearly the author is a Star Wars fan, using lines from the movies. My brother is going to love it.

B009GEBBNQ|4.0|Definitely worth watching, it lives up to expecation and keeps interested. I didnt think it would be this good so I was pleasantly surprised.
0307887898|5.0|A friend of mine recommended me to read this book. Al I have to say is - its excellent read.<br /><br />If you are seriously wanting to start a tech company/ venture of your own..this book is very helpful. Practical advice and very easy to understand.<br /><br />Good job ! Eric Ries
0525952926|4.0|Follett writes a great book - interesting characters  and good historical facts- Winter of the World. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and would recommend it to friends.

B004V5QWU2|1.0|worthless, when the rain noise had VERY noticeable hitch when it looped, i didn even bother with rest of the sounds. one would think looping not be noticed, but  it is.....VERY noticeable.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|very smoth and has many good features like<br /> sharing files from ur pc<br /><br />im so glad to see it no amazon app store
B000L212HC|4.0|this is a great movie... so much so that i want to show it to a friend... i bought it just so that she could see it...  the weekend after we saw it... i found that i already owned the movie...  so i guess i really like it.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Always like reading a Harry Bosch novel<br /> He solved the crimes he is assigned in his own way. Harry is, also always in some authority figures sights. Somehow, he always manages to win & fight another day.
0446693804|1.0|My 7th grader could barely get through it.  Not sure the significance of putting in on the summer reading list.  When I started reading it, I knew EXACTLY what was going to happen half way through chapter 2. Wish I was wrong. Very predictable, typical, sad, and rather boring. Thank goodness it's not too long.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I've had my MDR-7506 headphones for about 8 years now and they are still my go-to 'phones for virtually everything.  Even after having purchased the much-more expensive and allegedly higher-end MDR-7509s, and comparing high-end models headphones from several other manufacturers, the MDR-7506 (and sister model MDR-V6) are still my headphones of choice.<br /><br />Their frequency response may not be perfectly flat, but it is still awfully good.  They accentuate bass a tiny bit, but not in a \\"Beats\\" kind of way.  It's natural sounding, and not the least bit boomy or overwhelming like you typically find on \\"high end\\" consumer headphones.  Imaging is also essentially flawless, or at least as flawless as over-the-ear headphones can get.<br /><br />Aside from the very slight bass boost, the response and sound quality is fantastic.  There is definitely a reason that sound engineers keep selecting this model of headphones.  They just sound that great.<br /><br />I also find them to be very comfortable as well, even for long periods of time.<br /><br />Overall, these are amazing headphones.  The only other model I'd consider buying at this point is the Sony MDR-V6, which are absolutely identical aside from a shorter warranty and nickel-plated connector instead of the gold-plated one found on these.
1936608618|5.0|I was referred to pick this up by a friend and I cannot set it down! This book is a must have for any athlete who is training to get better at a certain skill or to just simply understand the mechanics of a certain movement. I really enjoy how this book wraps the Crossfit domain with an endurance model to focus on 1) techniques, 2) intensity, and 3) volume. By establishing and following this \\"Crossfit Endurance\\" model, it just makes sense to focus on quality of training versus quantity of training.<br /><br />I really enjoyed how this literature contains chapters on individual skills. The chapters were very informative with the description of movements, the mechanics behind it, and drills to practices these certain skills. The chapters were also really reader friendly with the amount of detailed pictures. I really learned a few things that I thought I already knew in each chapter. Certain chapters helped me more than others but overall, this was a very good book to review some movements. I certainly recommend it to anyone who is training for competition or just training recreationally. It's reader friendly and contains a lot of information so if you are trying to work on your running, cycling, swimming, strength and conditioning, mobility, or just programming a workout, I highly suggest this book and it's \\"skilled-based approach to endurance training\\".
B004EPZ034|5.0|My grandchildren love to watch Alvin movies when they come to visit. I was delighted to add this one to my collection.
0199566941|5.0|Despite the massively high cost, this book is a true demonstration of the old saying that you get what you pay for. It is truly authoritative. It takes a purely non-judgemental and non-partisan approach to Shari'a - a rare thing where many books are written with one or other partisan approach in evidence.<br />It starts with a strong discussion of the roots of Shari'a, the origins and positions of the main Schools of Fiqh and their general approaches to financial products. It then goes through the main products in detail, describing well the main features of each and any problems or defects that each of the main Schools may see with each products and its variants.<br />In all of this, it does not seek to pass judgement on which products are, or are not, compliant with Shari'a, it merely explains any difficulties under each Schools' approach to compliance.<br />On the downside, the law that is most closely examined is the common law of England and the United Kingdom. In considering taxation, it also concentrates on the UK experience. Fortunately, for those in Common Law countries with VAT/GST or similar systems this is not a serious issue.<br /><br />If you are serious about learning the law in relation to Islamic Finance and you live in a Common Law jurisdiction then this is the best book I have yet found.<br /><br />If the price is too high, do as I did and suggest to your library that they purchase it.
B005S9ELM6|4.0|First of all I give it 4.5 stars.  Full Disclosure: I like spy movies, I like realistic and historical movies, I'm tired of silly fantasy flicks and I want more movies like this one!  In my opinion the essence of a spy movie is the ability of the director to get the viewer engaged and empathetic with the characters, and then feel the tension as the possibility of getting caught and punished (imprisoned for life?  Hanged?  Tortured?) is always hovering over everything.  This movie accomplishes that!  It's based on real history, so the story has that extra edge of truth to ground the plot.<br /><br />Ben Affleck plays a very charismatic yet realistic member of the CIA, an \\"Exfil\\" specialist, who is trying to exfiltrate 6 Americans who escaped from the doomed American embassy in Iran and are hiding out in the house of a Canadian ambassador.  I really like Affleck's no-BS performance.  (I think that he's maturing as an actor and, like Dicaprio and Tom Cruise, is getting very good at playing more serious and realistic roles these days.)<br /><br />Affleck's character (Tony Mendez) comes up with a cockamanie idea to gin up a fake movie production based upon a real script (\\"Argo\\", a cheesy sci-fi film), get some publicity for it from his Hollywood co-conspirators, and go over to Iran as a Canadian film producer.  His idea is to hoodwink the totalitarian Iranian government apparatus that 6 Canadian members of his film crew are on-site with him to scout the film, and then they'll just return to Canada by air.  Audacious, crazy, full of weaknesses, but as the dialogue says, \\"It's the best Bad Idea that we have.\\"  Mendez's Hollywood willing co-conspirators (played delightfully by John Goodman and Alan Arkin) are willing to go along 100% with the ruse, to make it seem as though Argo is legit.  That's the fun part of the film.<br /><br />It's when you are \\"in\\" Iran that the film really hits home.  It makes you really think that you are there.  The initial scenes of the Americanembassy getting over-run and the 6 people escaping is gripping.  The scenes of terror in the post-Shah Islamic Republic of Iran effectively convey the chaos, hatred, mob dynamics and fear of a fanatical, America-hating foreign country under Jihadish revolution.  But the movie really kicks into gear when Mendez goes there and actually starts implementing his plan.  The tension kicks up a notch when the 6 escapees realize that they have to do this, kicks up another notch when they start executing their plan, and kicks waaaay up as they are actually trying to get out!  You understand all the time that there is no guarantee of success (and that the odds of escaping are actually against them).<br /><br />I really like the ride that this movie gives.  Kudos to Affleck for directing it and in his portrayal of a true American hero, Tony Mendez of the CIA!
1118109791|5.0|This review book met and exceeded all of my expectations.  Was very helpful in preparing me to take the GMAT exam.
0062127241|5.0|I really enjoyed this romp.  I've long been a fan of both The Who and Pete's solo material.  I was eager to learn what Pete Townshend was all about and I was more than happy with his candor and openness.  The complexity of his work mirrors the complexity of his life.  A driven and sometimes compulsive man, one gets the feeling that he gave everything that he had to everything that he did.  As a lifelong musician, this was deeply satisfying to me in that his material and many other bright and talented groups and individuals are the story of my life.  I've copied and emulated their styles and eventually made them my own.  It's neat to have gone through all of that material again and somehow feel that I was a part of it, even tangentially, as a fan.  Great job Pete, and thanks for sharing yet more of your life with us!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love that it can actually talk. I thought this feature was cute, that you can select when the app will sound an alarm (or voice) when it reaches certain percentages. Mine says &#34;your battery is at 50%&#34; and you can also see how long your battery will last for almost anything you want to use it for.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Cant put it down once I get started! But the pieces are kinda small on the screen sometimes. Gotta try this one out! :)
B00633W614|4.0|Terrific author and Great series.  Can't wait for the next one to come out.  The history is an important part of the story and seems quite accurate.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Good plot.  Characters really come to life.  i did find myself skimming in the areas that were too graphic for me :)
0802473156|5.0|Everyone in the world should read this book! It is good for all relationships (spouse, children, co-workers)... absolutely wonderful!! I have bought several copies.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|These work great for hooking my cameras (Canon 50d and 60d). I shoot in RAW and was able to pull the images over to my iPad quickly. I use a couple different apps once I have them over on my iPad to edit the Raw files and convert them to JPEG.<br /><br />I would recommend this kt to anyone who wants to hook their camera to their iPad and be editing files in a few minutes. You won't do high end edits with you iPad but you can do some cool stuff.
B007THA4FI|3.0|You really need a character map to keep up with all of the characters and the relationships between them.  It is not a light read, but it is well written.  Stick with it...I hear that it goes pretty fast once you get through a couple hundred pages...if you can.
0525953728|5.0|Very well written! Every page held my attention. I didn't want to put it down. Congratulations to Seal Team Six!
B004HYDM0A|4.0|I enjoyed this movie very much. It turned out a lot different than I thought in the beginning, but I was very pleased with the way they accepted what the outcome was without trashing her.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This description of a NED was amazing because a scientist/doctor experienced and wrote about it.  Though it was very difficult for him to describe what he experienced, I felt like I was reliving it along with him.  He message of love and compassion can be confirmed in many other NED's and revelations.
B0035LJZ1Q|3.0|I liked the movie. The acting was good and all. However, being the story of the headless horseman I believe they could have done it a little better. Good movie for free, just regret spending money on it.
B005AERS74|5.0|Got this album off amazon for a great price. You cant beat it. I believe it is one of maroon 5 better albums that they have come out with. You cant go wrong.
0399156577|5.0|Fiona Bristow has finally found a place of peace and solitude on Orcas Island.  In her past, she escaped a violent serial killer, but it has taken her years to feel safe again.<br /><br />And with her business training Search and Rescue dogs, she feels a measure of control.<br /><br />But a newcomer on the island is about to shake things up for her.  How will Simon Doyle insert himself into her life in both positive and negative ways?  Will he effectively break through the barriers she has set up?<br /><br />Meanwhile, her old nemesis, the Red Scarf Killer, locked away in prison, has apparently trained someone to pick up where he left off, targeting young women in the same way as his mentor, but with a goal of finally taking down Fiona, the one who got away.<br /><br />Themes of search and rescue populate this novel:  searching for lost people; searching for perpetrators; and finally, searching for love, peace, and solace.  [[ASIN:0515149489 The Search]] is filled with wonderful characters, like Fiona, Simon Doyle, and her stepmother Sylvia.  And the dogs are like people, too, richly fleshed out through the details the author shows us.<br /><br />A fast-paced story that still manages to give us the small and wonderful moments in life, it also folds in the beautiful surroundings and makes us want to visit the gorgeous island where these characters live.  Five stars.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|I bought this Movie as a gift for my husband, it is his fav!! It was my first time buying from amazon. I was very impressed by how fast it got here and how simple the purchasing was!
B001EN71CW|5.0|Have watched Firefly since I had to guess when it was on on fox.  Got mine for $10 so you can't go wrong there!
B0071BGOJC|5.0|This is one of the most accurate novels I have read of the second World War.<br />This is a page-turner and very well put together.<br />To me this is the best of the Triology and I highly recommend
B0000AMRJC|5.0|Great value with the bonus feature disc and super fast shipping! Glad I bought this classic movie at such a great price! Exceeded my expectations on delivery, quality and price! I highly recommend this seller :Noram International Partners, Inc.  The used discs are in perfect condition and play without any issue on all of my DVD players.
B000I9U9A4|2.0|Very poor copy.  Too dark to see in many parts.<br />No more DVDs from Amazon.  I will buy this<br />elsewhere
030758836X|2.0|The book was interesting and different, but the ending was a huge let down. Wouldn't recommend this book to a friend.
1451695195|5.0|Have read many books on this subject and this one also gives me hope that there is love and paradise waiting after we leave here. It also helps that this was experienced by a member of the medical community who many times, tries to find a pathophysiologic view on why people experience what they do, when they have a near death experience.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|Package showed up right on time. It took a while because of where i live but still nice service. And it came with a free persona4 protector screen which was a plus.
B007JOM0GC|3.0|I really liked a lot of the songs from this CD. I would have rated it higher except that a number of the songs are on the \\"trashy\\" side. If you have any young daughters at home,steer them towards Taylor Swift.
0316067598|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, truly a great read. I could not put it down! (After the first half). Just when you suspect the book to end, the action continues for another 100 pages! Thank you to all the service men and women out there.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Just finished reading Nelson DeMille's &#34;The Panther&#34;. John Cory, former NYPD detective, now a member of the Joint Terrorist Task Force at his best. He and his FBI Special Agent wife (also a member of the Task Force) are sent to Yemen to hunt down the Panther. Yemen an unstable country where nothing is really the truth. Who is double crossing whom is the norm and what is really the end game. It is here that John Corey, who killed the Lion, is the bait to lure the Panther out. The story takes many twists and turns, with many lies uncovered. In the ending, back in New York, there is the making of another lie. A great story. Hard to put down.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Kidz .... if we keep the kid in us alive we will continue to grow. Stephen King continues to remind us of this. Constant readers rock!
B009FOBZL0|5.0|I really enjoy this wallflowers CD. They returned to creating great music that a lot of people can enjoy. I also got to see them live in Dallas, Tx and IT WAS AWESOME!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Mr. Howey has created a confined yet expansive new world with many, many stories to tell. I am anxiously awaiting the sequels and prequels. If you're a fan of post apocalyptic science fiction, you do not want to miss these series of stories.
B007PKSN6Q|4.0|I enjoyed all the tracks and really enjoyed the movie.  Tom Cruise can sing and his presentation in the movie was superb.
B004XWLIJS|4.0|I'm a big fan of Jason Statham, and enjoyed this film a lot.  There's plenty of action to keep you entertained.  The only downside was the film didn't take the extra time to flesh out the characters more, and really there wasn't much reason not to.  A little more time spent on the major characters and their relationships with one another would have given this movie a lot more punch.  Maybe that will all come out in a directors cut, who knows.  All in all a good film.
B006MVJ2L4|4.0|I liked his earlier CD, For Your Entertainment much better.  His soundtrack from the video Glam Nation is far superior in my opinion (and the video was great but you have to be prepared for some &#34;extraordinary&#34; presentation!).
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|I absolutely love this group! Their interpretations of the music they choose is absolutely wonderful!  I recommend this group to everyone who loves creativity in music!
B008C40218|4.0|I have many Calexico CDs, all of which I really enjoy.  This CD was good but not much different from some of their previous, good CDs.  But would recommend it.
B005PWPUW6|5.0|It is easy to use. And converted my DVD plyer so tatit could work on my AMP for Surround sound in the room.
B008FOB124|4.0|I am enjoying this CD, but one has to have a taste for this off beat, almost oriental style.  I do like it and would recommend it if it is the style one likes.
6305127638|4.0|One of the best Star Trek Next Generation films to date.. The borg have invaded earth and it is up to the enterprise crew to save the day once again ! I recommend buying it if you are a fan
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Fabulous.  Such an interesting and real story. Such great writing.  I couldn't put it down.  I would love to read it again.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This was a thoroughly fun game. No issues and plenty of game play!!! Definately worth the price and am looking forward to more like like this one cause I'll be first in line to purchase!
B008Y2IU12|5.0|I love dark versions of classic fairytails. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
B001EN71CW|5.0|Joss Whedon should have had a longer run with this series, but FOX killed it.  Luckily for us, we can now enjoy the existing episodes in true HD.  Firefly has a huge following and every fan should have this Blu Ray version even if they already own it on regular DVD.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Let me say that I absolutely loved the original &#34;Vacation&#34;. After that the movies went downhill until this one came out way back when. I loved it the first time that I saw it and have always laughed every year when it is shown around Christmas. This year I figured, &#34;What the heck&#34; and decided to buy the Blu-ray. Now I can watch it with my other holiday favorites 'A Christmas Story' and 'The Santa Clause'. Checy Chase, Beverly D'Angelo, and Randy Quaid are flawless and the rest of the cast ranks very close.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Best read I have had in a long time!  I couldn't put it down!  Great sci-fi and excellent writing.  Read this book-it will not disappoint!
B004SBX112|4.0|I understand each device runs a different program.But you would have to think ROVIO and AMAZON would take care of those who PAY for their apps first. As of now the only way to get Winter Wonderham would be to buy the HD season's for another $3 how can they put advent themed levels and not have it update on the paid or free versions......SMH
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I love twitter because it gives you a chance to learn about other people, when I first joined I hated tweeting but then I started to get use to it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I've read all of his, and this one starts fast and keeps going.  Did a great job of renewing his characters and the plot line was fresh and current.  Not too deep, and not a lot of character color, but I think significantly better than the last couple.  Well worth the money and time.
1600597963|5.0|Being a new beginner in beading , I gleaned new ideas in bead work besides just making jewerly.  Great  book for anyone that likes embroidery or bead work!
B005974CNA|5.0|I love Dream Theater. It's hard to find their CD's in Guatemala, so I bought in presale. What you have to keep in mind is that this is a digi-pack item, so they have to have a huge caution to avoid damaging it. Besides of a small crease in the side, the CD arrived fast and cool.<br /><br />Every DT fan should buy this particular album and the special edition is really a great feature where you'll see the documentary they made to find a new drummer. I have seen it a lot of times and it's really a great plus to the regular version.<br /><br />Besides of the music, that is brutal and great (as most DT material), the art is really cool and deep, so I can assure you will enjoy the product.<br /><br />Don't doubt it. It's a really great deal. Buy it.
B005PK1G76|3.0|The size and shape are great, but because of the curse of my City Mini Stroller's handle this seems to tip back quite a bit. Maybe in time it will settle into place, but it seems to be an awkward fit.
B006GLMHBM|5.0|When Sex & the City was such a big phenomenon, I couldn't relate to it -- it seemed like such a glib, unrealistic fantasy.  I  came into it when Charlotte was on her marriage-quest & had dumbed down quite a bit, so I couldn't see how she fit with the other characters.  Watching the first season, I finally saw the character's smarts & backbone.<br />Plus, the pop-culture frenzy surrounding it was a real turn-off for me -- forced & frantic.  Watching it now just as a show, looking for the writing & acting -- I see how sharp, funny, & humane it really was.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Read the actual ages ago,but rented it off my free month of Prime and read it through again. Always loved it and probably always will. If you loved the first book, you'll love this as well. Awesome read!

B004SJ3AXI|4.0|The only thing I don't like about it is not being able to complete as many levels as I would like:)
B008WCP2PG|1.0|Blah... trailer, movie, not much different than in theaters. I guess low budget means even much lower budget on the DVD/Bluray. Disappointing.
B002RVZV9K|5.0|This is a gem of a film. To see the creative process of these men was remarkable! I highly recommend it.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|Heres a cute seniors type of movie not typical of the usual Hollywood fare.I saw this movie in the theater this past summer,and of course it couldnt compete with the shoot em up or teeny bopper drivel.It was gone before a buzz could be started .But if you want a real heartfelt look at what happens closer to the endzone of life with a little cheek and humor,here it is.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|This book is not as good as the other diary of a wimpy kid books. Shoudn`t greg be in high school now anyways
B0006JGFNQ|3.0|It is really cute, but all around the ears there is glue showing. It is quite thick and cannot be removed. I would return it, but I do not want to go through the hassle.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am not one to really write reviews as I don't feel that I have an affinity for it. However, this series has caused me to WANT to say something.<br /><br />Wool is an exciting series that is inventive and new. I am usually one that does not like books with a lot of description or listening into the characters' innermost thoughts.  While Wool has this, Mr. Howey's way of writing the story makes even these pages fly by.  There were many times when I though that I knew what was going to happen, only to have a character or the story go in a complelely new direction.<br /><br />I can't wait until spring when Mr. Howey's prequel to Wool will be released. Don't wait until then though. Get Wool and read it now. It is a terrific bargain.
B009AJD5E0|1.0|I was really looking forward to this one. I have been an Aliens and Predator fan since the beginning. I'm just gonna pretend this one doesnt exist.
B008ZOHCKE|3.0|Didnt really have much use for it. Though it would be cool and tried it but I rarely used it and deleted it.
B008Y1RTUG|3.0|On the one hand, Charlize was incredible and played the perfect Queen. On the other, Kristen Stewart played her typical plain jane self. She doesnt know how to act and you cant tell this character apart from her Bella character except a slight accent change that was not believable. It was entertaining but could have been better with a change of Snow Whites character to another actor.
B005PK553C|5.0|This has become one of my favorite shows. If you love the horror genre you will love this for sure!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game because it is a bunch of games in one. It makes you determined to get at least four thousand points!!!!
B0067TQQI8|4.0|Battery works as promised. The adapter used to recharge it should have been a std usb adapter...otherwise a good product.
1451695195|1.0|I couldn't get past page 77 -- it is boring, repetitive and much too long.  This should've been a magazine article, not a book.<br /><br />Most of the story is about what happens here on earth with his family, which is all very predictable, and often irrelevant.  Do we really need to know that his father was the only surgeon in the Pacific theatre during WW2 who could perform ear, nose and throat surgery?  It has no relevance to the story.  Likewise the entire first chapter about his skydiving days:  irrelevant.<br /><br />And if he truly absorbed \\"vast continents of knowledge\\" while in the spirit world, he's not sharing it with us.  We know he was in a hell realm, and then a heaven realm, but why?  And what does any of it mean?<br /><br />I don't doubt that NDE are real or that Eben's experience was real.  But with so many other really well written stories out there, this one adds little.  I was excited to get the book and start reading; I fell for the marketing hype.  Very disappointed and am sending it back.
B004NELBPC|5.0|Don't watch a lot of TV, so this is my nightly news source. Conveniently allows you to organize categories by areas of interest, i.e. politics, entertainment, business, gay voices, etc...... Highly recommend.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Provides great insight into Lincoln and his cabinet. Super lesson in politics and how to make a leadership group out of your rivals.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|I watched this movie and really liked it, the whole movie kept me interested.  I would recommend this movie to anyone.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|I love the Jack Reacher series....; he is the &#34;tough guy&#34; all men aspire to be, and all the ladies dream of meeting.  Secure in himself, Jack Reacher extends that security to all he meets that need his protecting.<br />I can't wait for the next Reacher novel.<br />Three cheers for Lee Child.
B00A6N8F4Y|2.0|I wasn't impressed with the acting done by the main characters, so I lost interest in this one. Benecio Del Toro and Salma Hayek are always fun to watch, along with John Travolta. Maybe I expected too much from this one--with it being an Oliver Stone film, on top of everything else!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|A very good story with an immediate hook. Lots of real science and very good characterisation.<br />I couldn't' put it down and found it a refreshing change after recent splurge on space operas<br />Easily worth $5.00 amazing for free
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|Why Children Succeed is a must read to understand why we need to truly reform how we view and teach our children.  Mr Tough does an excellent job rehearing and reporting on innovator in education who understand that schools need to go beyond forcing memorization to pass tests.  He points out that research and many of these programs are finding that we need to invest more time with students teaching them &#34;HOW&#34; to think, problem solve and develop self control.<br /><br />Put this book in your principal's, superintendent's, and school board president's Christmas stocking.
B00338QENI|5.0|I really fell in love with this book. I am glad we got to learn about Henrietta's life and the fact that she was an actual person not just a cell to be cloned over and over again for medical research.
B008U7ZPHS|4.0|Gripping and amazing. A Rick riordan marvel. Continues to rock. Could not keep it down. Master class. Proves once again
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Can't wait for next season in January!!!  Want to know what happens with Matthew and Mary! And also with Mr. Bates and Anna
B000JMKTLO|3.0|Leaves you on edge of your seat. Story of a disturbed family who ultimately get what is coming for them all along.
B005J2UM9S|1.0|really really bad movie.  I am a horror fan and this was a pieve of crap.<br />Don't waste your money
B00471TLZS|5.0|I've loved this movie since it was first released and still do.  Vampires, zombies and monsters get quite sickening after a while, but ghost stories never die, and this was one of the best, blending frights with humor and the average American family.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|This is probably my favorite season.  I can't wait to finish the 5th season and find out what happens!!! Jax is so hot lol
B000NQRE1E|5.0|Naturally, this get's five-stars from me. Who am I to decry the 11 Academy Awards it earned. I know this a fictionalized work except for the iceberg, sinking and manufacturer's claim of &#34;unsinkable.&#34; Two people who are now acclaimed actor's in their own right got started in their roles, Kate Winslett and Leonard DiCaprio. Romance and dramatic license make up the majority of this film around Titanic's actual date and cause of sinking. I recommend this movie for it's wealth of visual and auditory treats. Titanic is a major footnote in the history of both America and Great Britain.
B005PK553C|5.0|Very good! I don't know if I like the second season as much but the first season was pretty good.
B008WK30XO|5.0|I simply like the type of music written for the movie Lawless and this is why I gave ith maximum 5five-star rating. I can listen to this type of music all the time as it reminds me of the type of region and occurrences that generated pure country music. The documentation of life lives again in this music. I didn't hear anything I didn't like. I would recommend this product to anyone that really wants to immerse themselves in the times.
B008XG1X18|4.0|It's a great app for when I am not at the computer.  I haven't really used it a whole lot but it is very convenient when I find stuff I like to pin.
B009KHBDUU|4.0|I liked this movie because not only was it silly funny but there was an actual story plot. Also how can you go wrong with Johnny Depp.
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|Many give this book flak for being too unrealistic. I, however, think it's perfectly realistic. It just might not be realistic to one's current situation. It is often trying to prove a greater point about what is so badly broken in many corporations. Reading this book will most likely make you want to quit your job unless your job is awesome and already does this.<br /><br />I wish all managers had to read this.<br /><br />Also, a very very quick read.
B005LAIHHC|3.0|It is another Sacha Baron Cohen movie so if you liked the others you will like this one as well.
B007MDB548|5.0|I like the pre order option.  I like that I can ship it directly to my granddaughter.  And my granddaughter loved it
B007FEFLTO|3.0|For some reason, i did not find this second book of the Century trilogy as engaging as the first. It's main value is to remind one of the significant geopolitical events that occured around the second world war. I found myself thinking of the adage: &#34;those who fail to remember history are condemned to repeat it.&#34; The brutal rise of facism on the right and communism of the left are equally frightful responses to chaos or imbalance in socio-economic conditions. The reader cannot but help seeing similar strains in the strident political rhetoric of our own day.<br /><br />I found the development of characters and families through whose lives the story is told a bit shallow -- broad but not deep.<br /><br />None-the-less, I do recommend it. While those of us over 60 are more likely to read it, it would be of greater benefit to those under 40.
B007TK77QE|4.0|Although this J. K. Rowling's adult novel has been nicknamed &#34;Mugglemarch&#34;, I found this small-town-story compelling. The starting point idea: remove suddenly (by death) a central character from a small community and see what happens, is a good one. The suddenly died councellor had friends, enemies and people in between. Rowling makes her characters lively, And as in Harry Potters, the teenagers become the heroes of this novel.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|These characters go through so much during this book that I can't even image dealing with it because stuff like that does happen in real life!  I was happy that there was a second book and enjoyed that as much as I did the first one!  Good read!
B0043D2L9S|5.0|This harness is to be used with any Lowepro belt. It sustain the weight attached in the belt and distributes it, avoinding pain in your neck.<br />The material is very good, like all the Lowepro's products.
B00A6N7BS0|1.0|Wait until this is on TV, I thought it was going to better than it was. Probably should have read some reviews before watching it
B0043D2LAC|5.0|The quality of Lowepro's cases is notorius. This case fits a camera's body (D800 or D600) and some little accessories, like battery, memory, filters, etc.<br />You can attach it in Lowepro S&F Belt.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great finish. I loved the series and thought this was an excellent finale. And my first book on kindle. Yay!
B008N1V11U|4.0|You can't got wrong for a $1. Gameloft make some amazing games lately. I bought this for my Kindle fire and boy i love it. It's really fun and you will enjoy being batman for the day
0060507772|5.0|I have fallen i love with the disk world series, this was the icing on the cake, I love the book.
B00A4YVHXQ|1.0|only has 1 easy song, the rest are normal to expert....many times u have to press 2 keys simultaneously.....would have been fun, but not for beginners...
B0084TWN9K|3.0|Although this style of writing is not my cup of  tea, I will say the author is quite talented in writing these short interludes in people's lives. I like stories connected and nothing connected in this book. I would certainly recommend this book to people who have little time to get involved in a story, but still want the satisfaction of reading shorter, but interesting, events in others lives.
1451695195|3.0|\\"Proof of Heaven\\" by Eben Alexander has accomplished the goal of becoming a talked about best-seller because it addresses an always compelling topic, the existence of a spiritual realm beyond what we can ordinarily sense, in an accessible story form with claims to gravitas.  Unfortunately, the scientific sounding claims are not backed up.  His appendix considering and rejecting possible scientific explanations for what happened to him was the least readable part of the book for me.  It contained a lot of fancy-sounding terminology without addressing the two basic questions:  What evidence is there that the memories he reports on were actually generated while he was in deep coma?  What evidence is there that the parts of his physical brain capable of dreaming or hallucinating were totally shut down?<br /><br />Even if it was suggested by his publicists, Dr. Alexander should be held accountable for the word \\"proof\\" in the title of his book.  There are details in his book, like the appearance of his birth-sister to him during his coma, that convey an aura of miraculousness, but I didn't read any concrete details that couldn't be easily explained away.  I personally would have been less distracted by skeptical thoughts if the book had been presented as an honest account of a remarkable personal experience rather than as proof of something more.<br /><br />Dr. Alexander has chosen to shine an intense spotlight on himself right now.  It must be pretty disorienting, on top of the disorienting other-worldy experience he reports on.  I am interested to see where he goes next.  I would love for him to address skeptical concerns in a way he did not do in the book.  Does he continue to cater to people who want to believe without deep inspection, or does he take seriously his claim to have had an historically unique experience and the capacity to think about it scientifically?  Is it fair to ask him to release his medical records of the event?  Will he allow the physicians who worked on his case to divulge details?<br /><br />It is not reasonable to expect Dr. Alexander to have \\"scientific objectivity\\" about his own life-changing experience and it's fine for individuals to take comfort in what he presents, but I fear the book will have the effect of widening the divide between faith and reason because it encourages people to confuse a \\"confirmation\\" of what they want to hear with science.
B0068RHGJM|5.0|Great album takes you on a wonderful ride. Can't say one bad thing about it. A must have for any nightwish fan!
B009GEOLM4|4.0|This isn't exactly the live action type of Batman but it was good.  The artwork was great.  The story is classic Batman.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|These books are absolutely fantastic!  A must read for science fiction fans.<br /><br />The story is truly original, and is very well written with excellent characters.  This is one of those stories where you almost wish it wouldn't end, it is that good. I can't wait to see what else Hugh Howey has up his sleeve!<br /><br />Read these, you will not be disappointed!
B004LQGZ7G|5.0|This is a great classic.  One of the best chase scenes.  Great feel to the movie drama.  Love the cars.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I think it could be a lot of fun, I just don't use it a lot.  As I get into the habit, it will be fine.
B007VUA7VO|1.0|I had it installed for a couple of weeks just using all the default settings. Everything seems fine. Checking the app gave me reasonable feedback on battery useage and future projected life. Then I decided to check out the Settings. I set verbally alarms for battery % useage while going down and while charging up. Then I ran the Calibration program to fine tune my Fire. It ran for 90 minutes and reported 5% useage to do the tests. However, the Fire Battery meter said I was at 47% remaining. I left it in stand-by mode for several hours which usually draws very little power. However, when I tried to wake it up, I got a message that the battery was so low that it could not open. SO I charged the Fire overnight and promptly un-installed this apps. I'm guessing that the monitoring of battery status drained the battery. It was free, so I guess you get that you pay for!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was assume, i cant wait to start reading the third one!!!!!! The ending of this book just makes me get into the third.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|I bought this for my girlfriend, and she wants to rate this &#34;20 Million stars&#34; instead of just 5.  &#34;5 stars doesn't do it justice.&#34;
B009SCRERI|5.0|I bought this for my daughters last night (via Amazon digital) and they both absolutely loved it!  I have to admit that my wife and I both ended up watching it with them and we really enjoyed it too.  We are now watching it for the 3rd time!
B00A12Z264|5.0|Christina Aguilera's new album is her most cohesive album in my opinion, though it is her least experimental album probably since her debut. But I understand why she played it safe, given the complaints she always gets about her albums being all over the place and too overwrought.<br /><br />The standouts in my opinion are Lotus, Army of Me, Make the World Move, Your Body, Let There Be Love, Sing for Me, Blank Page, Just A Fool and Empty Words (on the deluxe). I love the light, ethereal vibe of Lotus (intro). It really sets the mood for the album. Army of Me is such an empowering song and very  radio friendly. Make the World Move is a great collabo with Ceelo, though I wish there was more of him on the track. I love the pounding of the beat and it feels as if she brought that Back to Basics vibe to this current era. Your Body should have been a smash single, The beat is sick, fresh and very hard, hip hop sounding with a nice electro vibe, plus her vocals are insane. The bridge is a thumping, declaration of Ms. Aguilera.<br /><br />Let There Be Love is a sleeper song. When I first heard the album, it sounded like filler to me since it has a generic &#34;club&#34; beat. However, once I saw her perform it live it really began to stand out to me. What stops it from being another generic club track is her voice. Similar to Whitney Houston, Christina knows how to take subpar material and give it new life.<br /><br />Sing for Me reminds my why I became a Christina fan. Again, like Whitney and Etta James, she is a fearless singer. When Christina sings, &#34;when I open my mouth, my whole heart comes out...&#34; I get chills. Blank Page is one of her most sincere ballads. She sings it from such an honest place and it is so soulful without needing to riff from the top of her range to the bottom. I'm impressed.<br /><br />Just A Fool just might be the best Pop duet I've heard in years. Blake and Christina harmonize so well and again, the vocals are from such a sincere place, they really highlight the lyrics. Empty Words really deserves to be on the actual album, another heartfelt Christina ballad. I love the lyrics to this song and it is also really catchy. Kind of reminds me of a P!nk or Kelly Clarkson ballad.<br /><br />All in all, I see this album having longevity if Christina and her team play their cards right. Just A Fool is destined to be her biggest hit in a long time!
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I have always used Mirriam Webster dictionary and have one on my desktop pc.  I like the idea of having it on my tablet<br />so it is handy to check out words as I am reading.  This is one I would recommend.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|great story, kept me wanting to read more. the suspense kept building to a great ending. would recommend to anybody.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have this game on my desktop and played it much of the time.  I had already gotten a solitaire<br />game before I noticed this one but had to have it too. Just a little change up on my solitaire games<br />keeps me happy. Am looking for a 'pyramid' solitaire game like I have on my pda, THAT one is<br />my favorite.
0736092269|5.0|I recommend this to anyone interested in how movement impacts our muscles, and how we use our muscles impacts how we move, and live.  The science of strength is fascinating as is the human body.
B00A1XOPE8|3.0|While well written, Emperor's Soul leaves you hanging at the end. To me it ended abruptly - but perhaps that's just a function of it being a novella.
B008ELUEQC|3.0|Been a Rod fan for over forty years. The album is not what I would except from Rod but a few songs are great.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Though I read this long past the time it was published, I was still riveted by Hosseini's story, knowing that oppression and cruelty still affect the lives of many women in Afghanistan.  The character Mariam begins her life sadly, a &#34;harami-bastard...whose only sin was being born.&#34;  Her end is tragic as well, but along the way she does her best to survive, and gives of herself completely to save another woman in the same awful circumstances as herself.<br />This is a beautifully written book with vivid descriptions of Afghanistan and well-developed characters.  Highly recommended.
B007ORVC36|1.0|This review is about the picture quality. This great show was in sync, but quite blocky. I wish I had known that before making the decision to purchase. The beautiful cinematography of Mad Men could not be enjoyed.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|awesome game loved it a lot classic just like the original in the arcades very addicting to play time toys
B00A5052YE|3.0|I am really a Alicia Keys fan & I would have loved if she would have kept the magic flowing from the beginning to the end of the album, but somewhere the tracks got redundant & boring!!!!  However, there are some outstanding songs on the cd that are worth buying like, &#34;Brand New Me, When Its All Over (which I have on repeat), Listen To Your Heart which is my fav on the the cd & is most definitely on repeat! I feel she should have kept going in this direction instead of all the slow boring love songs.  I also loved the duet with Maxwell, &#34;The Fire We  Make&#34;, which grew on me in the end.  One Thing & 101 are also good as well.  The rest is nothing special...
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|i really enjoyed this book, it was out of the ordinary of what i usually read. It quickly caught my attention and breezed right through it!!!
B00A7ZXDLQ|4.0|I am not totally a Rihanna fan, but this cd is by far one of her best.  She is constantly evolving & pushing the envelope.  I especially love the controversial song she made with Chris Brown, &#34;Aint Nobody's Business&#34;, which actually isn't!lol Love it!!!
B002NZK5TG|5.0|Love the movie. Bought for my wife. Came quickly and she was happy. Also loved the digital option that came with the purchase.
1611761174|5.0|I loved Fall of Giants, and I am always nervous about sequels, but this one did not disappoint.  I consider myself someone who is knowledgeable about history, but I learned so much from the novel.  The characters each draw the reader in, and I found myself feeling like I knew them all by the end.  I totally recommend the book!
B006YXTRHY|2.0|I'm sorry but I just don't find myself enjoying teen angst movies and this movie is just overloaded with &#34;angstiness&#34;!  I enjoyed the special effects and the action but this movie was just outright depressing.  I couldn't help but wonder if the actors are wondering &#34;When does this end...I need to move on&#34;.  If you're home on a Friday night and want to know what happens with the rest of this saga, then watch it but don't expect to walk away &#34;satisfied&#34;.  I plan on watching the last movie just to find out the answer to the following question &#34;What the hell did the big kahunas see in Bella?&#34;
B004VM7M22|4.0|Breathtaking,unputdownable,novel ,the stuff of movies.,well why havent they made a movie about this. But hey  !Argo just came  out in the theatres ,i really enjoyed it ,but on Wings of Eagles would have made a great Movie .Ken Follett at his best.
B009GENZKS|2.0|Seen other RE movies.  This one was a little hard to follow.  Had to watch it twice to figure out where it fit in with the other films.
B0053O89IS|5.0|I'm a Bones junkie. Love the series. I'm always sad when the series is over for the season. I look forward to more seasons.
B007G92QGO|4.0|I greatly enjoyed this novel which gripped me from start to finish.  The theme of this story, about an Assistant DA who must defend his son who is accused of murder, seems to be that \\"A Father's Love is Blind.\\"  Well written and engaging, my main criticism is that it was a little implausible.  However, one makes allowances for the sake of entertainment.  For its genre, close to top of its class.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Reminds me of the old kings quest games. great puzzles and funtionality. I was addicted within minutes, and have almost finished it in a few days.
B0084U0IEG|5.0|A great read!  and it's about reading.  I am almost through and I will really miss it when it's over.
B0098460O4|5.0|These 2 young people are wonderful  they should have 10 stars, this is a wonderful Holiday gift for anyone who enjoys good music.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|This is the best album I can remember purchasing since The Head and the Heart a few years ago.  Definitely worth a listen... At least 8-9 tracks I could easily just play on repeat. :)
B0098VYCCE|4.0|I enjoyed this movie a great deal, it was really great re-make on an old story. I would definitely not recommend this for children however.
B009S33I68|5.0|Great story of the sacrifice those who answered their Nation's Call during the Vietnam War; their dedication, hardships, valor, and honorable service.
B0076DELIG|4.0|The advent of any new Michael Connelly book with Harry Bosch feels like coming home for the holidays to a family well loved, and rife with expectations based on the past. Others have reviewed the plot, so I'll move beyond another rewrite here.<br /><br />In this tale, we see Harry methodically with tenacity piece by piece find the solution to a case he had a brief contact with during the riots in la after the Rodney king debacle. As the cold case , as it has become, gets warmer, this is predominantly Harry working alone, with the other characters playing minor roles , and not much further development of the supporting casts and their relationships with Harry..some, but not a lot.<br /><br />But this is the quintessential Harry, there for the victim, outside the chain of command if need making connections through good police work. We do learn some of the history of gangs and the approach of law enforcement along the way, and there is a stomach punch at the close.<br /><br />This is a really good read..not my favorite of the line, but a great visit home.
B00A0SLTCU|4.0|A remake, but with its own twist on the story, and a couple of nods to the original. Definitely worth watching if you like a good action/sci-fi/mystery..
B000002J1L|4.0|Genesis almost broke up in 1970 due to the unfortunate leaving of Anthony Phillips. They also wanted to get a more dynamic drummer for their sound. Genesis was about to embark on a soul-searching quest for the right sound. The music was getting more surreal, more abstract, more grandiose and larger than life itself. Fortuantly, they found 2 of the best musicians for the job. Enter Steve Hackett, one of the most brilliant guitarists of all time. His guitar trickery and mastery of the volume pedal/tapping would be a key role in bringing a classical and romantic edge to the band. And also, enter Phil Collins, a man who would change the sound of Genesis as we know it. As for now, though, he was an amazing jazzy drummer with incredible timing.<br /><br />As said before, the music was getting grander. And darker too. The Musical Box deals with murder, molestation, and death, all set to frantic headbanging rock. The Return Of The Giant Hogweed is a fantastic sci-fi/horror story with one of the best intros of all time. Steve Hackett fits right in with this album. In many ways, this is one of Genesis' heavier albums, with a lot of fuzzed out guitar craziness. Tony Banks is also getting better on the keyboards and comes up with a lot of different shades of playing. Peter Gabriel is....well, just insane. The many voices, characters, and intonations he comes up with during this album have to be heard to be believed.<br /><br />The shorter songs are a bit of a letdown though, even though they are a nice break from the 3 epic tales. While Harold The Barrell is a funky little number about suicide, the other three do nothing for me. For Absent Friends just kinda blows right by without much of an impression, Seven Stones has no memorable melody, and Harlequin, while pretty, still just kinda makes me shrug my shoulders.<br /><br />However, the band ends with one of their best numbers, The Fountain of Salmacis. The song tells a Greek myth about hermaphrodites, and has one of the best guitar solos you'll ever hear. However, it's Gabriel that shines here, actually resonating with every ounce of soul in his body.<br /><br />This is the beginning of the winning streak for Genesis. Buy if you're curious.guitar solos you'll ever hear. However, it's Gabriel that shines here, actually resonating with every ounce of soul in his body.<br /><br />This is the beginning of the winning streak for Genesis. Buy if you're curious.

0143113100|4.0|This book was enjoyable overall, it seemed like a self help book. the information in the book was more of a known information. the people in the book, the characters, were just in need of a motivation. This book showed that the brain is truely plastic and that the brain is malleable. the information in the book was easily readable. even to those who dont have a high reading skill or level.<br />Although the book was good, towards the end the book became repetitive and the appendix was long and dragged, almost like a waste of pages. even though this was a good book, it started to bore towards the end.<br />This book is recommended to others, even though the ending lagged, the book overall was a great and imformative book.
B002UXRH10|4.0|I was undecided about Rated R because of all the mixed reviews. When a singer deviates from the pop formula to something branded as mature or experimental, you either hate it or love it. Since the store was disposing of this at $3.95, the risk is negligible.<br /><br />Melody wise, Rated R does an amazing job of channelling angst, misery and sorrow in Russian Roulette, Wait your Turn and Hard. Although a departure from Good Girl Gone Bad, it never leaves listeners alienated with its musical direction.<br /><br />Take for example Stupid In Love. Yeah love sucks. The chorus goes: \\"I may be dumb but I'm not stupid.\\" Well, dumb means stupid right? No wonder her friends call her an idiot in this song. Don't worry RiRi, you're not stupid. Everyone makes mistakes. Even people who pride themselves as smart.<br /><br />I actually thought Fire Bomb was the best track here. It's a happy tune and kind of offsets the album's miserable tone a little.<br /><br />Speaking of balance, Rihanna goes submissive in the sexy sexual Rude Boy. \\"Tonight, I'm gonna let you be the captain, ...be the rider...Giddyup Giddyup\\"<br /><br />The video for Te Amo should delight our hetero brethren. It's a case of Bad Girl Gone Lesbo with a dominatrix to boot.<br /><br />And the cover. RiRi belongs to a select group of artists who always appear on their artwork or videos with an eye covered. The inside pages contain recurring music industry themes - Devil's horns, bondage gear, a face veil similar to the one worn by Prince in My Name Is Prince video and RiRi lying with a bunch of naked dolls.<br /><br />LA Reid, I know you'll probably read this (just kidding). From the bottom of my heart, you guys did great on this record!
B004SBS8LA|3.0|Its Angry Birds, but with a promotional twist. Not a bad game. Short, but it was free. Still the other versions are better. Not worth the space it takes up really.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|This game was totally not what I expected. It has nice scenery, but it's not like other mystery games I enjoyed.
B002Q4TKAY|5.0|This is a great CD, that has amazing music. Audio quality is stunning and every note and word is heard clearly. The Killers gave an excellent performance.
B003UESJHE|4.0|Great movie and I got the blu ray for an excellent price. It doesn't make sense to pay full price but for Black Friday prices it is great.
B002ZG99A4|5.0|This movie is a testosterone rush. It is the king of brain dead action flicks. So much pointless, insane things going on. The story does not make any real sense past &#34;bad guy; kill.&#34; Tons of hilarious scenes that will have you laughing because some action sequences are just that out there that all you can do is laugh. I have no idea how many times this can be watched before it drums into your head its stupid, but it is still worth a buy.
B003PIS5XI|5.0|I really like this movie.  I know it is a young man's wish fulfillment fantasy but it is still just so much fun.
B004G6009U|5.0|I'm a man and I have to say, this was a great movie. The story was well written, characters were made well that they absorbed you into them, and overall there is nothing that can be negatively said about this movie. It was damn good. Disney did a great job with it.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|It really bothers me that Target got a special disk which the others (including this one) didn't get, but otherwise this is a great set.  I wouldn't recommend getting the 3d now but I bought it for a really great price on the day it came out, so I'm very pleased.  3d is fun but I don't think. Film which was retro fitted with 3d is worth a additional $10 or $15 dollars.  However, I purchased at the opening day price which was a great value.
B007SGM084|1.0|From my humble point of view these are very poorly written books, the author has a very limited vocabulary, she failed to create intrigue, suspense, drama, not even a theme. I cannot even attempt to imagine how divine Christian is, or how incredible his body smell is or how beautiful is a girl who does not even brush her teeth in the morning. I would not rate it as erotic literature, not even pornographic, it's just three little dirty books aimed at a very young, healthy, strong, sex-inclined group, which I forsee will have a negative impact on so many young people avid for strong or out of the ordinary experiences. The author tried hard to make it believable but I don't think it is possible to vanish or cure Mr. Grey's traumas  in three or four months, it's like saying you could do the same with an alcoholic person.  I never quit on a book, I alway think it can get better.  However, from an economic point of view congratulations to the author, she has managed to earn I suppose a substantial amount of money.
B009HV2JT8|1.0|One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Everyone involved should apologize. If you see the actors in the street throws eggs at them.

B00AA7O22U|5.0|I rented this movie for my 6 sons age ranging from 1 year to 19 years old. They all totally enjoyed it. It was captivating and thrilling. Chuck Norris was so cool. The story line was even easy to follow and we couldn't wait to see what happens next. I rented it but i will be buying it now .

B0084U0IEG|4.0|Ian Mcewan's new novel is a full ride down espionage lane mixed with a bureaucratic twist embedded in a love story that HAS A HUGE PAY OFF.
B009YDAUJ0|2.0|I guess I have to be the one that says it but the first season was definitely the best so far.<br />Don't get me wrong this season is still better than the second season(god that farm was getting old).<br />But I wish there was that same level of emotional suspense as there was in the first season. I feel like<br />now the walking dead is a soap opera instead of a suspenseful drama.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This series just keeps getting better and better! Aside from the steamy scenes, the story line is great! Book 3 is just as great!
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Not the greatest, but a pretty good movie.  Filmed locally, so I thought I'd watch it again....always see something I missed before.

B0087ITBT8|4.0|Aside from her near-cameo appearances in two ensemble comedies, Barbra Streisand has not starred in a movie in sixteen long years, not since 1996's [[ASIN:B0019TSI8W The Mirror Has Two Faces]] which she also directed. Her output as an actress has been meager since around 1980 when she started directing films, building houses and returning to the concert stage periodically, so it was with both great anticipation and some trepidation that I saw this light-hearted 2012 comedy. What a relief to find she hasn't missed a beat in her sharp comedy timing. I think she's terrific as Joyce Brewster, the energetically overbearing mother of Andy, an organic chemical engineer who long ago moved to California and has recently invented a cleaning solution he is pitching to various store chains headquartered across the country. He plans a weekend visit with Joyce in New Jersey, but upon an intriguing discovery about her past, he invites her on an eight-day cross-country road trip with him.<br /><br />As directed by Anne Fletcher ([[ASIN:B004X75RK4 The Proposal]]) and written by Dan Fogelman (the underrated [[ASIN:B003Y5H574 Crazy, Stupid, Love]]) who based his script on his own late mother, the film is about how their two mismatched personalities unsurprisingly clash at every stop as their relationship twists and turns with each new humiliation for Andy and each new revelation for the both of them, a few of them quite poignant. The film is at its comedic best when she and co-star Seth Rogen as Andy volley back and forth with her well-meaning thoughts and antics at odds with his spiky annoyance at anything she says or does. Rogen plays against type as the coiled-up Andy since his stoner-dude personality has been the basis of much of his previous comedy. Here he needs to show some dramatic gravity (as he did earlier this year in [[ASIN:B0086213XW Take This Waltz]]) and again does surprisingly well when necessary. There is a confrontation scene between the two characters that I wish could have gone on a bit longer and deeper than it did, but he manages to bring a real edge to the film in ways I didn't quite expect from him.<br /><br />Of course there are predictable comedy pieces that also work like a steak-eating contest in Texas where Joyce has to down a fifty-ounce piece of beef in an hour to avoid a $100 tab. There's also quite a supporting cast here, but like Streisand movies of yore, the familiar actors contribute moments that amount to nearly bit parts. Kathy Najimy and Miriam Margolyes are among Joyce's Weight Watchers friends in a quick dinner scene early in the story, while Adam Scott and Ari Graynor show up at the very end of the road trip in San Francisco. In between are appearances by Brett Cullen as a cowboy who becomes smitten with Joyce during the eating contest and Nora Dunn as an officious HSN TV hostess. But that's fine since Rogen really lets Streisand dominate the movie all the way from pushing off potential suitors at a mature singles mixer to getting into the wrong car at a mini-mart pit-stop to getting drunk in a motel bar to sharing her innocently ignorant perceptions of stereotypes. This is only her 19th film since her extraordinary debut in [[ASIN:B008Y78GYI Funny Girl]] 44 years ago, reason enough to enjoy the warm, accomplished performance she gives here.uld have gone on a bit longer and deeper than it did, but he manages to bring a real edge to the film in ways I didn't quite expect from him.<br /><br />Of course there are predictable comedy pieces that also work like a steak-eating contest in Texas where Joyce has to down a fifty-ounce piece of beef in an hour to avoid a $100 tab.

B001LF4IA6|4.0|For me, anything by Bruce Springsteen receives positive ratings. I like all his music and this CD is no exception. Probably biased so don't take my word, listen for yourself.
098555780X|5.0|Very informative with great instructions and pictures on how to tie various decorative knots.  This is a good book for a beginner
1846556007|5.0|If you have read the other books in the Harry Hole series you will love this book. The Bat gives us a better idea of why Harry Hole is who he is (or was). After reading this book you will have a better understanding of why Harry did some of the things he did. You will like Harry even more.
0316228532|1.0|JK Rowling Hates Muggles.  Who knew?<br /><br />This is a book written by someone who hates the traditional.  Far from being cutting edge, this is a predictable rant which attempts to insult and decimate middle class values with the most obvious of words and devices.  A leftist paean to the theory of the underclass producing people with moral compass readings which are more sure and fine than those of the middle class.  The middle class are of course, liars with much to hide and manipulations to engineer.<br /><br />Representatives of the ruling class are treated with hands off kid-gloves care; one can almost see Rowlings doffing her cap as she escorts them through the book protectively. \\"Real Money\\" is a leftist god, and we all know that Rawlings has plenty.  Of course the conservatives are skewered as bigoted, small, racist, homophobic haters.  How trite, parochial, and overdone!<br /><br />Complexity of character is far beyond Rowlings reach.  The simple parables of good and evil work in her previous children's books but to consider this adult fiction plotting and characterization is to just look at her vulgar use of plot devices and gutter language.<br /><br />Avoid at all costs.
B001U887LK|5.0|Purchased for my daughter as her old ones were pretty nasty-looking.  These coordinate with more of her p.j.'s (which apparantly is important to a teenager!) and keep her nice and warm as she wanders around the house.  They are even sturdy enough for her to wear to do her outdoor chores.
B009UZBLSG|3.0|The adapter works on the Nexus 4. It scales the 1280x768 screen to 1920x1080p @ 60Hz landscape and possibly HDCP protection and digital audio. You don't need power to use it. It will take USB 500 milliamps to 2amp chargers.
B008VBYN80|3.0|I just started this game but it is ok so far.  It is pretty simple to figure out but like most other games you need to spend money for the great items.

B001DHXT2U|5.0|This got here earlier than it was supposed to! I was scared it was the wrong movie because its a christmas present for my boyfriend cuz he wanted the whole Avenger's collection of movies and i couldnt find this in any store around here. It was the correct movie and i cant wait to see how excited he is going to be on christmas when he has all of the current movies!
B00008BXJJ|5.0|couldn't wait to get this cd, just love it! I have it in my vehicle so can listen to it all the time.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Yes, there is a kiss at the end. That, needless to say, is taking a huge liberty with the manners and customs of the time of the story (PDA would simply NEVER occur in Austen's time), but what the hey, it's a fantastic kiss. Although it's brief and chaste by today's standards, it's one of the sexiest scenes I've ever seen. Anne's face and body language are transformed by that kiss, and she takes Wentworth's arm with a sensual touch that does away with those nagging doubts we all have--&#34;were they really sexy in those days?&#34;--oh yes, they were. A couple of minor changes were made in the plot, but nothing that causes any consternation. This is a first-rate production.
0143119680|3.0|This book was a slow read for me. In my opininon, there are three significant flaws with this book. The story idea is really good, but there is a lack of realism in the characters' mannerisms and body movements.  Normally when I read a book, I can imagine the characters in the situations presented, but in my opinion, the characters in this book often move or talk \\"unnaturally\\" which makes the believability aspect low.  It's also full of facts, science, and history which is sometimes interesting, but this makes the reading difficult and its over-done.  This also takes away from the entertainment value and made it easier to put the book down after each read. Thirdly, the book didn't climax until about 3/4 of the way through and not until they all enter the witches' house.  Nevertheless, I find the story interesting and will read the second book.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|Although this came out several years ago I saw this for the first time on Masterpiece Classic just recently. And how wonderful it is! Romola Garai is simply perfect as a good-hearted but overly enthusiastic Emma, who means no harm to anyone, yet does it anyway. Excellent cast all around, no essential plot details left out. Good movie of a great book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The first time my niece told me about this book series I scoffed because I didn't think something a teenage girl like her would read could be that interesting. Boy was I wrong! I love this book. I love the intensity of katniss and every other character!
B00785P2QC|3.0|it could be alot better,i have no problem as of yet but using real cash to get what you want is really sad,the facebook thing dont work.so i losing out on the point you get for doing things in the game...smdh
B006LSZECO|4.0|Good Book ! Great guessing game. I love the style of her writing..Can't wait to read more of her books real soon!
B007EECSFA|5.0|I could not put down this book.  It sucked me in from the beginning and did not let go until the last word!  Kate Morton spun a story that seemed so true and realistic it was like reading a diary.  I loved this book and highly recommend it!
B0073LWEXK|4.0|This is a fun puzzle game. The graphics look really good and it ran with no problems on my HTC incredible. I would have given it 5 stars but I got through the game pretty quickly and now I have no desire to play through again. If more stages are added I'll definitely play more.

B001EN71CW|4.0|I upgraded from my DVD set to this one. Other reviewers have gone into the details, so I won't repeat anything here, suffice to say it's a great series. I would have liked to have seen more special features for the BD release, but you can't hope for much with a defunct series 10 years after the fact. The one thing that was missing, and it's a small thing, is just an episode list somewhere. One thing I liked about the DVD release was they had the episodes listed in series order and also the dates they were aired (totally out of order). That way you could clearly see how poorly handled this series was from FOX. It also let you know which episodes were on which disc. As it is with the BD release, know where does it say on any of the packaging or disc labels, which episodes are on which disc. It's a little thing, but I think it's important.
B000WS4QJG|5.0|This contains a nice collection of old MJ songs plus a DVD.  If you like MIchael Jackson's music, this is well worth getting.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|This book started off slow. It gave you a lot of time to speculate the outcome, but it waited almost too long to get to the reveal. Once it reached the reveal, it was not explained very well.
B008OHV5QO|5.0|I saw Neil last Monday, Nov 26th. The show was awesome. This DVD is fantastic it goes into a lot of his older material. The concert was mainly new (from Pill). If you like Neil Young you will love this!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This novel helps you guessing on how the story was going to play out and who would end up on top by the end of the novel.
B0084U0IEG|5.0|Ian McEwan is one of my favorite authors. Once again, his latest novel is a well written and an intriguing story. If I had highlighted my favorite pieces of writing, I might have highlighted most of the book. McEwan's subjects require research and historical accuracy that require his fantastic intellect. As a writer myself, I stand in awe of his skills that take you into his latest world...London, MI5 etc. A must read if you insist on great writing.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Awesome movie and this is the most complete package I've seen. It has every format available for this movie. It cost me the same amount as the standard blu ray. I don't even have a 3D TV yet, but if I get one I will be set.
B004UQPM4E|4.0|Firstly, I'd just like to say Superman has been my favorite hero since I was a little boy watching the movies and tv shows with my dad. When I saw that they had a Superman Special Edition Anthology on BluRay, I just had to have it. I was pleased with the delivery, speedy and on time. The product is in great shape, though the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because there was a tab on the DVD clip for Disc 1 missing. The only reason I even say anything is because it was listed as &#34;NEW&#34; and that makes me wonder if that's true.
B009X00E18|4.0|If you're looking for a thin, lightweight cover, this definitely fits the bill. Not sure if it's worth the money (especially since I received it through the Vine program), but this is the thinnest/lightweight cover I've seen, and I've purchased several different ones for my various versions of Kindles. It does have a horizontal display stand option, not the most stable I've seen, but the cover will fold back to allow that, and you 'snap' the Kindle Fire into place in the cover.  All in all, it seems like a decent cover if you want some protection (especially for your screen) while carrying it about without too much weight, but if you're accident prone, I'm not sure this will hold up to too much abuse (or that the cover fastens closed all that well).  Also, I've had other covers that provide much more stable display bases with more options as well.  But it does live it up to its name/advertising, I'll give it that much.
B001CP4VNY|4.0|I bought this purely for nostalgia reasons, to be perfectly honest. Though, I do like Forever much more than &Robin.
B00A0SQBDM|1.0|after getting invested it makes you pay to unlock the rest of the game. Not worth five dollars for whole game, gave one star for false ad of free when its just a sample!

B00A6N7BS0|2.0|The story was interesting, but fell apart with bad acting by Salma Hayek and a predictable (cop-out) ending. Taylor Kitsch was the best thing about this movie.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|It hasn't woken me up yet.  Perhaps I am not using it correctly but there are no instructions.I may end up dumping it.
B0014J8D9Q|5.0|It may be somewhat controversial to claim that Unforgiven is the single greatest Western, but most fans of the genre would agree that it deserves to be lauded as one of the best. Unforgiven manages to be both a traditional Western and a deconstruction of the traditional Western, such that it is as thought-provoking as it is suspenseful. Eastwood returns as a grisly anti-hero, much the same as his \\"Man with No Name\\" persona, in a familiar yet tainted setting. Those interested in Eastwood, Westerns, or otherwise fans of the grisly, brooding anti-hero archetype will enjoy this brilliant film. While Unforgiven takes itself quite seriously, it is sprinkled throughout with loving parody of the once-dominant Hollywood action genre.<br /><br />Unforgiven is a must-see for fans of American cinema. With delightful performances from Hackman, Harris, Freeman, and Eastwood, this is a film worthy of its cast and its ambition. Both cerebral and visceral, Unforgiven comes with my highest recommendation.
B002RVCD6O|5.0|My favorite of the Harry Potter series.  It has the least bad plot changes from the novel, lots of good action and a fair balance of character development.
B008XG1X18|5.0|So much fun and very informative! Like having a new magazine to browse at your fingertips. pick what you are interested in and scroll to your hearts content. Save what you want to refer to (excellent recipes and design ideas) and share with others.
B009NQKXYK|4.0|A good watch if you're a sci-fi fan.  Really good special effects.  Might be a little choppy for those wanting to follow the story line.

0321356683|5.0|In programming as in Golf, bad habits die hard.  Fortunately in Java programming no need to pay a coach to kick the bad habits out and become a better programmer; all you need is Effective Java!<br />Effective Java brings a concentrate of programming advices and best practices that are the result of many years of coding experience and peers discussions.  Most programming books can be substituted for online resources these days, however I have yet to find a replacement for Effective Java.  It is simply too unique a book and too valuable (yes, I always keep it within hand's reach at my desk) to be easily replaced.  A lifetime coach for just few a dollars :)

0316228532|1.0|I thought that I would enjoy this after reading the Potter books. Shows how wrong you can be at times. I'll give her a second chance if she does another book, but it will have to be low priced!
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Best Christmas movie yet. A family tradition that starts playing every year at Thanksgiving.<br />Bought a copy for each kid this year for stocking stuffer!
B008KE3960|4.0|Si gioca bene, bisogna impostare una strategia però non è difficile. Da provare per gli amanti del genere \\"vola e spara\\"
0810989956|5.0|Grandson 9th birthday! It came on time. Hours of entertainment for him and lots of laughs  Love it Love it
B008FIHUDO|5.0|this was yet another great album - i love her covers and her original songs.  she's just got the most amazing voice!
B006LSZECO|5.0|One of those books that you didn't want to put down. Lots of twists and turns. would definitely recommend it.
B00001OH7P|5.0|A wonderful listen from start to finish....you need this in your collection - you want this in your collection - you must have this in your collection!
B000YGIIPO|4.0|Another great classic remade by Terry Pratchett. This book is a good read for adults, even if it is written for young adults, and I can't wait to have my son read it.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|The story is great and to think they found some one to play a young Tommie Lee Jones that is so convincing. For those of you who are Men in Black fans you will not be disappointed and be sure to follow the story line. Do not go to sleep on this one or you will miss something.
B009EAO38C|5.0|This is the first album I felt compelled to purchase the moment I first watched their videos on Youtube. Not only is it incredible music and a steal at $8.99, but these guys are the sorts of folks that deserve support for the amazing work that they do.
B0098VYKSA|4.0|Anything With Charlize Theron and you basically cannot go wrong. She is the female Daniel Day Lewis; a true genius whos personal life experiences give performances that no silver spoon Actor/Actress can ever attain. the only reason I gave it 4 out of five stars is due to Kristen Stewart performance which was as cardboard and hollow as she is in her vampire movies.
B000J0PEPW|5.0|This movie scared the pants off me! it is a must for any horror buff especialy if you liked the Exorcist!
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|It was a great flick for me which kept me on the edge of my seat; I didn't read the books and now I'd like to.
B0057RCFQS|5.0|This is a great deal, my husband and kids love Jurassic Park. These dvds and the extra bonus dvd are great.
0307341550|4.0|Very interesting and creative twist. The author drops clues along the way and you can begin to suspect &#34;who did it&#34;, but still are a bit thrown at the end. I would easly read another one of her books. Well thought through characters with the most amazing depth and description. This would be a great movie!
B005Y423ZC|5.0|I absolutely enjoyed it!  She's my favorite singer! I would recommend this DVD to everyone who Loves Adele.  Love it.
034580404X|5.0|To be expected, VERY erotic and VERY vivid. But, yes they do have a plot! I was skeptical to buy them at first as this type of genre is typically not my thing. Granted, I have only finished the first book and have the complete trilogy to read. Interestingly enough, I was talking to a nice lady in the grocery store who I would gauge to be in her late 50's and we started talking about the books from a small talk perspective. She said, &#34;the books are not usually something I am into and I could barely put them down!&#34; So, that was enough for me try them. The characters have depth, there is some good humor and some pretty darned amazing imagination involved. I enjoy how the author has created a character in Ana's sub-conscious. I am not easily offended and can find something interesting about every topic, so my ten cents is these have more to offer than just erotica. A game of emotional cat and mouse, if you will. I know they are putting together the screenplay now and then will begin casting. I hope they do the books justice in the movie, it would be a shame not to!
0061964360|5.0|I adore this cover- its beautiful and reminds me of true love. Another special twilight cover to add to my Bella Swan collection
B003O86FMW|4.0|Very good second book in this series.  Can't wait for this movie to come out.  I would highly recommend reading this series.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Preordered this set and I'm very satisfied with my purchase. My husband and I LOVE these this trilogy, especially The Dark Knight Rises. Very happy that I preordered through Amazon!
B0049J2CKE|5.0|This was my third time watching this movie; it never gets old. Ratatouille is a great movie for ALL ages.
B000OZ0NXA|2.0|I see they are making a move of the Jack Reacher character.  That may be watchable - this book was too hard to read - being slow and too descriptive to keep up with the plot.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|love it.  but will it ever be over?  I don't care if it ever is cause i can keep playing for now.
B006QF5CU6|4.0|A down-to-earth, almost realistic action/thriller/drama that has withstood the test of time. Vanessa Williams acts her (beautiful) butt off in this- running from laser guns, fighting atop a cargo container suspended in midair. Add in James Coburn and James Caan, and it is still a great rental all these years later.
B002WY65VU|5.0|I loved this movie!!  and now I can watch it any time I take a notion.  Highly recommend it for any movie fan:)
B0083GQVOC|4.0|It's like watching a two hour car crash in slow-motion- you know it's not right, but you can't look away. Not a family movie, at all.
6305428042|5.0|I am pleased with my purchase. I really enjoy this movie and couldn't find it anywhere. I am glad that you had this.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game is the best much it is amazing you should get it is alot of fun that's what I think if you don't like it that is you opinion but I love it that's why I gave it 5 stars!!!!!
B000VBIGD6|5.0|what can i say, my family loves this movie, you can be depressed because of the hollidays ,an this movie will make you forget
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book and felt it was well done as most all of Grishams books.are and would probably buy it again. Overall, the story was well written- the ending was a little weak and I felt it ended in somewhat of an anti-climax.  I always look for a little more of a exciting or surprising ending in novels but perhaps I have become too acclimated to Grisham.  As stated before, his first 3 or 4 books were the standard which I felt he did not get too very often.  It followed his previous style-maybe I need to look at my reviews a little more critically in the future.  I try to read a cross section of authors and now am enjoying &#34;The Art of Power&#34; by Jon Meacham...So fiction and non fiction balance each other in my tastes.  Roy &#34;Uper&#34;
B00914JWSW|5.0|Release Me by Barbra has added much comfort and joy as well as pleasure when I have it playing on a daily basis.  I believe this is a superb piece of music that is healing and soothing to the mind, body, and spirit.  She is still the best, even though she took a long time to decide to release these songs. A great addition to my Streisand iPod choices.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very easy to read and navigate, & the additional accessories to post mark & verse a day..I just love it!
B004LWZWGK|2.0|I wanted to like this movie.  I really did.  I liked \\"Batman Begins\\" and \\"The Dark Knight\\" despite their numerous flaws.  But \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" was almost ALL flaws.  It was clear to me that Nolan was coasting on his successes and didn't put any real work into this film, especially the script.<br /><br />A lot of people really like this film, but I can't help wondering if many of them aren't simply predisposed to liking it simply because it exists:  they are so happy to get another Batman film that they have lost their ability to be objectively critical of a flawed film.  But your mileage may vary, I suppose.  A lot of people liked \\"Lost\\" and that show was total garbage, so there's no accounting for taste, I guess.<br /><br />I can't recommend this movie, despite the nice Blu-ray presentation and a few nifty extras.  If this movie didn't have Batman in it, more people would see it for the lame piece of work it is.  So try not to be blinded by the fact that it IS a Batman movie.<br /><br />And I used to think \\"Inception\\" was Nolan's worst and most bloated film.  \\"TDKR\\" makes \\"Inception\\" look like \\"Citizen Kane\\".
B000I0QL82|5.0|I am a big fan of both Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire. Bing has a wonderful voice and Fred is wonderful when it comes to dancing, you put those 2 together and you have one heck of a movie
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Very interesting movie - one that you will need to see several times to catch all the little details that are part of the background and jokes for seniors. Some young people will not have a clue of how it is to get old - but they will someday!!!
B002P5XXR0|5.0|This plot of this video has been done many times yet this story is very entertaining.  Very fun and good drama.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I have read all 3 of Gilliam Flynn's best sellers and absolutely lose myself in her writing. Her technique is amazing. It draws you in and forces your imagination to insert yourself in the story.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|This music stands out in the movie.  It's very fun to listen to as the indigenous sound will reveal itself in most of the songs.  Very satisfying!
B009VB7QQA|3.0|Some scenes were little far out. I did like the axe of course. Some of the action was on the bizarre side but still an entertaining movie and we Glad we watched it
B007QXU0ZO|5.0|I saw this group in concert.  I heard them on the radio and had to own and see their music.  I highly recommend 'Up From Below' CD.
B00A3SGWYC|1.0|One or two decent tracks, but the rest was a bunch of re-sampled garbage!  Creativity is out the door! I am OFF THAT!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I like to think that I am a John Grisham fan. I think I've read every novel he has written.  While most his novels have held my intrest and have been satisfying and enjoyable, this one falls short of that standard.  Until about the middle of this  novel, I was enjoying the story and the characters in it.  However, without any lead in to the change in the tenor of the novel, we see a different story develop, which, to me is a second story altogether and doesn't have any relation ship to the first part.. Sorry John, you didn't score big, with me, on this one.
031618201X|5.0|Werevolves, and Manners, and Manga oh my! So adoring the mangaization of one of my favorite book series. It's wonderfully done and follows the book amazingly well. Characters are great and I love the take on the costumes!
B00062PN6I|5.0|Very nice, the ear cups are BIG and fit all around the ear providing great sound and blocking a lot of the outside noise. BEST headphones for 10 bucks!!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Nice story, somewhat believable plot, and amusingly stupid characters. Pretty much what Harlequin characterizes. I liked the characters despite the stupidity, but it really felt like most every other Harlequin I have read. Still a great free read!
034580404X|5.0|I enjoyed all 3 books, it was fast reading.  As someone else said, it is a love story with some suspense between Ana and Christian.  I enjoyed it so much that I am rereading it again.  What can I say, loved the books.  After reading some chapters, I needed a cigarette and I don't smoke. To try to do all those S&M or sex positions you need to be in your 20s, very limber and physically fit. To all the people who complain that it was badly written, so what.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|it is not working smoothly in the Andriod platform... cannot more forward.. not enough information to let play learn how to play the game..
B0015USNCQ|2.0|First of all you can only put a small potato in this device. Secondly once you do, you will be lucky to have the strength to make it go through the grate or slicer part and it feels like you are going to break it. I felt like I had to jump and put all my body weight to get it to go through the slicer. And mostly unsuccessful. A pain in the patooty. I now just cut the potatos like I always have.....with a knife!! Such a waste of $54.00 plus dollars. I learned to late the method of returning the item or I would have. But it does look cute on my counter LOL!! Save your money and cut with the knife!
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is awesome game where u make stuff and destroy stuff. but it is super addicting! I played it for like a hour last night
1451695187|4.0|it was a gift to my Boyfriend he said it is good and that he likes it ......he cant seem to put it down when he starts reading ......
B009UX2YAC|1.0|you should get paid for playing this horrible game. it is just a copy of temple run. it is worse!!!! we all know how bad temple run is. waste of time and space.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Great product at an excellent price. Perfect gift for the holidays.  Great idea for any Potter fan you may know.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|its a okay game but you have to delete all your data to get a new background. that's the part I hate........
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|THE DIFFRENT TYPE OF ARRANGEMENT MAKE THIS MORE EXCITING AND LESS BORING.THIS IS WHAT MAKES IT VERY ADDICTIVE FOR EVERYONE.
B008NABUU8|4.0|I'm not very far into this game, but I have been enjoying it. Sometimes it is a little iffy when trying to place the pieces, but overall it is fun.
B002RKRTGO|4.0|I have the Kindle software on several of my computers, but this is the first volume that I read on my new Kindle Fire. It was a good choice. I'm not certain how many times I have read  “The Hounds of the Baskervilles,“ but it is more than a couple, and this was as pleasurable as any. The price was right too. So, if you like Holmes, this is great read.
B00A0SMTXS|1.0|I bought the HD version, thinking I could actually enjoy HD via a download....WRONG!<br /><br />I have a high bandwidth connection...it averages in test between 20 and 22 MBPS...so not slow.  However I was prevented from watching this movie while waiting for Amazon servers to push the data down...  It literally turned into a fiasco!  I ultimately ended up having to watch it in SD...what a WASTE!
0307887448|5.0|Ernest Cline has an amazing amount of creativity in that head of his.  I cannot say enough good things about this book.  I would never have normally read a book in this genre.  This book is a must read, and I am not surprised that it will be made into a movie.  Great Book!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|A little far fetched obviously, but all dramas are I suppose. Gripping stuff though. Superbly acted, fast paced well written dialog and some delicious unforseen twists. Looking forward to season 2.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|been waiting for this a long time. although there are a few loose ends, mostly Ridley & co., tied them up
B0018QQQK8|3.0|there was so much more potential for this story. Instead it came across as a cheap date. I liked the overall story.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|This app works very well on my Samsung Galaxy. It allows me to access the Amazon Cloud Player. It is a very nice inhance<br />ment to the Galaxy.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I could not put down these books. I loved all the twists and I loved how it ended! Great great books!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have read this book twice in 6 months.  I believe this is his best novel to date.  I did not want it to end!
B00920HMNM|5.0|If you are a Donald Fagen fan, this is a must.  Incredible sound quality on the vinyl and the songs are all great.  Harkens back a bit to his early more funky work on some of the songs.  Love it!
1442353279|5.0|I really enjoy reading this book, he is as honest and true as someone can be in his own memoirs and his life story is fascinating good work Arnold !
B008OHV4PG|5.0|Thanks so much.  Enjoying this purchase.  Wished it was more documentary and back story and less concert but it was pretty good.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I really liked that it filled in a lot of the back story & they resolved a lot of their issues. However the ending has kept me from purchasing and reading book three of the series. I actually was mentally exausted with the ups and downs of their relationship and was just happy they were going to be able to enjoy some normal time as a couple, the end. Instead it leaves you knowing you have some sick psycho out there looking to destroy them both! REALLY I MEAN COME ON ALREADY.
034580404X|5.0|As I'm sure everyone else has said these books are a great read. They through me for a loop but I love the story and the love in these books.
B008JB4XX2|5.0|Perhaps one of the best hard rock albums to come out in recent history.  Simply jaw dropping.  I have pounded the steering of my truck to oblivion with this cranked up.  Big crunchy guitars, unforgettable choruses and hooks.  An absolute must buy!
B0087JTAKW|4.0|This book makes you think about how to live your life.  TIme is precious, use it wisely. I would recommend this book to friends.
B005HSG3VK|2.0|The design of the leather case covers up too much of the kindle screen. I have to push down the leather to navigate the controls.<br /><br />This is a serious design flaw for users and should have been a priority in the initial product design.
B00846REIS|4.0|Ordered this because I read the Shades of Gray trilogy. I liked the trilogy better, but it was an ok book to read.
B007QPFGJW|4.0|Phantom: Harry Hole is the best flawed detective in print. Nesbo holds your interest from chapter to chapter. Lot's of twists.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Such a great show.  I started watching them from the beginning just a few days ago and I am already all the way to the current episode.  Wish they could make them faster.  I am totally hooked.
B0036WHM1E|4.0|The Stone's are a brother and sister duo who write music made to relax to.  I especially love songs sung by Angus.  Very sweet!
0446580848|5.0|I must admit, I'm a hard-core Nelson DeMille fan and have read most all of his books.  I have copies of all that I have read.  This book is another submission in the John Corey continuing Saga...  I was particularly thrilled that he had combined Paul Brenner (The General's Daughter) in with the smart-aleck John Corey.  They are a great pair and maybe some day he'll have them meet on another ops.<br /><br />This story is about another terrorist (this time US born) returns to parents home land with his own agenda.  I don't want to spoil the story or the plot of this book, but it kept me turning the pages clear to the end...  If you are a Brenner or Corey fan, you will enjoy this book.  Happy reading!
B007THA4FI|2.0|I guess I expected too much out of the Harry Porter author.  It was a whole different kind of story.  Very sad and depressing.
B00005JNS0|3.0|I bought this movie because it has cars in it. I would recommend for older children. My son is 18 months and it does not hold his attention. I gave it three stars not because it is not good, but because it is not good for my sons age. Other wise a five star movie
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|This book made me fill so sorry for those perple in Afganistan.  There life and culture canged from one day to the next.  I'm so glad to be a American and living in the United States.  The book was really terrific
B008YWY0HK|4.0|Different from the usual, more for older kids and adults although the brothers are a naughty addition.<br />Found it was difficult to understand the brogue at times only reason it got 4 instead of 5 stars
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|I honestly really liked this book at the beginning. [Potentially some spoilers here] Then as the book goes on it ends up all over the place, and the ending is just ridiculous (in my personal opinion). This couple has some serious issues. I would say it is probably worth reading. Perhaps you can get passed some of the silliness that bugs me about it.
B008QE9XD2|4.0|Enjoyable but disappointing, Johnny Depp is spending a lot of time in makeup in his latest films.<br />Nice to see Michelle
