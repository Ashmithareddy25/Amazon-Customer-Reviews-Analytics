B000002J09|3.0|Many people give this album five stars. Because they love Led Zeppelin and their music but for me I am no Zeppelin fan and not going to be one. Sure this album has it´s moments, but I´ve listened to a lot better disc than this. The melodies are all scrambled together and yet while it´s heavy and well played it also gets a bit annoying not just Robert Plant´s voice but it sounds so dated. <br />Many people disagree with me but I have listened to 3 other Zeppelin albums and they´re all allright. they are however far from being masterpiece including this album.<br />I Don´t Hate Zeppelin I´m not feeling them.
B00000JLWW|1.0|Titanic is the highest grossing film of all time but this dvd is the worst of all time.No extras, not animorphic, paramount needs to get with the times. This dvd gets only one star for poor quality.
B00003CXI1|3.0|The scorcerers stone has been stolen! that's what the book said and that's what this movie said. I really didn't actually enjoy this movie but it was still quite entertaining. It is a fantasy about a boy wizard who goes to school to learn magic. Based on Rowlings bestselling books Harry potter's first adventure reaches sky high. When I had read the book but hadn't seen the movie I didn't know how Warner bothers were going to create an actual Quiddich match but they still did it with prestige effort. the movie had no romanical aspects and the comedy was escruciatingly dry. I think Warner bros. should have put even more effort into the acting in the movie but the special effects were pleasing. Luxembugh ratings believes this movie deserves three stars for the poor acting but all other flaws are miniscule.
B000065U1N|5.0|I've seen just about every war movie made and this is one of the best, not as good as Saving Private Ryan or Band Of Brothers, but it is still a great movie filled iwth action and excitement
B00005B36H|5.0|this review is in response to cute(3&amp;1/2). there is nothing boring about this cd. it is in its own way, a masterpiece. as an avid tool fan for the last 7 years, it really burns me up for people to go spreading their rotten opinions. if you dont like them, keep it to yourself.
B0000645ID|1.0|It only comes to show you, read the fine print....I bought this with high hopes I was getting the movie. But all it is, is the soundtrack to the movie, and I thought it was the movie because it said DVD (of course it the word audio under it, in real small print) on it, but it's just an audio version of the movie. It does have photos, that are modified, with horrible quality, and it also has the lyrics to the songs, but I couldn't figure out how to get the screen to go down to read the full text of the lyrics. I am diffenitly taking this back to get a refund.. I have seen the movie before, and I really like it, but I can not endorse this product due to the fact it is very deceptive, and they even put it in the video section at the place I bought it. I just thought I would warn ya'll about it...
B000002J2D|5.0|Trick of the Tail, Wind & Wuthering, Spot the Pigeon, Seconds Out, And Then There Were Three...<br />These are the albums I would lend to any young music fan who was curious about Genesis.  I know a lot of Gabriel-era fans (and I am one of those too) would turn up their noses at this, and a lot of other fans would hack off ATTWT from the end of this list.  A lot of people complain about the absence of Hackett (I certainly wish he had stayed too), and even Tony Banks puts down the album as one that \\"just didn't work.\\"  To me though, it's the final chapter of Genesis' greatest decade - and, coincidentally, it WAS the last one recorded in the 70s.<br />There is, of course, one song that sticks out like a sore thumb: that career changing hit single known to us as \\"Follow You Follow Me.\\"  I like to pretend that it was just a love song single that was tagged on to the end of this prog-lite album.  The rest of the songs ARE in the spirit of 70s Genesis, though, albeit a bit more light as I said.  There's the atmospheric synth intro on \\"Down and Out,\\" which also boasts a Hackett-esque time signature and a stellar ending.  There's the lovely high-pitched vocals on \\"Snowbound\\" (reminiscent of \\"Ripples\\").  There's \\"Scenes from a Night's Dream\\" which sounds like a leftover from Wind and Wuthering.  And I've always been very fond of the dramatic \\"Say It's Alright Joe\\" (great lyrics: \\"There were kings who were laughing in the rain / And they told me I'd come here to lead the parade\\" etc.)<br />Add to these the two outtakes \\"The Day the Lights Went Out\\" and \\"Vancouver\\" (the latter is a lovely sentimental piece, both are available on the second box-set) ... how could you say that ATTWT is NOT classic Genesis?
B000068QKT|5.0|Wonderfully written, wonderfully cute. A good dose of originality and a great escape from Hollywood.
B00004U2EZ|5.0|I came across this Helene's CD on the backstreet of my university.It's so great,i should say, she is fabulous,marvelous and let me know how charming French songs could be displayed! I like the background music and her voice,sometimes soft and sometimes hard.<BR>Great!Helene Segara.<BR>I love Francise!
B000002A3T|5.0|The Division Bell may be PF's greatest work ever. Though i must admit its hard to compare anything to Darkside or Wish... This is more mature, relaxing, spiritually deep and Gilmours Guitar has never sounded sweeter. The old bass player/singer is not missed at all and has done nothing solo that comes even remotely close to DIVISION BELL. I can put on the headset and listen to this one as often as i wish and still love it. This album takes you away from it all.. It doesn't get commercially old like many of the 70's hit albums. The entire album could be one long story or even one song, it flows so naturally with no real hit single. If you love this album , get a copy of Van Morrisons INARTICULATE SPEECH OF THE HEART or ASTRAL WEEKS. Theres a similarity in feel and the place the music takes you to. Relax enjoy ...   A  Van fan hooked on Gilmour .
B000000NN1|5.0|It is a well-know fact that Yes-frontman, Jon Anderson, attempted unsuccessfully to bring Vangelis into Yes to play keyboards for the band. This wasn't meant to happen, apparently, so here you have in front of you the album that contains the sound that Vangelis could have brought into Yes. With a perennial musical struggle between good and evil, the tracks of the album take the listener through a spiritual rollercoaster. Along with his previous work for \\"Apocalypse of the animals\\" this album lays the groundwork for several of his later works: the more choir-based works, some harmonies to be found in Opera Sauvage (1979) and even the origins of the theme of Chariots of Fire! Though it's not my favorite Vangelis album (you don't want to go through hell and back, every time you listen to an album, which tells you that he actually did a great work), it is a brilliant masterpiece, deserving a space in the collection of all serious rock collectors (yes, this is more a rock than a new age album.)
B00006LJ72|4.0|No offence intended, but did Javier listen to any of the music on this collection - or had he heard the tracks before? So he doesn't like New age music. That's fine.<br />If those who DO like this kind of music have not bought any of Enya's albums, buy this. You'll have three hours plus of wonderfully dreamy musical perfection.
B00000I924|4.0|I bought it because of the incorporation of techno beats/synths with southern blues/rock style guitar (never heard that combo before).     When I first got the CD, however, I didn't like it.  I felt the playing was, overall, sloppy and I couldn't stand \\"Brush with the Blues\\" (too long and doesn't quite fit in w/the rest of the album). Fortunately, it's grown on me.  I now think every song is really cool...even BWTB.  Word is, Beck's style has always been sorta sloppy, yet way advanced - it's his trademark technique.    Don't know why it annoys me so, but \\"Angel\\" is an exact replica of \\"Behind the Veil\\" from his Guitar Shop album...he just changed the name.      This is the first Beck album I've ever heard/bought and, being a technical guitar freak (DiMeola, G.Howe, Morse, etc.) I find this type of guitar music very grounding and pure.  (Would buy some of Jeff's older stuff, but it sounds horribly dated)
B00005MKA1|5.0|This is an absolutely beautiful collection of songs from the heart of Bob Marley; there's not a bad tune on this album, and if you're not already a Bob Marley fan, you will be after listening to this. &quot;Misty Morning&quot; and &quot;Crisis&quot; alone are worth the price of this record. Do yourself and your loved ones a favor and add this to your music collection.
B000001FRY|4.0|When I first heard this album, I was blown away. It was exactly what I had always been wanting to hear, but had never heard, in rock music. Subsequently, I was an exclusively loyal fan for about 5 years thereafter.  With all it's reverb and echo, the music transported me to a different world - a world only 4 kids from Dublin, Ireland could take me.  I always realized these people didn't know anything about music theory or how to play their instruments, but combined w/Bono's strong voice, they pulled it off, anyhow.   If you're a U2 fan and have never heard this CD, you're missing out.
0679746048|5.0|I think this is a good book to read. i believe if you are someone who is going through these types of problems or have depression, this will teach you alot of how it feels to be in a hospital and what you get out of it. Even if you are not in any of these situations it is a good book for people who think they might be going into a type of career in this field. if you are looking for any other books to read that are simular to this one i would suggest reading CUT and is a little bite simular to girl interrupted.
B000002UAU|5.0|This albun is the best in the story of the music. This change the world and the way to play music.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is the best DVD set in my collection. The story is gripping and the DVDs has a lot of great extra features including: biographies, a timeline and story summaries.<br />The interface is also very intuitive.<br />This sets a new standard!<br />thanks HBO!
B00005JKZT|5.0|The Two Towers were of course spectacular, and I knew they'd be. i saw it on the very first day it came out which was a first for me and it was so much fun to be around all those insane fans. The only thing i didn't like about it was that it seemed to short to me. I know it was almost 3 hours but it was too short. Also some scenes in the trailer weren't shown in the movie. I bet tho, those scenes are being saved for the extended dvd version. :D
B00005JLS0|4.0|I'm a big fan of both Grant and Bullock, so I was thrilled to see them come together for this movie. While not my favorite film of either star (those would be About A Boy and While You Were Sleeping), Two Weeks Notice is nonethless both sweet and funny, plus it includes a beautiful tribute to New York City. It's a perfect choice for anyone looking for a romantic comedy.
B00005RHGK|5.0|This is a really scary movie, and is crimnally underated. WATCH IT ALONE IN THE DARK!
B00005JLS0|3.0|I will begin by issuing a disclaimer.  Like probably a million other heterosexual American men below the age of 65, I have a bit of a crush on Sandra Bullock.  To paraphrase the line from \\"Jerry Maguire,\\" she had me from hello, or at least when I first saw her in \\"While You Were Sleeping.\\"<br />So, I eagerly went to see \\"Two Weeks Notice.\\"  I had fairly high expectations given the charisma of Bullock and Hugh Grant.  By and large, I wasn't disappointed.  It was not side-splittingly funny, but there were a number of moments where I chuckled or laughed out loud.  The other people in the audience seemed to enjoy it too.  I thought that Sandra Bullock did her trademark performance very well, that of the lonely girl next door that steals our hearts.  Hugh Grant came across as a sympathetic and charming rogue.  As a couple, I thought they looked good together.<br />Where I felt the movie was weak was a little on plot.  I'm not picky, like movie critics who seem to spend their careers sneering at airy little pieces of fluff like \\"Two Weeks Notice.\\"  If you go to see a romantic comedy, you shouldn't go expecting brilliant plot twists.  No, instead you go to watch a \\"feel good\\" story that's very predictable:  Boy and girl meet cute.  Boy and girl fall in love.  Obstacles arise, but movie ends with boy and girl together.<br />This being said, there were a couple plot elements that didn't work.  I for one did not buy Sandra Bullock as a compulsive over-eater.  If she ate the volume of Chinese food we see her ordering several times in the movie she'd be a whale or bulimic, and her character was neither.  I also thought that the scene where she got in a cat fight with her romantic rival was a wee bit implausible even for this kind of a film.<br />I think my favorite part was fairly early in the movie when we saw how dependent Grant's character had become on Bullock's.  They really seemed cute and plausible together.<br />I'll close this by saying that I hope, as it is rumored, that this is not Sandra's last outing as a heroine of a romantic comedy.  She does it so well, and even though she's no longer a kid, she still looks as lovely as ever.  But perhaps I shouldn't worry.  From what I understand, her next project is \\"Exactly 3:30,\\" a movie about a woman who is chronically late who seeks therapy from a psychiatrist so she will be on time for her wedding.  Naturally, she falls in love with the good shrink.  That sure sounds like a romantic comedy to me.  I guess we'll have to wait and see.
B00004ZBVG|5.0|This film encompases the realism a Vietnam Veteran wants in a film centered on/in that war.  the films actors dedication to self portrayals of those who were there while fighting against all odds for those in need and under fire is accurate.  Danny Glover portrays the honest truth of character that most men had within themselves while there.  I remembered my own dedication to my country and its best beliefs while watching the film.  Thank you Danny for a wonderful portrayal.
B00000373U|5.0|This was my first Elliott Smith CD, and I can't think of a better point to begin an Elliott Smith collection (although you should buy them all).<br />Either/Or has the perfect mix of the softer, folkier stuff from Smith's first two CDs (&quot;Roman Candle&quot;, &quot;Elliott Smith&quot;) and hints of the more complex arrangements of what's to come (&quot;XO&quot;, &quot;Figure 8&quot;). Highlights of the disc include, of course, the haunting &quot;angeles&quot;, but also &quot;ballad of big nothing&quot;, &quot;rose parade&quot;, and the unusual sonic ride of &quot;cupid's trick.&quot;<br />When faced with a new artist, it's often difficult to choose where to start your journey. For Elliott Smith, begin here.
B000002A46|5.0|This is the BEST Christmas ablum EVER! Mariah mixes her takes on traditional songs and new (and great) songs that she wrote. It has fun songs that you can even dance around to, and more traditional, slower Christmas tunes. I like this CD because, first of all, Mariah is the greatest singer in all the land, and because it has kind of a Gospel flare to it! The second track (All I Want For Christmas Is You) and the last track (Jesus What A Wonderful Child) are the best songs. The last track is awesome! &quot;Jesus! Jesus! Jesus! Jesus!&quot; All I Want For Christmas Is You is also a wonderful song. This truly is the best Christmas CD ever! You'll love it. Even if you aren't a Mariah Carey fan, you'll love this CD. It's a treasured part of any CD collection. You won't regret this purchase! I guarantee it! So, treat yourself to a nice present and buy this CD! You deserve it! ENJOY!

B000060OFT|4.0|First of all, I would've given this movie a 3 1/2 rating if it was possible, but I just rounded it up to 4.<br />I watched this movie, along with the first version, starring Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey as (of course) Romeo and Juliet, in English. Yes, I know, it was assigned, so I couldn't get out of it. I have to say, both versions are better in different ways. I undoubtedly think that the acting was far better in the first version. I liked the actual movie and the 90's twist better in this version.<br />I have to say, I am a fan of Baz Lurhmann's work. He did an awesome job directing \\"Moulin Rouge\\" and some parts in Romeo + Juliet sort of reminded me of that movie. I didn't think that the people could act, though, in this version. Leonardo Di Caprio was horible, and Claire Danes was just \\"so-so\\".<br />I don't think they should've used the original Shakespearian lingo, because the actors (and actresses) just couldn't interpret it well enough to act it out. I think that Olivia Hussey was better looking than Claire Danes, but maybe it's just me. I liked the puns in this version, ex: the guns wth \\"dagger\\" on the side. It was hilarious with Mercutio being a cross-dresser.<br />I liked this because it was sort of fast paced, which I liked, just like \\"Moulin Rouge.\\" Again, the acting was horrible, our class couldn't stop laughing because they sounded funny trying to say the lines. I'm not sure about the DVD features, so I can't rate them, but the movie is pretty good!<br />My overall opinion? The acting in this version was atrocious, but the directing was brilliant. Baz Lurhmann is a genius. That's right, a genius.  Also, check out the soundtrack for both this film and the original Romeo & Juliet.
B00005JL78|3.0|While most people in the reviews have voiced their opinion of the plot of the movie. I would like to point out that this is one of the noisiest DVD titles I've seen.<BR>While viewing on an LCD projector the grain is so overpowering it distracts from the movie.<BR>I have to applaud Lucas with Star Wars II and the superb transfer to DVD which as virtually no noise.
0783222904|5.0|&quot;DANTE'S PEAK&quot; is indeed one of the most spectacular and greatest DISASTER motion pictures of alltime! It's countless disasters, strong and powerful human drama, and outstanding special-effects of fire, flood and hell on earth make for powerful medicine that fuels an unbelievable story of conquest, courage and suffering unlike any other. Unlike the films &quot;TWISTER!&quot; (That dealt with a serious outbreak of TORNADOES in Oklahoma), &quot;THE POSIEDON ADVERTURE&quot; (With a massive TSUNAMI/TIDAL WAVE), and &quot;THE TOWERING INFERNO&quot; (Which dealt with a spectacular FIRE in the tallest building ever built), &quot;DANTE'S PEAK&quot; is magnificient collaboration of IRWIN ALLEN'S disaster films like &quot;FIRE&quot; and &quot;FLOOD&quot; that captures the true realism of disaster! It's even greater than &quot;WHEN TIME RAN OUT&quot; (Involving an spectacular VOLCANO eruption in paradise). With an outstanding cast starring PIERCE BRONSON (In what I consider to be one of his best works), and LINDA HAMILTON, &quot;DANTES'S PEAK&quot; will literally KEEP YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEATS! Filled with spectacular scenes of chaos and destruction, &quot;DANTE'S PEAK&quot; shows the courage, the suffering of the town, that was ever filmed! Like &quot;THE TOWERING INFERNO&quot;, with it's continual surprizes, &quot;DANTE'S PEAK&quot; keep you ever wondering &quot;WHAT ELSE CAN GO WRONG?&quot; or even more so &quot;WHAT'S NEXT?&quot; (What worst thing could possibly happen next?). It's a powerful tale of VOLCANOES, love and the evitable oblteration of the town known as &quot;DANTE'S PEAK!&quot; The most memorable scenes in the movie occur when Dante's Peak erupts and the madness to survive and escape follows! (ONE NOTE: THE ENDING OF THE FILM CLEARLY SHOWS THE HORRIBLE DESTRUCTION AND THE AFTERMATH, SHOWING &quot;DANTE'S PEAK&quot; RESEMBLING A MOUNT ST. HELENS REPLICA AS IF TO REMIND US ALL OF THAT TERRIBLE CATASTROPHE BACK IN MAY 1980, AS WELL AS TO SHOW THAT IT CAN HAPPEN AGAIN HERE IN THE U.S.AGAIN AT ANYTIME. A WARNING WE SHOULD ALL HEED AND PREPARE FOR!). By far &quot;DANTE'S PEAK&quot; is a disaster film of the highest calliber! I recommend it highly! It has become my favorite alltime #1 DISASTER motion picture!
0066214122|3.0|Literature can both reflect societal moods and create them. This book may be an example of this cliche, as it is a jump start on a particular area of technology that is the subject of intense research at the present time: nanotechnology. There is talk about the possibility of self-replicating nanoscale robots, and with also the possibility that these entities could be intelligent, many individuals, scientists and non-scientists alike, feel apprehensive about this technology. The technology is not yet here, but developments in the 21st century are accelerating at an unprecedented rate.<br /> The book starts off well, at least after the introduction, which the author has felt the need to insert. The presence of the introduction is a distraction from the story line, at least for me personally, for I want to start the story without any biases or prejudices. The author's opinions in the introduction are somewhat negative about the future and character of humankind. A reader disagreeing with the author's opinions may be tempted to read the book with a hostile frame of mind. The author therefore should have kept his opinions to himself, and have spoken them through the characters in the book. He is clearly very worried about the developments in nanotechnology, and does not trust the scientific community to deal with it responsibly. The author though is bound by the constraint of making the story interesting, and that is hard to do without interjecting a large degree of malevolence in the technologies he is using in his story. Friendly, helpful nanobots are not going to hold anyone's attention for long.<br /> The first 150 pages or so of the book were very exhilirating: the tension building in the mind of Jack, the main character, and his doubts regarding his wife's behavior kept my attention. The author does a fine job of capturing his introspection, and in the meantime the reader gets a kind of crash introduction to terminology of evolutionary algorithms and artificial intelligence. Indeed, the reader gets exposed to talk of distributed parallel processing, or \\"agent-based programs\\", artificial life, ant routing, genetic algorithms, and protein folding, to name a few.<br /> As soon as Jack enters the desert though, the story gets less credible. Since this book has only been released for a few weeks, I could only say why I believe this by revealing the plot, which I don't want to do for the sake of new readers. I was surprised actually that the author took the move he did, as I was expecting the behavior of the nanobots to be much more subtle, as well as their detection. Instead though their behavior was very extreme, and this led me to think of how easy they would be to combat. The behavior of the nanobots would be much more believable if they would have acted in more mischevious ways, and such behavior would follow I think more naturally from the first part of the book.<br />  As the story nears its end, the events become more and more unbelievable. In addition, the characters seem to be almost juvenile in their behavior, and the author has the annoying habit of having them constantly using the \\"F-word\\". This is supposed to (I guess) make them more realistic, but instead they come across like they are playing nothing more than a difficult video game. In addition, obvious countermeasures to the nano-swarms make the story less believable. One could for example program a collection of swarms to engage in battle with the malevolent ones.<br /> Hence in general this is a disappointing book, which again is too bad considering the first part, which was written very well. I did not walk away with a feeling of foreboding that I did when reading the author's \\"Andromeda Strain\\" way back when. And if the book was meant to frighten the reader about the perils of nanotechnology, it missed its mark, considerably. But even if it did succeed in instilling fear about the possibility of nanotechnology, the research in this area will continue, and hopefully will be realized very soon.hopefully will be realized very soon.

That just makes me critically insane with giddiness!<BR>the highlight of this whole cd has to be the \\"true love waits\\" track.  What a hevenly song! So tingling and wonderful...because the message that true love waits is true i have been waiting for my true love for two years to come back home and settle down..and i have now a frim grip on what it means to love and be loved .. granted this person doesnt like radiohead but i love him anyway and he loves me and im getting side tract...radiohead is dedicated to touch our emotions...that can only be trasmitted by having the roaring sound of the cround and of mr.yorke singing while the band coresponds by harmoniously soothing intrumental waves of not enough tears to fill the ocean , not a big enough smile to truley grasp the reality of the happiness and excitment for the moment....radiohead live!!!!!ahhh.. what joy!
0151008116|3.0|If you are one of those readers who must have allegory in every story, pass on Life of Pi.  Read Life of Pi for the delicious pleasure that comes from  longing to be closest to the one great thing that can (and will) kill and eat you. Imagine the softest, orangest, whitest, blackest of furs and giant cat feet that can crush your skull with a casual swipe. Imagine losing everything except your ingenuity and the will to live.<br />The hero of this story is a shipwreck survivor who also manages to save a few others. It changes his life (well, duh). Plus he gets to hang out with a tiger. What's not to like? There's all the thrill of surviving a shipwreck, plus the pleasure of knowing the hero lived because he is after all telling the story.<br />Scenes from this novel have stayed with me for months, and I savor the memory of the riddles that begin to crop up almost from the beginning. Touches of humor reminded me of Smila's Sense of Snow. This noveich had me laughing even as the characters were at the brink of death. Did I mention there's a tiger? The memory of the island can still raise hairs on the back of my neck.<br />Read, be pleased, be disappointed, feel cheated, accept the plot twists, disregard the plot twists, and imagine that somewhere in the Mexican highlands, there still lives a hybrid race of jaguar with pale orange stripes.

B000067CQK|3.0|I got this 30th Anniversary edition last week, and within<BR>a day of owning it, the entire middle &quot;book&quot; and CD pouches<BR>contained within the board hardcovers fell out and detached<BR>completely from the covers, and also ripped out chunks of<BR>the inside art pasted on the covers as well.

B000056NX4|5.0|I saw this version for the first time on PBS about 2 Easters ago and was in tears long before it was over. I ordered a copy for Christmas that year and have almost worn it out.  Also have the CD which I play in my car to and from work (Heaven help me if I ever have an accident and the rescuers get to me while \\"Herod's Song\\" is playing...they'll never believe it!)! For both the CD and this video, unbelievably wonderful is too mild a description.  The music, the settings, the total design are all perfection.  Glenn Carter (Jesus) is awesome!  Jerome Pradon (Judas) is superb! Tony Vincent (Simon Zealotes) is fantastic! Pilate and Herod are totally wonderful and almost steal the show! And Caiphas and his cohorts will absoluely leave you limp! The ultimate JCS!  5 stars just aren't enough to give this one!
B00005JKHP|4.0|Star Trek: The Motion Picture-Director's Edition remains a beautiful and slow movie. It's a very very beautiful movie, to sit, relax and watch.<br />The new special effects don't add anything to the spirit of the movie. I really don't like changes made in original movies just to put some advanced computer effects (like Star Wars Trilogy).<br />This DVD has great images and good sound, but the documentaries could have been better, as it only shows William Shatner, Majel Barret and Walter Koenig interviews from the original crew.
B00007E8V4|4.0|what can i say? system is a great band. and their new record is good. i think it is even better than \\"Toxicity\\", although the self-titled debut is the best record they've released.
B00005JLS0|5.0|I went and saw 'Maid in Manhattan' last week and couldn't believe how unreal the story line was. I decided to give '2 Weeks Notice' a shot because I love Hugh Grant. It was the only movie (besides Die Another Day) that I've seen in the past month that actually deserved my $6, and I wasn't disappointed.<br />It was a great story line, and Sandra Bullock played a great characted. Ms. Congeniality is one of my top 5 movies, and I was happy to see her playing her usualy weird/humorous self and i was also happy to see sheryl from rhode island (lol) in the movie as Lucy's best friend. <br />Hugh Grant played an amazing character who had me laughing throughout the whole movie. Who couldn't help but fall in love with those dreamy eyes? <br />The movie went step by step, unlike maid in manhattan which saw the rich famous guy fall in love for the poor maid in less than a week. If you're going to go see 'Maid in Manhattan', reconsider, trust me, you'll be much more satisfide with '2 weeks'.
B00005JKZT|1.0|I have actually seen this film and it was very disappointing.  While it is without a doubt some of the best cinematography ever, it was really nothing more than a war film and basically \\"Braveheart\\" with elves.  It is 100% unadulterated testosterone.  The two female characters in the film are \\"fluff\\" and do exactly as they are told.  Not to mention that I had a huge cramp in my back after sitting watching battle scene after battle scene for three hours.  To the other reviewers, no one cares whether you liked the trailer or not, that's the gimmick to get you to spend your money on the film.  Don't you get it?  It's an advertisement and those are always suppose to make the product look good even if it is a piece of trash.  Save your money and peace of mind this holiday season and see a film that doesn't cater to war mongers.
B0000634EV|3.0|Why are the back up vocals overdubbing phil on phil while pepper is a great singer. Plus the first album had a much more bluesy, southern rock style that I think made it great. This album is for the most part dark and gloomy and depressing. Hell, darkness and pain are all played out metal themes. Nola could be put in from beginning to end but I guess that was a different time and I was a different person.
0553381407|5.0|Excellent book - highly recommended.  Helped me reclaim my life.
B00005OAIE|1.0|Is this Dave Play or Cold Mayer or John Matthews? I can't keep track anymore. Dave had a couple good tunes. I don't understand why anyone cares anymore or even wants to copy him so much.
B00005QZWI|5.0|This is the perfect fantasy album. It has beautiful music such as numbers 8, 10, and 14. And then it has those battle sounds such as numbers 7, 12, 13, and 16. And number 2 is very peaceful!<br />I have so many favorites on this album, i might as well say the album is my favorite. It has very ditinct tunes that you will always remember! My props to Howard Shore
B000005IRG|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful things that I have ever heard.  The first time I heard it, I broke down and cried!  The guitars sing, the lyrics provoke thoughts of late nite/early morning New York City...betrayal, pain, fear, lust, etc.    Sarcastic, poetic, romantic, perfect in every way.  I highly recommend this album.  It still gives me the chills.
B00005R2M3|5.0|I admire her attempt to crossover and I think she suceeded! It is an awesome album and I think anyone who like a good beat should listen to it. She has a strong but beautiful voice, and if you like this album I think you should listen to a few of her spanish ones!
B000002ULO|5.0|Don't try to tell me that this isn't Paul Mccartney's best album ever.  It beats most Beatles work!  There is not a single song on this album not worth listening to!  All of Mccartney's other albums have one or two legendary songs on them, and the rest [are not so great], but this is one ...exception!  It could use a little bit more electric guitar, but I'm not going to start.  If you don't have this album, no matter who you are, GET IT!!!!
B00007BH5C|5.0|Awesome soundtrack! I was so excited when I got it, and every song on it made me appreciate Howard Shore even more than I did before! The fellowship of the ring was also an excellent album, but I think the Two Towers is just a little better. It has some of the same distinct tunes from the first one, and also some new ones, that I have already gotten stuck in my head! I already have my list of favorites:<br />3. Riders of Rohan<BR>5. The Uruk-hai<BR>6. The king of the Golden Hall<BR>17. Isengard Unleashed<br />They are all EXCELLENT and BRILLIANT but so far those are my favorite. And you can also insert the CD into your computer and it gives you some stuff. If I could give this 6 stars I would! It is wonderfully composed, and I cant wait for Return of the Kings!
B00005JKZT|5.0|The question of how do you follow up one of the best fantasy movies ever made, has finally been resolved by Peter Jackson: you take things to another level, another scale.  And that's precisely what he's done with The Two Towers, the middle part of his Lord of the Rings trilogy.  It begins pretty much where the last film left off, with Frodo and Sam in search of Mordor, Pippin and Merry hobbit-napped by orcs and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli on their way to rescue them.<br />Any review of this movie is probably going to be separated into two parts to some extent.  One is to whether Two Towers works as a film and secondly as to whether it's a good adaptation of Tolkien's novel.  The answer to both is a defiant yes, despite sometimes veering from the original narrative.  Visually this is amazing, making glorious use of the New Zealand landscape, and manages to stage some thrilling battle sequences, in particular the long but not over-extended fight for Helm's Deep that proves the movie's finale.  However, though Helm's Deep has often been the focus of many a review, the stunning fights along the way - notably Gandalf's battle with the Balrog, and a group of Orcs arriving on a pack of hyena-like creatures.  There's also the creation of Gollum, most definitely the most impressive digital creation for the cinema to date.  Although much credit is due to the actor who plays him, the digital creation of Gollum's split persona is superbly realised, managing to mould a creature that is both grotesque and pitiable.  The acting is again solid as ever.  Indeed, the cast is almost entirely made up of rising stars, and Elijah Wood, Liv Tyler and Viggo Mortensen hold their own alongside acting greats Ian McKellen, Christopher Lee and Bernard Hill.  All of the characters here have such screen presence that they really pull you into this beautifully realised fantasy world.  Of course, such words as 'beautifully' and 'superbly' seem like hyperbole but to anyone who's seen the movie they're the only words that seem fit somehow.<br />Now as to how Peter Jackson, a self-confessed Tolkien fanatic, deals with the book.  He does it incredibly well, although the various deviances from Tolkien's work may infuriate some purists.  Yet for the most part such deviances are entirely necessary and help to make the story even more cinematic and involving than it already was.  The book is actually split into two parts, telling the tale of Frodo and Sam after telling of what happened to the other characters.  As an interesting sidenote, the battle of Helm's Deep actually happens halfway through rather than at the end.  Jackson adds much more Eowyn and Arwen (who isn't in the book) to the action, although incidentally the romantic subplot of Aragorn and Arwen is in Tolkien's appendix to the third book Return of the King.  The addition of more screen time for the female characters was a wise choice, since this was arguably the only thing wrong with the book was its homogenous environment.  There's also the addition of Frodo's empathy for Gollum, and his argument with Sam over this provides one of the movie's most compelling moments.  Also the recreation of the Ents and the Nazgul are very well done indeed, showing Jackson's attention to detail.<br />At three hours in length many people have complained that's it's boring, but something this accomplished that has character development alongside the action sequences, drawing an audience of adults and kids alike.  My one point of possible criticism is that this might be a bit menacing for younger children, although other than that this is proof positive that Jackson is a director of his generation.  Miss this at your peril!
B00006IR5S|1.0|I loved the first Harry Potter soundtrack (especially &quot;Hedwigs Theme&quot;) and I was so excited about the second one. I thought it was going to be even better. When I got it, I was very disappointed. It says in the booklet that they wanted the same Harry feeling but a little bit grown up and different. I think they should stick to the first one. It felt like I was listening to the same song over and over again. And none of it was very distinct to me, the only one would probally be the first song on the soundtrack.<br />This almost made me scared to get the Two Towers soundtrack, because I was so disappointed by this one, but I was blown away by LOTR. It was even better than the first one. Whatever Howard Shore did, John Williams needs to follow in his footsteps! I only hope the third soundtack is better than the 2nd one.
B00005JL9B|5.0|Battle Royale (BR) is a very disturbing film about 42 ninth graders on an island that have to kill each other in order to survive. BR will shake up anyone who is in their full senses while viewing this film. The violence is very graphic and impossible to escape.  Nonetheless, the film has a very solid theme, trust. Where does trust stem from? Choices that we make everyday are reflecting on what and who we can trust, and this is depicted with an honest brutality in BR. On top of the trust theme there is love, friendship, anxiety, identity crisis, loss and jealousy mixed into a brutal drink that the audience will have difficulty swallowing.

B00005OWIU|5.0|Very well composed! They have tose distinct tunes that you look for in a movie! The best song on this almbum would have to be Hedwigs Theme!
B00005JLRR|4.0|Nemesis had its moments, it was great to see most of the cast still functioning. Even though they were on the 'chunky' side. Alas, Star Trek has run its course, and there does not seem to be another mission, except into that black hole that awaits all over used franchises. New stock, new worlds, new blood. else we are just simply following a weekly episode of  Lost In Space.<br />I can say these things as I am an avowed Star Trek fan, and it is with great pain that I would say 'cut the series', but its gone on too long.<br />The Jean Luc clone was a twist that I had not forseen and I really liked the idea and the way it was worked out.<br />Tom Hardy (Black Hawk Down, Band Of Brothers.) as Praetor Shinzon did an excellent job and the close up of Shinzon and Jean Luc, looking deeply into each others eyes to see who would blink first was a great scene. Picard searching his enemies mind for a resemblance of his own youth, not unlike a Narcissistic love affair....  The Alien's were great and the action was there but so was long scene's of trite dialog with #1 Troi and Picard. <BR>With the loss of one of the crew , but the gaining of another, the loss will not be profound.<br />Bring on some new and exciting people and \\"MAKE IT SO!\\"
B000000OPZ|5.0|Este es el mejor disco de Hair Metal, del único grupo que supo <BR>captar totalmente su esencia.<br />1-Crying in the rain: versión mejorada de esta gran canción contundente, perfeccionada por la voz de Coverdale en unos coros impresionantes. 7<br />2-Bad boys: Buena pero no sobresaliente, con ajustes simplemente correctos. 5'5<br />3-Still of the night: Hasta el 1/3 de la canción todo transcurre como en un simple tema Heavy Metal, pero después surgen las guitarras tocadas como violines y las melodías épicas, dando forma a un enorme corto. 8'5<br />4- Here I go Again: Himno del rock, nº1 de todas las listas, estandarte del grupo y su clásico por excepción, pero un tanto sobrevalorada por su incalculable fama. 9<br />5- Give me all your love: Melodías sencillas, comprensibles únicamente como arte comercial. 5<br />6- Is this Love?: Pocas power ballads, alcanzan el sentimiento y la claridad de esta canción, brillantemente interpretada por todos sus componentes, que merecidamente arrasó en listas y que ningún amante de las baladas puede dejar pasar. 10<br />7- Children of the night: ¿Power Metal?, única incursión del grupo en el género, solventada de forma notable, en la que Steve Vai a las guitarras se luce como nunca. 8<br />8- Straight for de heart: Relleno, pura canción de relleno.<BR>Ni arte ni nada musica simplona para un disco demasiado bueno como para tolerarla. 3'5<br />9- Don't turn away: Mirar la anterior
B00005JKZT|5.0|Be prepared to be greatly entertained even if you flunked LoTR 101. The story progresses with the Ring still in the custody of Frodo(E.Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin).<br /> There are two new 'little people,' Merry and Pippin, who spend most of their time riding on the backs of beasts or on the limbs of a tree. You will like them and I did not mind the trees either, they were quite entertaining and essential for the start of the disembowelment of the black power under Saruman The White. Purists will say the Director took liberties on interpreting the Books an I say good on the Director as there were a lot of numbing dialog in the book, that is not in the picture.<br />All and I do mean all of the cast were there and 100% with the movie. They are to be commended for their togetherness and long hard months making this movie of the century. Kudos for all of you! And for entertaining us with a well thought of story.<br />You will marvel at the cinematography and especially the breathtaking beauty of New Zealand, what a masterpiece of scenery. The sets were not to be believed, they were so perfect, Down to the last stone in the Castle tower.<br />The love between Aragorn (Viggo M.) and Arwen, (Liv T.) is a sweet never ending <BR>affair that exudes their admiration for each other. <br />Mckeller, as (Gandolph The White) does a great job for his part to destroy Saruman The White. The scene of him calling his great white steed and then riding him, no saddle or bridle will amaze you.<br />Now for the part I thought was the most realistic of the creatures of LoTR and that is 'precious, precious,' Gollum, a Smeagol, an ancient relative of the Hobbits. Andy Serkis does all the crawling around over the rocks and chasing the fish in the stream and the Animators fill in Gollum, and there is no time when you will not think that precious, precious, Gollum is anything but, real and alive. Even on the very close-ups of his face, absolutely amazing. If for no other reason Gollum is worth the trip and money to see this amazing film. <br />But you will have 10,000 reasons to go see this movie and an empty spot in your psyche if you do not...I want to mention Orlando Bloom who has quite a big part in this movie and as young as he is he carried himself well, also, Karl Urban as Eomer did a brief but great job.
B000079B0A|5.0|I already had the American Fever album when I got this album, and was surprised to notice some differences in a few tracks on the Fever CD in this set.  Namely, a shorter version of Burning Up and a shorter version of Come Into My World.  But they are good tracks anyways, so it isn't a big deal.<br />The bonus CD has been in my CD player ever since I got it!  I already had Can't Get Blue Monday... and The Scumfrog's... mixes and we all know how great they are, but the other tracks were wonderful too!  The Fischerspooner remix of Come Into My World is worth the price of the set.  I didn't really like the Roger Sanchez Release the Dub mix of In Your Eyes; it didn't have that extra 'something' that the other remixes had.  The b-side Whenever You Feel Like It is a fun, bouncy song that instantly gets in you head.  And the CGYOOMH mix is long and atmospheric - a fun remix!  All in all, a great set to get.
B000002H97|5.0|The black album was the very first Metallia CD I ever bought, about a year ago.  Wow what a good choice it was.  There are the obvious tracks that everyone has heard on the radio. Enter Sandman, Sad but True, Wherever I May Roam, Unforgiven, and Nothing Else Matters.  If you're thinking of getting into Metallica and you've heard some of these songs, they're all on this album.  I think this is a good choice for a first CD of theirs to get, because although they went a little more mainstream (the songs are simpler, it's not quite as \\"heavy,\\" designed more for radio) it's still Metallica, and it's damn good.  Other tracks I like besides the main ones played on the radio are Of Wolf and Man, Don't Tread On Me, Through the Never, and the bass solo that starts off My Friend of Misery.  So the moral of the story is...if you're one of the Metallica fans that like the complex songs of their 80's music, you'll feel a little alienated with the simplicity of these songs.  But if you're someone that's not real sure about Metallica, I'd definitely suggest this album to you...actually I'd suggest it to everybody, it's some damn good music.
B000002H6C|5.0|I truly do not understand why this album stands in Master of Puppets' shadow.  I keep hearing \\"oh, there is no bass and Jason Newsted is sleeping.\\"  Jason Newsted is a better bassist than Cliff Burton would have ever been.  The only reason everyone bows down to Cliff is because he is dead and they feel it would be disrespect to say he is not the best.  This is not the first time this has happened, either.  The same thing happened with Brian Johnson(AC/DC's lead singer after Bon Scott's death in 1980).  It also happened to both of Ozzy Osbourne's guitarists after Randy Rhoads' death(Jake E. Lee and Zakk Wylde).  Anyway, in my opinion, this album is an improvement from Puppets.  The songwriting is more complex and the music is not too fast and out of control(like Puppets).  The only song on Puppets that comes close to the standards of ...And Justice for All is Welcome Home(Sanitarium), which is nothing compared to One.  Harvester of Sorrow is a great song, also.  <br />    Dont listen to everyone that doesn't like this album.  They probably said \\"oh, everyone says it's not as good as Puppets, so I'll only listen to One and maybe the title track\\".<br />     GET THIS CD!!!!!
B00005YW4H|4.0|This album is great! It's just the kind of easy listening that you can fall asleep to (admit it, we all want something to doze off to sometimes,) slow dance to, or just read to. It's a wonderful album. It's very jazzy and it has both a maturity and and innocence at the same time that is difficult to accomplish.
B000066NW0|5.0|this CD is great! It has songs for anything. it has cool songs for playing at the school dace, rocking songs to listen to while your cleaning your room, songs that inspire you when your bored, or songs that make you happy when your crying over sme dumb boy! Basically this is the best CD ever, and Avril rocks my world!
1881273156|5.0|This one book has done more to better my marriage than any other book I've ever read.  We've been married 17 1/2 years and I still refer back to this book many times.  I highly recommend it to anyone in a troubled marriage, getting married, or just wanting to help a good marriage grow stronger.
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer is a true genius!  He blends wonderful acoustics with masculine vocals that surpass most artists.  His lyrics are especially good compared to other musicians in his category.  The songs &quot;My Stupid Mouth&quot; and &quot;3x5&quot; display his talent.  I feel that the singles &quot;No Such Thing&quot; and &quot;Your Body is a Wonderland&quot; are not good examples of what Mayer is capable of doing.  This is a great introductory CD to alternative music because it has some pop flares to it.  I highly recommend this album, as you can listen to it time and time again and yet never get tired of it.
6301008944|4.0|1987 was one of the better years of my life. I was ten years old and the world was my oyster. I went to a couple of different camps that year and for the first time began to see how big the world really was.  1987 was also the year ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING came out.  The movie stars Elisabeth Shue, back when she still played good, clean, fun parts and was the directorial debut for Chris Colombus (the guy behind HOME ALONE, MRS. DOUBTFIRE, and those HARRY POTTER movies).<br />The movie is about a babysitter who gets an unexpected call to babysit right after her boyfriend postpones their anniversary dinner. She agrees, but just after the parents leave, her best friend calls from the bus station downtown in Chicago. The best friend has run away from home and is in a bit of trouble. So, unable to leave the kids alone and unable to abandon her best friend to the perverts she has encountered, she loads up the station wagon (station wagon, the classic 80s family vehicle) and heads to the city.But a tire goes flat on the expressway and chaos begins: jealous husbands, car thieves, gang wars, mob bosses, and rowdy college parties.  All in a night's work.<br />The film is charming because even though it pokes fun of the suburbanites of Chicagoland, it does so without being harsh, while at the same time uplifting the good and finer (though few) points about living in the suburbs. A friend of mine loves this movie solely because of that.<br />Overall, the movie is fun and is worth seeing because it jumpstarted Shue's career and was Colombus's first feature.
B00006RU5B|5.0|You didn't think it got any better listening to Rage's first album did you? Well pick up Audioslave's self titled cd and you'll find that adding Chris Cornell to instrument division of Rage was a brilliant idea. These guys know how to rock. Tom Morelllo and his crew lay it down as always but now Cornell croons over the top intensifing the sound to a serious extreme. If you want a cd that can probably only be descibed as wailing, buy audioslave today.
B00005JL78|3.0|I can't compare this movie to \\"Blade Runner\\", it would be unfair.  Scott and Spielberg are two fundamentally different people.  However, Scott has more of a handle on the darker side of life that fits better on Phillip k. Dick stories.  But I applaud Speilberg's effort and for awhile, the movie reaches wonderful moments.  Then an ill advised ending is tacked on.  I wonder if this was Speilberg's original intention or did he pander to other opinions.   Somehow, I like to think he was forced to change the ending.  Then I can keep my respect for him.<br />The acting:  There were too many characters in this film.  Many of them inhabited by actors who are a bit better than Tom Cruise himself.  Cruise is capable of better work but all the running and fighting did not allow him to build a more interesting character.  There are only so many hours you can watch a handsome man looking frantic.  Then the movie is absolutely stolen by Colin Farrell who plays Special Agent Witwer and Samantha Morton as Agatha. Colin Farrell in particular created a wonderfully, nasty, sleazy yet moral character in Witwer.  He displayed the same sexual predator gleam when he looked at Anderton and then in his scenes with Anderton's wife.  I wanted to know more about this character's private and professional life.  The same could be said again with Samantha Morton's Agatha.  She is so wonderfully mysterious.  What was she aware of while she was drugged?  Did she have other thoughts then future murders?  She seemed to be a victim of sexual abuse by her handler,  how did she deal with that?  All of this opportunity is just thrown away.<br />The design of the movie is wonderful.  See it for the design, Colin Farrell and Samantha Morton.  Turn it off when you see Cruise put too sleep.  It will be a more satisfying experience.

B00001NFCY|5.0|This is a one-sound band.  Their songs are basically dirges of various degrees of misery with the singer moaning over a thick wall of sound layed down by slow but nimble drum-playing (I think the drummer only knows that one beat, but he does it to perfection), a thick bass, and droning guitars that were probably overdubbed many times over.<br />There is no great musicianship, no great guitar solos, and - even though he can carry a tune - the singer could be picked out of a  million different alternametal outfits.<br />So why 5 stars? Because this is simply just some of the best damn songwriting I have heard since Nirvanna hit the charts about 10 years ago.  There is an intensity in this CD that will not allow you to push the stop button from the first song. <br />Pick this one up!

It's obvious that the content on this album is amazing, but the songs don't go too well together. It's a bit strange for a life-long beatles fan to listen to songs Come Together and A Hard Days Night on the smae record.  I really recommend not buying this and buying all the others instead. All the beatles albums mihgt as well be greatest hits records, everything of theirs is so well known, and for a good reason too.

B00005JKZT|5.0|Excellent excellent excellent.  The acting was absolutely flawless.  The images, props and landscapes capture the spirit of Tolkien.  Golem/Smeagol was better than I'd ever imagined him to be.  Here are my minor complaints: The Ents could have been a tad better (too small, and voices not as old and wise as I imagined).  Some sequences of Aragorn were so blatant in depicting him as a sexy macho man it almost reminded me of zoolander.  Legolas riding a shield down the stairs while picking off orcs with his bow was just lame and unnecessary.  The comic relief provided at Gimli's expense was good, but maybe needed to be counterbalanced a bit - he didn't come off as tough as he could have.  Enough of the nitpicking.  3 hours went by like it was 1 hour.  I want more more more!!!!
0780624890|4.0|I like this movie, i like blade, i like the story, i like blade 2.  But the Blade series is slowly slipping into the while Batman downfall.  Blade 2 started it all, where the filmakers give us less story and plot and mystery, and exchange it for flashy gaudy colorful sets and mindless action.  In batman 1, the color scheme was simple, black, white, and grey.  It had a sort of haunting theme to it, which i liked a lot.  In blade 2, we are with black and white and gray, with a little bit of tan thrown into it.  Which also creates the haunting effect of a good movie. Then batman made Batman returns and batman forever, and if u didn't notice, batman turned into a haunting superhero to nothing but a kids action figure.  I just hope in blade 3 they stick to the same story and plot line, and give it some of the same color scheme that made the first blade movie so scary  and likeable.  Hopefully you people will know what i mean.
B00006LLNU|5.0|It's funny when you buy this with some friends or something, or someone visiting curiously looks at the cd with no title, no band name and no song titles, no writing on it on the side or front (if you take the slipcase off) , then they open the unmarked booklet only to find blank pages. The point of this is the focus is just on the music, nothing else is needed.<br />It's awesome how the two halves are so different, almost like two entirely different cds. The music isn't really styleistically different, but the mood that is captured is almost like the two sides are two opposite magnetic poles. All the tracks seem to make me think of winter, this cd is better when it's snowing outside or at least snow on the ground. but &quot;(&quot; seems to feel like a happy event like ice skating on a lake on a wonderful winter afternoon, and &quot;)&quot; is on a sad, lonely night.<br />The tracks seem to have layers of depth - depending on how you listen to it, a certain song might sound very simple and shallow, but the next time you listen to it, it will have a lot of depth you didnt realize before. This is especially apparent on the second half because the songs might seem very bland and drawn out but you have to dive deeper into them.<br />&quot;(&quot; has more happy sounding songs. They feel very... Icy and joyful.  Track 4 being my personal favorite. It is beyond brilliant. There are very ethereal melodies, (through the whole cd too) that i'm not going to try to describe any further. Instrumental Track 3 makes such a simple piano melody into something way beyond that.<br />&quot;)&quot; is much different. the cute colorful little piano melodies have gone to sleep and replaced with weeping guitars and very melancholy songs. Even thought there is no lyrics you can really feel what the music is trying to say. These songs are generally longer and build more pressure, building up to that astounding end of the last song that sounds like it's the beginning of the apocalypse.<br />This is not Agaetis Byrjun and is a LOT different from it. Sigur Ros isnt going to repeat themseves. They are really doing something incredibly unique, and breaking way out of the musical paradigm we know of.>This is not Agaetis Byrjun and is a LOT different from it.

B00006CXXU|5.0|Finally a young artist who knows what the people want to hear.<BR>Finally a cd  filled with songs that makes you feel you've got your money's worth.<BR>Finally a young artist who knows her craft well  enough to honestly take chances.<BR>Finally a young artist who's actually worked on her album and didnt phone in her vocals.<BR>Finally a young artist who's done her homework by listening to other artists and  infused their best into her own unique style.<BR>Christina has clearly evolved beyond her peers.<br />All of the current divas need to listen to Christina's newest effort, \\"Stripped\\" for lessons of pure vocal and production artistry.  She out does Mariah with  full melodic lush vocal arrangements that include great lyrics that's not overproduced, just listen to \\"Soar\\" and  \\"Walk  away\\" She out does Janet with club/dance songs that actually build with tempo and funk. Listen to \\"can't hold us down\\" w/Lil Kim, \\"Fighter\\"and \\"Get mine, Get yours\\". Songs that could be remixed, but dont have to.(And if you've  seen her Dirty video, Janet:it might be time for new choreographers,cause Christina's is hot!) Christina is also proving unlike Whitney and Toni's recent efforts that you can mix classic songs with good lyrics with great vocals and have good results without overdoing it and trying to sound too hip.The \\"Impossible\\" duet w/Alicia Keys is very good and shows Christina is secure(unlike most divas) and recognizes great talent. What's  equally refreshing is the vocal on the Beatles/Cyndi Lauper-like song, \\"Beautiful\\", with the right touch of pure vocal,basic accompliment and social commentary, it's a classic and is exactly what it's title says. Her Spanish/flamenco melody,\\"Infatuation\\" in which a girl falls for the wrong man,is both lyrically comical and danceable. Christina also charts the slow jam territory with \\"loving me for me\\", <BR>the soulful sultry, blue light selection has an intoxicating sound even Jill Scott could love. Both songs \\"The voice within\\" and \\"I'mokay\\" are examples of a artist's own healing through song. The folk/rock \\"Cruz\\" has such a young Linda Ronsaldt sound,you're  utterly amazed what Christina can do with her voice. and the funky 70's cut, \\"Underappreciated\\" has you hooked from the start with its bass guitar intro. and speaking of guitar driven songs listen to the high energy Gwen Stefani-like song \\"Make over\\" It's infectious. \\"Stripped\\" should get a lot of Grammy nominations for both vocal and production quality. Definitely a cd to buy if you love good music.....watch out Beyonce, I don't think nobody was ready for this jelly!!!
B00006879E|5.0|This is the best album I've bought in a VERY long time...usually I'll buy a CD and only like 3 or 4 songs on it, but this is not the case with \\"Songs About Jane.\\"  This album is completely refreshing, every single song on it is brilliant!  And forget about their live show- wow, you haven't seen anything until you catch Maroon 5 in concert...I have seen them 4 times, and every single time they manage to leave me speechless, and just in absolute awe.  This band is truly special, and such a rarity in the music industry today...if you don't go out and get this ablum you are missing so much!!!

This movie has so many famous one-liners...&quot;say hello to my little friend&quot;...lol ...Scarface is dark and grimey. Tony Montana (played by al pacino) will go down as one of the most notorious characters to ever hit the cinemas...

6303407188|4.0|MY RATING- 8.0<br />To begin, it's a well-aclaimed mov here in Portugal and we have some Ed Wood moviegoers (thank god there isn't a lot!)<br />It's a damn well made mov, created when Burton had finished his personal Batman Returns, this one on the life of Edward Wood Junior, the worst director ever.<BR>Well I never watched a mov from Ed, and to be honnest, I don't intend to spend my money doing so. This mov spare us the torture of it, and Burton uses again his strange sense of humour to tell the story of a guy who was convinced that his movs were excellent. In a way, the message is given by Vincent D'Onofrio in a delicious cameo as Orson Welles- we must go through with things, even if they're bad as Ed's movs.<BR>As Ed, Johny Depp goes quite well, as well as Sarah Jessica Parker as the girlfriend who leaves him, Bill Murray (ultrafunny!), Patricia Arquette (very sweet), Lisa Marie Juliet Landau and Jeffrey Jones as the omnipresent Criswell. But the real surprise is Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi, the  horror star from 30's Dracula. Under his heavy makeup, we really forget we're seeing an actor, he truly looks like Bela! What a performance! Impossible not to sympathise with him, he even won the Oscar (which is quite rare in a Tim Burton mov).<br />Overall, this is a quite entertaining doc mov, and a interesting change on the director's career, that will please fans and nonfans.
B00005JKZT|3.0|I loved the Fellowship of the Ring movie, and was eagerly awaiting the Two Towers.  Although a devoted Tolkien reader (generally re-reading LOTR once a year), I don't consider myself a \\"purist\\", and was willing to forgive Fellowship for it's deviations from the story because it kept within the spirit of Tolkien, as well as being necessary to adapt to a much shorter medium than the books.<BR>However, I was deeply disappointed by the deviations The Two Towers movie made from the book - deviations which I felt fundamentally altered many of the characters involved.  Example #1 is Faramir - his whole character is altered by his stout resolution to take Frodo to Gondor.  The whole contrast between Boromir and Faramir is now completely lost. The scene takes up valuable minutes that could be spent on something else, and far from adding to the story, seriously detracts.<BR>Also disappointing is the healing of Theoden, and his subsequent recovery.  In the books, Gandalfs healing powers are 10% magic, and 90% wisdom.  The movie completely reverses this relationship, making the healing a simple magical duel between Gandalf and Saruman.  In Tolkien, Wizards accomplish their greatest feats through their extensive knowledge and lore.  Changing this to magic feels like a cheat.  Also, after being freed from his affliction, Thoeden seems to show very little willingness to accept the advice of Gandalf, another serious departure from the books which seems pointless.<BR>Third major variation I was disappointed with was the Entmoot.  The Ents make decisions very slowly.  To show them deciding not to help, and then flipping about on a moments notice when Treebeard sees what he should have known all along seems bizarre in the extreme.<BR>I also had a problem with the treatment of Gimli.  The comic relief added to Fellowship was fun, and added to the story.  In the Two Towers, however, the comic relief seemed to consist of making Gimli into a buffoon, something not at all keeping in character with the story.<BR>I thought the added scene depicting an attack on Theoden and his people was O.K., and added some extra action, but the fall of Aragorn seemed a pointless excursion.<BR>A minor quibble- Gollum was not visually not at all as I imagined him, but I recognize that everyone will have their own opinion of what he should look like.  But really, he didn't look nearly as wizened as one would expect after 500 years of being stretched and tormented by the ring.  Clean him up and fix his teeth and he would look like a healthy hobbit, not a creature barely recognizable as one.<BR>I was also deeply disappointed that the two best scenes from Two Towers were removed - the confrontation with Saruman, and the fight with Shelob.  But since these seem to be simply moved to ROTK, that doesn't detract from the series as a whole, I suppose.<BR>Two Towers remains competently executed, and the actors do an excellent job portraying the parts they were given.  I simply have serious problems with the scriptwriter.  Overall, Peter Jackson has used up most of the good will from me that he earned in Fellowship of the Ring.  I'll be watching Return of the King, but praying it resembles Fellowship more than Towers.
0451197879|4.0|Roadwork starts off suspensefully, as a crazed man with a knack for carrying on conversations with himself buys a high-caliber rifle and a .44 Magnum revolver.  However, the explosive result of this purchase, which you might expect to be soon coming, doesn't arrive until the very end of the book.  To get there, we must wade through some very dense, overly-detailed (but very well written) exposition.<br /><br />Bart Dawes has finally been pushed too far; at age 40, he's lost his only son to a brain tumor, and now the public works commission has decided to build a new highway system, which will not only go through (and thereby erase) the building Bart's worked in for the past twenty years, but also his home.  Bart must move, but he refuses to.  In the process, Bart will lose his job, his friends, his wife, and his sanity, but he stands strong in his refusal to leave his home, reminiscent in a way of Hank Stamper in Ken Kesey's \\"Sometimes a Great Notion.\\"<br /><br />Roadwork is different than anything Stephen King (well, Richard Bachman, to be precise) has written; it's more a character study than anything else.  As King himself wrote in his \\"Why I Was Bachman\\" introduction to the first edition of The Bachman Books, \\"Roadwork is probably the worst of the lot, because it tries so hard to be good.\\"  And that's the whole of it: Roadwork reads like it's been written by a young writer who's trying hard to appeal to the literary crowd.  It's verbose, packed with introspection, and moves along at a snail's pace; the total opposite of the Bachman/King extravaganza The Running Man.<br /><br />It's no surprise that King relates that Roadwork was written at a time when he was trying to impress those elitists whom would ask him at cocktail parties if he'd ever write \\"something important.\\"  (Interestingly, in the second edition of the Bachman Books, in a foreword titled \\"The Importance of Being Bachman,\\" King states that Roadwork is now his favorite of the Bachman bunch.)<br /><br />This is not to say Roadwork is a bad book, or even a boring book.  It takes dedication to keep turning those pages when you begin reading it, but in time you adjust to the casual pace of the narrative, you begin to learn (and respect) who Bart Dawes is, and you root for him, no matter how nuts he's become.<br /><br />The ending finally picks up the pace, as Dawes accepts his fate and brings those guns into play, as well as a generous supply of explosives.  In that regard, Roadwork packs the suspenseful punch you'd normally associate with the books under Richard Bachman's name.  But with its slow pace, grim view on the world (the Bachman view is generally that life sucks, and terrible things happen for no reason), combined with its firm rooting in the 1970s (which might make it inaccessible to those who weren't around in that decade), Roadwork might not appeal to the average King/Bachman fan.  However, for those looking for an intense character study that slowly builds to an explosive climax, it comes recommended.ork is a bad book, or even a boring book.

6304401132|5.0|Though it is remembered nowadays as a masterpiece of animation, when the film was released in 1959, it got the cold shoulder from moviegoers, mostly because of its adult themes and hellish villian.  The uptight society of the day did not take to it too well.  But today, we know the genius behind the movie.  The film revolves around Aurora, a Princecess who will one day succed Father, King Stefan as ruler of the Kingdom.  But the King's enemy, Maleficent the evil fairy, does not take kindly to this and lets out a warning that Aurora will die on her 16th birthday when she pricks her finger on a spindle.  Not sweet is it.    But the King's friends, the good faries (sorry I cannot remember their names), offer to take the princecess to a secret place in the woods to hide her from Maleficent, until her 16th birthday has ended.<br />That is the plot.  The animation in this movie still holds up today for its rich colors, sharp contrasts in moods and settings (Stefan's Castle is bright and proud while Maleficent's Castle is vile, dark and ominous) and simply unforgettable characters.  The three fairies are an absolute delight to watch.  If you need any one scene from this movie to prove what I just said, see the finale where Prince Phillip battles Maleficent as a colassal dragon from hell.  <br />This movie got Disney going on the path that would eventually, though it took another 30 years, lead them to the Aladdin, Lion King and Beauty and the Beast, even though they had dabbled in Adult themes before.  This movie is for anyone looking for a good story, lush animation and/or that Disney flare.  It is one of their best.
B000002VC5|5.0|I, too, find myself always going back to this APP cd out of all the APP cd's I own ! There is something hypnotic, maybe slightly outdated, but still holds that something special (memories of a musical era gone by perhaps)...Whatever it is, I Robot possesses an entrancing quality that many so-called prog rock experimental artists and albums of the mid to late 70's failed to hold onto (they just didn't age as well)... This APP title was a precursor to many artists of the 80's and 90's that were hard to categorize or just categorize as synth-pop/rock artists who used the Parsons Project as their inspiration. If anything, I Robot is a collage of great musical marvel that can still take the serious listener (both old and new fans) into another space and time (from the 70's to the future and back)!

0452282152|5.0|I think to truly enjoy this story is to read it through Griet's eyes and heart ... to look at things from the point of view of a teenage girl .. still innocent and inexperienced .. poor and unpriviledged .. She takes you with her on her daily duties as a maid ... she describes the way she looks at her master and the unspoken magic she feels between them ... her description of her mistress ... her feelings towards her Pieter and his bloody nails .. it is the way those wide eyes looked on life and people around them!<br />Chevalier's style is original, simple and stunning! The meaning behind the title... the purity of Griet's emotions... I felt like I lived in that house and could imagine the kitchen , the attic .. even standing infront of the studio's window over looking the New Church... a very sentimental experience!<br />The ending is unexpected and romantic just like when Griet pierced her ear .. I thought he would give her the portrait .. although she says that she would never see it again .. it tells a lot about the way he felt towards her and about the kind of person he is even though he is not fully_exposed as a character.. I believe that Chevalier did this on purpose just to show us Vermeer the artist ... The Griet we see at the end is a mature young woman ...protective of her family ... thankful for her new life!<br />A beautiful story where fact and imagination intertwine to create an atmosphere filled with tension and love, and a better understanding of life!
B000002C1V|5.0|After listening to PInk Floyd every day for a year, I tired of the &quot;classic 70's&quot; Floyd sound from albums like DSOTM and Wish You Were Here; songs like &quot;Money,&quot; &quot;Wish You Were Here,&quot; and especially &quot;Another Brick in the Wall&quot; are so well-known that it's almost become a cliché to like them. The &quot;psychadelic '60's'&quot; material less known to the general public is half amazing and half terrible; almost no albums from that era can be listened to the whole way through. This album, however, is both filled with amazing songs and not hideously overplayed. If you like Pink Floyd because they're &quot;trippy, man!&quot; or because you love chanting &quot;we don't need no education,&quot; then buy something else. On this album, Roger Waters takes aways almost all of the famous Floydian texture to create a masterful concept album, half of it whispered, half of it screamed, that sends shivers up my spine whenever I listen to it. From the disturbingly quet title track and &quot;Paranoid Eyes&quot; to the raging &quot;Hero's Return&quot; and &quot;Not Now John,&quot; The Final Cut will please anyone interested in REAL music. The message it presents is truly universal, more penetrating and painful than the concepts behind the &quot;classic&quot; albums and meant to change people's views on war, politics, and depression. Sure, it deviates from the traditional &quot;stoner&quot; sound. But I, for one, think this is a good thing. <br />I expect to buy some of Roger Waters' solo albums in the near future.
0451197968|5.0|I've read online reviews of Richard Bachman/Stephen King's novel The Running Man, and some of them claim that this book lacks a certain something that relegates it to being the worst of the Bachman Books.  For the life of me, I can't understand why anyone would think that.  As far as I'm concerned, The Running Man is not only one of Bachman/King's best books, it's one of the best straight-up action novels I've had the pleasure to read.<br />When you think about it, there are a ton of action movies out there, but not very many action novels.  Sure, you have a plethora of low-grade action series, such as Mack Bolan, Remo Williams, etc, but there aren't very many stand-alone, pure action novels.  The Running Man is one, though, and from beginning to end it's a thrill a minute.<br />I grew up in the `80s, and of course loved the Schwarzenegger film, loosely based on this book.  Matter of fact, I still do.  But the movie just doesn't compare; whereas it's goofy, WWF-type fun, the novel is dark, brutal, and brimming with mean-spirited, hardcore action.  Ben Richards, the scrawny, underfed, cynical protagonist of the novel, is a far cry from Schwarzenegger's he-man.  This is one of the best features of the novel, witnessing the \\"pre-tubercular\\" Richards (per King's description, in his \\"The Importance of Being Bachman\\" foreword) take on the forces sent against him.<br />According to King, the novel was written over a 72-hour period, and the published version supposedly isn't much different than that first draft.  This speed of writing is reflected in the novel: it chugs along like a No Doze-popping trucker.  Whereas most King novels are bogged down by excessive description and detail (something King is normally criticized for by the literary critics), The Running Man  is a trim, fat-free exercise in the concept of \\"less is more.\\"  A grander scheme (and theme) is hinted at in the subtext of the book, but like all good novels, it isn't beaten over your head; the story itself is the star, and after reading it you'll reflect on the little details ingrained within.<br />Since this is a Richard Bachman novel, expect his trademark, downer ending.  However, the ride there is exciting and excellent, and this is one of the few Bachman/King books I would consider re-reading in the future.  The novel begs for a more faithful film adaptation; the modicum of description, the streamlined action and characters, and the black humor dripping from the dialog all make the book read like a well-done, action-packed screenplay.<br />It's never been considered a part of the subgenre, but I think The Running Man is an early example of what has become known as cyberpunk.  Though it doesn't feature the trademarks normally associated with the genre, such as computers and hackers, the atmosphere in which the novel takes place - a grim, technology-ravaged, depressing world in which a large wall separates the rich from the poor, and the media reigns supreme - could come straight out of William Gibson, or even the film \\"Blade Runner.\\"<br />Simply put, The Running Man comes highly recommended, whether you're an action fan, a King aficionado, or even if you're looking for an introduction to the world of Stephen King/Richard Bachman.is the star, and after reading it you'll reflect on the little details ingrained within. <br />Since this is a Richard Bachman novel, expect his trademark, downer ending.

B00005JLS0|5.0|Two Weeks Notice is a really awesome movie. It's funny and romantic, and it's really fun to watch. This movie goes by really fast. It seems like it's only on for ten minutes before it ends. This movie is a romance between a rich boss and his employee, who doesn't want to work for him anymore. This movie is very interesting, and I thought it was really great. I totally reccomend this movie to anyone who wants to see a funny, romantic, and really entertaining movie.
B00000DC10|5.0|Could this be the greatest album ever made? I believe if it isn't it must come close. Unlike most albums, where it seems the band involved is trying to create a complete album around two or three decent songs \\"the shape of punk to come\\" is mind-blowingly awesome from start to finish. Each song is as powerful as the last one. Songs like \\"New noise\\", \\"Tannhauser/derive\\" and \\"Liberation frequency\\" are unlike anything anyone has heard before. Completely breaking the traditions and rules of punk and any other genre for that matter, \\"the shape of punk to come\\" steps foot into completely unchartered territory. I mean a ten minute punk song with ochestral violin playing throughout? <BR>  Refused disbanded on the eve of this album's release. And I for one think it was possibly a smart move. \\"The shape of punk to come\\" is a once in a lifetime album. The music cycle usually goes like this:<BR>1. band release a few e.p.'s maybe a full album or two<BR>2. band releases awesome career high cd<BR>3. band releases follow up cd, usually not as good, but more mainstream, band becomes famous<BR>4. band spends rest of life in mainstream releasing mediocre albums becomes hated by their original fans<BR>  If you don't believe me just look at bands like Korn, 311, blink 182 and Limp bizkit. By stopping after \\"the shape of punk to come\\" Refused ensured that they would never become a popular, mainstream band. More importantly they in effect 'froze time' in our minds. What i mean by this is that when we think of refused in 20 year's time, we will think back to our last memory of them (circa this album's release) which is subsequently their greatest moment. Whereas when we think of Korn we'll think back to their last woefully mainstream albums rather than the greatness of their self titled debut. I believe this is why Kurt Cobain and Nirvana are considered so great. Cobain killed himself at the peak of his popularity and greatness, and that greatness is how we will all remember him. Had he notkilled himself I am sure he would have suffered an Elvis like demise.    <BR>  Some speculate that Refused intended to split before they made the album, using the song \\"Refused are f*cking dead\\" as evidence. If this is true it would explain the bizare experimentation on this album compared to their previous relatively conventional hardcore offerings. Refused had nothing to lose. Bands usually feel the need to obey the rules of their genre ie, punk songs cannot go for more than 3 minutes etc. Refused break all the rules and I think, for me, is what makes this album so great. The fact that Refused are a Swedish band also is significant for me, as almost every other European band tries to mimmick it's American counterparts. Refused did not.<BR>  The shape of punk to come is one of the best if not the best album of our times. It blends punk, metal, electronica and various other styles. If you haven't heard it yet, nows a good time to do something about it.

B00005JKZT|5.0|Wow! I can easily say that this is the best movie ever! The Two Towers is much better than Fellowship. It has much more action and quickly paced scenes. The acting is great. Gollum is one of the best characters, you can't even tell he is computer generated at times. I went to the movie on opening day and got more than I expected, even though I went in expecting the best it was better than the best. I think that everyone should go see this movie.
B00006JUNY|5.0|Okay, now most of you who are reading this review already know how good of a movie Fight Club is.  Most of you know that Edward Norton and Brad Pitt give outstanding performances that will have you applauding.  Most of you know that the production values are up there with the best of them.  Most of you know that the script is brilliant, mostly because it is adapted from the best novel of all time.  And most of you know that David Fincher is a genius.  So I'll skip all that and get right to the big story here: Fight Club is being presented on D-VHS.<br />For those of you unfamiliar with D-VHS, here's a quick fill-in.  The \\"D\\" stands for \\"digital\\" (obviously).  With a D-VHS player, you can record HDTV broadcast in its full 1080i scan lines without sacrificing quality.  And now that movies are finally coming out to own on the format, we can see them in high definition.  But how much better is it than the DVD?  Well, it's certainly good enough to take a look at.<br />First, the video.  Anyone who bought the Fight Club DVD knows that it has excellent video and looks just down-right awesome.  The image here is even better.  Compared to the 480 scan lines on the DVD (progressive or interlaced depending on your player's output), the 1080i here helps the transfer enough to just squeak past the DVD.  One thing you'll notice right away is how the colors are perfect.  Black level is dead-on and colors never bleed or smear.  The DVD had some edge enhancement that wasn't too noticeable, but was there, nonetheless.  It ain't here on the D-VHS.  The image is so life-like and free from error that it looks like film.  If you consider yourself a videofile, you needn't look further for one of the most impressive video performances available for the consumer.<br />Now, the audio.  Considered by many to be top demo material, the DVD edition of Fight Club had a staggering Dolby Digital EX mix.  Mayhem surrounded you wherever you were.  The surround back channel added to the three-dementionallity of the film.  It stood up to the best and held its own (even against powerhouses like Star Wars and Gladiator).  The Dolby mix here again just barely squeaks by the DVD release, and while it's not an official 6.1 mix, it decodes perfectly into the surround back, so those of you with 6.1 receivers needn't worry about that.  The only thing I'm really surprised with is the fact that no D-VHS titles have DTS tracks yet, especially considering there's nothing on the tape but the movie, a 5.1, and a 2.0 track.  They could have easily fit it in.  Oh, well.  Maybe in the future....<br />So is D-VHS really worth it?  Well, at least with Fight Club it is.  With an absolutely perfect video presentation and a hard-hitting Dolby 5.1 mix, this is perfect for those just now getting into D-VHS and want to see if it's worth the investment.  Surpassing even the excellent DVD, I don't see why anyone with a D-VHS player would want to pass this up.<br />Movie Grade: 5 stars (out of 5)<BR>Video Grade: 5 stars<BR>Audio Grade: 5 stars
B00006690G|5.0|i am an extremely heavy metal/punk/goth person. i mostly listen to a lot of weezer and and good charlotte and stuff, but sometimes i'll listen to eminem, and he is definently one of the best musicians out there. ... the beats to the songs are pretty good, and i liked most of the skits. i didnt like steve berman, but everything else is awesome. eminem doesnt have to put a lot of effort into making a good album. its natural. and thats what makes it so good.
B000002U8U|5.0|&quot;Stranger in Town&quot; was my introduction to Bob Seger. I had never heard of him before a friend played the record. This album and Seger were an immedidate hit with me. Since that afternoon in 1979 I have seen Seger in concert 8-9 times and own every album/CD that he has produced in his career. <br />In my opinion, this record displays some of the top Seger songs done in the singer's prime. The record falls into the middle of a ten year run for Seger when he produced the best material of his career. <br />Most of the best known songs from this album can be found on &quot;Nine Tonight&quot; live album from the 1980-81 tour but you won't get the lesser known material that make the purchase of this album worthwhile. <br />This is a Seger classic.
B00006AW2M|5.0|This album is probably the one Stones album that really belongs to Brian Jones. At the time he was developing an interest in all things Arabic.  I don't understand why people always compare this to Sgt. Pepper as  this is a much darker piece of work. The new mixes are truly astounding. I've been listening to this on vinyl for years and I can say that I have never truly heard this record until now.  I don't have an SACD player yet but the new Stones remixes just might make me take the plunge. Why don't we sing this song all together? Open our heads let the pictures come.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I don't know who this Ricky Wright character is but I really don't where he is coming up with this bs about John Mayer.  Did you ever think of addding how he has been a fresh new artist with new lyrics and a new outlook on music, not to mention life!  He sings nothing like dave matthews either.  I don't think anyone could if they wanted to.  This review is terrible.  He knows nothing about the lyrics.  Did you ever think that maybe he was using them as metaphors for something else.  He doesn't even know what the songs are about! He's writing something about a new artist that he has no knowledge about and he is completely WRONG!  If I were this guys manager he would definately be out.  John Mayer is one of the greatest innovators of the new age and if you don't think so...look at the charts Ricky.
B000002V07|4.0|This is a good release with good songs... some of them are very skilled indeed and Hope Sandoval's voice truly seductive and beautiful.<br />But this disc just doesn't reach down into me like Among My Swan does. When I listen to Among My Swan, I cry. When I listen to So Tonight That I Might See, I just think &quot;Wow, what great music!&quot;<br />It's still a must-own, however. Tracks like Fade Into You, Five String Serenade and Into Dust are amazing compared to the nonsense that's on radio these days. Even good-but-not-great Mazzy Star is good enough to bring it home, on the right day...
B000003BZ4|5.0|This is easily my favorite disc to be released in the mid 90's, It ROCKS, but it also displays a musical integrity that few bands ever achieve, I really like the mixture of Rock, Metal, Blues, and Jazz sounds they mix so brilliantly. There is not a bad song on this whole disc, I can listen to this from start to finish and never get bored with it. You have Warren Haynes great guitar playing and gutsy vocals, Allen Woody's tight bass sound and Matt Abts powerhouse drums all mixed together making a big heavy sound, a definite MASTERPIECE. If anyone who reads this review likes hard rockin' blues music this is a MUST have for your collection.
B000002U94|5.0|&#34;Nine Tonight&#34; provides a snapshot into the sound of a 1980s concert by Bob Seger. It is filled with all of Seger's hit songs plus many lesser known ones that fans appreciate.  It is a superior record to &#34;Live Bullet&#34; which is a very good record but this CD contains all of the big hits from Seger's biggest records late 70s and 1980 plus a live version of &#34;Night Moves&#34; that is better than the studio version.  It also provides a different intro to &#34;Ole Time Rock n Roll&#34; that Seger didn't perform in the 1986-1995 concert tours. The album is a blend of 1975-81 Seger material that has become legendary over the years, which makes it the strongest Seger album currently available to the public.  If you wanted to buy one Bob Seger record, this is the one to buy. It combines the best songs from his best albums. You will miss some of material from the mid-1980s and 1990s but this album represents the essence of Bob Seger.  The only thing missing from Seger's released material is a boxed set of the huge depth of unreleased songs recorded over the years that did not make the cut for his studio albums. Various sources familiar with Seger's music, bootleg CDs of unreleased songs, and interviews given by Seger during the years 1978-1995 indicate a number of gems not included on albums because many had the feel and sound of songs like &#34;Against The Wind&#34;.  One can hope Seger will release a boxed set of unreleased material in the near future.
B000002IOW|2.0|Rush's inevitable slide into mediocrity was evident from 1982 on. Unlike Hold Your Fire, ad Power Windows this album is not drawn out in synthesizers. Alex Lifeson's guitar is not buried deep in the mix like it had been for a while, but this album is not an improvement. Neil Peart's lyrics are repetitive, as well as Geddy Lee's vocals. Gone is the shrieking, and instead his voice is low (at least for his range) and it sounds generic. The songs on this album aren't that memorable, for pretty much, if you have heard one song you've heard the whole album. The musicianship of the band is still tight, and their skills are still virtuosic, especially on the complex time signature changes on &quot;Chain Lightning&quot; and &quot;Superconductor,&quot; but even that cannot save this album from blandness. Don't be fooled by the title; Presto is not a magical experience.
B000001Y5X|4.0|Manson's very first. This stuff is very electronic and weird, but I love it. Not as good, as , say &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot;, but it's a good CD. Here's how I explain this CD: It's like one big, demented carnival. Buy this, and see how the amazing Mr. Manson, has always BEEN and always WILL BE, and rock icon.
630245333X|5.0|This is a major improvement over the original one. The storyline is good as is the acting, actors, dialogue and action sequences with great special effects without all that computer generated nonsense that is plaguing today's movies (watch Star Wars-the attack of the clones and you'll understand what I mean). Overall: EXCELLENT.
0676973779|5.0|This book is a great read! I have read plenty of books over the years and this is one of my all time favorites. No other book has kept me so interested all the way to the end. And the fact that this is a 'true' story makes it all the more incredible. The story is almost unbelievable, yet it seems very possible. It's a relatively short novel and it's very easy to read. The main character is down to Earth and his adventure is uncomparably captivating. No other novel I have read compares to this one. A sixteen year old boy stuck on a lifeboat with a tiger, a hyena, a zebra AND a monkey! On his little boat floating in the Pacific he encounters a lot more than you would think, and it get's pretty bloody at times. This is NO childrens book. And the ending to this novel was put together pefectly. I loved this book, and you will love it too.
B00005QXXO|4.0|Having seen Radiohead live on their extraordinary 2001 tour, I was very pleased when this mini-album came out so I can relive the aura and the amazing experience of a Radiohead show. To better suit my tastes, thought, a complete Radiohead concert would seriously rock! For now, for those unfortunate people who have not seen them live, buy this. They are just as powerful live than they are in the studio. The highlights of this are the piano version of \\"Like Spinning Plates\\" and the rare song \\"True Love Waits.\\"
B00006RU5B|5.0|Finally, Something melodical, and Heavy. The musicianship of this band should speak for it's self. With Chris Cornell (Sound Garden &amp; solo/ Euphoria Morning, also recomended for your listening pleasure)  Singing right from the heart, with the purest emotions seeping thru, from recent experiences of life, that might not be all peaches and cream ( as we all know ) But Music prevails, and I'm sure it eased any discomforts and tribulations that life sometimes deals, one. Tom Morello ( Rage against the machine- Don't let that scare you , If you are not familier with them, )  Absolute amazing guitar player, playing very tasty licks and with the effects he has patented , is a  true experience to listen to. Drummer- Brad Wilk &amp; Bass- Tim Cummerford ( Also from R.A.T.M.) Make up this incredible rythym section, and have been playing together So long, they are a hard pair to top, these days.  This Album is Soul Power.
6301562178|5.0|And that is all I have to say.
B00005NWM3|1.0|Is anyone else sick and tired of this sub-genre of bands who parlay an unfortunate broken home experience into a career? Like Everclear before them and Good Charlotte, Nickelback makes strident, one subject music that serves as the soundtrack for the younger people working in support collection units nationwide. Nickelback is the more militant of the bunch because they seemingly know of no other subject to write about and somehow, when you listen to this and watch the videos, there's a creepy sense of this whole stance being a targeted demographic than anything truly cathartic and that's despicable.<BR>&quot;Never Again&quot; is about the best of the lot here, which isn't saying too much since it can easily be mistaken as a Bush outtake. The hits are there for people who buy into the notion that Chad Kroeger's the new spokesman of the generation and that his Jesus-like look is hot. For everyone else though, a little of this stuff goes a very long way and if you can sit through an entire listening of this CD without wanting to scream &quot;get over it&quot; at the stereo, then you should be commended for having a very high pain threshold.
0783225857|5.0|I first saw&quot;TKAM&quot; back in the 60's when it came out.I had read the book first,and was anxious to see it on film.I wasn't disappointed.The cast is perfect.I think this is Mr.Peck's finest film.The dignity and grace he instills in the character of Atticus is inspiring.And it inspired a whole generation of kids(I was 14 when it came out)who turned out to be social workers,lawyers,and activists in the fight for equal rights.This is one of the best films you will ever have the privilege to see. (Look for Robert Duvall in one of his first roles.)
0553213105|5.0|It is unfortunate that most first time readers of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE see it merely as one more book to be endured in 11th grade English.  However, most soon enough catch the magic of an author (Jane Austen) who can weave a spellbinding tale of love, romance, satire, and passion while all the while poking a not so gentle thrust at the social mores of the early 19th century.  This book is no frilly ancestor of a Harlequin romance, even if it shares with the dim-witted heroines of Harlequin a time-honored plot of lovers who meet and find an instant dislike that later morphs into enduring love.  PRIDE AND PREJUDICE starts off with that basic premise, but what sets it off as classic is what goes on behind the lovers, Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy.  A careful reader usually notes the society in which Elizabeth and Darcy play out their little games of cross-purpose verbal repartee.  The world of Austen's PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is a society ruled by conniving and single-minded women who see men only in terms of the size of their wallets.  Whenever a new bachelor appears on the scene, the women of the novel (with the exception of Elizabeth, of course) immediately try to guess his income so that they can decide if one wishes to marry him.  His age, his looks, his habits are much less significant than his income.  A fat purse compensates for a fat head.<br />Modern readers typically call such schemers 'golddiggers,' and according to modern values, perhaps they are, but these readers ought to judge the book's morality against the age in which it was written.  Austen (1775 - 1817) lived in an England that prized manners and breeding over all else.  It is no surprise, then, that since the reclusive author felt most comfortable only in the company of women, that she would limit her book only to the thoughts, feelings, emotions, and habits of women.  In PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, men are never permitted to occupy center stage, nor are they shown interacting independently with other men.  If a man is present in any scene, so must a woman to control and observe his actions. Men--even the eventually triumphant Darcy--are generally portrayed as vain, sycophantic, sarcastic, and totally aware that they they are prized only for their money.<br />The world of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, especially if one has seen the fine film version starring Greer Garson, is one that seems to have been built for women to inhabit.  All the women wear flouncy, bouncy dresses with huge flowered hats that Scarlet O'Hara might have worn in GONE WITH THE WIND.  Even those ladies that complain of poverty never lack the funds to afford those outrageous outfits.  Further, Miss Austen stages a ball in just about every third chapter that permits single women to size up eligible men.  As these dandefied women and uniformed men speak to each other, the modern reader probably will be surprised at the excessive politeness and deference tossed unerringly about.  This strict adherence to a surface morality ought not to fool the reader into assuming that the characters are as inwardly noble as they are outwardly polite.  In fact, behind this massive wall of formal phrasing and good manners lies the same fears, jealousies, and general backstabbing that pervade a modern disco.  What gives PRIDE AND PREJUDICE its perpetual charm is the biting irony that causes the reader to wonder: 'Did that character say what I think he (or she) just said?' The modern reader can best appreciate Austen's wit if she can read between the lines to sense the tone of the moment.  If such a reader can see that this book is a polite if powerful indictment of a way of life that even Austen wished to poke fun of, then perhaps this reader can appreciate the charm of a book that grows with each successive reading.

B00005NRO3|5.0|As a whole, ignoring the conclusion for a moment, I judge Scream 2 to be the best film in the Scream trilogy.  The opening scene is quite brilliant in design, setting the backdrop as a movie theatre premiering the movie Stab (based on Gale Weathers' book about the killing spree documented in the original movie); basically, we watch enthusiastic audience members raucously enjoy a dramatization of the opening scene of Scream, and the first murders take place in this theatre full of masked, knife-wielding audience members-it's a perfect backdrop (but Jada Pinckett's death swoon is incredibly prolonged).  Rather than shirk criticism about this just being another rehashed sequel, Scream 2 is built around the very idea of recreating the events of the first movie.  We are on familiar ground from the very start of the action, feeling quite comfortable with the main characters from the original film: Sidney, Dewey, Randy, Gale, and-in a manner of speaking-the killer.  The introduction of Cotton Weary, the man who was wrongfully sentenced to prison for the murder of Sidney's mother, is a very effective addition that does much to increase both the suspense and mystery of the film as well as the list of possible suspects.  New cast members I took special note of include Heather Graham, Sarah Michelle Gellar (in a definite non-Buffy role), Portia de Rossi, and the singular Rebecca Gayheart, and I am happy to report at least one of these most attractive women does not succumb to the killer's knife.<br />The original Scream was a pretty original take on slasher films, and I was a little surprised to find the plot of this sequel equaling if not bettering that of the original film throughout the first two-thirds of the drama.  To some extent, we have seen all of this before-the killer calling his victims on the phone and then jumping out of nowhere with that familiar mask and sharp knife, individuals trying to escape the killer's grasp and usually failing to do so; Sydney facing up to her fears and trying to survive.  It all works well here, though.  The killings are not quite as violent or gory this time around, but the suspense is palpable throughout the entire movie.  The killer even made me twinge a time or two, and that rarely happens.  The only criticism I would have of Scream 2 is the ending.  It is much too long and drawn-out, for one thing.  It is also somewhat weakened by the fact that we know what kind of revelation to expect; it was well nigh impossible, even for as talented a script writer as Kevin Williamson, to top the power and surprise of Scream's final moments.  Even though I was unsure who the bad guys were in the first movie, in retrospect I could go back and analyze the clues to see that it made sense.  While the identity of the killer(s) did surprise me somewhat in this sequel, this was largely because the evidence I needed to figure out the mystery was not there for the most part; too much of the truth is hidden from us until the climaxing moments of the movie.<br />Scream 2 is a remarkably good sequel, one that does not fall victim to the curse of progressively bad follow-up films the horror genre is rife with.  Its additional comedic element, such as can be found in the interaction between Dewey and Gale as well as in Randy's theories on horror sequels, does help to offset any disappointment to be found in the film's ultimate revelations.  Of course, it is all but impossible for it to achieve the same effect on the viewer as the original Scream did because, while you may not know exactly what is coming, you can be reasonably sure that you know the form in which it will appear.p to her fears and trying to survive.

B00005JKZT|5.0|Being a movie fan who has never read any of the Lord of the Rings books, I was a bit skeptical about whether or not I would like this movie or not.  I had seen the first movie and liked it fairly well, but I was not prepared for the incredible movie experience of The Two Towers.<br />As many mid-trilogy films are, this movie is darker than the first and probably the next movie.  All hope seems lost as the fellowship of the ring is broken up and travels separately.  If you have not read the books, it may surprise you that Frodo is not in nearly as much of this movie as he was in the last, because the movie follows each of the broken up groups of the fellowship of the ring.<br />From what I heard, I expected the movie to be almost constant fighting and battle scenes that would get old after awhile.  While there are plenty of keen fighting scenes, there is also plenty of deeper character development, especially since all the characters had been introduced in the first movie.  There are also plenty of special effects, but they are blended into the movie and advanec the story, they don't create a sense of showing off.<br />[possible spoilers here]<br />Ian McKellan returns as Gandalf, and his acting is superb as usual.  Elijah Wood as Frodo is excellent as well; however, as I mentioned before, he is not in the movie as much as in the last one.  He portrays Frodo quite well, as Frodo has grown to appreciate the Ring more and more and begins to act kind of eerie or creepy.  The other two hobbits, Pippin and Merry, play a more important part in this film.  And of course, there is Golum, who is completely computer generated character, but is not reminiscent of the dreadful Jar Jar Binks in The Phantom Menace.<br />In conclusion, I think that anyone who has either read Tolkien's books or just likes action, adventure, or fantasy stories would very much like this movie.  It very likely may be the greatest film of the year and has been called the \\"Star Wars\\" of this generation.  Peter Jackson's second Lord of the Rings movie is an excellent show and a movie that will be famous years from now.eter Jackson's second Lord of the Rings movie is an excellent show and a movie that will be famous years from now.
0783211856|5.0|This was, without a doubt, the most difficult movie to sit through. It captures so vividly and painfully one of the darkest times in history. As a rule, we do not watch R rated movies in our home, but I believe that EVERYONE should watch this at some point. It is truly inspiring and helps to open our eyes as to what we as humans are capable of, both good and bad. I promise that you cannot possibly watch this and be unmoved by the powerful message.
B00006690G|5.0|This is the best of Eminem yet. If you are not sure about the guy, download them off the internet and listen yourself. But please buy the CD if you'd like to show some support. Let's face it. Eminem is one of the top rapper out there. He didn't earn this because he was white or he said things other didn't have balls to say. It was because his music is hot and his lyrics is funny and in touch with the reality.
630521610X|5.0|Scream provided the horror genre with a significant shot in the arm when it was released in 1996.  This movie was a whole bunch of horror films all rolled into one, yet it was also quite original and unlike what had come before.  Along with the undeniable creepiness and suspenseful nature of the wonderfully complex plot, Scream brilliantly incorporated pop culture and humor.  It paid homage to its antecedents, referring to 14 different horror movies of the past, incorporating scenes (and that powerful Carpenter music) from Halloween into the plot itself, citing the unspoken rules of horror movies, and sneaking in great cameo appearances by Linda Blair and \\"Fred\\" the janitor (played by Wes Craven himself).<br />The phone call from the killer gimmick works very well here, providing Scream with its own peculiar trademark.  I certainly had no idea about the true identity of the killer at the end, and I was thrilled to discover all of the rich nuances fuelling the entire killing spree. Scream is not your typical slice and dice flick with an easily identifiable bad guy and a plot that serves no more purpose than to provide an excuse for killing people.  Script writer Kevin Williamson is a veritable genius, a man whose love of horror movies fuels him to put together a story that will involve the audience's mind as well as its emotions.  The manner of murders are refreshingly varied, partly because the masked killer is so doggone clumsy most of the time and has to rely on devices other than his shiny big knife.  I found the suspense level of every important event almost perfect.  The soundtrack also adds strength to the whole effect, featuring great tracks such as Don't Fear the Reaper and Red Right Hand (which was originally used in a classic X-Files episode).<br />Of course, even the best script will fail without a talented cast, and Scream is blessed with some of Hollywood's best performers.  Neve Campbell is of course the perfect Sidney; Drew Barrymore is largely responsible for making Scream's opening scene such a memorable one; Courteney Cox is the perfect self-centered tabloid reporter; David Arquette is actually likeable in his role as the somewhat dim-witted deputy sheriff; Rose McGowan is the quintessential best friend (and a total knockout); Skeet Ulrich and Matthew Lillard play their roles perfectly; and the character of Randy Meeks, the self-proclaimed horror expert, is one of my all-time favorites.  Even the Fonz himself, Henry Winkler, plays a part in the film.  I don't think you could put together a better overall cast for a horror movie, and that is one of the real secrets of Scream's success.<br />No matter how many times I watch Scream, I never fail to get completely drawn into the suspense.  The DVD makes the experience even better with its load of goodies-a number of trailers, Wes Craven's commentary, some behind the scenes footage, interviews with cast members about the movie, cast biographies, trivia information, etc..  One really interesting note about this film is revealed in the credits: this movie was made \\"No Thanks Whatsoever To: the Santa Rosa City School District Governing Board\\"  because the school board backed out of its decision to let part of the movie be shot at its local high school, citing the film's excessive violence.  I believe this movie does what horror is supposed to do: draw out your own fears and negative emotions, transfer them to the screen, and send you away feeling invigorated, refreshed, and glad to still be alive.sponsible for making Scream's opening scene such a memorable one; Courteney Cox is the perfect self-centered tabloid reporter; David Arquette is actually likeable in his role as the somewhat dim-witted deputy sheriff; Rose McGowan is the quintessential best friend (and a total knockout); Skeet Ulrich and Matthew Lillard play their roles perfectly; and the character of Randy Meeks, the self-proclaimed horror expert, is one of my all-time favorites.

B00005JKZT|5.0|I recently went to go see The Lord of the Rings The Two Towers and it wasn't as good as I had expected...it was so much BETTER! The first one was amazing telling and explaining the plot of the story and how the ring came to be but the second one has a lot more action and each character(s) have there own story...Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas continue their journey searching for Merry and Pippin but find themselves in another even greater situation...Merry and Pippin are captured by the Urak-Hai and are accompanied by the Ents...and Frodo and Sam continue their quest to destroy the one ring with Gollum as their guide...I don't want to tell you exactly what happens and I'm not one of those people who spoil it in the reviews for those who haven't seen it...but I highly suggest you go see this AMAZING and EXCITING movie and I would even say...best movie of the year! Aragorn is DEFINATELY good to look at! lol...:)
B00006JDVV|4.0|Reign of Fire was one of the best Dragon Movies I have ever seen. Those dumb dragons in &quot;Dragon Heart&quot; are nothing compared to this movie.  The realism with the way the dragons looked was perfect.  The acting was well done.  The plot was done preety well.  The DVD of this movie made it even better. It had great special features like the interview with the director and the behing the secens of the film.  The picture quality was great and the sound was just right.  This is a DVD you should see.
B00003CXE7|5.0|I loved this movie. It was vey good. If you have a weak stomach I would not recomend this movie to you.<br />The main caracter is Russel Crowe. He is sooooooooo cool.
B00005JKZT|4.0|Well some of you aren't going to want to read this but,the movie was only 4 stars. The action great, CG was great, following the plot of the book not so great. Now I'm not one of these nerds who think it has to be word for word like the book but some of the scenes were way off. The Treebeard scene was one of the lesser ones  but still off(Why can't they just agree to a war what was the point of having to be tricked?)Also Aragon falling off the cliff? What was the point of that(Why couldn't he just ride to Helms Deep with the others?) And finally, the one and only thing that really upset me was the next to last scene Faramir and Frodo.Faramir Bad?? What happened to I wouldn't pick it up if it was on the highway and the walls of Gondor were falling(or something like that)? Now it's tell the king I have a most powerful gift for him(traitor). Peter Jackson really let the book readers down on this one I think. Now my mom may not mind but for someone who has read the book this is to big of a director's change. Leaving something out is one thing but changing the story is another. All in all this is a great middle movie to the series.Just read the book before you go. Smeagol is the best CG creature ever(Star What!!!)Don't be fooled though this isn't a movie it is the continuation of the first one. You jump right in and take off till you once again hit a sudden stop no looking back.Well once again the long wait till the DVD comes out.This will be the best movie ever after the third part is finally out no movie can come close!
B00006JJ1O|5.0|Look out Shirley Manson and Courtney Love!  T.A.T.U's album really rocks!  After All The Things She Said was released months ago I anxiously awaited the release of their album ... and it was well worth the wait!  Both girls voices carry a very wide range and the combination of their styles makes for a very unique sound.  But aside the much hyped lesbian relationship of these two Russian teen vamps because once you hear the cd you'll only want more.  The music speaks louder than any marketing stratagem and it screams FIERCE!
B00002MZ2C|5.0|Well, now we're talkin. I was really impressed with RATM's first album, and I loved Evil Empire, although a tad less than the first. Then comes The Battle of LA. Holy S---! The power, the conviction, the unrelentness of it all enthralled me. This is Rage's crowning achievement. You see, it ain't nothing wrong with rap stylings, as long as you know how to do it, do it musically, with class, and withoug apologies, as Rage so masterfully does. In my book (so far, I admit there's always stuff you ain't heard...) there is only 3 acts that use rap to a lesser or greater degree that are really good, because they are not relying on pre-fab sounds from electronic gadgets: Rage, The Roots and the Chili Peppers.  Sadly, Rage is no more as we knew it. Now we have Audioslave - good, but never as great as the original. You want reality? Power? Groove? Innovation? Play this one loud and call me in the morning.

0385508417|1.0|This is a horrible, horrible book. It might sound like a lighthearted, fun book to read over the holidays...but it isn't.<br />The basic premise of the story is about one couple that decides to &quot;skip christmas&quot; and not buy presents or hold the usual festivities. Instead they are going on a cruise. The book is basically abou tthem struggling to not &quot;do&quot; christmas and how others treat them because of it. Sample: &quot;I think she might break,&quot; he thought. &quot;I had better keep her away from the mall today.&quot; (regarding his wife)<br />So, they spend the whole book doing this, and at the end, it's all a waste. Their daughter comes home with her fiance and only tells them on christmas eve about how excited she is to show her boy how christmas is done in the US: parties, decorations, etc. So they end up blowing all of their money on getting it together. If it sounds good, it isn't. Trust me, do not buy this book. If you are otherwise a fan of John Grisham, this may make you hate him.
B00005JLRR|5.0|I have seen all the TV episodes of all the Star Trek series old and new. I have also now seen all the movies of Star Trek old and new. This movie, \\"Nemesis\\", is definetly one of Star Trek's best presentations that they have ever created.<BR>There are no weak points to this movie and the movie was well written and presented. This movie does have the same emotions and style as \\"The Wrath of Khan\\" and is well worth spending money to buy or go and see in theaters.<BR>While reading other reviews for this movie, I feel that people who write most of these reviews are not true Star Trek fans or can not understand the true meaning behind Star Trek. Star Trek is definetly not like Star Wars. One difference being is the fact that Star Wars does not have Teleporters.<BR>This movie had the Star Trek soul to it and for the people who are not Star Trek fans, then I would have to tell you to not go and see it. Because, it is hard to gather the emotion to understand the characters if you have not watched all the Star Trek movies. For the people that have never seen a Star Trek movie, it may be wise to learn first what Star Trek is all about, rather then deciding a bad review for a movie that has characters you can't understand. This movie, \\"Nemesis\\", will live on as a legend and may in time, be regarded as one of the most emotionally powerful movies in Star Trek's History.
014028009X|3.0|I must admit, I tried to read this book a few years ago and put it down after about five pages, very disappointed (given all the press it had gotten).  <br />But looking for a good bubblebath read -- something that wouldn't require too much thought -- I picked it up again after finding an old edition for just a few bucks.<br />This time around I got into it and read it quickly.  This is one of those rare instances in which I did prefer the movie, but the book kept me entertained, despite the fact that Bridget and I are practically polar opposites.  Still, I think that most young women can relate to struggling to keep our life on course, keep our love lifes stable, and satisfied with our bodies.
B00006V9A0|5.0|First of all, I am a big fan and so of course have all the individual album's, single's, and a ton of bootlegs so this compilation really isn't that useful for me. However, as a greatest hits CD i think it is great. I'm really glad they didn't include too much from nevermind. That's why this disc works really well for newbies or people who just own nevermind. Most people don't have Incesticide and so haven't heard one of my favorite songs: Sliver. The only change I would make is &quot;Where Did You Sleep Last Night&quot; really needed to be in here (replace Man Who Sold the World?, maybe). It is probably the best cover of a blues song I have ever heard and is an amazing song.
1565847032|5.0|I decided to use my review space just to mention that I find it funny how anytime anyone says something that another side doesn't agree with, they suggest that they are completely driven by money. Someone wrote an earlier review asking why Chomsky didn't &quot;step down from MIT, because he liked the money..&quot;<br />So if an author like Chomsky writes a book with differing opinions than what are shown in the mass media today, they aren't allowed to get paid?<br />I don't get it.
B00005JKZT|5.0|I was spellbound by the previous Lord Of The Rings film, \\"Fellowship Of The Ring\\". However, that one, as powerful, riveting, and astounding as it is, it is eclipsed by this second installment film in the three part trilogy ¡§The Two Towers¡¨. The cast of this movie is perfect. The same held true with the previous as well. The thing that I found vastly improved was the grouchy dwarf Gimli. I wasn¡¦t fond of him as he seemed selfish & just plain uninteresting in the first LOTR movie but in the second LOTR movie, he was vastly improved in this movie to become one of the highlight characters in my opinion. <br />The whole imaginative world that J. R. Tolkien built in his mind would¡¦ve put anything that George Lucas or Steven Spielberg would¡¦ve imagined to shame. He made up entire languages, entire language accents, entire worlds, it goes on. He would¡¦ve been impressed by the movie screen adaptations.  No other novel that I¡¦ve read has been so well adapted to the big screen like ¡§Lord Of The Rings¡¨ has and I doubt it¡¦ll be surpassed for a long time if ever. <br />What I find amazing about the LOTR movies so far is that things that make most other fantasy movies rather cheesy sometimes, add so much to this movies power and emotion. <br />Just trying to be able to put even a drop of the creativity that Tolkien had, onto the big screen seemed impossible but with the help of Peter Jackson, doing so succeeded in every way. Ian McKellen was perfect to play Gandalf. I especially find it wonderful to see the husky voiced Christopher Lee play the renegade wizard Saruman. The only one missing from the previous movie is Ian Holm as Bilbo Baggins. That however, is made up for though as new characters are introduced as new alliances are made to fight Saruman¡¦s armies. I would even go far enough to say that IMO, what Peter Jackson already has accomplished surpasses what Lucas & Spielberg did when they made the ¡§Star Wars¡¨ & ¡§Indiana Jones¡¨ trilogies. Even the Harry Potter, Ronald Weasley, Hermione Granger team doesn¡¦t stand a chance against the menacing Saruman, Gandalf, Frodo, or Aragorn. Those movies are all classics but ¡§The Two Towers¡¨ alone in more powerful than ¡§Star Wars¡¨, & ¡§Harry Potter¡¨ combined! Jackson¡¦s directing is stunning & mind boggling. In fact, from my perspective, this movie is perfect!  The visuals are amazing especially with the ¡§Sauron¡¦s Eye¡¨ and the lightning above Mt. Doom, as well as the birds eye view of Saruman¡¦s Tower Palace and the Gates to it.  The storylines are incredible emotionally deep and moving. There isn¡¦t one drop of talent wasted in the movie. <br />Picking up where \\"The Fellowship of The Ring\\" left off where Frodo and Samwise were when they saw the fiery Mount Doom, the two run into the alienish looking creature Gollum, a former Hobbit, who found the Ring after thousands of years and tormented by it's power before Bilbo Baggins found it after Gollum lost it and Frodo now had the ring and is on his bid to destroy it in the fires of Mt. Doom but encounters Gollum, the one who found it after it was lost for thousands of years. Due to his permanent mental poisoning caused by the ring and his experience of the rings power, he guides Frodo & Samwise (who does not trust Gollum) towards the fiery Mt. Doom. At the same time, Aragorn, Legolas, & Gimli hunt down orcs that captured Pippin & Merry during the battle that claimed the life of Borimir in the last movie. The two hobbits escape the orcs though and what lies ahead for them is well, let¡¦s just say, out of this world. The whole story perfectly runs along and the special effects are beyond words. <br />However, that¡¦s not the main thing that makes this one rank above ¡§Fellowship¡¨. What makes this one even more powerful is that towards the ending, there¡¦s a powerful message at the ending that I¡¦m not going to give out as doing so would spoil the thrills. <br />I had sky high hopes for ¡§The Two Towers¡¨ but to my surprise, this movie not only met them, it surpassed them by a thousand miles to become my favorite movie of all time. Five stars isn¡¦t enough to do this movie any justice. <br />I think overall, I think this one may as well turn out to be the best of the three, as well as the one with the most substance. All I can do now is try to keep myself entertained as I now begin the excruciating one year wait for the cataclysmic finale ¡§Return Of The King¡¨ and witness the final battle to save Middle Earth from the evil clutches of Sauron. Ultimately, these three movies will become legendary classics as the years progress and become favorites for generations to come. <br />I look forward spending 9 to 10 hours watching all three LOTR movies the whole way through when all three of them are out on video. <br />Go see this movie pronto! Once you leave the movie theatre, you¡¦ll never be the same again. º_ Well, I¡¦m pretty much exhausted of words. Bye! Bye!
0316666343|4.0|I think I really like this book.  I might not have understood all of it, but I appreciated all that I could.  I was unsure about the ending--something about it was unrealistic.  Maybe it was the mother suddenly coming back or Mr. Harvey getting killed by an icicle or maybe it was how quickly the family healed.  However, there was much to think about in this book, and I'll certainly read it again.
B00005OMTT|5.0|This is a fantastic, colorful collection of 18 amazing tracks from Enigma's catalog. I don't think that this album is soothing. In fact I think it's a very intense stormy album. <br />All of the songs are great and this CD is a must have.
B00005JKZT|5.0|I don't think trailer reviews should be written. Anyway, I just saw the Two Towers and it was defenitly better than the Fellowship. And Thats hard to do. It did totally fool aroud with the story, however. Faramir never wanted to posses the ring, and he never took Frodo and Sam to Osgalith in the book. The scene with Osgalith was the only dissapointing part. I especialy liked Gandalf going toe-to-toe with the Balroq on Zirak-Zigal. LOTR trivia: Gandalf's sword Glamdring was once held by Turgon king of Gondolin. The film ends at least four chapters before the book does, but I think this is to compinsate for th Return of the King's length. That book is shorter than the first Harry Potter(ugh, I hate HP). That probably mean's Jackson has cut out the Souring of the Shire. Oh well, you can't have everything in life. <BR>Please excuse any misspellings, as I am horrible with the English language.

B00006RU5B|5.0|Audioslave is a band that takes music seriously.  The band members demonstrate a creative, independent sound that is seldom allowed in the industry today.  The self-titled debut is a meticulously prepared achievment that any collector with an appreciation for early 1990s PNW music should have.  Fans that like &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot;, &quot;Paranoid&quot;, or Rage's first album should purchase Audioslave.  I recommend it without reservations.
B000021YQV|3.0|If you want something to help with anger,aggression,being pissed off,sad,or really happy or just something gritty, crunchy and full of feeling to accompany that feeling that you get when you feel you just have to sit down and soak in the musical juices...then System of a Down's Toxicity IS NOT FOR YOU.  I give them credit for being creative spontaneous sounding and having new voice that stands out from the Creeders, Incubusers and the such, his voice is just different.  It never sounds down to earth and serious tho.  Maybe i'm just not down with thier Armenian roots(if anybody gives a damn what that is or if this statement makes any difference in helping reviewers to explain thier unique style) So it's good not incredibly heavy filled with ear pleasing bottom end.  Under all this difference and foreign uniqueness when you listen to them there's nothing so ear pleasing or captivating enoough to sit and stare figure out what the hell they're talking about, you just know what you just heard wasn't what you needed to vent or vibe.  1. somewhat heavy  2.weird and unique 3.If you need something to help cope and deal with feelings this won't do a good job
B00006RU5B|4.0|I have to admit that I wasn't really a big fan of Rage Against the Machine or Soundgarden but I always thought that singer Chris Cornell and guitarist Tom Morello were simply the most amazing musicians in rock and roll today. Chris Cornell's vocals are nothing short of amazing. He really has a powerful voice. Tom Morello is just extraordinary with his guitars. I didn't think it was possible to come up with the sounds that he does on a guitar. After hearing the first single \\"Cochise\\" a few times, the song has really gotten underneath my skin and made me a fan of Audioslave. I was fortunate enough to find a copy of the self-titled debut album in the used cd bins on one of my regular jaunts to the record store. So going on the strength of \\"Cochise\\", I bought the cd. The only flaw with this album I thought was that it was a bit too long for my personal tastes and towards the end of the cd, the music started to sound alike.If the album was just under an hour, I think I would have given this album 5 stars and consider it simply flawless. Still the album in general is a good, solid rock album. One of the few that I appreciate since my tastes in music lately has been towards goth and industrial music. It is nice to hear a rock band that isn't as lumped as \\"emo\\" or \\"nu metal\\", two types of music that I despise with a passion. If anything, Audioslave's music is reminiscent of the era when bands like Soundgarden or Rage Against the Machine had that massive guitar sound. I'm not saying that Audioslave sounds like either band (which they don't) but in a general sense they bring back a magic when bands were putting out some of the most uncompromising music there is in rock 'n roll. Although a bit flawed, Audioslave's self-titled album is a powerful rock album that doesn't come off as whiney ...Chris Cornell's powerful vocals and Tom Morello's amazing guitar sounds makes for an unbreakable combination. The highlights for me on this album just happens to be a couple of ballads. I absolutely love \\"Like a Stone\\" and I Am the Highway\\". Lyrically, my favorite song is \\"Show Me How to Live\\". I definitely am looking forward to hearing more from Audioslave in the future.bsolutely love \\"Like a Stone\\" and I Am the Highway\\". Lyrically, my favorite song is \\"Show Me How to Live\\".

B00006RG9K|5.0|This video and acc. cds reminded me how much I enjoy Genesis. After MTV's attempt to overexpose them in the '80's, I could hardly stand to hear them. Thankfully I have now discovered they were still putting out incredible songs and arrangements.  This video is actually very entertaining... as opposed to many concert videos that are incredibly one-dimensional.  LOTS of extras that add various dimensions... well worth the cost. It reminds me just how much Genesis is also a very visual band. Being a drummer, I especially love the shots of Phil and Chester playing. Not surprisingly, 10+ yr old Genesis music STILL beat anything released since. Unlike today's &quot;groups&quot;, they weren't ones to follow trends, they stayed true to their music and themselves.
038533558X|5.0|After reading Tell No One, I waited patiently like a good kid for his next book...meaning: the day it was released I ran out to buy it, told everyone who asked \\"I was real busy with work\\", and settled into the divan in the big bay window overlooking the Pacific Ocean, with no real plans, I immersed myself into the fast action world of Harlan Coben.<br />Taking a quote that sets the stage: \\"We never forget our first love. Mine ended up being murdered.\\" And from this starts the new and ninth book, which was a fast lane ride from beginning the very last and very surprising twist at the end. Coben is the king of twists and he doesn't disappoint.  In fact, the book is full of twists.  Each time I thought I might be on the right track, Coben would throw out another curve, off I would go believing that now, I was truly on the right path. The only drag on the book is that the lead character, Will Klein is interchangeable with the lead from Tell No One, David Beck but honestly that didn't bother me too much. Between all the action, plot twists, the lead characters dealing with rage, memory, lost identities, broken hearts, and grudges into the next lifetime, my plate was filled, appetite satisfied and I was immersed in a great read.
B00005JL78|5.0|After watching AI I was truly disappointed in the direction Stephen Spielberg.  Minority Report was a relief.  His time and effort for depicting the future with his weekend think tank with some of the great minds in many different areas made of a convincing movie.  I love how computer enable directors to bring realistic dreams to the movie screen.  The story is just as incredible.  It reminds me of the old Twilight Zones or a great Alfred Hitchcock.  The picture is great on this DVD.  Using a type of desaturation a crisp blue formed.  The special Features found on disc two are amazing. My biggest problem with many DVD's is the lack of cooperation by the director and cast.  Here Stephen Spielberg takes his time to explain his vision along with his other constituents. This is a buy.  You will not be disappointed.  The man delivers again with a breath taking film.

B00006879E|5.0|Suffering a severe hangover on a long car ride home, a friend played a new new CD he had recently purchased.  This CD was none other than Maroon 5's &quot;Songs About Jane&quot;.  Not only did I make the trip home with all of my insides intact, but I went and bought this CD as soon as I could drive on my own.  Maroon 5 is nothing but a band with an enormous amount of future potential.  Each and every song has its own characteristic that keeps it playing in your head all day long, so it is no wonder that this band is on the tip of the tongue of an increasing amount of students at the University of Oklahoma.
0345409671|3.0|This is one of those books that will capture your imagination. It has it flaws, but it was still well written. I don't hate this book, but I didn't love it. I think that Anne Rice was running out of ideas and decided to write something about the two most controversial things on this Earth, God and the Devil. The fact that God was depicted as being evil and not caring was a bit too exagerated. Memnoch seemed too good. He talked about the history of God and his angels, yet we still know nothing about him and God and why they truly fight. You need to know Christanity quite well, which I don't, to understand this book. I loved the other books much better and hope that Anne Rice makes books like the first ones. This book just shocked me a lot and I just don't really know how to describe it!
6305971145|5.0|I love this movie! I watched it every year until my sister taped over it and I am so happy to have found it!

B00006V9A0|4.0|It was on a Sunday, late into January 1994, when Nirvana met for the last time in a recording studio. That evening they produced their last track with lead singer Kurt Cobain before he committed suicide a little over 2 months later on April 5th 1994. With the death of Nirvana the remaining two members disbanded and the group that gave birth to grunge was no more. Now over a decade since Nirvana's first release we are offered the long awaited Nirvana Greatest Hits CD. The CD opens with the final track ever produced by the trio \\"You Know Your Right\\". The song keeps to the Nirvana formula of raw chaos and subtle melody. Kurt ironically proclaims in the song \\"Things have never been so swell/And I have never been so well\\" Looking back now we see that things were not so well and less than 4 months later Kurt took life into his own hands. The CD begins with \\"You Know Your Right\\", Nirvana's final recorded song and moves along appropriately to the first \\"About a Girl\\" which was released on their debut album, Bleach. The album continues to flow in this fashion as it moves onto \\"Sliver\\" and then brings listeners to the unforgettable Nevermind days which put  not only Nirvana but grunge music in the spotlight. The release of Nevermind slapped MTV in the face as angry teens uprooted pop music and spread their teen spirit across the airwaves. \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\", the fifth song on the CD brings back the memories of the first time you heard that tidal wave of pure punk and grunge mixed so closely together it made you grind your teeth in sheer shock of the possibility. \\"Teen Spirit\\" spelled out revolution and drove Nevermind through the roof. The Greatest Hits CD continues to spit out Nevermind classics such as \\"Come as You Are\\", \\"Lithium\\" and \\"In Bloom\\". Other hits such as \\"Heart Shaped Box\\" and \\"Sliver\\" are present but it was the appearance of \\"All Apologies\\" and the David Bowie cover \\"The Man Who Sold the World\\" which I found to be the most unexpected but well deserved tracks on the CD. It's difficult to critique any Greatest Hits CD as most songs on the disk are great to begin with. With Nirvana I feel the overall CD brings back the forgotten legacy that Nirvana left behind. After listening to the tracks on Nirvana I cannot help but realize how some tracks foreshadow Cobain's suicide. It's hard not to realize how much anger, hope and despair comes through in Cobain's lyrics. The compilation itself contains all their hits but only had 14 tracks and although it could have included \\"Where Did You Sleep Last Night\\" or \\"Something in the Way\\" I never got the feeling that the CD was lacking. In the liner notes of the CD drummer Dave Grohl admits \\"It's easy to remember him (Kurt Cobain) being sad, but the things that I like to think about are his happiness and how much he loved music, whether it was sitting in a living room and playing acoustic guitar, or playing at the Off Ramp in Seattle. He really loved creating music.\\" The CD ends with \\"The Man Who Sold the World\\" and at the end of the track, through the midst of applause, we hear Cobain's final words on the CD as a he subtly says: <BR>\\"Thanks\\".
B00006CXXU|5.0|Out from behind the horrendous make up, comes Christina Aguilera's third full length english CD (if you include her Christmas CD). A Twenty-Track monster that rockets Christina to the top of my personal pop-charts.<br />Through and through, this album is flawless. Amazing production quality, amazing vocals, lyrics, and musicianship. And the mixture of styles is a plus as well!<br />The intro is a great, tense opening, using clips from media and such, letting the listner know that this opener is being set up as the target she plans to knock down for the next 19 tracks (and she hits a bulls-eye every time).<br />It is amazing how differnt each track can be from the next, but equally amazing how fluently they all flow. It's just enough that you almost CAN'T get tired of the sound, because it's all so difernet, yet holds an underlying link, that keeps it fluid. As soon as the CD is over, you wanna play it again.<br />I may have to listen to this record a few more times before I can really find a serious flaw in it. I don't care what the critcs say about X-Tina. She's X-Cellent in my book.
B00000JPYQ|5.0|This is the best live album ever, period. No one else comes close to the sheer blistering power and clarity of sound. Schenker is on fire and the rest of em' are as solid as a 'rock'. This album sounds even better today than it did 20 odd years ago! How many albums can you say that about? The best ever rock album by the best ever rock band. If you like melodic rock with a hard edge then buy it today...NOW!!...make it a priority in your life, you won't regret it. Nuff said.
B00005R2M3|4.0|When I first heard Shakira, it was MTV, so I paid little attention to it - figureing it out to be the worst. But under closer inspection, I was quite suprised. Firstly, I was not away that she had already been around for a while, just not in the US, and secondly, and most importantly, all the instruments, and stytes she seamlessly blends into one another.<br />The open of the CD just blows me away, with the most rockin' version of a tango song I have ever heard. It really gets things moving for the rest of the album. I am in love with the guitar riffs through out, and much in love with the almost muted horn section in \\"Underneith Your Clothes\\". It's almost a mini song, inside a larger song.<br />The moments of Brazilan singing, is just georgious. She is able interlace both languages seamlessly without any jarring effects.<br />There are of course some MTV-ish, tunes in there, but that is come to be expected with all Pop records these days, and after all, I did hear her first on MTV.<br />The only reason I don't give this five stars, is because of the few soggy moments in the album, where it seems to die down for a bit, the music is un-enjoyable, and sometimes somewhat borring.
B00003OSTQ|5.0|In a 1970's review, who's author I'm at an unfortunate loss to recall, it was prophecised that Network would be a huge commmercial smash. Imagine that! Could a movie like this woo modren crowds who labor under the belief that by simply being enjoyable a movie is worthy? No. There is a pleasant lack of what in modren terms could be considered \\"commercial appeal\\", in fact there is not even a score to manipulate our emotions as the director sees fit, which alone merits praise. Our latter day Athenian crowds squeal like indignant pigs when their vices are questioned (\\"If you don't like it, leave America\\"), but regardless it should be done in the spirit of satire, at least. How wonderful then that Paddy Chayefsky does an extradordinary job. Yes, maybe the message will fall on deaf ears, as another review has stated. Perhaps we have embraced Jerry Springer as \\"a crazy uncle\\", and badly staged sex scenes on tv still makes us grunt like pigs in estrus; as long as there are people of reason, the truth of Chayefsky's indictment will not fade away.<BR> I believe that credit for the success of the picture can be divided equaly among the Writer, the cast, and the director( yes, Hollywood folk out there who read this. The credit should not be the director, the cast, and then-lastly-the Writer), who perform their duties with the skill much lacking in the younger filmmakers of today. *sigh* Now if only agesim could be abolished in Hollywood, the teen demographic utterly forgotten, and innovative ideas given their day instead of being rewritten to be safe, yawn inducing cliches by illiterate \\"writers\\" with an eye toward a new Lexus.... Enjoy this crown jewel of cinema that could only have been made in the 70's, a great decade for movies. It did not earn Best Picture, of course(Rocky did) which I'd call it a crime, but given that the Academy of Motion Pictures has also awarded How Green Was My Valley Best Picture in the same year as the release of Citizen Kane, never gave Hitchcock an award, nor Stanley Kubrick, and among other laughable deeds gave Julia Roberts an oscar over Ellen Burstyn, the academy has rendered itself obsolite in mine eyes.

B00004SCX6|4.0|When i first bought this album i thought it was really good but then when her new cd came out i thought this one was childish and silly. Well for some reason i listened to the album again recently and i must say...what happened?<br />This album was a vast improvement from her first album and i although her 3rd album is good, this was full of hits and potentional hits. Yes, some of it's cheesy but it's pop music what do you expect. At least it's good pop.<br />While Britney's voice is nothing short of average, it's not as bad some people say it is.She has something that most performers lack- when she's on stage you cannot look away. It's like she grabs your feeble mind by its head and controls your every thought. Truly a great entertainer and I think that we have yet to see her full potential- now on with the review.<br />1. Oops: i like this song but it's kind of annoying after 2 times...yeah.<BR>2. Stronger: never gets old, awesome song. Wish it was the 1st single.<BR>3. Dont go knockin: it's kind of silly but it's good, nice beat.<BR>4. Satisfaction: i really like this song, her voice sounds sexy and it has something her other covers miss for some reason. It's a bit repetitive but it's definately worth a listen.<BR>5. Don't let me be the last to know: britney sounds so good on this song;sensual, emotional- i love it and she does it great live.<BR>6. What u see...: Catchy r&b/pop dance track- a lot of fun to listen to.<BR>7.Lucky: ok i like this song but it is annoying after a few listens. good beat.<BR>8.one kiss from u: ehh its ok but it sounds like filler to me<BR>9.Where are you now: this song is ok but its a little to slow. i like the music- her voice sounds good but she could never do it live.<BR>10. can't make you love me: catchy song, great techno feel.<BR>11. When you eyes say it: sigh, i would buy this album just for this song- ok you'd probably download it but- it's a beautiful song, i hope britney works with diane warren more often because she makes great ballads- mature, sexy, awesome vocals and music.<BR>12.dear diary: filler yet again.<br />Overall: 8/10 <BR>Yes it is a great step up from her bubblegum pop and is almost above her 3rd album which, despite good songs, didn't experiment much in the \\"funky r&b\\" type of music britney said it would.<BR>If I had a say in the singles that should have been off this album they would have been.<br />1.Stronger<BR>2.Satisfaction<BR>3.Don't let me be the last to know<BR>4.When Your Eyes Say it<br />But, hey what do i know. I'm just a guy with an idea. Think what you want about this album- i'd take a listen though before you buy it.
0790729687|4.0|Few films could match the pre-release hoopla of the 1994 vampire epic \\"Interview With the Vampire.\\" Based on the now-classic Anne Rice novel and starring Hollywood big guns Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, this goth horror fantasy lived up to expectations in amazing fashion due to terrific period detail, superb performances and the always-interesting direction of the talented Neil Jordan (\\"The Crying Game\\").<br />Granted, much of the fascinating Rice Novel (the first of her Vampire Chronicles) was forsaken, but so much is followed verbatim that even the most dedicated devotee was - for the most part - pleased. Pitt makes a perfect Louis and, surprisingly, Cruise is terrific as Lestat. Their verbal and eventually physical warfare makes for great fireworks along the recreated riverfront of 18th and 19th century New Orleans French Quarter.<br />This is arguably the greatest vampire film ever made, though fans of Francis Ford Coppola's \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" and Hammer's \\"Horror of Dracula\\" may disagree. But the look, the emotion and the angst of these stylish and oh-so-beautiful vampires (Antonio Banderas' Armand is also a memorable character) should capture the imagination of just about any moviegoer with a taste for the unusual.<br />After viewing \\"Queen of the Damned,\\" a sad and utterly moronic version of the third Anne Rice novel from her Vampire Chronicles, one can't help but appreciate this thoughful celluloid portrayal. Rarely hitting a bad note - with the exception of a tacked on Hollywood-Guns-and-Roses ending which nearly capsizes the entire film, \\"Interview With the Vampire\\" is a great example of what big money moviemakers and producers can create when they take supernatural material seriously. A fine film based on a fine novel. This great work will leave you thristing for more.
B00005JKCH|2.0|... this has got to be one of the worst \\"Special Editions\\" around. The movie is great but the EPKs ... big time.<br />It has barely anything substantial. It's predominantly various interviews with the cast and Stan Lee and they talk exactly the same thing in each interview; with about half a dozen clips from the movie that repeat several times over. There is no actual behind-the-scenes nor any of the teasers that were immensely popular 8-12 months prior to the movie release.<br />The concept art gallery was good but they could have included some more. Probably the only positive thing I found on the \\"Special Edition\\" was the Activision game demo. But for the people who already have the game...oh well.<br />Definitely a huge disappointment for me. Wish the studio had spent a little from the millions they earned in the box-office to make make this DVD a true \\"special Edition\\" for the fans.
B00005QDW5|5.0|ECHOES THE BEST OF PINK FLOYD is the only album a true PINK FLOYD fan should own.
6305972591|2.0|Children of the Corn is ninety excruciatingly long minutes of kids hacking up their parents and other adults who vex them.  How about this, I'll sum up the movie with a few quotes.<br />    \\"He who walks behind the rows is displeased.\\" (ooooooh)<BR>    \\"Outlander---I'll get you OUTLANDER!\\"<BR>    \\"Who did this?\\"<BR>    \\"Isaac.\\"<BR>    \\"Malachai.\\"<BR>    \\"Sacrifice, sacrifice!\\"<br />   It's really pretty awful, and the acting is worse.  I'm not a fan of Stephen King, but I'm guessing his novella would have to be better than this.  If you thought The Shining was bad, you're in for a special treat!<BR>That said, it does have some things going for it.  The cover is scary looking.  The VHS copy has a raised sickle (I've never liked those things) and evil eyes watching from the corn stalks.  And there is something genuinely creepy about a corn field.  I don't know what else to say.  Don't see this movie!!!

B000002UAU|5.0|I bought Sgt. Pepper on a whim and I am so glad that I did.  This album is so amazing to me. Every song on it is so different from the next yet they're all so great.  I've had this cd for less than a year and I've already had to buy it again because i wore out the first one from playing it so much. Everything in this album comes together to make it great.  Amazing lyrics, great use of their instruments as well as all the experimentation not to mention each band member's phenomenal talent. Lucy in the Sky is pure Lennon, With a Little Help from my Friends, all Ringo, Within you Without you everything Harrison, and When I'm 64 could be no one but Mccartney. By far one of the best albums I've ever heard!
B000002OOY|5.0|This soundtrack is definatly the best I've ever heard. It is the soundtrack that got me interested in movie soundtracks. It has the greatest theme I've ever heard. Sadly the theme wasn't used much in the second film, but in the third it was back and it sounded better than ever.<br />I definatly recommend this soundtrack to fans of the movie, fans of John Williams, and fans of movie soundtracks because this is the best one out there.
B00004W52U|5.0|even though they only were around for a short time they made this cd that just blows me away. it is one of the greatest ska cds ive ever heard and if you dont currently own this cd...go out and BUY IT!!!!!!
B000055WIQ|5.0|this is better than the original. even though people say its not scary this movie still scares ... me!!! i saw it in the theaters like 2 years ago i went home with chills. for religious people please dont see this. i thought the spider wlak was great. this is with out a doubt the best horror movie!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|I never give five stars, but Momento deserves every single one. A Masterpiece of orginality and a rare diamond in a sea of Hollywood medicority. ...  <br />This film is brillant on every level, its' genius has been discussed enough by previous reviewers but the only warning you have to give is that the \\"viewer\\" must enjoy a thought-provoking film. One that provokes metaphysical questions both personally and on the artistic level. ...<br />It is not to state that I am some great intellectual but I do enjoy the act of asking myself questions and trying to come up with the answers. The best way to wind up a film for me is to have a coffee and talk about it with whoever I saw it with. I usually gauge the success of the film by how long the conversation goes on after. An hour is usually the mark of a really good film, that happened with Fargo, Schindler's List. With Momento, I am still talking about it months later...<br />I enjoy no-brainer films once in awhile too, sometimes it is nice to just sit back and drink in the eye-candy and take it all in at the surface level. But Momento is not this kind of film, which probably explains why this film has not gotten the mass recognizition that it so richly deserves.<br />I now use this film when I first meet or interview people, and ask them what they think of it, if they've seen it. ... Everyone, like the character in Momento likes to think of themselves as the positive flawless person of thier own stories but really are they, or do we all lie to ourselves to make ourselves happy? I know I do, by thinking I am a lot smarter then I really am... <br />Mitchell
B00006C79E|5.0|As other customers on this review board have said, it takes<BR>quite a few listens to really get into this album. With the exception of Soft Like Me, the CD is one of their best recordings ever. The best thing to remember about Saint Etienne is they're an experimental pop band, which means some people may really love this record, and others may get disturbed by the throw backs to 80's style New Wave via Sparks, Cabaret Voltaire and Depeche Mode. A genre, which I should add, that I was apart of as a teenager and very much enjoyed. The main object of the experiment is the audience themselves. I have been a fan of this group since 1998, with the release, of Good Humor/Fairfax High.<BR>Every album that I've purchased from them contains something completely different. That's what I like about them. There aren't enough artists, nowadays, even the so-called alternative pop bands who put out consistently good and listenable music with the exception of maybe Bjork, or possibly even Thievery Corporation and Morcheeba.
B000002UUX|5.0|Megadeth is at the peak of their career with this album, by far their best work. With Marty Friedman and Nick Menza joining Megadeth proved to be a much more professionally sounding and better produced album than their previous work. (So Far, So Good, So What?) <BR>What's so great about this album is that it breaks normal verse, chorus, verse, chorus, solo, chorus song structure. No two songs sould alike but at the same time the album sounds great from start to finish. The drumming and guitars are flawless, but I felt Mustaine's voice didn't sound as powerful as other metal singers of the time. I also find myself turning up the bass becuase it seems like it just wasn't recorded loud enough. <BR>I love the whole government conspiracy theme to the album, I got interested in the whole Area 51 & Hanger 18 thing becuase of it.<BR>This album is defintly in my top ten and has been for a long time. It didn't leave my car's CD player for like 3 months! You won't regret buying this one.
B00006JL1Z|4.0|Back when I bought the green sleeved hits collection from the \\"Big Mac\\", I found myself dissapointed-- no \\"The Chain\\", or \\"Never Going Back Again\\", which are absolute essentials.  Well, good news: this two-disk collection has them, and so much more.  I LOVED the fact that the live version of \\"Big Love\\" was included, simply because it's far more passionate and dramatic than the studio cut;  just listen to Lindsey's break-neck guitar and dynamic singing.  <br />Some people have complained about the lack of the pre-1975 material.  But I think I can speak for most persons when I say \\"don't let the hard-core fans scare you away.\\"  They're always the ones to forget that a greatest hits album is for the casual fan who has little or no material from a band in their collection, and yet would like all of their radio favorites brought together in one easily purchased package;  it is not intended for those who already have all of the artist's albums.  And this collection does an admirable job of filling that need.<br />My only complaints are ones which the hard-core fans are praising.  As they already have everything else, they love the alternate mixes of \\"Rhiannon\\" and \\"Over My Head\\".  Well, whereas the remixed \\"Rhiannon\\" is (thankfully) not very different, the casual listener will probably be disappointed with the remixed \\"Over My Head\\": lacking the attention-catching fade-in and putting a hill-billy-ish acoustic guitar to the front of the mix, rather than the song's famous, rich keyboards (now set in the background) results in a far less emotionally satisfying experience.  This is a drawback, not a feature!!!!<br />Still, it's a minor drawback, and overall this is the hits album I have been waiting for for years.  Classic rock fans, by all means, snap this one up!
B00006J3WH|5.0|.... OK some words.  [&lt;b&gt;Please some one get Amber Benson a recording contract&lt;/b&gt;].  Her voice is stunning.  When I first heard of this episode, I thought well there goes the series yet in many ways this is a stunning piece of TV and the soundtrack album is one of my favourite CDs to listen to on the way to work.  I'm already a fan of Anthony Stewart Heads' excellent 'Music for Elevators' CD and my one compliant is we don't hear enough of him on this.  I'm not a big Buffy fan yet I was taken from this project from the first time I saw the episode.  On it's own, the music stands firm.  A classsic. Buy it and be happy.

B00005JKJA|1.0|Other than the unique style of David Lynch movies this is a waste of film.  I thought perhaps it would come together at the end but I think I was more confused when it was over than I was throughout the movie, and that's saying a lot.

B00005JKZT|2.0|Anyone who has read the book will be likely to find this film to be jarring.  If Peter Jackson is such a Tolkien fan, why does he find it necessary to make so many gratuitous changes?   My personal unfavorite is the new character Faramir who Jackson wrote in.  By a strange coincidence, Tolkien also had a character by the same name in his book.  I am not a purist,and loved the Fellowship despite its changes, but this time the spirit of the book has been trampled and I really don't care if I am the only person in the known universe who thinks so.
B00005OAIE|5.0|A lot of people compare John Mayer to Dave Matthews, and as a classical musician with a well-trained ear, I have to say that I can't rightfully compare the two.  Dave's voice and John's voice aren't even all that similar, just their vowel pronunciation.  Not only that, but Dave's music is more \\"composer\\" istic, with his use of 3/4 and 6/8 time, versus John's strict use of 4/4.  So please, give the man credit for his originality, because the lyrics do it all.  3x5's lyrics are fantastic, and they REALLY make sense.  If you like original music with a distinct sound, this album is for you.  If you're against Dave Matthews clones, then I again say, this album is for you.  Enjoy!
B000002JS8|5.0|I had the good fortune of seeing AC/DC appear as a surprise guest for Aerosmith and Foreigner at Comiskey Park, and AC/DC gave one hell of a performance.  I was deeply saddened when I heard that Bon had left us, but at the same time not too surprised either knowing that Bon was what he preached, or sang.  This is Bon's last dance with AC/DC, and it's a lasting tribute to that front man who, to me anyway, will always be the essence of what AC/DC epitomized.  The chemistry of Bon &amp; Angus on stage together was unique in and of itself to experience, and I often find myself wishing I could re-live that hot summer afternoon at the old White Sox Park one more time. <br />By the way folks, Bon's voice is real and is not the result of studio or technical manipulation.
B00005JKZT|4.0|The movie was fantastic, but so much happened that some of the characters were barely in it, like Gandalf, Eomer and Faramir.  This film was three hours long, but still needed to be longer to add a bit of depth of character to some of the people in it.  Perhaps I'll be a bit more satisfied if they put out an extended version on DVD.  <br />The battle scenes were truly breathtaking; I sat there slack-jawed, staring at what the director Peter Jackson has achieved with this series of films.<br />But there were certain things not in this film that were in the books, that I really wanted to see, most notably, Gandalf's confrontation with Saruman after the battle of Helm's Deep.  There were a few scenes with Arwen to make the film not so male-oriented, and I thought they could easily have been dispensed with so that we could spend a little time getting to know some of the newer characters.  Eomer in particular was in the film for not much more than 60 seconds, and I thought he needed some fleshing out.<br />However, all in all, Jackson has raised the bar on film making once again with this film.  Gollum was the first computer generated character I've ever seen that I actually liked, and in fact he was quite a scene-stealer.  The film was a wonderful effort all around.
B00005JKZT|3.0|Ive noticed that most of the reviews currently are based on the \\"preview\\" (mostly 5 stars). I too liked the \\"preview\\", and it looked very interesting.<br />BUT, when i went to go see it it was not that interesting.<BR>I have not read the book, but then again i did not read the book for the first movie (fellowship) and enjoyed that one. But this one was three hours of what i would like to call a \\"buffer\\".<br />They did a very odd thing, which I could not follow. It seemed as though they had three (yes three) movies going at once. This really confused me, and by doing so might have took away from the movies story line. Now, I don't know if they did this in the book, but as a viewer I would have liked to see it progressing though time, not just little cuts.  After the movie, i found out that there were two other hobbits, which i thought were just another storyline of frodo.  This is what triped me up, and as a viewer, I did not pick up on this because they looked so much alike.<br />Also, even at the biggest war scene yet, it was'nt top notch. The computer graphics (cg) were good though, and kept that feeling of realism that could only be acomplished by computers.<br />The music of the movie was very appropiate, and fit in perfectly as this epic battle unfolds.<br />I think this is really ment to lead up to the third movie, and i'm hoping the third is much better.<br />They did a good job with golem, and like the book he was a major character in the movie.<br />To sum it up. The Trailer seems alot more interesting then the movie really is. And the movie had a very confusing sort of style to it, which I myself did not like. If you are a true fan though, you just have to see this, but don't expect it to be like the first movie.<br />Lastly, I think if I had read the book, it would have made a lot more sense and would have been better.<br />~hope this helps
B00007G1ZC|5.0|This is Kurosawa's best Color Movie.  The photography is incredible. Eight tremendous shorts that seam to roll into one another, the concept of the crows where they walk into the Van Gogh paintings is stunning!

Lang, Captain Beefheart 99 cent special and &quot;The Who Sell Out&quot;.<br />Don't like it, very sorry I bought it and hope that you listen to it before you make your purchase.  You should buy music that you like to listen to, not what someone else says.
B00006SFBD|4.0|The great thing about Opeth is that they consistently put out amazing material.  This album is no exception.  It may not be as epic as Still Life or poetic as Orchid but it holds its special place in the Opeth discography.  The album progressed much from BWP in the sense it is heavier.  Given they only had about six weeks to record this and Damnation, they did an amazing job.  The standout tracks on Deliverance are the title track and By The Pain I See In Others.  My only beef with the latter is towards the very end, Mikael sings something I can't understand.  The other four are very amazing as well.  A Fair Judgement is a very emotional song with some of Mikael's best clean vocals.  Wreath is probably the heaviest song on the album because it has no acoustic passages.  It's a good introduction to Opeth's realm, but not their best.
B000066HHK|4.0|This CD was the demo CD that Linkin Park released just before they got a deal with Warner Music. The songs are:<br />1. Carousel<BR>2. Technique<BR>3. Step Up<BR>4. And One<BR>5. High Voltage<BR>6. Part of Me<br />Amazingly, this CD has elements that Hybrid Theory does not. Carousel has some great rapping by Mike Shinoda...but instead of putting some sampling behind him like With You or Forgotten, they gave that and some heavy bass. Also, the sampling wasn't just up in the air, it was derived from the main melody of the song. Step Up is another rap song, but has only 2 minutes of good stuff before it launches into sampling and sound effects. <BR>And One is the best song on the album. A song that has is completely dissimilar to HT songs, it starts out with Chester's voice talking about his 'disjointed heart'. But the guitars here are kind of mixed up and dubbed back and Chester's voice is rough and really adds some realism to his lyrics. What is also unique about this song is that it has an ingenious little solo about 1:30 into the song, with Chester providing background vocals until Mike Shinoda comes in with his rap and then the song builds into the beautiful chorus, which includes Linkin Park's style of blending the bass and guitars with Chester's voice. Also at the end there is an entirely new beat with a crazy rap by Mike Shinoda. His rapping style and rhymes are amazing as they as usual. What gets me are his sayings like:<BR>'Cryptic colloquialism shifts your midrift'. I mean, who would of thought up that piece of work. Mike's style of breaking up his sentences mid-way to satisfy the rhythm of the beat and putting rhyming words in one sentence as well as acrostically (eg. lots of words with C or S), is apparent in Part of Me and High Voltage where his raps are the bulkhead of the songs.<BR>The only weak part of the album (with the exception of 'And One' and maybe 'Step Up', are the choruses. They either sound corny (High Voltage), or they feature Chester who has an over-emphasized growl that overwhelms the instrumentals and is not particularly attractive to hear (Part of Me, Carousel). The weak verses, are non-present in Hybrid Theory so that is good to know they improved on that. <BR>All in all, this album was well put together and shows the early promise of one of the best Metal bands out there!
B00004BZ0N|5.0|They were known as: \\"The Only Band That Matters\\" and they certainly lived up to that title.  The Clash's London Calling is one of Rock's crowning works of glory.  We get punk, rock, reggae, jazz, and pop in this double album treasure.                                                               The title track \\"London Calling\\" was recently featured in both a Jaguar commercial, and the recent James Bond movie: \\"Die Another Day\\". It's militant beat and ominious warnings are as unstoppable as The Clash themselves.  \\"Spanish Bombs; one of my favorite Clash songs, digs in its heels with its catchy chorus, music and \\"freedom figher\\" lyrics  romatically reminescent of The Spanish Civil War.  \\"Train In Vain\\" was an instant pop hit in the eighties, and has earned a permanent place in the classic pop music genre.                                                      \\"All meat and no filler\\" is what you'll find on this sub-cultural rock album extraordinare folks.  It has earned its place as one of the greatest rock albums in the history of rock music itself.                                                            These guys really need to regroup and turn the music industry and the world upside down again (if only for all us fans), and take back what is rightfully theirs: The title as \\"The only band that matters\\". Come on Mick, Joe, and Paul  us fans need you guys again!!                                                                    If you are a Clash fan, then you know exactly where I'm coming from.  If you aren't a fan of theirs YOU WILL BE! after listening to their London Calling album.  Own it today!
B00005JKZT|5.0|For those who have read, re-read and re-re-read the Lord of The Rings, the new Peter Jackson film, the Two Towers, is a big departure from what we've imagined while reading the book.  That doesn't lessen the visual impact, the cinemagraphic sweep, or the awe inspiring size and scope of the film.  The battle scenes alone are enough to make the ghost of Cecil B.(10 Commandments) DeMille drool with envy.<br />It does mean that you shouldn't go into the movie expecting to see the story followed as closely as it was in Fellowship (yes, it also departed from the written story, but not as much as Towers).  <br />Although Mr, Jackson took quite a bit of artistic license with this film, enough of the original story is woven in to satisfy the most ardent fan of the book.  In fact, there are long stretches that are taken practically verbatim from Tolkien's work.<br />The only major annoyance?  Gimli's role dwarfed (sorry) by the desire to have him be the comic relief.<br />All in all, Towers is at least as good, if not better than Fellowship.

B000005L86|5.0|this is the real deal.  I would not lead you astray--- if you dig reggae, this is roots... full of delightfully nasty, tasty &amp; meaty hooks.  Not as sophisticated of song-writing as Bob Marley wound up putting out (not pop-friendly radio here), but definitely deep grooves with true rastaman vibration.  Just a great energy on this recording--- goin' rasta style, on a hillside with a Red Stripe and...<BR>May I also add that the packaging is as quality as I've found... totally worth the &quot;green&quot; to get the 2cd remastered set.
B00004VMUH|5.0|Nightwish is one of the most talented bands around today. Their blend of metal with classical, and opera makes it a very unique listen. Many hardcore metal fans, simply by hearing `opera' wouldn't even give Nightwish a chance. Personally, I listen to death metal, and melodic death (in flames, arch enemy, at the gates, carcass, ect...) and I love Nightwish. Anyone who likes this band should get the box set, and the live DVD (if you can still find it, look on ebay). Enjoy.
B00005JLF5|3.0|OK, first why just the 3 stars?  Well, let's be honest, the relatively short and first season of DS9 wasn't the best of the show.  Why?  Well because the writting staff was just being created with some coming over from TNG and whatnot, plus the actors and characters weren't all that developed yet.  And of course, neither were the story-lines.  But anyway...a 3-star rating leaves room for more accurate ratings later on in later seasons.<br />Alright, now that we've got that out of the way, what's this show about?  Well, to be honest, I'm not totally 100% sure.  When DS9 debuted in January 1993, I was in the middle of my college career and I didn't have alot of time to keep up on a weekly series.  (And I still don't, 10 years later, for that matter.)  And so while trying to follow the series during this first season was hit and miss, but I did manage (I think) to catch most of this first season's episodes.  I started to lose interest in it when the second season started.  And it's a shame that I did because I hear that the show really started hitting its stride by its 3rd and 4th seasons.  However I do know thru reading about the show over the years, that DS9 became one of the best sci-fi shows ever to air on the TV in modern times.<br />Later on in the series there was a huge war between the Federation/Klingons/Romulans and the Dominion which consisted of the Cardassians, Jem-Hadar, and the Breen?  Like I said, I missed the whole Dominion War arc, so I'm not sure.  But as I understand that this part was some of the most intense and entertaining sci-fi on at that time, next to Babylon 5 of course.<br />But anyway, with the OFFICIAL release of all 7 seasons on DVD, just as 2002's release of all 7 seasons of TNG, I will be able to experience this series the way it was meant to be seen.  Complete and in order.  And from this release, logic suggests that Paramount will release all 7 seasons of VOY in 2004.  Yes I know, that series gets hammered by alot of Trek fans, but I'm willing to give it a go just to see its heavy Borg arc, that once again I missed during its first run.<br />So anyway, if you missed this series on TV as I did.  Having it on DVD and in 5.1 Surround will be a treat for years to come.  Now if we can just get MGM to release Stargate SG-1 a little quicker.'m willing to give it a go just to see its heavy Borg arc, that once again I missed during its first run.<br />So anyway, if you missed this series on TV as I did.

0792843584|5.0|Cimino may not have made a blockbuster, but he did make one of the best Westerns in cinematic history.  Unfortunately, most people can't sit through a 4-hour movie.  If you are one of those persons who can appreciate a complex narrative, delivered by a stunning cast, that tells a more candid tale of the West, then \\"Heaven's Gate\\" is a real treat.<br />Cimino has collected a set of compelling stories that swirl around the range wars of the Montana.  He relates these stories through his protaganist, a federal marshall played by Kris Kristofferson.  His thoughts drift back to Harvard Yard in the opening sequence, where he reveled in the commencement ceremonies with his old schoolmate, John Hurt.  Much of this scene was chopped out in the theatrical release, undermining the content of the film.  It is this Eastern view, which Cimino wants you to take note of.  How one can meld into the West as Kristofferson does, and how one can become part and parcel of the cattle syndicate as Hurt did.<br />The stories mainly focus around the Eastern European immigrants who attempted to carve out a life in late 19th-century Montana.  They came up against the great cattle syndicates, who owned much of the range, leaving little for the immigrants to settle on.  Cimino gives you a very intimate view of the events.  His camera angles take you right into the action.  This is a very visceral movie.<br />Eventually these immigrants come up against the cattle barons, who had formed their own vigilante gangs in an attempt to combat the encroachment of the new settlers on their land.  Kristofferson has grown close to the immigrants and eventually chooses to support their claims, leading to a final gut-wrenching confrontation, which includes his old schoolmate, John Hurt.<br />The cast is first rate.  Walken, Bridges, Huppert, Watterston all give excellent performances.  Cimino has inverted many of the myths that surround the Old West, and provided a living history.  The film almost has the quality of a sepia tone, as he has muted his colors to give the sense of age.  The [fourty]... million budget seems paltry by toda's standards, but at the time it was one of the most expensive films ever made.  Unfortunately, not everyone was ready for it.quality of a sepia tone, as he has muted his colors to give the sense of age.

B00006JJ1O|4.0|browsing at the record store I came upon this thinking , &quot; gawd, not another cute but talentless girl group...&quot; but as I listened, I was pleasantly surprised. And then I saw the Trevor Horn credit... at any rate, this music would have been supermarket pablum if done in Amerika, but given Horns sense or irony and arrangments it doesnt turn out bad. I would like to hope that as much of this albums goodness is from the 2 girls, and not just their being pawns of the producer...In an interview they said they resented being lableled lezzies, and claim they each have boyfriends....whatever.
B000066NW0|5.0|Ever since I heard her Sk8ter Boi song on the radio, I was hooked on Averil.  This CD is heart-felt and genuine and is a must have for anybody who liked her first two hits.
B00006CYAD|5.0|This CD is awesome. The bonus track 'Grow Up' and the songs 'Worst Day Ever', 'I'm Just A Kid', and 'One Day' are songs that almost every teen can relate to. The CD is also very low on profanity (one swear word- \\"what the ? is wrong w/ me\\"). Simple Plan may be new, but they are surely destined to be as great as blink 182, Sum 41, and New Found Glory.
B00005JJX8|4.0|This movie was made before jet travel and TVs were pervasive.  In addition to the beautiful scenery of Monaco, it has beautiful Grace Kelly for the men and Cary Grant for the women.  The lovely blond supporting player is good on the eyes too!<br /><br />The script has great jokes, a little snide about Texas oil widows and thrill seeking heiresses.  It has the characteristic Hichcock practices of adding humor to otherwise serious situations and attractive characters who are less than top drawer (a cat burglar, a spoiled heiress).<br /><br />The visual metaphors of fireworks, etc. add grist to movie buff trivia mills.  And of course, it was during the filming of this movie that Grace met Prince Rainier.  A thoroughly romantic story in every aspect.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Remember \\"Fractured Fairy Tales\\" on the old \\"Bullwinkle\\" TV show, where they warped such old standards as Sleeping Beauty? (FYI, the FFT version of that tale had a prince who suspiciously resembled Walt Disney decline to wake Sleeping Beauty and instead turn her castle into a tourist attraction called Sleeping Beauty-Land.) That spirit is very much alive and well in \\"Shrek,\\" a computer-animated film about an ogre who agrees to rescue a princess when an evil (and vertically-challenged) prince exiles hordes of fairy-tale characters to his neck of the swamp.<br />Mike Myers is terrifically convincing as the gentle but tough Shrek with a light Scottish accent. John Lithgow is properly villainous as Lord Farquaad; Cameron Diaz as Princess Fiona, however, just doesn't sound as convincing as her co-stars. But it is Eddie Murphy who steals the show as the ever-talkative Donkey who accompanies Shrek on his quest.<br />\\"Shrek\\" is simply delicious, not only providing lots of fun for kids and adults alike (with the requisite burp and fart jokes that will delight kids and the young at heart) but also sending a very good message - just because someone else says you're ugly doesn't make it so.

B000059LGC|3.0|When heiress Lynette Doyle (Lois Chiles) is murdered during a Nile cruise, it is up to super-sleuth Hercule Poirot (Peter Ustinov) to seperate the culprit from the many suspects who had reason to want her dead.  I have never been a fan of the \\"cozy mystery\\" sub-genre that was Agatha Christie's forte, in which suspects are bumped off at regular intervals until the detective gathers everyone in the drawing room to reveal his solution of the crime.  Therefore, I am not the proper audience for this film.  The cast is certainly impressive and the production is smooth.  I enjoyed the beginning of the film quite a bit; it takes on the air of a smart, elegant comedy of manners as the foibles and interrelationships of the various characters are introduced.  However, I began losing interest after the murder of the heiress, as the mystery aspects of the story asserted themselves, grinding formulaicly to an implausible conclusion./

The enery is contagious.  The Beatles are having fun and it shows. John,Paul,George,and Ringo are in top form in this black and white film.  The songs sound great and the action is non stop.  My 17 year old daughter has been a Beatle's fan for many years.  She was delighted by this film.  It was like an undiscovered treasure to her.  If you are a Beatle's fan this film is a must for your collection.

0805062971|5.0|Okay, so maybe I'm breaking the rules, but I can't help it.  You have to talk about this novel after you have read it because there are so many issues that Palahniuk explores, it's tough to keep up with them all.  This is really a fantastic book that deserves a number of readings to get to the heart of.  My particular favourite section is Chapter 6 describing what fight club means to a generation of men raised by women.  Fantastic stuff.
B00005R23X|5.0|this movie is coppola fundamentals.  from a plot and acting angle, it doesn't necessarily stand out as a masterpiece.  however, if you've ever read stoker's novel and have even a slight degree of familiarity with europe at that era, the adaptation makes perfect sense.  in style, it matches perfectly, from the surreal and somewhat &quot;detached&quot; special effects to the two-dimensional acting of keanu reeves and gary oldman, who handles his over-the-top role in typical genius mode.  watch it for the eye candy alone, if you want.  eiko ishioka's insanely detailed costumes should be enough (a book is devoted to her costumes from this movie alone), and so should the stunning backdrops and bizarre visual going-ons throughout are worth it alone.  the plot requires a very romantic heart to digest and understand, or maybe just a tall glass of ether.<br />in conclusion:  not necessarily a plot movie.  if you want to poke holes in someone who says its garbage, though, challenge them to read stoker's novel and come up with a better interpretation.  second, probably coppola's greatest marriage of visual style and plot, and probably one of the best in general.  not for the snobs, but great for those with imaginations looking for something that can stand the test of time and repeated views -- you'll find something new every time you watch.
B000021YQV|5.0|Holy [smokes]... this is one of the best cd's EVER!! the diversity and  mixture of sounds throw you through a roller coaster rides of emotions and feelings, and you can't help but feel relaxed Aerials to finish you off. Here is a little song by song review:<br />Prison Song: 5/5 A SOLID song. This song goes so fast and so powerfully that you don't even know what to do with yourself. One of the best songs on the CD.<BR>Needles: 4/5 One of their worst song on the CD, which isn't saying much. It is still a great track, but something about it rubs me the wrong way.<BR>Deer Dance: 5/5 I didn't like this song at first, but now it is one of my favorites. It inspires you like none other and it still keeps that hardcore, powerful, metal-driven sound that SOAD thrives on.<BR>Jet Pilot: 4/5 This is also an awesome song but it lacks substance. You are flung through the song with lots of energy, but it goes as quickly as it came, and then it is a very non-descript song, unlike most of the songs on the album.<br />X: 5/5 This song hits every kind of chord and note and it makes you just feel energetic at the end of it all.<BR>Chop Suey: 6/5 And here it is, the best song on the CD. They picked a very good song for their first big hit. The beginning of the song hooks you, and from there you are reeled into a song of rage, despair, and depression. By the end of the song, you are relaxed and complete in your emotions. This song \\"completes me.\\" heh heh heh<BR>Bounce: 3/5 Their worst song on the album. It is a very fun song, but it so lacks meaning and catchy beats that a 3 is the highest I feel I can give this song.<BR>Forest: 5/5 Second only to Chop Suey, this song is a breath of air, a sigh on longevity. The notes Serj(lead singer) hits on this track is amazing. His voice chills me to the bone in this one.<BR>Atwa: 4/5 Another mediocre song that, even though it is amazing, sort of leaves me wanting less. They overdue it a little bit here, but still very good.<BR>Science: 5/5 Great track. That is all that I can say about it because I do not know it as intimately as the other songs for some reason.<BR>Shimmy: 5/5 First song by SOAD I had ever heard, and it was what got me addicted to them. It has so much energy and power behind it that it fills me to the brim with some moshpit-wanting.<BR>Toxicity: 4/5 Everyone has made a big hype over this song, but I don't see how SOAD can justify making THIS song their next single over all of the other GENIUS songs on this album. It works, though.<BR>Psycho: 5/5 A very disturbing but bangin track. This song has become a theme song for me and some of my friends.<BR>Aerials: 5/5 And the cd ends. This a very unique song. It is very different than the other songs, but pulls the whole cd together with a soft but big sound, that just leaves you with satisfaction. After the song, there is a little jingle that made me laugh the first time I heard it. <br />So, in short, this cd is pure genius and no body should be without it. GET IT SOON!!...
B00005JKCH|2.0|I wasn't very impressed with this movie at all. I expected a lot more from Spiderman it didnt' seem to hold true to the comics.
B000060P79|5.0|Most of the time I'm a little sceptical to go out and buy a CD from a band that I've only heard 2 of their songs, but I'm glad I did!... If you're into Blink 182, Box Car Racer, Good Charlette, or anything along those lines, you'll love this CD!  All of the songs have really good lyrics...of course there's My Alien...but that one is even good...it's one of those fun songs!  Be sure to check it out and keep rockin!
B0000035E7|4.0|I love every song Nirvana ever wrote, and all of their albums...But they almost had a formula for turning out great songs towards the end. Y'know, the songs start nice and quiet, then the chorus hits, and the screams and massive guitar riffs start...I really like Bleach because of its uniqueness.<br />Starting with the vocals. The way he screams these songs is incredible. Its almost like Kurt was purfosefully trying to sound as caustic as possible w/o completely ignoring the songs melodies (hahaha). Musically, Bleach is slow, dirty, and very powerful.<br />However, to the guy giving revisionist history lessons, who said that Nirvana was nothing w/o Dave Grohl: Wrong...Bleach was a very popular indie record, but it didn't get major label distribution until Geffen bought the rights from Sub Pop, AFTER Nevermind had sold millions of copies. But people knew that Nirvana was a special band long before Nevermind. I worked at a record store in the early 90's, and I remember playing Bleach after the owner went home. This was before Nevermind came out. People would come up to me out of the blue to find out who the band was, and bought the CD on the spot. I must have sold 5 copies that way, and I can't remember any other unknkown band that people could instantly relate to like Nirvana.<br />So whatever that &quot;special&quot; thing was, that separated Nirvana from a lot of other great indie bands of that era, it's very present in Bleach. Buy this!

I wish I had a dollar for every time he said he was disappointed at some town or landmark he encountered. If I were him, I would have turned around and went home long before the end of the journey.<br />One insight I gained though - he talks a lot about how his father was a grump during the annual family vacations. It's clear that Bryson is a chip off the old block.

B00006V9A0|3.0|A CD can hold about 74 minutes of audio, why can't they use up most of those minutes on this disc? Instead we get like say 50 minutes or so. Not good enough. A greatest hits CD needs to be filled up, especially if its Nirvana. And because this CD is short many greats were left out like Paper Cuts, Milk It, Negative Creep, Drain You, Polly, Dive, and how on earth could they leave out Aneurysm? Also, even if this greatest hits cd had Nirvana's 20 best songs, you are still missing out on a lot of excellent material. So I say buy Bleach, Incesticide, Nevermind, In Utero, MTV Unplugged in New York and in that order instead of getting this. It's best to get this album for collection purposes only. However the songs that were picked for the album were excellent except I never really liked Been A Son and Lithium much. So get the studio albums and the MTV Unplugged album first, well worth your money.

0316666343|2.0|A good concept poorly executed. It opened promisingly and heartbreakingly -- those of you with adolescent daughters might really find the opening discomforting -- but quickly bogged down with weakly-developed characters, confusing time shifts and plot lines, and simplistic platitudes about love and loss. <br />Unlike some of the others here, I didn't find this book spiritually hokey, I simply found it juvenile. It had the underdeveloped feel that I get when -- stuck for something to read -- I pick up a book that my 12-year-old daughter is reading. I don't regret reading it, butI wouldn't recommend it to anyone else as a great book to read. <br />Sheri Reynolds covered similar ground with 5 star results in &quot;A Gracious Plenty.&quot; I'd recommend that you read that book instead.
0385508417|1.0|A couple of hours of my life that I will never regain.  A potentially cute Christmas farce that falls flat and is poorly executed.  The characters suffer from severe one dimensionality and Grisham's concept of character development seems to involve nothing more than a number of sentences of which punctuation is the only common element.  Perhaps most disappointing is the racist undertone near the end of the book, where quite a bit of attention is paid to the skin color of a central character.<br />If you were interested in reading a well written book with a similar concept of a husband interested in living outside the norms of society, you might try Nick Hornby's \\"How To Be Good.\\"  At least he makes an effort at literature and is not merely killing trees.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|During the holiday seasons in New York, a old bearded man who claims to be Kris Kringle (Edmund Gwenn) is hired to be Macy's Santa Claus by worker Doris Walker (Maureen O'Hara) after proving to be impressive at the Macy's Thanksgiven Parade after the original guy to play Santa got drunk. Doris is just a skeptical woman who raising his daughter Susan (Natalie Wood) to believe in the truth even on Santa rather then fantasies until one day when Doris finds out that he claims to be the one and only Santa, she thinks he's nuts. But after he is determinated insane after a conflict with the store's psychologist, he is put on trial as everyone old and young alike must put their faith that he is the true Santa Claus for it would be a miracle.<br /><br />An amazing movie that has became a timeless and cherished christmas classic! Ever since it debuted in May of 1947, this movie has became one of the most beloved fantasy-comedy-drama movies ever thanks to it's original idea and strong message. Edmung Gwenn has earned an oscar for his role as Santa Claus as he's the true star of the movie besides O'Hara, the other performances including the young girl are all superb. This is a memorable movie about the meaning of christmas and what you should believe with your own heart as this is a feel good movie that will touch your every heart string.<br /><br />This 2-Disc DVD is superb! contains great picture and sound with both the original B&W and new Colored versions. The extras are very good like audio commentary by Maureen O'Hara, Documentary \\"AMC Backstory: Miracle on 34th Street\\", A featurette on the history of the Macy's Thanksgiven Parade, Promotional Short that was made for theaters to promote the film, \\"Fox Movietone News Footage: Hollywood Spotlight\\", TV Version of the film and poster gallery.
B000066NW0|2.0|Okay. Maybe she has a mediocre voice, and some singing talent, but she is trying too hard to be something she's not.

B00000099Y|1.0|Nope. Didn't look any of those words up. BUT... I was wondering why so many people are willing to write so much about these guys, and I have finally figured it out:<BR>1. Tool is not popular and highly rated because the world is coming to an end, they are popular and highly rated because the world has already ended.<BR>2. We are currently existing in a harmonic reverberation of the 4th dimension 'echo' that issued forth from the cataclysm which ended all time and space previously known to what we now call 'us'.<BR>3. At the exact moment of the end of time, someone or something was making so VERY much noise, that it has imprinted on this 'echo.'<BR>4. We now call that imprint 'TOOL,' and in the resulting veil of illusion, have given its manifestation human faces and names. Thus we believe it to be a 'band.'<BR>5. So, you see, if you imagine the previously existing universe as some kind of ordered cosmic waste, and the end as some kind of elimination of that waste, then 'TOOL' is really the useful sound of the Cosmic Toilet Flushing, heard from somewhere way, way down the hall.<BR>6. Spinach and roses. (This lines is here only to ensure an adequate mangling of metaphor.)
B000000W5L|4.0|One of the greatest albumns to have shown the Stones at their best. From the opening notes of &quot;Rocks Off&quot; to the country balled of &quot;Sweet Virginia&quot; and Jagger's soulful howl of &quot;Sweet Black Angel&quot; this albumn has it all. Some of the best songs like &quot;Ventilater Blues&quot; and &quot;Shine a Light&quot; are great songs that you don't hear on the radio much anymore. If you want to get away from the overly produced Top 40 of today this is a great rock and roll albumn for you. It's one that shows the Stones in their rawest form with a whole lot more to come.
B00003CXB2|5.0|\\"Lawrence Of Arabia\\" is an Outstanding Best Picture Winner of 1962. I am glad that David Lean won an Oscar for Best Director here. Peter O'Toole (Oscar-nominated) stars as T.E. Lawrence, a British officer, who wanted to get a job as an observer with Prince Feisal (Alec Guinness), the leader of the Arab army. Lawrence led the Arab armies against the Turks in the Middle East during World War I from 1915-18. Omar Sharif plays very well in his Oscar-nominated role as Sherif Ali Ibn El Kharish. \\"Lawrence Of Arabia\\" is easily one of the best movies ever made. And if you haven't seen it, you should, unless if it is long to you, but see it anyway. I have this movie on the Limited Edition 2-Disc DVD and I highly recommend it.

B0000296SI|2.0|Although I realize that Blink sold-out terribly(don't fight the facts. Their rich kids from L.A. who gave up a punk band to make 12 year old girls swoon), once you can over-look the fact that Blink 182 is no longer a punk band, this cd has a couple good songs, although most are horrible. This cd is very over-produced and poppy and songs like \\"All the Small Things\\" are solid proof that Blink will do anything for a dime, however, the song \\"Wendy Clear\\" is very good if you could ever forgive them and take a listen. I think this song has a special feel to it that I can't put my finger on. So with that good song and a couple ok songs and remembering how this album and The Offspring's \\"Americana\\" were my favorite albums about 4 years ago, I'm going to be generous and give this album 2 stars!WOW! I still can't believe TOYPAJ ever was written by the same band that wrote a great album called \\"Dude Ranch\\". That's a terrible thought. I really like punk bands like anti-flag, The Ramones, Rancid, Operation Ivy, The Bouncing Souls, Alkaline Trio, The Sex Pistols, ETC., so it hurts me to see blink go this low, especially after \\"Dude Ranch\\". Later.
B00005JKCH|2.0|This is pure candy-floss: well marketed, somewhat cynically timed, but fundamentally an unimaginative adaptation of cartoon strip which itself was a pretty bare-faced rip-off of Superman. There are a number of reference points for Spider Man, and it doesn't measure up to any of them:<br />Firstly, adapting a comic strip to the big screen: Since Christopher Reeve brought us Superman-con-fromage, action heroes have all but infested the cinema, mostly with substandard results: The best of the bunch was the Batman franchise, which (at least while in Tim Burton's capable hands) took a fairly cornball & camp idea and extracted a far darker, more gothic essence. Sam Raimis does nothing of the sort here: Spidey is straight, wholesome, dull, and ickily adolescent: I'm not sure what Raimis had in mind, but watching scenes where, at the flick of his wrist a infatuated 17 year old shoots sticky white stuff around his bedroom wasn't exactly the superhero experience I  bargained for.<br />Secondly, the \\"celebrity Bad Guy having the time of his life\\" gambit doesn't pay off: Having a serious thesp play the villain is hardly a new idea. But where Jack Nicholson, Anthony Hopkins, Alan Rickman, Dennis Hopper and so on have animated (and in some cases carried) pretty cheesy films, in Spiderman, Defoe never really gets to grips with his part, and he certainly doesn't ham it up the way it screams out for. Partly I think this is because the green goblin part is poorly conceived: I don't know whether that fault lies with Marvel or Raimis' scriptwriter.<br />And lastly, the special effects aren't that much chop: I rented The Matrix last week, which is practically a senior citizen in the Special FX world, having been around since 1998 or thereabouts. But it still leaves Spiderman for dead.<br />And those are about the only criteria on which a film in the format of Spiderman could have hoped to justify itself. It will never be Citizen Kane, certainly, but given the hype Spiderman received (and its box office receipts) I was a little surprised this picture didn't at least subvert one or two conventions. It (ham-fistedly) set itself up for a sequel, so I guess there is another chance out there for some aspiring director to make a mark.<br />But I'm not holding my breath.d its box office receipts) I was a little surprised this picture didn't at least subvert one or two conventions.

6304698658|5.0|This is a hilarious movie. Nonstop laughs and a hilarious cast combine to create the most hilarious Christmas comedy ever! I could not stop laughing each time I watched this! It's a very clever movie, a classic. I'm cracking up just thinking about it right now! The funniest person is the old lady that is very disoriented. I love this movie and the DVD is great too! I love the really long trailors for each &quot;Vacation&quot; movie. You can relate to this movie, with the snotty neighbors, and the forgotten, dusty gift in the attic. And I'm sure some of you out there can relate to the unexpected guest arriving, much to your displeasure. Chevy Chase's car scene in the beginning reminded me so much of my Dad's driving. You must buy this DVD, it's great. You'll laugh your little snow pants off! This is a must-have for any DVD collector. Also, check out the other DVD's in the &quot;Vacation&quot; series. ENJOY!
B00005T30L|5.0|It's nothing new that Thora Birch is one of my favorite actresses today, so it's no accident that I enjoyed this film. However, the best performance comes from Steve Buscemi; while he, Thora, and Scarlet Johansson each play outcasts, Buscemi pulls off some of the most comedic moments ever captured on film (you will never feel the same when inside of a 7-11 after viewing this movie). Yet, Buscemi also is able to maintain his character's personality with the most dramatic feel to it. He was ROBBED of an Oscar nomination!      Though &quot;Ghost World&quot; is a tad long, its perceptions of reality are starkly and hilariously on the spot, and its ending perfectly weaves these perceptions together. Masterfully written by Terry Zwigoff and Daniel Clowes.
B00005JKDR|5.0|At first, I thought \\"How stupid, why would I want to watch this movie?\\" when it was featured on a flight to Heathrow Airport in London, England. I decided instead to watch \\"Dragonly\\" and some other random English movie \\"Kick it Like Beckham\\" (?) Why was I so stupid?!?!?!  Finally, my godsister forced me to watch it on the way to an out of town football game. I loved it! This movie is great for all ages! It's funny, and very clever. There are a lot of jokes that I didn't catch the first time, but got after watching it a few more times. For example, when the jelly-ish monster falls through the grate in the sidewalk, he exclaims \\"Great!!\\" (get it??) The funniest scene has to be the first part (you have to see it, it's hilarious.) It's really cute, too. The little girl is adorable! You just want her to be real so you can take her home with you! The DVD features are awesome, too. It's really fun to go through all the doors and learn about the diffferent things. You'll love this DVD, it's great! It's especially great for younger kids, but even older kids and adults can appreciate it too! It's one of the best Disney movies, and the best one this millenium (with flops like \\"Treasure Planet\\") You won't regret buying this DVD. Enjoy!
B00005JKG9|4.0|If you don't mind hearing 138 usages of the &quot;F-word&quot; and its derivatives (trivia from imdb.com), you might enjoy &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot; to the fullest extent possible.  It follows a group of realtors who have been lacking in sales, and their corporation tells them to start selling or start packing.  Hence, a contest is introduced: the highest seller gets a cadillac, while the lowest gets the door.  Chaos erupts, scandles ensue, and someone gets taken with cuffs.  High energy performances are churned out of each of the film's great actors: Al Pacino, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, Kevin Spacey, Alec Baldwin, and Jack Lemmon, the film's gem.  The colored lighting of this film really blew me away; the blue could represent the coldness and phoniness each realtor embodies to make sales, the red lighting implying the blood they must shed, and the green backlighting symbolizing the money they each desparately want to earn but cannot reach.  Though I prefer Mamet's lighter &quot;State and Main,&quot; this one's still excellent.
B00003CXI1|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies! I love the book series of Harry Potter. The special effects are so lifelike! I was in awe at how great of a production this was! The cast is perfect, the effects are mind blowing! I must say, it is kind of annoying with the DVD to have to do all of the things to get to the extra features, but that's OK. This is a great movie for all ages, a magical world that we all dream about! I only wish that i could be a wizard and go to Diagon Alley, Hogwarts, and ride that train! This is a great movie for anyone, you'll really enjoy it. I reccomend this movie to anyone. Enjoy! Oh yeah, hold on... you should read the books before you see the movies, because the movies just kind of ruin the books (the ending is revealed and so on). The books are so much better, J.K. Rowling is such a talented author. You must buy the books before anything. ENJOY!
B000002J09|5.0|This is one of the greatest albums of all time, with songs like black dog, when the levee breaks and the unbelievable stairway to heaven you are sure to at least enjoy this album. If you dont there has to be something wrong with you. I highly recommend you purchase this album.
B000002MY3|5.0|First of all, all you people out there that said this album wasn't good do not know what good music is! I mean, how could this CD be so bad (like you say it is) and sell 16 MILLION COPIES?? Answer that please.<br />Now, onto the review. OK, this is the best CD by a female artist. I love Alanis' voice. She writes awesome music and lyrics. She is the most talented female, besides Mariah Carey, that I know of. This is probably her best CD. I love every song on it and give them all 5/5 ratings. This CD is so full of anger and such astounding artistic talent that it blows my mind. I bought this CD after listening to my sister and her friends listen to it EVERY DAY for years. I think I got it about... um... 3 years ago. I just saw it there and said, &quot;Isn't that what Jiji used to listen to?&quot; So I bought it and have been hooked on Alanis since!<br />1. All I Really Want - This is a great song. I love it. I especially like the little &quot;why are you so petrified of silence... here can you handle this? [pause]&quot; part. It's all good!<br />2. You Oughta Know - One of the best tracks on the CD. I love all of Alanis' expressed anger! It's great and can still be heard on the radio all the time.<br />3. Perfect - This is a great track too. It's one of the slower songs, but it's really really good! I love it.<br />4. Hand In My Pocket - This is one of my favorite songs. I remembered it from my sister's car long ago. It's really good, and I saw the video once and really liked it too!<br />5. Right Through You - This is the song that I'm listening to right now! It's really good. One of my favorite tracks on the CD. I really really like this song.<br />6. You Learn - I also remember this song from long ago. This is one of my favorite tracks, too. I also hear this on the radio too, sometimes.<br />7. Forgiven - This is a surprisingly good song! I really like it, but I don't understand, is she like anti-God or something in this song? Whatever, I still like it.<br />8. Head Over Feet - I also remember this song too from long ago! I heard it at the fair too once. This is one of the best songs on the CD. It's really good. One of her best songs ever.<br />9. Mary Jane - This song is kinda depressing, but it's still really good. I thought it was cool that one of the American Idols sang it on the show! You know you're popular when one of your songs is sung on that show.  It's also one of the best.<br />10. Ironic - I remember this song also from my sister's car. I also heard it at the fair once on this weird ride that had snow scenes on it. It's one of her best songs too.<br />11. Not The Doctor - I love this song! OK, you probably already figured out that I'm going to say that this is one of the best songs on the CD. It seriously is! They all are the best songs!<br />12. Wake Up - This song really grew on me. It's really good, and I like it a lot. I love it.<br />13. Your House - I don't get why they put &quot;You Oughta Know&quot; again before the real song, because it is the same as the version on track 2, but the intro is slightly different. I like that she sings without any music. Go Alanis!<br />This is the best CD ever. It's great. You'll love it. Alanis is the master. She is the greatest influence in the music biz. She made me want to learn guitar, which I am taking lessons for now. I love you, Alanis! Will you marry me?? Please?? LoL :)  Enjoy!ead Over Feet - I also remember this song too from long ago!

B00005JKZT|5.0|Congratulations to Peter Jackson and all of his associates for bringing Tolkien's work to silver screen in all its glory!  One obvious telltale to how successful this movie is the fact that over this weekend, one could not simply go to the movie theater and get tickets for the next show.  The lines for this silver screen masterpiece were to say the least, amazing.  The Two Towers and its predecessor, The Fellowship of the Ring are what movie going is all about!  Hopefully, the producers will follow the same pattern they set with the first movie and put the DVD for the theatrical release out in May and the extended version next November.  <br />The premise:<br />The Two Towers opens with what can only be described as an utterly astonishing sequence of the battle between Gandalf and the Balrog.  As is revealed at the end of the previous movie, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are trailing the Oraki who have captured Merry and Pippin, taking them to Saruman.  Frodo and Sam are on their own quest, attempting to take the \\"one ring\\" to Mordor for its destruction.  Along the way they have Gollum to deal with.  The movie builds up to the battle of Helms Deep.  The Battle of Helms Deeps makes the epic battle scenes of other popular movies over the last few years pale in comparison.<br />If you have to wait in line or purchase advance tickets for this movie, it is absolutely worth the wait.  Now we've only a year to wait for the conclusion to this masterpiece in The Return of the King.      {ssintrepid}
0451207521|2.0|Not nearly the quality of his prior works. No complexity of characters is attemted. The storyline is predictable within the first several chapters. Don't bother.
B000005JAB|5.0|This classic early solo album is like a collection of short stories and contains some of Cale's most poetic lyrics. There is a subdued, almost melancholic air about most of these, like Child's Christmas and Hanky Panky Nohow. The impressive orchestral backing make it less of a rock album than most of his best later work (like the Island period). An exception is Macbeth - a robust slice of rolling rock. The arrangements may be orchestral, but the melodies are simple and tuneful for the most part, as on the lovely Andalucia. The delightful title track with its edgy arrangement, birdsong and \\"you're a ghost\\" refrain is especially evocative, while the swaying reggae beat and trenchant lyrics of Graham Greene make this another classic track, and quite catchy too. Half Past France is a sad slow ballad and Antarctica is a moody piece with subdued, whispered vocals. Paris 1919 is a very \\"literary\\" album and Cale at his most accessible.
B00005JKZT|5.0|Wow! I'm tempted to say that The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is the BEST film I've ever seen. I won't go that far just yet. I'll have to see if it stands the test of time like my other fave flicks; For now, I'll just say that Two Towers is the best film of the year. <br />   The Two Towers hits the ground running; There's no recap of The Fellowship, and the audience is instantly thrown into the thick of things, starting with Gandalf's struggle against The Balrog. We follow Frodo and Sam on their trek to Mount Doom, Aragorn, Legolas, & Gimli as they track the Uruk-Hai that have abducted Merry and Pippin, and get our first glimpses of Gollum and Treebeard. The acting and effects are first-rate, especially Gollum, a computer-animated character voiced/portrayed by Andy Serkis. He's cute in an ugly kinda way, and the effects combine with Serkis' amazing performance to generate a sympathy for the character that none of the animated Tolkien tales ever managed to do. I don't know if Serkis is eligible for an Oscar, but he should be. The scene where Gollum argues with himself is heart-rending. The Two Towers also contains the biggest battle scenes I've ever seen in a movie- There were times when the audience would just collectively gasp at the sheer size of the armies. Amazing stuff! We've all seen effects-driven films before though; What sets The Lord of the Rings apart are the characters. You truly grow to care about them over the course of the films, something I can't really say about too many other Fantasy/Sci-Fi films lately (Phantom Menace & Attack of the Clones...).<br />  Ok, so that's what's good. What's bad is the Year-long wait until The Return of the King! I don't know about you, but it's not often I sit through a three-hour long film and start feeling sad when I know it's about to end! I just wanted it to keep going! Director Peter Jackson has done yet another wonderful job, and I can't wait to get the DVD.
B000006O7C|3.0|A tragic, untimely end came to the life of much-admired singer/songwriter, Jeff Buckley, in the May of 1997 when Buckley playfully jumped in the Mississippi River and was caught by an undertow. At the time of his death, Buckley was in the midst of the trying process of composing a follow-up to his 1994 debut album, Grace. He had almost completed an album with producer Tom Verlaine (former guitarist of the legendary punk and new wave pioneers, Television). Unsatisfied with that work, Buckley parted ways with Verlaine and relocated to Memphis where he began anew, recording four-track demos which he hoped to build into a more pleasing album. Was the delay of new material the result of a perfectionist neurotically nitpicking over slight blemishes in perfectly enjoyable songs or a serious artist in a difficult period enacted reasonable quality control? On Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk, the 1998 double-album that combines songs from both the Verlaine sessions and the Memphis demos, there is evidence of both.<br />First of all, it should be mentioned that Sketches generally features a more bitter and livid tone than Grace. The latter album featured one quite brooding song \\"Eternal Life,\\" but the exception has become the rule on Sketches. The harsher climate works more often than not, but Buckley, obviously more adept in the emotionally warm atmosphere of Grace stand-outs such as \\"Last Goodbye\\" and \\"Mojo Pin,\\" is occasionally caught on snags.<br />Take the nearly nihilistic \\"The Sky in a Landfill,\\" which opens disc one, the section of Sketches composed of the Verlaine sessions, for example. Buckley has collected a bunch of grim phrases (\\"evil black the sky,\\" \\"public's empty promise,\\" \\"garbage dump of souls\\") but seems to have little idea of how exactly to fit them together. This is just one instance displaying how the Verlaine sessions are plagued by both an awkward change in tone and an even more troubling development: sub par songwriting. Clumsily constructed and featuring wordplay that ranges from unskilled (\\"It's in your heart/It's in your art, your beauty/Even in this world of lies/There's purity\\") to inexplicable (\\"I feel the spell that you have cast, hot, pink, nasty/Bubble gum, coming down just like a big red coal\\"), the songs of the Verlaine sessions are, sadly, a far cry from the gems of Grace. To overcome this, Buckley calls upon on the power of his spectacular voice, often employing overdub to add a sense of fullness to many of the flatter tracks. A greater focus on vocals might have made for a pleasant twist, if not for the darker tone, which does not mix well with Buckley's high-pitched, dulcet style. This disc has some decent moments, particularly the sweet account of romantic curiosity, \\"Opened Once\\" and the delightful experiment with R&B crooning \\"Everybody Here Wants You.\\" All in all, however, Buckley can not be blamed for having shelved these recordings. He could do much better.<br />And he does on the second disc, consisting of mostly the four-track demos recorded in Memphis. Included are improved versions of \\"New Years Prayer\\" and \\"Nightmares by the Sea;\\" a splendid, bizarre take on Genesis' \\"Back in N.Y.C,\\" a classic soul-style rendition of Porter Wagoner's trademark hit, \\"Satisfied Mind,\\" and the thrillingly cathartic build-up, \\"Haven't You Heard,\\" which is probably Sketches' best track. As can be expected from recordings from such an early stage in the album-making process, the tracks are rough and unpolished and a few of the songs are outright throwaways (\\"Demon John,\\" \\"Your Flesh is So Nice\\"). If it had been completed, this effort would likely be a worthy follow-up to Grace. Unfortunately, Buckley never lived to complete such a follow-up and all that fans have to suffice is this frustrating documentation of his efforts to produce a sophomore release including both the good moments and the bad.
B000002WPI|5.0|This CD is the best in the world right ahead of Nas and Mobb Deep. Nothing can touch it, it;s incredible, the way the RZA, the GZA, ODB, Ghostface Killah, Raekwon, Method man. the rebel INS, masta killa,and u-god fit together. I would give this a 10 if i could.
B0000029DD|5.0|Grace, the 1994 debut of singer/songwriter, Jeff Buckley, seems like an unlikely choice for one of the greatest albums of the nineties, an honor it is often given. In an age in which so many new styles emerged and so many doors were opened, Grace was not a particularly innovative or ground-breaking album. Buckley touched listeners the old fashion way: speaking strait from the heart. His approach succeeded in every respect. Grace is the most enchanting and emotive album of its era.<br />Buckley's songwriting style was a meeting of misty scene-setting, warm spiritualism and emotional heaviness, all of which bring the pain and poignancy of his subject matter (classic-style love and loss) into glowing, vivid dimensions. One listen to the effortlessly beautiful \\"Last Goodbye,\\" and one will be flooded with visions of erstwhile relationships and bittersweet partings. Another particularly outstanding track, \\"Lover You Should've Come Over\\" mourns lost love with a sense of gut-wrenching despair that is rare in its deepness and vibrancy. Truly, Buckley had a knack for writing songs of emotion-rendering richness.<br />But a greater key to Buckley's success than his lyrics were his vocals. The young singer's voice was an instrument of strength, soul and aptitude. The diverse array of cover songs featured on Grace represents the truly remarkable capacity of his vocals. He gently twirls the jazz number \\"Lilac Wine,\\" around the end of his tongue; becomes almost operatic on his stunning rendition of the English hymn, \\"Corpus Christi Carol\\" and reaches an almost unprecedented level of serenity on Leonard Cohen's wry ode to spiritual sovereignty, \\"Hallelujah,\\" which takes on a whole new sense of gravity under Buckley. The said version of \\"Hallelujah\\" soundtracked a montage of footage of the World Trade Center attacks and their immediate aftermath, shown on VH1 the week following September 11th, another testament to this singer's ability to touch people like few others of his generation.

If you are squemish and want to read a Bible story then you should stay away from this book.<br />It's FANTASTIC. Robert Jordan wishes he could write this good. He probably has a lot of sleepless nights knowing that the true king of the genre has not completely taken his overly long lived stay on the throne.<br />If you like Robert Jordan then you will LOVE R.R.

You have to give him credit for writing from the gut and telling us the story that needs to be told and not the story every politically correct nay sayer wants to be told.<br />You don't have to like Martin's work, but you do have to love it!

He is simply the best living author alive today. If you have not read this series then you're missing out.<br />Very rarely do you see a writer who can develop characters and plot at the same time. I'm not sure if he has a weakness... he is like Tiger Woods. Solid in every area. He dominates the genre and is clearly heads and shoulders above any fantasy author and I will go one step further and say any living author.<br />He is the Shakespeare of our time. And it's time we gave him the credit he deserves. Now I need to go get some sleep. Reading his novels is probably not good for my health, no food and sleep for this long can kill a man.<br />-Martin Fan
B00005B4GU|4.0|I think this album is pure genius.  Like spinning plates is probably my favorite song on here.  it is so complex.  My only problem with the album is, it is mostly techno-experimental sounds, not alternative rock. So for a rock album, i don't really like it cuz...it's not rock. but for a techno album, it's awesome.  basically, no matter what kind of music you like, you'll love this album if you only give it a chance because it is just so brilliant.
0201633612|3.0|I've been a C++ programmer for quite a while.  Every three years or so, it seems there's some revolutionary text or other that promises huge leaps forward in the art of software design.  This book, extreme programming, various modelling languages and techniques, 4GLs, etc etc.  I can remember people arguing that everything C++ would be different once it got a standardized string class.<br />The patterns in this book lie largely within my experience, and none would not be obvious without careful analysis of software requirements.  Really, what's new about an Iterator pattern, or an Interpreter, State, Builder, Adapter, or Proxy?  In my experience, this is like people raving on about the benefits of hash tables or doubly-linked lists.  If you want a mind-opening experience, do something interesting (and hard at first) like writing LISP code to interpret an arbitrary expression using only compiled functions.  No, your negative college experiences do not apply.<br />In conclusion, if you're new to programming, this book does contain useful wisdom that comes from experience, and this is largely hard to come by.  As another bit of wisdom: avoid trying to simultaneously apply as many patterns as possible.  If you're an experienced programmer, though, you probably already know and can explain everything in this text.
B00005JL78|4.0|Minority Report, based on a mediocre short-story by the very talented sci-fi writer Philip K. Dick, turns out to be a pretty good film with a fast pace, good special effects, and a twist and turn ending with at least one good surprise.  It uses the original story only as a starting point, which is a good thing.  The widescreen DVD version is great, but the second DVD with extras is not that exciting or informative, with basic explanations of how the movie was made.  The last section is a Mutual Admiration Society meeting between Speilberg and Cruise, who claims that the director's ideas for the film were uniquely Spielberg's own.  However, this movie would not be what it is without Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, another adaptation of a Dick tale.  Great script and plot here, and the scene with Cruise jumping from car to car on a vertical highway blew me away.
0345423496|1.0|SPOILER: THERE IS NO ENDING.  The book suddenly stops in its tracks.  I had to re-read the final chapter and check the PAGE NUMBERS to see if the publisher had left out the ending by accident.<br />It's as if Mr. Clarke lost interest in this awful piece of fluff about three pages into the story -- if story is the right word --and continued to write, grudgingly, in order to pay his mortgage.<br />Yes, he's brilliant, and he's written some classic fiction and non-fiction, but he was so disintrested in his own story that the magic, the mystery, the grandeur of the next (or, previous) thousand years is glossed over without any thought about entertaining the reader.<br />If you haven't read this book yet -- don't.  Go find a 30-year-old Larry Niven book, curl up and enjoy the next thousand years written by an author who gave a damn.
B00005JLRR|3.0|I'm a lifelong Trek fan. The Landru episode aired on the night I was born and I've been watching Trek ever since. So, naturally I went to see Nemesis. There is good and bad news. First the good stuff: This movie is 100% better than the icky Insurrection.<br /> Now for the bad: Nemesis suffers from inconsistancies and bad writing. Shinzhan, who makes an excellent bad guy and is a bright spot in the film, has never seen a human woman before and is fascinated by Troi. Instead of using that to the Federation's advantage Troi acts like a schoolgirl when he asks if he can touch her hand.  Wesley Crusher is wearing a Star Fleet dress uniform. Why? Didn't he leave Star Fleet years ago? Worf is back on the Enterprise. Didn't he return to the Klingon homeworld at the end of the Dominion War? Riker, in a crucial fight scene stops, stares and watches a Reman escape down a chute. That made not a lick of sense. The Enterprise is still vulnerable to the cloaking device. Why? After all these years why hasn't the Federation come up with a cloak of its own? Where is the rest of the fleet? Throughout a serious confrontation nobody from Starfleet sends even a short message to the Enterprise. Shinzhan's motivation for going after earth is so weak that Piccard should've been able to talk him out of it. <br />Ultimately, I enjoyed Nemesis but it should have been better. Trek people like me will go see and some of us will grumble but I don't see this one pulling in non fans.
1558807381|1.0|If you absolutly must see this movie, rent it.  Otherwise, don't waste your money, I regret wasting mine.  The story was trite, and the characters were dull and lifeless  (Save Tim Curry).  I could not find one good aspect of this movie.  It was a waste of talent, and a waste of production money.  Tim Curry's character's costume, looked like a bad Horror movie costume.<br />I almost turned it off with in five minutes of the movie when Tom Crusie's character appeared (he looked a lot like Peter Pan in tight tights).
B000008JUM|5.0|This collection surely puts a whole new take on the expression &quot;turn over in one's grave&quot;.  Cole Porter must be positively wriggling with enthusiasm in his.  For here is a CD that does all sorts of things at once, and in his name: first and foremost it raises both awareness and finance for a problem that, at the time, was struggling for airtime.  But it does so much more.  &quot;Red Hot and Blue&quot; brings together not only an eclectic collection of modern artists, but it unites them in the very name of integrating musical genres.  This CD will not only provide you with the right starting background for your next dinner party, but it will open doors for you yourself if you listen to it alone.  Anyone even remotely interested in the cause, the artists, Cole Porter himself, or progressiveness as a way of life, won't be reading this review, because they will already have been recommending this CD.
B00005OLY5|1.0|This movie was very much like Lord of the Rings, when my friends and I were watching it we were relating Willows characters to Lord of the Rings characters.<br />The story of Willow goes like this.  And evil Queen (who my friends and I have related to the character Lord Sauron) finds out that a child born in her kingdom will someday over throw her (the child we dubbed \\"The Ring\\").  The child was rescued and was found by a dwarf like creature named Willow (This guy really looked like a Hobbit.  Hence we dubbed him Frodo).  The village sorceror (New name Gandalf) gives Willow the mission to return the child to her homeland (does the plot sound familiar yet).  Willow gets a few members of his village to accompany him (Now Sam, Merry, and Pippin).  On their quest they are being hunted down by wild boar like creatures who want to kill the child (now The Ringwaiths).  This leads a few members to abandon the group.<br />As they travel further they come across this human character played by Val Kilmer (Who surprisingly fits the character description for Aragon, both in image and personality).  He says that he will help Willow in his quest.  They continue traveling (picking up new characters, who are like Boromir, Legolas, and Gimli (not a dwarf, but personality really fits).  They even have a female character who Val Kilmers character is in love with (She is now Arwen).  They also run into a powerful fairy type spirit (who is like Galadriel).<br />The characters battle a lot of soliders, ward off the boar things, and fight a big huge stone type creature (remember the stone creature in the mountains in Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Rings).<br />The ironic thing to this whole movie, is the baby doesn't even over throw the queen, like the prophecy says, well the child doesn't do it by her own devices.<br />All in all, do not buy this movie, it is almost a softcore rip-off version of Lord of the Rings.  (They even sacrifice the baby at the end, like the way they toss thering in the volcano at the end of the last Lord of Rings book).  True Lord of the Rings fans will find this movie insulting, while true fantasy movie goers will be dissappointed by the cheesy jokes, graphics, and attempts to create a fantasy movie.<br />Even if Lord of the Rings had never been written or imagined, this would be a REALLY BAD FANTASY MOVIE.  please people go see Labyrinth, Dark Crystal, or the Neverending story, at least those ideas are some what original.
0767825411|5.0|Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis wrote the script, but Bill Murray gets all the best lines and moments in this 1984 comedy directed by Ivan Reitman (Meatballs). The three comics, plus Ernie Hudson, play the New York City-based team that provides supernatural pest control, and Sigourney Weaver is the love interest possessed by an ancient demon. Reitman and company are full of original ideas about hobgoblins--who knew they could &quot;slime&quot; people with green plasma goo?--but hovering above the plot is Murray's patented ironic view of all the action.
B000000XB9|5.0|CCR doesn't get any better than this....
6304030983|5.0|Based on the children's book by Chris Van Allsburg, Jumanji stars Robin Williams as a man who escapes his confinement within a devilish board game, only to be followed by all kinds of exotic problems: elephants, lions, zebras, monkeys, floods, giant insects, killer plants, and a big-game hunter. The computer-generated effects all wreak havoc through quiet streets, and while most of this is pretty fun, relationship conflicts and character development are weak and forgettable. The high point, in comic terms, is probably David Alan Grier's hilarious performance as a cop catching the worst of these various plagues--one at a time.
B00006RU5B|4.0|Before i bought this record, i ensured i didnt read any reviews. I know that it is impossible, but if for a moment you could forget there was ever a Soundgarden or RATM, then this record is even better than it already is. Having said that, we always knew this cd would be awesome, because it contains one of the best voices of the 90s, and one of the best guitarists of the 90's, compounded with a bassist and drummer who provide the finished package. I know, nothing here is as good as &quot;Jesus Christ Pose&quot; or &quot;Killing in the Name&quot;, but if no comparisons are drawn, this is top 3 best cds of 2002. Highlights include &quot;Cochise&quot;, &quot;Set it Off&quot;, &quot;Show me How to Live&quot;, &quot;Shadow on the Sun&quot; and &quot;I Am The Highway&quot;.
B00005O5CM|5.0|this movie is definitely one of my favorites!! this was the role reese witherspoon was born to play. it is incredibly funny..and it teaches some valuable life lessons, too. i cant wait for the sequel!!
B000067CPX|4.0|if not don't worry about it and you won't have to use critical words like musicianship.
B00006879E|5.0|I first heard Maroon 5 when i went to see Vanessa Carlton. It was me and three of my friends. When they started to play we were star struck. Me and my three friends absolutely LOVED them! Right after they walked off stage, we went over and bought there Cd. We saw them standing there so we thought we would get their autgraphs. We also ended up talking with them for a while. They are really down to earth individuals, which i think makes them a 10 star band rather than a 5 star. This is defiantely the greatest Cd of 2002!
B000068OSK|4.0|The 'White Stripes' debut album has an amazing vintage rock/blues sound that captures something that the pop charts haven't matched in a long time.  The White Stripes revisit the blues on this album, adding new elements with obviouse respect to the original blues genre.  'St. James Infirmary Blues' in particular is outstanding.  However, the guitar can get a bit grating in combination with Jack White's unusual voice for people unfamiliar with the Stripes.  This album is less accessable than 'White Blood Cells', but thats kind of what makes it so rewarding.   Exellent.
B00005JLRR|3.0|The spell cast over the Star Trek movie franchise is broken, and not in a good way.  It seems that since the roll-out of ST:TMP lo these many years ago, that only the even numbered movies seem to resonate well with the audience.  Unfortunately, ST: X \\"Nemesis\\" shatters the formula--it falls short of being good.<br />\\"Nemesis\\" lacked so many things, where does one start?  How about connection?  It lacked a connection to its previous films and to the series as a whole.  It lacked conviction--the cast was on auto pilot.  It lacked conflict--the villain was laughable, and hardly menacing.  Rather, he was a petulant little prig, with no gravitas at all--hardly a fitting foil for our known cast members to battle.<br />Connection is the most disappointing thing--it was difficult to see the connection between the lives the characters used to live in the other movies and the series because so much time was spent on other things.  Data seemed to be un-Data-esque, and I was left wondering if they remembered that his emotion chip had even existed.  Geordi was AWOL, Beverly was fleeting, even Admiral Janeway needed more screen time.  The only one that didn't need time was Wesley--whose presence was hardly explained--again, a lack of connection.  Even the Enterprise itself seemed small and just a jumble of sets--the extras that played the other cast members acted like they had no connection to the stars to form a \\"crew\\".<br />Emotional connection was what I ultimately found lacking.  There was a stark absence of emotion, like we saw in the episode where Jean Luc returns to France after the Borg had assimilated him, or where he vows to stand against the Borg in ST: First Contact. I found myself grasping for emotional connection to this cast/crew as they gave lip service to the paces they were going through.  I was very disappointed in this film, mostly because expectations were high after such a long hiatus.  It gets a 3 of 5, and that only because it is, after all, Star Trek.  Ihope your experience is more enjoyable than was mine.
0930289234|2.0|Yes, I know I'm going to get a lot of \\"unhelpfuls\\" for the two stars.<br />I feel it's important to bring Watchmen up from more of a recent viewpoint, though. Many of the people who gave it five stars either read it 20 years ago and have let it accumulate a rosy glow ever since, or else simply aren't familiar with the state of modern comics.<br />I spent the first ten years of my life reading hundreds or thousands of comics (and books too, thank you very much), and there's little about Watchmen that distinguishes it from the current crop. The art is subpar, the cliches glaring, and the \\"mature humor\\" nearly as subtle as Roseanne. The integration of contemporary issues such as nuclear tension and sexism lends it more weight as a snapshot of an age without actually contributing to its longevity.<br />The attempts at sophistication- the subcomic \\"Tales of the Black Freighter\\", the repetitive wordplay- fail miserably, and do more to make the book an embarassing showcase of pretension than comic innovation. As my father is fond of saying, \\"If you can't dazzle 'em with brilliance, baffle 'em with bulls**t.\\"<br />If you're a comic fan, Watchmen is a harmless waste of a few hours. If you want a real introduction to the comic medium, though, stick to Maus or Hepcats.
B0000039PW|3.0|Don't get me wrong Biggie was a great rapper. But had the wrong guidence(P.Diddy) and went to the wrong label(bad boy). There is a lack of originality and too many samples. Biggie was better off at Interscope or Def Jam. Biggie:great lyricist, but wrong guidence and production.<br />The inteludes are also too Pornographic. There's one interlude were he's having sex with Lil Kim and another Interlude were Lil Kim is giving Biggie [felatio] for the first time.<br />Recomend it if you love Biggie.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Have your wife do the same or invite some good friends over and spend the whole day in front of the TV because you're not going to want to turn it off once you slip that first disc into your DVD player. Not for work, for bed, for dinner or even to catch a plane to Hawaii. You will be glued to your television set, and when you've reached the end, you're not gonna be able to get this movie out of your mind. This is the first time truly great storytelling has been applied to World War II.
B00005JKZT|4.0|I wanted to be one of the first people to give this flick a rave after having seen it.  \\"Towers\\" is not faultless - even next to \\"Fellowship\\", but it's still a great flick, very much the \\"Empire Strikes Back\\" of the trilogy.  The film opens with Gandalf's climactic battle against the Balrog in the depths of the Dwarves's kingdom of Moria, setting us up for the return of the wizard who we all thought lost.  The over-all story concerns the efforts of a group of rabbit-like people called Hobbits to destroy the \\"One Ring\\" of power sought by the evil Sauron.  Should Sauron reclaim it, he will become powerful enough to return the world to shadow.  The only way to destroy the ring is to toss it into the fiery chasm of \\"Mount Doom\\", a seething volcano in the dark land of Mordor - itself Sauron's home (the ring is otherwise indestructible).  The first film had the Hobbit Frodo and his friends form a \\"fellowship\\" with Gimli (a bellicose dwarf), Legolas (an elvish archer whose quiver never empties of arrows and whose aim is always true), Boromir (a human and thus more prone than most to the ring) Aragorn (played by Viggo Mortensen; Aragorn is also human but seems immune from the temptations of the ring out of duty - his great ancestor was seduced by its power and Aragorn's doubts keep him honest) and the sage wizard Gandalf (Ian Kckellen buried under piles of hair and speaking in a delicious accent that seems similarly weighted).  The band must contend, not only with the forces of Mordor, but also those of Isengard - a human realm led by the once wise now corrupt Saruman the White.  With nothing but hope to stand in the way of Mordor (in \\"Middle Earth\\", magic is common while \\"hope\\" is considered the stuff of fantasy) Saruman throws his lot in with Sauron - his fortress in Isengarde and Sauron's looming citadel at Barad-Dur being the two towers of the title.  If the Rings trilogy is meant as a metaphor for pre-WWII Europe, Mordor would be Nazi Germany while Saruman would approximate Marshal Petain and Il-Duce, the Quislings, Fifth Columnists and collaborators of every stripe; scenes of Saruman addressing huge columns of Orc troops look reminiscent of the Nazi rallies of 1938.<br />\\"Fellowship\\" ended with the band fracturing.  The Hobbits Merry and Pippin (the first movie's comic relief) are captured by orcs.  Frodo and Sam, eager to prevent any more of their friends from suffering, proceed onto Mordor alone.  The remaining band swear to rescue the Hobbits.  Gollum, a wretched hobbit-like creature who bore the ring for 500 years (the ring gave him long life, but time has not been kind to his body or soul) appeared briefly in the first movie, but now comes face-to-face with our heroes.  Sam would as soon be rid of Gollum, but Frodo pities him - both because of Gandalf's wise words in the first movie, but more practically because Gollum will prove useful for navigating the dark lands of Mordor.  Gimli, Aragorn and Legolas are side-tracked in their search for Merry and Pippin when they miraculously reunite with Gandalf and go to join to the defense of Rohan - a human kingdom facing massacre from Saruman's army. Rohan's king leads his people to a mountain redoubt called \\"Helm's Deep\\" - carved out of the mountains, it's apparently impregnable, the only defense they have against Saruman's orcs.  Meanwhile, Merry and Pippin meet up with the enchanted inhabitants of a living forest - CGI trees who learn to their horror that Saruman has uprooted the forests of Isengarde to feed the fires that forged his army.<br />So, is it great?  Yeah - it suffers in comparison to the first movie, though that's because \\"Fellowship\\" was able to focus on that one group rather than dividing itself among several as \\"Towers\\" requires.  The new flick fits seamlessly with the first, though making it harder to follow for non-fanatics who didn't catch \\"Fellowship\\" (which began with a monolog by the Elvish Queen Galadriel that synopsizes the ring lore, and then reinforcesit through the perspectives of the elvish King Elrond and the nagging doubts of Aragorn; the new film doesn't deal with the legend at all, keeping its business to the story at hand - the ring itself becomes less an object than an idea or metaphor, a \\"mcguffin\\" like that suitcase in \\"Pulp Fiction\\").  If the story is harder to follow, it stays true to the first film's focus on the trials and loyalty of its characters.  If the flick gets more jokes at the expense of the dwarf Gimli, it also reminds you that he's the guy you want fighting on your side when the Orcs strike your neighborhood - something you'd never say about Jar-Jar.  Aragorn is less remote than he was in the first flick - though Gandalf becomes more aloof, the result of his life-altering battle with the Balrog.  The change implies that he's less of the approachable character in \\"Fellowship\\" - and only highlights the cursory treatment of that epic deathmatch.  \\"Towers\\" draws strength from two sources - the epic battle for Helm's Deep and the tortured character of Gollum.  Though both dependent on cutting-edge CGI, the flick works wonders with each: the battle is fought by hordes yet not the faceless hordes of \\"Attack of the Clones\\"; Gollum is a CGI wonder, tortured not only by his endless wasted life, but by conflicting emotions brought to life in one scene that unintentionally reminds of Ren from \\"Ren and Stimpy\\", but shows the very convincing depths of his dark soul.  At over three hours long, this movie doesn't waste a minute.
B000002U8G|5.0|Do you ever wonder what it would feel like to experience sonic perfection? I don't either...but if such a thing existed, this would be it. The album's highlight is the 23-minute &quot;Echoes,&quot; considered by many to be the band's crowning achievement. Somehow, the song is able to keep your attention for the full duration...even though it's mostly instrumental. Also on this album are the (absolutely hilarious!) track &quot;Seamus,&quot; about a dog who would howl when he heard blues music, and the hard-hitting &quot;One Of These Days,&quot; in which Nick Mason's growling vocals make you wonder if you're in danger of being chopped &quot;into little pieces.&quot; If you don't own this album, I must apologize profusely for not asking you to buy it sooner.
B00005JKZT|3.0|My review might have to be taken with a grain of salt, since I'm not a Tolkein fan, the only book I've read is The Hobbit, and I didn't even see the last movie.  Even for someone in my position though this movie is kind of fun.  It starts off with a bang, the movie goes straight into the action, and we follow several threads of adventurers all seeking the same ends, to save Middle Earth, the world of men, and destroy the ring Frodo wears about his neck.  The movie is three quarters special effects, but they're nicely done, it's a little like watching a Disney movie with human actors.  The epic itself is rousing.  The bad guys, the orcs are truly disgusting.    The ents, walking and talking trees, are rather slow and frustrating, but they're supposed to be that way.  And they are engaging.  The loves of Aragorn, elf and human, add a little romance to the story.  And the climactic battle scenes are amusing as long as you don't think about them too much.  The best character, however, is Gollum (aka Smiegel?) a washed out villain with a conscience who must debate his every move with himself.  Apparently he's entirely computer graphics, but he steals the  show.  He's a kind of anti-Yoda.
B00004Z459|5.0|First of all..........BUY THIS CD........It is;\\"in my opinion\\", one of the best cds ever made.  Hybrid Theory is a perfect blend of rock/hip hop.  I bought this cd yesterday, and I litarally havn't been able to put it down.  I'm even listening to it right now.  If you don't like this cd, your like, on [...] or something.I can't get enough of this.  It truly defines rock.  Plus, Liknin Park is my fave. band too.  I think Hip/hop, or rock lovers can appriciate this cd.  And for all you moma's boys out there, yes theres no cursing.
B000069HK2|5.0|...really, no complaints. i'm not one to buy a CD after just hearing a song or two, but after &quot;The Taste of Ink&quot; and &quot;A Box Full of Sharp Objects&quot; i dont know how i couldnt buy it. great cd, its always on- it never gets old...i recommend it
B00006LLLN|4.0|Recorded live last April 29 and 30th in Louisville Kentucky this double CD (I've seen better made double cases to hold CD's in) gives you a lot of their songs. <BR>I've listened to just part of it so far and found the audience cheering to be a little distracting in some cases. Dan Tyminski's &quot;I am a man of constant sorrow&quot; gets a big roar of approval (it's #4 on disc 2), sounds a little different than it did on the &quot;O brother where art thou?&quot; CD but is still good. Alison Krauss' did  &quot;Down to the river to pray&quot; (same disc, #11)for Austin City Limits, its the only track not recorded in Kentucky and I prefer the &quot;O Brother&quot; version.<BR>Good album if you like them but would be beter as a studio recording.
6305144176|3.0|Not as good as Dr. Strangelove or Duck Soup, although I don't really understand all the negative comparisons to Full Metal Jacket. All in all, Kubrick's film may be a little better, but this is a funny and occasionally moving film that is definitely worth a watch.
B0000039LE|5.0|Halloween is without a doubt a real shocker. Set in Haddonfield, Illinois, it is about a six year old child who, after murdering his older sister, returns from Smith's Grove Sanitariam 15 years later to continue his bloody rampage.<br />I like this film not only because it features Jamie Lee Curtis, Donald Pleasance and P J Soles, but because Michael Myers, the killer, is nothing but pure evil. Personally I find that quite disturbing - that Satan has been incarnated in a scary mask, boiler suit and carrying a shining butcher's knife. The POV's are good, and as there always is in the best of horror movies, there is in this one of course a big chase through the streets. The theme tune, though very simple, is really quite frightening and, combined with the lighting effects and the whole creepy gait and evil, makes this one a real scream of a treat.<br />What is also an excellent feature of this film is that in other films, like A Nightmare On Elm Street or I Know What You Did Last Summer, there is a lot of blood and gore, but in this one, there isn't. And that doesn't make it any less terrifying.<br />So, please! All you horror fans out there, search now for Halloween and buy it right NOW! It is positively a true classic.
0783226063|4.0|If you are not familiar with the book 'Dune' you will be lost in the narrative of this film. As one who'd read the book I was lost some of the time. Welcome to the mind of director David Lynch.<br />The script can't be blamed on him although I suspect somewhere in the editing room there are segments that would have made the story easier to follow.<br />There are a few reasons this is a worthwhile film.<BR>a) it is visually interesting although it should be noted some effects seem terribly dated and/or ill suited for a Science Fiction film<BR>b) if you can get past not understanding Dune the first pass it does become more comprehensible in future viewings.<BR>c) the acting is wildly varied with Kyle MacLachlan's characterization of Paul Atreides being wooden while Kenneth McMillan's portrail of Baron Vladimir Harkonnen is so over the top that you actually look forward to his pustule ridden face on screen.<br />When first seeing Dune in a theater I walked away being impressed with the visual and sound aspects of the film. It is very much a David Lynch film so if you don't like his directing don't bother. Part of the problems with Dune are the script which is asked to take a complex novel with many characters and subplots and boil it down to a couple hours of entertainment. <br />This has been done in the past but using Lord of the Rings 1 as an example, it took 3 hours to get the storylines and most of the characters together for a fine film. In Dune, Frank Herbert's novel, there was quite a bit of exposition on the politics and spirituality of the world he created. If pared down a good but incomplete story was possible. In the end this version of Dune chose to stay more comprehensive in plot with a loss of charater development and ability to comprehend the mostly linear exposition of the film.<br />When watching it a few times there is a plot but it is rendered nearly inconcequential as the film drives along by looks and a few Lynchesque touches to the novel's characters. The one theme that came though was the bad guys have all the fun. They are the only happy people in the film for the vast majority of it's running time.<br />Still, this is an enjoyable film and inventive where it can be. Consider it the anti-Star Wars.
B00003CXXP|5.0|I have read what seems like a million reviews of this film. What has never ceased to amaze is the psuedo-intellectual stance taken by the nay-sayers. Give it a chance. I did and I'm am so glad I did so. I have seen it several times since the first, and have enjoyed it with each subsequent veiwing. Judge for yourself. You will not be dissapointed. Destined to be a classic!
B00005A8GY|1.0|This album contains some of the finest work of Santana, unfortunately this Super-Audio CD does not sound like a Super-Audio CD, it sounds like an older  compressed and clipped format, barely a Redbook CD.  Obviously it was not transfered from the original tapes because it contains none of the space and hyper-resolution one expects of a SACD.  If you already own the standard CD of this fine music, don't bother switching because the sound engineers wholly failed at their job on this one.
B0000508U6|5.0|this album grows on you. you'll find it hard to part with. easily one of the best albums of the past few years.
B00005JKZ3|2.0|This one is just a silly rehash of the first one, an obvious cash in on based on the success of the first film. The script feels like it took about a week to write: it feels like they slapped it together, realizing that by the time word of mouth was out that it was bad, people would have already seen it. The funny moments are few and far between: Frank was funny, and Tommy Lee Jones' post office clothes were funny, but that's about it. I would recommend the first one, but this is very skippable. Thank you for taking the time to read my review and fee free to leave me a helpful/not helpful review.
B000002BYD|4.0|On pearl jam's 5th album we find doing a more grounded,more old shcool style album. Unlike the experimental elements of \\"vitology\\" and \\"no code\\", with yeild we find a more mellow version of pearl jam, with the exception of 6 some odd songs. Of course yeild has it's share of duds, it has it's share of in my opoion, pearl jams best tunes to date. Yeild not only being one of my favorote rock albums and my 3rd favorite pearl jam album starts off with tunes such as \\"brain of J\\" and \\"faithfull\\". What better way to start off a rock/alternative album with two very impressive tunes? While \\"no way\\" reminds me of something off of vitology, that song really to this day does not impress me. But \\"given to fly\\", well besides from sounding eirly like led zepplins \\"going to calliforinia\\" is awsome, with full of emotion vocals from ed vedder(as he now calls himself)and very rythimic guitars. While the middle part of the album pretty much falls into very mellow ballads, mostly acoustic oriented. Tunes such as \\"whishlist\\" \\"pilate\\", both of witch are pretty good, and wishlist as being probably one of pearl jams most flamboyant songs next to \\"even flow\\". Then you get into the later half of yeild and goes pretty much with the same formula, but definetly has some very nice tunes such as the laid back ballads \\"MFC\\" \\"lowlight\\" and \\"all those yesterdays\\". While \\"in hidning\\" as being one of my all time favorite pearl jam tunes with it's mellow/rocking formula and at the end a very neat little riff. I would definetly recomend yeild to new pearl jam fans and rock fans alike.
B00006LLNU|5.0|The funny thing is, there's really little that's incredible about this album: the album, the songs are all untitled; there're no liner notes, only some nice drawings of snowy forest; in fact, almost no writing whatsoever on the CD case, save a small plug for their website and the requisite copyright information on the CD itself, which is plain white; the songs are equally sparse in what they give us- mostly haunting sounds from a piano and strings, no hummable melodies, and the same phrase repeated over and over, not just on one song, but on many of them. Exactly what you wouldn't expect from a major-label release.<br />And that's what makes it so great.<br />I realized this as I searched frantically on the web- first here, and then at Sigur Ros' website- to find what the songs were called. When I discovered that there were none to be found was when it hit me: this album is about lack of pretense. They give you nothing to build up expectations, and therefore the entire album, both the music and the aesthetics of the packaging, is an entire experience devoid of symbols, messages, or anything else found in today's pop music. I loved it, personally, and I really enjoy the music, which is ultimately more relaxing than repetative. The final minutes of the last song, which end in a mellow crescendo of rock music, are just the perfect thing to top off this truly incredible album.<br />Thank you, Sigur Ros.

B00005ATQ9|5.0|I've heard alot of negative things about this film. I've heard how terrible it is to it just being one of Stanley Kubrick's failures. However, I have to disagree. First off, Kubrick never made a flawed film. Secondly, I would rank Barry Lyndon one of his best works. The cinematography by John Alcott is absolutly superb. Barry Lyndon is definitely one of the best photographed films of all time. Now, I do agree that the film is very long and fairly slow but if you keep with it and don't give up on it, you will be rewarded for your efforts. It is an artistic masterpiece created so perfectly. One reason being that Kubrick is a control-freak and a perfectionist. The music is synchronized wonderfully with the actor movement, the camera movement and the narrator. Anyone who says it is inferior to Kubrick favorites such as Dr. Strangelove or 2001 or Clockwork Orange hasn't really looked underneath the surface enough (the surface being how slow it is)and can't recognize good art when they see it. Sure there isn't a car explosion every 13 seconds or a robotic grenade launcher roaming the streets of LA, but all the elements of cinema and art are beautifully assembled. I think everyone should see it and give it a try.
6304493681|2.0|I rented this once, I fell asleep. I figured, well maybe I was just tired that night or something. So I rented it again. I fell asleep again. That should say something about this movie. The only good thing about this movie is the animation which is fantastic. But it takes more than animation to make a quality anime. Especially when it's a an anime that's trying to have a &quot;deep&quot; and &quot;one of a kind&quot; story with the time constraints of a movie format. The entire thing from start to finish was boring and I really wasn't liking Oshii Mamoru (although he redeemed himself in my opinion with Jin-Roh). Kusanagi is naked too often too, I never got what the point was with her being naked so often. It was probably just for fan serivice, and that's not a good idea to throw in pointless fan service in a movie that is supposed to be &quot;deep&quot;. I didn't notice the music at all so it probably wasn't very good. All in all Ghost in the Shell is just eye candy. I hope that the new GinS tv series is better than the movie.
0312305060|5.0|I can't believe I put off reading Michael Cunningham's THE HOURS for this long.  This spectacularly written novel resonates with emotion and insight as it follows the relatively ordinary details of the lives of three women separated by decades.  Each woman lives a single day here, each is haunted by the novel MRS. DALLOWAY.  Virginia Woolf is preparing to write the novel in the midst of unsettling thoughts and surroundings.  50's housewife Laura Brown finds refuge in the book as she prepares for her husband's birthday and finds herself tempted by thoughts of death.  Clarissa Vaughan has been nicknamed Mrs. Dalloway by her closest friend, the dying poet Richard, for whom she is about to throw a party. The three stories converge thematically; two are brought together by a shared character.<br />You don't need to read Woolf's MRS. DALLOWAY to appreciate this book because Cunningham has constructed a moving tale that stands on its own.  Although a knowledge of Woolf's novel reveals the layers the author has carefully constructed, there is much here to enjoy without that frame of reference.  The language is stunning, and the sentiments even more so.  Surprisingly, Virginia Woolf is the strongest character despite her iconic place in literature, with Clarissa almost as well drawn.  Laura is less memorable. Some of the minor characters appear with clarity while others seem tacked on, there only to support the ties to Woolf's novel. The homosexual characters (most notably Clarissa and Richard, with fleeting impulses from Laura and Virginia) are treated with affection and respect.<br />THE HOURS is a short, easily readable book, although you shouldn't - and most won't want to - breeze through it.  I recommend this book for a general readership.
6304595247|1.0|With a cast including Ralph Fiennes, Juliette Binoche, Jeremy Northam and Janet McTeer this SHOULD have been the definitive version of Emily Bronte's classic novel.  Unfortunately, it just isn't.  Although its individual components are, in places, excellent - Sakamoto's exquisite score, the locations, one or two of the performances - the whole film fails to gel.<br />Partly, it is because the usually excellent Ralph Fiennes shouldn't have been cast as Heathcliff.  He has virtually admitted as much himself - and is on record as saying that the film didn't work and was a miserable experience that very nearly put him off films completely.<br />Juliette Binoche doesn't fare any better.  She was, at the time, simply unequal to the dual roles of both Catherines.<br />That both actors subsequently went on to prove their cinematic worth only makes the waste of their talents here all the worse.<br />Janet McTeer and Jeremy Northam turn in excellent performances as Nelly Dean and Hindley - indeed watching Jeremy Northam, I found myself wishing that HE had been cast as Heathcliff - but they alone cannot rescue this film from itself.  In fact, at times, they seem to be in an entirely different film.  <br />Perhaps it is a little too much to expect total authenticity in a film, but the \\"Yorkshire\\" recreated by Peter Kosminsky and his set designers looks totally unreal and bears no relation at all to the world Emily Bronte knew and wove her story around.  They would have been well-advised to do a little more research into conditions in the north Pennines around the turn of the 19th Century (the book opens in 1801).  In fact, they might have been well-advised simply to read the book more closely.<br />And what on EARTH possessed them to have Emily Bronte herself plodding cross the tops to open and close the film?  What was the point?  It comes across as nothing more than a silly conceit - rather like the whole film.<br />A wasted opportunity - and a terrible misuse of a talented cast.  We can only be grateful that it didn't take its lead players down with it.
B00006LFGD|5.0|I came across the album by shear change &quot;WHAT A FIND&quot;. The music and voices are superb. It has to be the best buy of 2002 for my CD collection.If you or somebody you know like Streisand get this album for Christmas for them
B00006JJ1O|4.0|I say T.A.T.U. is not as bad as the main reviewer described them as. It seems like there is a lot of discrimination going on towards the Russian people in this country, only nobody would admit it. The whole country is talking about the discrimination towards Latinos and African-Americans but I think Russians are discriminated on the same level and that reviewer just totally trashed them just because of their origin.<br /> To get back to the point, I think that their music is something new to America. America is very conservative in terms of accepting European music, I haven't seen it happen too much. &quot;All The Things She Said&quot; has a sort of pop-techno style to it and it sounds very refreshing. &quot;They Are Not Gonna Get Us&quot; is the same way...their music is fresh and crisp. It is about time to stop overexagerating the power of hip-hop and realize that pop could be great too. Especially Russian :).
B000066NW0|3.0|Okay, so she has some good vocals, and some piercingly honest and emotional tracks, but what the hell is Nobody's Fool??  She's rapping??  Poorly, so first of all she has to misreprsent the punk culture, and that wasn't enough, she had to fake the hip hop too??  She evens says damn, on of the only swears on the album, as an obvious way to \\"look cool\\".  Otherwise, decent CD
B00003CXV4|2.0|I have to say that this movie was very disappointing despite the fact that it starred Keanu Reeves (who can act when he wants to) and Charlize Theron (gotta love the girl from Benoni - that's Benoni, South Africa). They had great chemistry in \\"The Devil's Advocate\\", and such terrible chemistry here.<br />People have pointed out that the movie was similar to \\"Autumn in New York\\", and it was. See one, you've seen the other. Both films were extremely \\"flat\\" in the way the storylines and character progression were handled.<br />There were many aspects of this film that I found disappointing: 1) an over-used plot;  2) the story really went nowhere; 3) as someone else said, every cheesy cliche in the book and 4) it was completely unbelievable. People grabbing perfect strangers off the street to come and live with them for a month? Please.<br />I didn't get the clothes either. Were they supposed to be bohemian? And what was with the scarves all the time? By the third scene during which she fiddled with a scarf, I wanted to strangle Charlize Theron's character with it!<br />Some movies have a point. This one didn't. Though it was worth it just to see Michael Rosenbaum in a dress.
B00000K0EA|5.0|There is just not enough room here to praise the 18th Bond film to the greatest extent.  Pierce Brosnan is in his second outing as the British superspy, on the trail of madman Eliot Carver, a media tycoon out to achieve the greatest news story of them all- extensive coverage of a worldwide nuclear war with China!    007 is aided by the beautiful (naturally) Chinese agent Wai Lin, and they are the only two standing in Carver's way of creating global chaos!  But with a handful of highly skilled and equally evil villains, it's going to be tough- but Bond of course comes through with the goods.  Played for the second time by Irishman Brosnan, it is a good, solid performance that proves that he has clearly broken into the role and adds his own mixture of charm, suavity, and cool to the character.   With a riveting storyline, explosive action sequences, numerous locations around the world, and even an Ericsson mobile phone controlled BMW 750iL with re-inflatable tyres and bullet-proof frame, this film quite simply has it all, and does the James Bond franchise a great deal of justice.  Definitely a thrill-a-minute film (or more accurately a thrill-a-second film), Tomorrow Never Dies is a worthy successor to GoldenEye, possibly the last great Bond film before the creators seemed to dry up slightly on ideas.  Any fans of the series or even of the action genre are openly recommended to see this film- over and over and over.  If you do not own Tomorrow Never Dies (more so if you don't own it on DVD), you are doing yourself a great disservice.  As soon as you finish reading this sentence, go out and buy it, and treat your senses to one of the greatest Bond flicks ever created.  At least do it for me.
0316666343|2.0|I am in agreement with another reviewer who is confused by all the raves that this mediocre book is inviting. I didn't think it was so great. Perhaps this is due to its following Tartt's The Secret History in my reading order, but this was only second-rate.
B00006LLNU|5.0|Agaetis Byrgun was unearthly enough already, but Sigur Ros' latest untitled album is probably not even in the solar system. The beauty of this album, with soaring orchestration, Jonsi's falsetto vocals acting like an instrument using only indecipherable lyrics, and the instrumentation of drums, bass, keys and drums, is almost unmatched by anyone. This and Agaetis Byrgun are tangible proof that Sigur Ros is one of the greatest music groups of all time. High points: Track 1, 3, 5, 7 and 8. Unreal. One of the best albums to come out in a long time.
0679642609|4.0|One should have more than one translation for Meditations.  Note this difference between Maxwell Staniforth's translation in 1964 (Penguin Classics) and Hay's 2002 translation in these two passages.<br />1964:  When force of circumstance upsets your equanimity, lose no time in recovering your self-control, and do not remain out-of-tune longer than you can help. Habitual recurrence to the harmony will increase your mastery of it.<br />2002: When jarred, unavoidably, by circumstances, revert at once to yourself, and don't lose the rhythm more than you can help. You'll have a better grasp of the harmony if you keep going back to it.<br />-----------------<br />1964: Adapt yourself to the environment in which your life has been cast, and show true love to the fellow-mortals with whom destiny has surrounded you.<br />2002: The things ordained for you - teach yourself to be at one with those. And the people who share them with you - treat them with love. With real love.<br />------------------<br />The 1964 version is regal, while the 2002 (Hays') version is Aurelius writing, quickly, in a spiral notebook while on horseback, the equivalent of \\"memo to myself.\\"<br />Reading this book is like taking a cold shower, or visiting a favorite bartender, who insists on serving you coffee, not drink. Hays has brought us a Marcus Aurelius who puts his hand on your shoulder, looks you in the eye, and tells you like it is: Get over yourself. You can't change the world. Do your best and realize you are of this earth. Human experience is muddy, so what? This book is best read in tough times, when you could use a little steel in your spine.
0316779237|2.0|I like David Sedaris and usually find his stuff very funny with that certain twist. The first story - Santaland Diaries was great - the others, not so great. Some were absolutely horrible-- things no one wants to envision during the holidays. Does that make it funny? The others were just plain boring. He could do better. \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" was so much fun to read!
B000066NW0|1.0|Ahem, well the only reason I see that someone would praise this album...is if they're getting some major kickback from it. Otherwise, I know that many of the folks who previously reviewed this album would have loved to hit a 1 rather than a 4 or 5. But alas, in keeping with tradition of the mass, they believe that they are obliged to follow the pack and, consequently, think alike as well...or else.<br />I am not particularly fond of this cliched album or the cliched Avril because listening to her dull and ORDINARY music (or cacophony, if you like) is sincerely a waste of one's precious ear drums -- sorry Avril, I know that this is way out of your domain, being ordinary and what not, but truth's a filthy she-dog, ain't it
B000001Y5J|5.0|...1992's Broken is non-stop heaviness. With acerbic lyrics, Trent's passionate screaming, texturized guitars, blaring drums, and a couple of weird instrumentals, Broken is an awesome experience, and one of the best industrial albums ever, even though it is an EP. Plus it has an Adam Ant cover too.
0385508417|5.0|Like many others, I, too, almost didn't read this book because Grisham cranks out, basically, the same stuff over and over again.  But David Gannon put it best, \\"It turns out that Grisham has finally diverged from his mass-manufactured overly frenetic pulp thriller habit and actually written a very different sort of story.\\"<br />If you like farcical characters & funny stories, buy this.  And if you do, you may also like another little gem I discovered on Amazon, \\"No One's Even Bleeding.\\"
0671027387|5.0|This story centers on the Presidential race between incumbent President Herney and his opponent, Senator Sedgewick Sexton, whose daughter Rachel is an analyst on the staff of the NRO (National Reconaissance Office) and is asked to participate in a mysterious and confidential assignment on behalf of President Herney. It seems NASA has made an amazing discovery that might secure the dubious future of the organization and revitalize the President's flagging campaign.<br />The interesting detail contributes to the realism in this fascinating story of political rivalry.  Frequently writers research the topic about which their plot revolves to the point that we are bored to death but Brown injects his factual material in a surprisingly interesting manner.  It enhances the plot and makes the incredible aspects of the story appear to be true. By the time I finished this book I had learned a great deal about NASA, Sattelite surveillance, new and imaginary military weapons,  asteriods, and deep sea  exploration and enjoyed it all.
B00005R2M3|5.0|If you look at Shakira, you would assume that she is yet another alleged musician whose only talent is looks.<BR>Not a chance! This album is a fantastic mix of various styles, written well and sang brilliantly. The Latin-flavoured &quot;Objection&quot; is great, &quot;Underneath Your Clothes&quot; is wonderfully philosophical and &quot;Whenever Wherever is just awesome in both its tune and its variety-pop, rock and world all mixed in.<BR>I also love &quot;Rules&quot;, &quot;Fool&quot;, &quot;Te Dejo Madrid&quot; and &quot;Eyes Like Yours&quot;. &quot;Te Dejo Madrid&quot; features a brilliant harmonica solo from Shakira which proves once and for all that the woman is what most of these attractive female singers aren't: a musician!<BR>There are no bad songs on this album, it is just brilliant to listen to.
B00007G1ZC|5.0|I saw this film several years ago and even today I recount it's imagery as perhaps among the most beautiful I've even seen. It's certainly not for everyone, but if you are a person who's mind is more sighted toward symbolism rather then realism at times, then this film is unforgettable. The aesthetics are lush and poetic, and the vignette's are touching if you allow yourself to be receptive to what Kurasawa's putting before you. The Van Gogh vignette is particularly beautiful. I've seen several Kurasawa films, enjoyed them all, but \\"Dreams\\" really captured my imagination in a very endearing way.
B00005U1YO|5.0|I have been a fan of Tom and Ed since my friend showed me the cd &quot;Dig your own hole&quot; on a campin trip with my youth group.Now till this day i am there biggest fan in georgia. When i bought this cd I was stoked. The song Come With Us at the begging just gave an awsome intro, the violin lead in building up was awsome. It Began in Afrika was great too i loved the synths. Galaxy bounch was an awsome beat, I first heard it on the movie &quot;Tomb Raider.&quot; It is a great song for bouncin down the road. Star Guitar is my favorite song the brothers have ever made. I bought the Star Guitar single as soon as it came out, and i bought American EP later that had an awsome remix of it too. The TEST was an phenomanal song for the end of the cd it had great lyrics. I strongly recommend this cd to anyone. If you dont like dance/techno i think your just another country hick without groove in this world.
6305278016|5.0|One of my favorite films--if for no other reason, it is signature Scott. However, it is a very good film all around! Douglas, Takakura and Capshaw were outstanding! Some may not like the genre or Scott, hence, some of the reviews. A caution: Be sure to read the reviewer's comments about the quality of the DVD version on down the list.
B00005NWM3|1.0|&quot;How You Remind Me&quot; is a great song, fantastic. I heard this and bought the album. It is disastrous. I tried to keep listening but I just couldn't. The vocals sound strained and inappropriate, the lyrics are awful and the sound is just an unpleasant noise. If you were thinking of buying this album based on &quot;How You Remind Me&quot;, don't bother. Find it somewhere else. &quot;Too Bad&quot; is the nearest thing to another good song, and it still isn't close.

B000003B6J|4.0|\\"Straight Outta Compton\\" was the first rap album that really blew me away.  Growing up as a white kid in the suburbs (and being part of N.W.A's core audience, as it turned out), I was familiar with rap music as a singles format (Kurtis Blow, Grandmaster Flash, Whodini, etc.)--mainly through friends and acquaintances at school who listened to it...and who sometimes even made their own demos!  <br />Anyhoo, listening to this album on tape in my room with my headphones on--so my mom couldn't hear all the cursing--I was really impressed at the explosiveness of the music and especially, N.W.A's attitude.  It had a street credibility and rebellious spirit that was sorely lacking in the cheesy hair bands of the time.  (Remember Winger, anyone?)<br />Looking back, I was simply too young and too green to comprehend the realities of the American inner city:  the drugs, the poverty, the crime, the hopelessness.  I just thought it was cool that these guys were cursing.  I had no idea that anyone (especially the FBI) would actually think this was more than music (as the murders of 2Pac and Biggie so sadly proved).<br />As music, \\"Straight Outta Compton\\" has aged since its release.  While Dr. Dre and DJ Yella certainly were innovators at the time, the beats owe a lot to Run-D.M.C. and sound a little dated.  The attitude, fortunately, has not aged a bit.  <br />The first three songs are where the bread and butter lie.  The title track is as brutal an intro as you're gonna find anywhere in popular music.  \\"F--k Tha Police\\" is a timeless classic whose harsh message about police brutality has unfortunately not diminished with time.  \\"Gangsta Gangsta\\" is a brilliantly descriptive narrative of street life.  These songs are some of the best American music ever recorded.  Period.<br />The rest of \\"Straight Outta Compton\\" is a tad checkered (which is why I only gave it 4 stars).  Out of the remaining 10 tracks:  one is solid enough to compare with the first three (\\"Dopeman\\");<br />Three are songs I love because they display N.W.A's caustic --and often hilarious--sense of humor (\\"Parental Discretion Iz Advised\\";  \\"8 Ball\\";  \\"I Ain't tha 1\\"...kudos to Ice Cube and Eazy-E on those ones); <br />One (\\"Express Yourself\\") is an inferior recording and has a subsequent remix that is better.  Look for it on the 1996 N.W.A release \\"Greatest Hits\\";<br />One is an adequate presentation of why MC Ren is called \\"the George Harrison of N.W.A\\"  (\\"If It Ain't Ruff\\");  <br />Three are boring (\\"Somethin' Like That\\"; \\"Compton's N tha House\\"; \\"Quiet on tha Set\\");  <br />And one is simply perplexing (\\"Something 2 Dance 2\\").  Can *YOU* imagine N.W.A dancing?  I can't!<br />Anyway, the meat and potatos of \\"Straight Outta Compton\\" are the first three songs.  Except for Public Enemy, you won't find more hard-hitting social commentary anywhere--even if it is of a nihilistic manner.  You also won't find any track here that explores some of the other downsides of the street life (i.e., losing loved ones to violence, court dates, incarceration, etc.), but you also won't find many other performers in popular music with the guts to tackle these issues either.<br />\\"Straight Outta Compton\\" is rude, nasty, thuggish, profane, violent, and utterly compelling.  It is the only N.W.A CD you should buy.
B000000WCA|5.0|The Spice Girls were without a doubt the most successful girl group of all-time. In July 1996, they exploded onto the pop scene with their infectious debut single Wannabe. It entered the UK singles chart at No.3, before storming to No.1 the following week...and stayed there for 7 more weeks. They accquired more popularity and recognition with the release of their debut album Spice. It topped the charts for months through November and December 1996 and on into January and February 1997 and has sold 27 million copies worldwide. Many people were quick to write the Spice Girls off as a one-hit wonder, but they actually did have some brilliant songs and definitely knew how to sell records and promote certain subjects. After four consecutive UK No.1 singles with Wannabe, Say You'll Be There, 2 Become 1 and Who Do You Think You Are/Mama, the Spice Girls went over to America, intent on storming the place - and they did.<br /><br />They officially cracked the tough American market faster than the Beatles, and within 5 months their debut album had sold more than 7 million in the US alone. They were the band that brought back pop music to the world - there would've been any Backstreet Boys, 'NSync or Britney Spears if the Spice Girls hadn't have stormed to No.1 in America with Wannabe. The thing that made the Spice Girls so popular was their individuality. Each girl had their own character and personality. There was Geri \\"Ginger Spice\\" Halliwell, the loudest and most outspoken member of the group and definitely the driving force behind the Spice Girls. There was Emma \\"Baby Spice\\" Bunton, the quiet and innocent band member. With her pigtail blonde hair, she was the cute one of the band. There was Mel \\"Scary Spice\\" B, the wacky and outrageous band member who always had an opinion on something. There was Victoria \\"Posh Spice\\" Adams, the posh one of the band who always wore her mini Gucci dresses and striked that pose. And there was Mel \\"Sporty Spice\\" C, known for her sporty attitude and tracksuit clothes. At least these girls were individual and knew what they wanted from life - unlike Westlife...wooden and two-dimensional. Some people who never got into the Spice Girls phenomenon will never truly understand how influential they were. Before the Spice Girls, I had no interest in music what-so-ever. Then, for about two years, they were all I could think about - day in, day out. This eventually led me into different musical territories such as Madonna, Britney Spears, Janet Jackson and Mariah Carey. They'll never know how much I was obssessed with them - along with every other 10 year old in the world.<br /><br />Spice begins with Wannabe (10/10). The debut single and classic pop hit Wannabe topped the charts in a whopping 31 countries worldwide and catapulted the Spice Girls into the stratosphere of worldwide popularity. The song has that one-hit wonder feel to it, but these girls were far from a one-hit wonder. Track 2 is Say You'll Be There (10/10). The second single from the Spice Girls, this song topped the charts in October 1996. The lyrics are very girl power-ish and strengthened their positive, worldwide famous message of \\"Girl Power!\\" Track 3 is 2 Become 1 (10/10). The third single from the Spice Girls and their third UK No.1. Topping the charts in December, 2 Become 1 was the UK Christmas No.1 for 1996. This beautiful ballad is one of my all-time favourite songs - I just love it. Between them, Say You'll Be There and 2 Become 1 topped the charts in a staggering 53 countries around the world. Track 4 is Love Thing (10/10). This is another traditional Spice Girls pop song. This song was never released as a single, but should've been! There's a trademark rap from Geri halfway through and the choruses are so catchy. Track 5 is Last Time Lover (10/10). This song is probably the most diverse on the album. With it's raunchy and funky R'n'B beats, this song has got to be my favourite unreleased song from Spice along with Naked.<br /><br />Track 6 is Mama (9/10). The longest track from Spice, Mama was the fourth consecutive UK No.1 single for the Spice Girls in March 1997. Being released around Mothers Day ensured another UK No.1 for the girls of the moment. Track 7 is Who Do You Think You Are (10/10). First previewed at the Brit Awards 1997, this song became an instant classic. The performance of this song at the Brits is absoltuely legendary; Geri Halliwell wearing a Union Jack mini-dress was pure class. It was perfect for the event and promoted their message of \\"Girl Power!\\" Once I saw her in that dress, I had a BIG-TIME crush on the woman for years! Track 8 is Something Kina Funny (10/10). This deep and mysterious song has a very hip and street feel to it. Mel C is superb on this song and Emma makes good use of her sweet voice towards the end. Track 9 is Naked (10/10). Oh my God! I absolutely love this song. The mid-tempo bassline with swirly beats and sultry lyrics makes this the album's best track. The Spice Girls would've received so much more credibility from the public if this song had been released. Mel C's little ditto after the phone-call is awesome too. Track 10 is If U Can't Dance (10/10). This song is superb to close such a top album. The bassline sounds like a car engine revving up - it's rather subdued so keep your ears peeled! Instead of verses, you get raps from Mel B and Geri in verses one and two respectively. This song is also a live favourite amongst fans.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />If you like pop music, this is the absolute album for you. It's such a shame that after Geri left, the Spice Girls went right down to the bottom of the pan. The Spice Girls were the biggest pop phenomenon of all-time and I'd give anything to re-live those moments and feel those feelings all over again.

B000002JS8|5.0|The eternal AC/DC debate:  which singer is better, Bon Scott or Brian Johnson?  To The Casual Listener, both men sound exactly the same (believe me, I've used the scientific method for this question on The Casual Listener).  My personal opinion is that while Brian Johnson is no slouch (witness \\"Back in Black\\") AC/DC started running out of ideas that night in February 1980 when Ronald Belford Scott passed off this mortal coil after one-too-many double shots of whiskey.<br />\\"Highway to Hell\\" is the album AC/DC was working toward their entire career up to that point.  Produced by hitmaker Mutt Lange (aka:  Mr. Shania Twain), this CD is solid from start (the anthematic, strangely prophetic title track) to finish (the lurid and controversial \\"Night Prowler\\").  <br />\\"Highway to Hell\\" really isn't any different from any other AC/DC album, except that the production is a bit cleaner and the songs are a bit catchier.  Except for the title track and \\"Girls Got Rhythm\\" (both FM rock radio standards), this CD probably has the largest collection of underrated songs in AC/DC's catalog.  <br />\\"Walk All Over You\\" shows how this Australian quintet straddled the boundary of hard rock and punk;  \\"Shot Down in Flames\\" is a humorous look at the plight of the single male;  \\"Beating around the Bush\\" is some classic Chuck Berry-on-steroids type boogie; and \\"Touch Too Much\\"--arguably the album's best song--illustrates how much Scott, and the Young brothers had grown as songwriters.<br />There is SOME filler here, but it's good filler.  \\"Get It Hot\\" and \\"If You Want Blood (You've Got It)\\" are standard, solid AC/DC stuff.  While \\"Love Hungry Man\\" is a little lame, but still 1,000 times better than what most other rock bands put out.<br />There isn't anything as catchy (or as chick-friendly) as \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\" or as guaranteed to headbang as \\"Back in Black\\".  Come to think of it, maybe THAT album is a little better than \\"Highway to Hell\\", but I'm giving the late Bon Scott hisprops anyway.<br />Tonight, I'm gonna tip a forty to my dead homie Bon.  <br />Peace.
6305841861|5.0|What can I say?This movie is truely amazing.My favorite horror movie of all time is right here.Evil Dead 2:Dead By Dawn. Whats not to like about this movie?It's got comedy,a little horror,and sweet action.Tons of decapitations with the chainsaw and tons of blasts to the head and gut with the shotgun. This movie is very unique and will be forever hailed as an awesome cult classic on my book.<br />Anyways,enough of me raving on how good this film is.Let me get to the point here in my review.Ash is back again leaving off where the 1st Evil Dead left off.A short re-cap of what happened in the first one sets off the beginning of the movie following sohrtly with Ash's 1st decapitation with the shovel only 10 min. into the movie.After that,its back to Ash alone in the cabin in the dark woods fighting off zombies and his possessed hand.<br />The movie is filled with one liners and comic parts.The part with Ash's possessed hand beating him senseless is so hilarious.I laughed and laughed.Then with Ash beating the fat old zombie lady in the cellar.That was also very funny.<br />I love seeing just an average day loser type of guy,turn into a hero but not a huge hero.A hero that isnt all to brave but nervous and frightened.If the movie was just with Ash alone in the cabin the whole movie,I'd love it still.But hey,they gotta throw in more meat for the zombies!<br />But,anyways,this movie is probably the best one in the Evil Dead trilogy.If you saw the first one and you didn't quite like it,then pick this one up.I guarantee you that you wont regret it.It's a wonderful horror/comedy/action film.Enjoy! :-)
B00006CXXU|4.0|Christina has let the little sugar pop gum filled pop music go down the drain. Her currant cd has so much emotion, and makes you want to cry. Yes, Dirtty is \\"scandelous\\" but what do you people expect comming from a 21 yr old.This album shows a more grown person who's has been emotionally rocked! [...].
B00005R24K|4.0|Here we are with Sam Raimi's kick off of the best cult classic trilogy ever made.Sam Raimi really knows how to deliver a good wholesome horror/comedy film.On a shoestring budget,Sam Raimi made Evil Dead what it is today.With claustrophobic settings and zany camera angles,has made Sam Raimi a unique film director.<br />Evil Dead is about a group of college kids that go up to a cabin for a vacation.The cabin is so eerie looking that we already get a sense of horror and disaster.As they enter and settle into the cabin,mysterious things happen.Like Ash's sister's hand getting possessed and drawing a distorted picture of The Book of the Dead,and when the cellar door msyeriously slams open.Of cours,we all know what happens,they go down the cellar,find the book of the dead,and read it.Then,after that,all the mayhem and gore of Evil Dead immediately starts.Kicking off with one of the most memorable scenes in a movie(ash's sister getting violated by the woods).<br />Through the whole movie,Ash is sort of a coward.Afraid to confront his friends,sister,and girlfriend who all turn into zombies.Heck,I would be too by the way they looked.But,hey,this is the kick off of our favorite hero Ash.I do like the fact though that Sam Raimi made Bruce Campbell's character a coward hero rather than a Bruce Willis type of brave,muscle bound hero.<br />The movie is filled with gross out gore and some comedic parts.Half the time Ash is getting slammed into a shelf on the wall or a cabinet,making it look hilarious.Even though this movie was filled with all these great things,I did think it was the worst one in the series.Don't get me wrong though,I did like it.I just thought it was more boring than the ED2 and AOD.<br />If your a big fan of cult classic horror fans,Sam Raimi,or Bruce Campbell,then rent it and dont buy it unless you like it alot or a huge fan of the 3 listed above.
B000066NW0|4.0|I've seen a lot of negative reviews about this album, and for the most part people are saying she's just another Britney Spears. Now, I can bring up several things wrong with that argument, but I can easily notice that those reviewers don't like young talent. This is fine, but then they start saying things like she's trying too much to be like Britney with her videos showing her in the mall and everything (see the \\"Complicated\\" video). What, like Britney is the only person who's allowed to go to the mall? (By the way, I don't remember Britney ever having a video that showed her in a mall.)<br />If people would just open their minds, they'll realize this is a very good album. The album starts off with songs you heard already, \\"Sk8er Boi\\", the feel-sorry-for-yourself vibe of \\"I'm With You\\", and the catchy \\"Complicated\\" (admit it). \\"Losing Grip\\" is an interesting story about her and an ex-boyfriend, and \\"Too Much To Ask\\" is introspective as well with its Sheryl Crow-esque feel. And I know the rap vibe of \\"Nobody's Fool\\" (which has a subtle sample of Wreckx-N-Effect's \\"Rump Shaker\\", which is probably a sample in itself) won't sit right with everyone, but I think it's good.<br />The only songs I would leave off this album are \\"Naked\\" (I-feel-so-naked songs are old hat) and \\"Mobile\\". But this is still a very good album if you can appreciate it.
B00007BH5C|5.0|I've been playing and playing my sound track for Fellowship of the Ring all year, and now I can alternate it with my Two Towers CD. I went whole hog and got the special version with the Farewell to Lorien bonus track as my Christmas present to me and I love this CD! <br />Since The Two Towers is essentially a continuation of the same HUGE movie, the familiar themes from the Fellowship score make for consistency and good continuity.  It's all from the same source, so I don't see any problem with Shore quoting his own earlier work. Use of leitmotifs is nothing new in music. I think Howard Shore captures the different moods of the different people of Lord of the Rings very well, and I find his score(s) very evocative of Middle Earth,alternately beautiful, stirring and sad, and sometimes all three at once.<br />  My particular favorite tracks are Evenstar for its sheer beauty, and surprisingly, Gollum's song for capturing so much of Gollum's nature although it's not a really a &quot;beautiful sounding&quot; track. Gollum is treacherous and dangerous and smelly and drives everyone mad, and yet, almost everyone who encounters him can hardly help feeling pity for his misery at some point, knowing he's very much at the mercy of his longing for the Ring. The song is packed both with Gollum's love and hatred for the Ring, and he might be singing to the Ring, to himself, or just throwing out his misery and anger to the world in general. <br />The music written for the Rohirrim is wonderfully stirring.  I can't wait to see the movie, and I'm looking forward to hearing what Howard Shore has in store for The Return of the King. If you loved the music for Fellowship, buy this CD--it's more of the same wonderful stuff and even better than the first.
B00000293E|5.0|Willie Dixon was one of the most prolific writers in Blues history. His music has been very influential on countless artists, who in turn influenced others that maybe didn't know anything about him. And his rock solid bass playing has graced many albums, and this is no exception. The amazon.com reviewer is really off the mark if he is not hearing emotion in Dixon's vocals. Yes, his vocal delivery and timbre is unique, to say the least. But, to me, that's what makes him so good. Also, the rythm section cooks! I agree with another reviewer in that this is not the kind of cd I am going to play if I'm on a date, but when I am alone, it's another story. Uncompromising and heartfelt blues. Dixon IS the blues.
0451207521|1.0|The farther I got into \\"Jackdaws,\\" the more I began to realize that this book isn't just another WWII espionage novel; it's also a mind-numbing exercise in political correctness.  The 21st century gay/lesbian/transexual agenda makes quite an in-you-face showing in this WWII spy & romance thriller.   The story would have been just as good without all the gender-bending and kink in my opinion, but I guess Follet feels his readers aren't getting enough PC indoctroncation from every other artistic medium, so he decided to make it a major theme in this novel.  Seek your reader pleasures elsewhere if you want a genuinely good WWII thriller without all the post-war prostelitizing for modern diversity.
B00005QDW1|3.0|I have a kind of love/hate with this album. I had pretty much all that ND had released (self titled, The beacon St. collection, TK, and RoS), and yes, I was horribly bummed the first time I heard &quot;Hey Baby.&quot; But, be it a conscious sellout or simply they're having fun, I have to admit that I just couldn't resist &quot;Hella Good&quot; - I love it! Because of it, I got the cd, and, it is sort of their worst overall, but not a bad one to play once in a while if you just want to have a nice time riding in the car. It is a pop/dance record with slight traces of rock and ska, as opposed to the other way around as in their previous works. I won't hate them, but they did go down a couple of notches in my book. Let's hope it was just a phase and that their next one goes back to their somewhat poppy  rock/ska/punk formula, or better yet, just plain hardcore punk-ska!!  Let's just wait and see.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This is completely different from her 1999 Genie in a Bottle CD. She co-wrote most of the songs and her lyrics are more personal and have alot more meaning unlike her buublegum pop 1st CD.      Can't Hold Us Down- a female impowerment song with a Destiny's Child attitude.       Walk Away- she sings this song with so much emotion,it's my favorite      Fighter- this song is about back stabbing friends,my 2nd favorite      Infatuation-this song has a latin beat      Loving Me For Me- good song title,but it sounds like she was making this song up as she was recording it      Impossible-Alicia Keys wrote this song,so if you like Alicia you'll love this song      Underappreciated- this song also sounds like she made it up as she was recording it      Beautiful- This song is awesome! It's about loving yourself for you and that you're beautiful no matter what they say. It made me want to cry coz it's such a beautiful song written by Linda Perry      Make Over-this is a very unique song, sounds like No Doubt      Cruz-wonderful song, but I don't know why she named it Cruz.      Soar- ok song      Get Mine,Get Yours-I hate this song. The lyrics have no thought.      Dirrty- Good song to dance to      The Voice Within- I love this song. It's all about finding yourself and life itself. Very powerful song.      I'm OK-this song is about how her Mom and herself were abused by her Dad. It's a very sad,real,thoughtful song.      Keep on Singin My Song- has the same message as the song Beautiful,but it's not as good.
B00005JL78|5.0|For once, the Amazon critics have it right. Tnis movie ranks with Bladerunner, Vanilla Sky, and the underrated A-I. ESPECIALLY Bladerunner (add in Dark City). It has the same impersonal dismal vision of the future.<br />I was never a Tom Cruise fan. He was always the romantic pretty boy. But his last two movies, Vanilla Sky and now Minority Report, have made me a fan. And I have always liked a good Spielberg film. This film is not just a great expo for Spielberg special effects, it is a great thriller a la Hitchcock.<br />Set in 2054, murders are elinated due to `precogs' seeing the future. Max Von Sydow is the head of the Precog corporation (in typical Von Sydow style). Cruise is the Chief of the crew that prevents these murders before they happen, and the movie takes off when he becomes the target of one of these `visions'. He has to overcome incredible odds to prove he wasn't going to commit the murder the precog's predicted.  But, TRUST ME, there is SO much more to the action than this short synopsis. I left it this way on purpose. If I tell all, it will ruin the effect of the movie.<br />About the cinematography...this is a dark film, and the whole movie is shot in near black and white. All the hues are toned down, and this sets the mood for the futuristic attitude (much like M. Night Shaymalan's Unbreakable) showing that there is no individuality. The fururistic vision of personalized advertising via retinal scanning is absolutely scary. I guarantee I will close my eyes in the future...<br />The sound is GREAT (for those of us with DTS). You hear rain drops to the side, and bubbles from the precog tank to the left. Absolutely SUPERB.<br />This is one of the best sci-fi thrillers I have seen this year. Again, this is not just a sci-fi movie. This is an excellent murder mystery not to be ignored.<br />If you have read my reviews in the past, you know I don't review poor films. Trust me, you will want to see this movie. I mean it.
B000075BFK|5.0|this is a tite album from tupac. His lyrics are hot!!! listen to the lyrics. actually, i think it would be much better if they didnt change the tracks but even though they did its still good. if they included the original tracks i would give this a hundred stars if i could.  The lyrics are the only reason i bought this. the best rapper of all time still lives on. rest in peace 2pac.
B000002BQK|3.0|as popular as she is, Mariah is not R&amp;B and never will be.  her vocal range, though exquisite is best left to ballads and laid-back tunes.  her forays into hip-hop are a mostly a joke, and i think she knew it, hence her 'sabbatical'...<BR>Mariah is an excellent vocalist, butif you are looking for R&amp;B, look somewhere else.
B0000255CL|5.0|Immortal is so good. I bought this album today, and this is after my opinion a little better than \\"Battles in the north\\".

I think SOND is the best immortal cd i have right now, but if u like to get chills and get cold over ur body, this is the cd for you!!!
B00005JKZT|2.0|The Two Towers had fantastic cinematography and effects, just like the first; however, it seriously deviates from the book. Now I know that a movie can't follow any book exactly and I was impressed with how 'The Fellowship of the Rings' was amazingly close to the book. But the Two Towers takes some of the most key events, characters, and relationships and totally changes them around. The first movie did not.<br />Great action... I think parts would be hard to follow for someone who hasn't read the books. There were some serious director liberties taken in this movie... many, many more than the previous. Some major events resembled the book. Others were totally changed and made less effective. Readers of the books who liked the first movie will be seriously disappointed with this movie. Too bad. :(.
0380973650|5.0|I loved this book.  The whole concept is fascinatng.  When early immigrants came to this country from overseas, they brought the gods of their myths and folklore with them, and those gods are living among us.  Some of them even getting into bar room brawls and the like.  This book had me alternately laughing out loud and scratching my head wondering what kind of mind had created this book. (I have since read other Gaiman novels, and now I understand completely.)<br />The end may have been mildly lackluster, but still I found it to be a provocative, absorbing, and very worthwhile read.
B00005JKG7|5.0|The Fog is number one in my book. John Carpenter put forth his best effort with this under rated classic. I was 16 when this film came out and I made my mom take me to see it. My home town was very strict with it's \\"R\\" ratings. Needless to say I was on the edge of my seat. I have a VHS copy of this film but it's not the same. It can't capture the widescreen angles of the original film. The township of Antonio Bay prepares to celebrate it's 100th anniversery when it becomes known to the local preacher, Father Malone(Hal Holbrook)that this township was bought with the blood of a group of sailors who were lead to thier deaths by the six founders of Antonio Bay. \\"Six Must Die\\" says the little piece of driftwood. Once the fog rolls in hold onto your seats. One of the things John Carpenter has been known for is his use of the same actors. Jamie Lee Curtis was also in three of the Halloween movies. Films today go for special effects to get chills. The Fog gives them to you the way Alfred Hitchcock did it. With suspence. The scene where the dead sailors go after Adriene Barbeau's son is a prime example of this long dead style of film making. If a good horror flick without all the blood and guts is what your after then The Fog will give you your money's worth.

B00005JLRR|3.0|If Paramount executives thought that this film would attract more than the usual Trek fan base, they will be sorely disappointed. The movie features good acting from Stewart and Hardy, a decent Goldsmith score, state-of-the-art effects, but the story is somewhat recycled from earlier films in the franchise.<br />Yeah, it works for Bond, but Trek was always more about originality. Sadly, while enjoyable, \\"Nemesis\\" brings nothing new to the table, with the exception of the Picard-Shinzon connection.<br />But, loyalty is hard to break; thus, I will be buying the DVD, reported to have some additional footage.

B00005JKZT|5.0|As every one knows the Two Towers starts where The Fellowship of the Ring left off.  What you may not know if you have not seen it yet is that it is a darker film than the first.  Hope seems to be ebbing away from our heroes.  It is much like Empire Strikes Back in that regard.  But like the great George Lucas says \\"You can't have a happy and exuberant second act.  In the first act you introduce the characters and in the second act you put the characters into the worst possible situation they could ever be in...\\" Frodo and Samwise appear to have the hardest time in the second film.  The ring's powers are slowly taking over Frodo who is as helpless to stop it as he is to abandon his quest.   He is starting to change into a different hobbit all together.  In a twist of irony the duo must trust Gollum to lead them deeper into Mordor.  I must say that I enjoyed watching Gollum.  In the books Gollum was a completely evil character with his own designs on the \\"Precious\\".  But Peter Jackson actually brought some humanity into the character.  You begin to see in Frodo a little of Gollum as the quest marches on.  But, you can also see a little of Frodo in Gollum as well.  It is a striking reminder that we all have these elements in us and that it is our choices that define our lives and who and what we become.  Frodo started out as our hero but it is starting to appear that Sam will be the true hero before the quest is over.  The entire cast gives a brilliant performance and once again the cinematography is truly stunning.  Definitely not to be missed!!

B0000696I0|1.0|Uhhhh... This movie is \\"bad\\"! I loved the first one and I used to love 2 but now that I'm over the age of 7.. what a horrible movie. Way too cartoonish. The first fight scene had a whole bunch of dumb jokes and after every time a turtle would hit a guy they would make a dumb coment like \\"awesome\\". Then the whole Vinilla Ice thing at the end... HORRIBLE. The way the beat the 2 bad guys mutants was by spraying a fire exsting. in their mouth which made the 2 mutants turn back into their regular selves. I mean how could the makers of the movie do this to the TMNT fans? If I met the makers of TMNT 2 I would slap them in the face! TMNT 3 was better then 2 but... WHY DID THEY GO BACK IN TIME TO JAPAN? STUPID! STUPID! STUPID! I hope someday there's a TMNT 4 that is like the original where it's darker and like the comic, now that would be amazing.
0066214122|5.0|First of all, I don't understand why people are calling this book Crichton's worst, and why one of the other reviewers thought Timeline was horrible. Let me say this. This is book is wonderful, I was hooked immediately, and finished it in a day and a half. Some people just must not have the power to appreciate good literature. Crichton, you never fail to amaze me.
B00005JLRR|5.0|I may be a little partial in this review since I am a huge fan of Star Trek, especially TNG, but I must say it was an excellent movie. If this is the last movie with the cast of Next Generation, what an ending. Fantastic final journey. <br />Everyone who's ever watched the series has come to expect only the best from this cast.  And this was no exception. Quite possibly the best Star Trek movie to date. <br />First, the entire cast is present to take the part in this adventure, including Mr.Crusher, who has a cameo in the beginning of the film. <br />Second, the story line is brilliant. It is a lot richer complemented by excellent performances.  One to mention here would be Tom Hardy portraying Praetor Shinzon, one of the best villains the crew of Enterprise had to face. After all we are all used to seeing brilliant performances from Patrick Stewart and Brent Spiner.<br />Visual effects and action scenes are excellent, as expected. But not to be misleading, Enterprise does not blow up everything that comes across. <br />Only down side was an extraordinarily fast pace of the movie. Filmmakers must have been determined to keep this movie under 2 hr.  Lets hope all deleted material will be present on DVD. <br />All an all, great movie with great ending. Simplicity of the ending is probably what made it so good. Too bad it was released less then a week before Two Towers. ...
B00003CXXP|1.0|This has to be the worst movie ever made, and certainly the worst movie I've ever seen. This is the kind of movie that will make one want to throwselves into an open grave; it's really that bad. It's been nearly two years since I went to see it on a hot, rainy day, and I still regret those 2+ agonizing hours of my life I wasted sitting there watching this. One thing that I can say about this movie without hesitation is that it could very well change your view on life; I don't care how you think about life-this movie will darken your view of life as a whole definitely a little if not a lot. In it, you see Haley Joel Osment trying to find his &quot;mother&quot; and a way to turn into a &quot;real boy&quot;. MAKE ME A REAL BOY! Near the end, you'll be screaming at the top of your lungs, &quot;Make him a real boy already!&quot; One thing must be said though, Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law were excellent in this picture, and certainly robbed at the Oscars. That still doesn't make up for AI as a movie. Throughout the darkness, disgustingness, and greyness of this horribly depressing film, the only thing that will keep you watching is the hope of a happy ending. THERE IS NO HAPPY ENDING! I wish I'd listened to the reviews I read in the newspaper. For once, the critics really were right about something.
B00000163G|5.0|This Cd from start to finish is the best rap cd that i have ever heard. Any of the 20+ songs included in this double cd are masterpieces. I can listen to this cd for the rest of my life.
B00000ILLT|5.0|Enya is one of of the most mysterious singers in music today. I consider her to be one of the few female singers who in my opinion can still make some great angelic melodies that don't sound banal or cheap even though some of her songs are so short as to be almost like unfinished demo tapes( Will she someday produce and compose a song that is about eight ot nine minutes long). The Memory Of Trees is my second favorite CD of hers behing Watermark which I consider to be her strongest outing to date. I doubt Enya will topple Watermark to tell you the truth.<br />Many people say that this is a sunny album. Well, it is kind of true. The sunniness is evidenced on the title track, Anywhere Is, and the Orinoco Flow-esque On My Way Home. Generally I think of this album as an album for a cloudy, romantic autumn evening with the leaves a bright red, orange and yellow. Several songs are quite dark and cloudy but not stormy like let's say Storms In Africa, Exile, or creepy like Evening Falls. This album is a gorgeous musical journey that trancends boundaries. I find this to be like the darker companion to the sunniness of A Day Without Rain which followed this one five years later.<br />I usually go with the darker material that Enya does but I enjoy the brighter material as well( I love music that is dark and stormy).<br />The title track is a gorgeous instrumental that has Enya returning to the days of the Celts CD. Instead of the usual piano instrumental that introduced us to Watermark, Shephard Moons, and A Day Without Rain we get a song that is more synthesized and with thundering beats to bop your head to combined with Enyas multilayered vocals that starts out as a cloudy minor note and after about 30 seconds it morphs into a major note to give an impression of the sun shining through the clouds on a warm autumn afternoon. This song is more similar to the Celts than the piano instrumentals of most of her albums although this song is much brighter than the Celts title track. Anywhere Is is like the blueprint of Enyas big-selling A Day Without Rain. It's a very bright, sunny song with rhythm that could make you almost bop your head along with. This song is more legato although there are hints of the staccato pizzicato strings that would dominate a lot of Enyas A Day Without Rain. I love the quiet middle part of the song. It kind of reminds me of the quiet bridge of Orinoco Flow a few years before then. After the sunniness we head into darker, mistier territory of Pax Deorum. This song is another dark almost Gothic piece that features Enya singing in Latin with a very misty feel. In the middle of the song the rhythm pauses and the sing becomes a major note for about a minute giving an imression of the sun breaking through the dark clouds. I consider this to be Enyas best 'Gothic' song to this day. It's almost like the darker side of Heaven if you could call it that. The song reverts back into a dark misty minor note song. Athair Ar Neamh is a very sad, cloudy evening song that features Enya singing in Gaelic. This song is a very beautiful, theme for a guy who is having a lonely summer. The song ends in a major note key like the sun breaking out just before it goes down. From Where I am is a beautiful piano instrumental. China Roses is a gorgeous, breathtaking, ambient song that made me get this album. It's one of Enyas most stunning compositions to date in my opinion. China Roses is a very romantic song that brings up images two lovers walking alongside the waterfront with the red leaves falling onto the surface of a pond with a large garden of roses and a huge crystal castle in the background. China Roses is one of Enyas most brilliant songs to this day. This song is the winner on the Memory Of Trees. Hope Has A Place is a another beautiful song that is similar to China Roses although not quite as powerful or mind- stimulating but still great. This song is a song about how hope is still existant even in bleak situations. This song reminds me of How Can I Keep From Singing from Shepard Moons. Tea-House Moon is one of the best Enya instrumentals I have ever listened to. It's a very stunning song with high pitched synths in the background with electronic synths in the foreground. This song is one to enjoy when it's cloudy and the red leaves are falling to the ground. This song is one of my favorites off this CD. Once You Had Gold is one song that you probably shouldn't play if you have not had much sleep because it's one song that will sooth your soul. I fell asleep in class a few times in the past listening to this song *giggles*. This song though is great though. I enjoy it alot on a cloudy evening. La Sonadora is a very haunting song that features Enya singing in Spanish. This song is very dark and spooky although not stormy or scary as let's say Exile, Storms In Africa or the dynamite Na Leatha Geal M'Oige but this song is one of the darker songs off this album. The chants remind me a bit of Smaointe from a decade ago. We brighten up again with the closing track On My Way Home. This song that contains many elements of the 1988 hit Orinoco Flow although not as spooky as that one. This song is much brighter than Orinoco and happier. This song is like the predecessor to the brightness of A Day Without Rain that followed this one five years later...<br />I consider this to be one of Enyas strongest albums to date. Only Watermark surpasses this one and it's not by too much. I strongly recommend that all Enya fans buy this amazing masterpiece.

B000000W5L|5.0|This is one of perhaps three or four Rolling Stones albums that is truly a cut above the rest. No slick production, few asinine lyricisms, no teeny-bopper &quot;naughtiness&quot; involved.<br />Anyone who feels this album is overrated need only consult the ratings for &quot;Tatoo You&quot; and &quot;It's only Rock N Roll&quot; to feel immediately chastised. <BR> <BR>   Many people have a problem with the sloppy, slouchy, muddy, ambient sound of the album, but there is nothing to be done about it except to admit it adds to the atmosphere. Jagger's vocals, too often overemphasized, are forced to take a back seat to the superb instrumentalism of this album.<br />  If &quot;Start Me Up&quot; and &quot;Beast of Burden&quot; are your favorite Stones singles, you will hate this album with a passion, as it is the antithesis of those throw-away songs.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Early 70's Neil Young meets Pink Floyd meets Bob Dylan, and Beck joins the fray for an ear shattering mix.  A must have for any fan of good music, regardless of preferred genre.  Go out and buy this, and any album that Jeff Tweedy is involved with.  Easily the best, most complete album released this year.  Cover to cover it is great.  Not a weak track here.
B00005ABX0|5.0|VEGETABLES. what a wonderful surreal song. Paul McCartney rhytmically chomps on celery in this moving and beautiful hymn to edible crops and their enjoyment.
6303314015|5.0|Whenever I am asked what a few of my favorite movies are, THE LION KING is always one of the first that come to my mind.  I'm generally not a huge animated movie fan, but this movie is simply irrisistable!  When I saw the opening scene in theaters I knew it would be a great movie- but it was fantastic, my words at the end were just &quot;. . . WOW!&quot;  With it's breathtaking animation and intriguing story, this movie is appealing to all audiences.  The realistic characters and jokes that will make even the adults laugh out loud add to the charm and beauty of this film.  I've heard the opinion that this movie can be too intense for younger audiences, but I have to say that the children this is reffering to must be VERY young or VERY easily upset.  I took my little sister and a buch of her friends to this movie (they were in the 4-6 age range) and not one of them were in the least bit tramautized- and couldn't find anything bad to say about it, for that matter.  The sad sequences in this movie are very touching and depressing, but that's what makes this a good animated film.  No magic spells or fairy dust, Mufasa is dead; welcome to the REAL world.  The powerful sequence at the end when the spirit of Mufasa breifly visits Simba in a time of distress gives us all hope and show us that our loved ones will always be watching over us.  This amazing video would be a great addition to any collection, but as the DVD is coming out soon, you may want to hold out and just go rent it! :-)  (p.s. this is to be re-release in Christmas 2002 on IMAX theaters, so if you need some extra encouragement, go see it!)
0486278077|5.0|Gray is a beautiful young man who after seeing his portrait wishes that the painting ages rather than his own face. Initially innocent he is corrupted by Henry Wotton his supposed friend, a devoutly immoral character who leads Dorian Gray into a truly sinful existance.<br />By chance Gray discovers his wish came true and the portrait not his own face is aged by his lifestyle, but when he sees the extent to which the image has been ravaged he wishes to recinde the wish. Wilde illustrates the ugly side of our natures and shows there is always a price to pay for it despite the public face presented to the world. Despite the dark message, the biting wit and sarcasm keep the reader amused as well as disturbed, leaving me with a somewhat guilty feeling if I should laugh while reading it (which I often did). The interesting thing is the author does not take a moral stance, maybe because of the life he led himself. Although Wild's only novel and not overly long, it is a truly great work. For the wit alone and a lifetimes worth of quotations it is essential reading.
B00005JKZT|5.0|Peter Jackson has done it again! He has outdone himself on the Two Towers. This is a must see movie especially if you followed The Fellowship of the Ring. I am a big fan of the books and I must admit that Jackson tries to stay as true to the books as possible. Who knew that Gimli the dwarf was a comediene? How about Gollum and his split personality? The closer he gets to Mordor the weirder Frodo gets. And Sam? well he is  just Sam. Treebeard was quite a spectacle too. Merry and Pippin really got his ire up showing him the trees sauruman destroyed. I would recomend this movie to anyone. My best friend's 8 year old son went with us and he loved it and kept up with it. Go see it you will love it too.
B00006V9A0|1.0|I saw the tracks on this CD and thought I was in for some great content, but was wrong. It is like the CD is mixed by some bootlegger selling copies on the curb. For one some of the sound quality of the tracks are [bad]. The other thing that [made me upset] was the fact that they just threw in songs taken right off the Unplugged album, just to fill in the last 3 tracks and other tracks on the album too. And they didn't even put them in order that they came in for the Unplugged album. So you'll hear the audiance clapping, or someone talking, and they will get cut off. This is an album that was slapped together in less than a minute...
B000063JDE|5.0|That line of dialogue from David Lynch's unquestioned masterpiece BLUE VELVET describes Lynch's film universe perfectly.  With the new SPECIAL EDITION dvd out we truly get a glimpse inside the making of a great film and how it can immediately be misunderstood by someone like Roger Ebert.  The behind the scenes documentary is great with interviews from many of the film participants.  To enter the world of David Lynch is to cross into an unknown vortex of subconscious desires, fears, and dreams.  The film brilliantly shows us the illusion of the perfect smalltown life vs. the city underworld right next door.  The images stay with you long after the movie is over.  Dennis Hopper is absolutely perfect in a harrowing, funny, and brutal psychopath filled with self loathing and anger.  I just saw a revival showing at a theater in Los Angeles and I highly recommend to anyone to see it in a theater if possible.  On the big screen the movie envelops you into its world from which there is no escape.  BLUE VELVET is definitely not for everyone, and that's ok.  Lynch wasn't trying to make a film for the masses, but rather as a complete personal expression in the movie art form.
0066214122|5.0|After the last few disappointing novels, I was worried that this might be another hack-made-for-movie book.  But, it is much more than that.  My eyes are blurry, since I read this in one sitting. I couldn't put it down and it scared me to death. I had heard something about nanotechnology, but really didn't understand its potential implications. Jack Forman the leading character has depth. There are the usual Crichton precocious kids, but he doesn't use them to explain the science...thank goodness. A few of the other leading characters are cardboard, but it is with reason.
B00005ATQD|2.0|I love Stanley Kubrick's work. He is one of the best director's in the history of film. With a ten-year abscence I was one of the first to see this film on its opening night, never have I entered a film with more anticipation. I wanted to like this film and went to work immeidately in watching it. But it fails... <br />The problem is simply the editing and the pace of the movie. It is beautifully shot, the acting is fine, the story itself has much potential but its execution is horrible. Like it or not, editing is the backbone of all film and a failure in this area breaks the spin of a film. At around three hours, I found myself sitting there half-way through wondering to myself, why didn't he tighten that scene up, he could have shaved a minute off of that, he could have cut that scene.  <br />I also think that Tom and Nicole worked against him in this movie. Not because their acting was poor but because of thier movie star status, could anyone at any point in the film forget they were watching Tom and Nicole, the then famous Hollywood couple. I could not be drawn into thier characters and a couple of unknown actors may have helped the immersion into the story. <br />I would have liked to give the movie 2 and a half stars but I had to round down. We expect much more from Stanley Kubrick and he is judged more harshly because of his stature. There are several scenes that stick out and make it a worthwhile watch for Kubrick fans. I have since revisted it and it has come to grow on me a bit but still, I can not embrace it or recomend it to anyone but the most loyal Kubrick fans. <br />There is one scence where Nicole is sitting on the toliet as they prepare to leave for a party, classic Kubrick but at the same time, one truly feels he was creatively consitpated with his last work.
B000069AUI|5.0|This CD is a fabulous listen. Coldplay has certainly become a voice for many disenfranchised music lovers, who have been beaten over the head with mindlessly stupid, studio manufactured, record company financed music no-talents. Coldplay has infinitely more credibility in Chris Martin's pinky than the entire conglomerate of plasticness of today's so-called pop stars (Twain, Dion, Madonna, Lopez et.al).<br />It is incredibly refreshing to hear lyrics that actually have weight, meaning and purpose. It is heartening to hear real, satisfying music instead of bells and whistles to hide shortcomings in the talent and that amplify the gross incompetence of the performer.<br />People who have taken potshots at this group, comparing them to Radiohead and Travis, chastising them for sounding too much, or not sounding enough like them, and calling their music 'wuss rock' are way off track in their commentary. You can't compare music this good with anything out there today. It is fresh, original, socially-biting and alive.<br />Every song on this CD has it's own merits. The leadoff, \\"Politik\\", with it's spacey music and in your face lyrics is perfect. The hit single \\"In My Place\\" is smart and bright. The jazzy title track is a nice change of pace. \\"The Scientist\\" is one of the best saddest songs I have ever heard - just brilliant. The greatness continues with \\"Clocks\\", with it's trippy magnificence. There is not one single flaw on this recording. Everything fits and sounds as it should. Chris Martin is at his vocal best and the band is once again superb.<br />There can be no denying quality such as this. They have helped redefine the British rock sound and have made it their own. My only hope is that they don't follow in the footsteps of The Verve and Radiohead and break up or experiment to the point of redundancy, respectively. Along with \\"Parachutes\\", Coldplay is highly, highly recommended. First rate.
B000060P79|5.0|This CD is really great.  The thing that first caught me was Simple Plan's harmonies, and Pierre's AMAZING vocals.  wow.  A lot of the songs are talking about teenage situations. When I first heard the band, I was thinking that I loved the sound, but the whole teen thing was weird.  I mean, &quot;I'm just a kid&quot;?  Being that I'm 21, and not in high school anymore.  lol.  So I did a little research, and all of the members of the band are either my age, or older!  So I guess I don't have to sneak around listening to this anymore. ;)  My favorite song is &quot;Perfect.&quot;
B00005JKZT|4.0|I just saw this movie yesterday and decided to writer a review on it. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers continues where the first one left off, the Fellowship is broken and now they continue different ways. Frodo and Sam are making their way towards Mordor to try to get rid of the ring. Mary and Pippin have been captured by a band of Urak-Hai, Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn from where they left off from the last movie are going to try to rescue Mary and Pippin. <br />Now not already known from the LAST movie. <br />When seeing the two towers I was often breathtaken by it but...It lacked when compared to the first movie. It seems as if the \\"Chemistry\\" between the actors was not there. There were glimpses   of it, such as when Frodo and Sam ask if people will write stories about them later on, it felt just like it used to, the relationship between each other. Probably the main reason was that much of the movie was made on blue screen. Another thing that made me slightly angry was that they completely ... up Faramir. In the movie he seemed FAR too much like Boramir. I think they took too much liberty when writing the script because they completely messed up how he found out about the ring and how he treated them. In the book he treated them as guests, but still prisoners, but he treated them with respect. Eventually he gets curious and asks them what they were doing there, and they get into a verbal sparring match that lasts for hours, and eventually Sam finds lets it out. Later on even though it's against the laws of his people he lets them go from the Hide Out.<br />But...In the movie he treats them as prisoners yes, but it seems just as prisoners. There wasn't the respect that he had in the book. He finds out about the ring from Gollum in the movie. Big \\"no no\\". And then he takes them to (I've gone blank) \\"The City\\", again, in the book they never visit it, which kind of screws up the plot line.<br />There were many good things though. The Ents were PERFECT! \\"We have decided that you are not orcs. Gollum was just plain amazing, the anamation AND the voice. The battle of helms deep sucked you right in, and Frodo saying that he believes Smeegle (Gollum) can come back was just heartwarming.<br />Except for the bad points mentioned above, very good.<br />Four stars!
B00006G8HX|4.0|With the death of Spock at the end of the last picture, and his funeral in the Mutara Nebula, now quickly forming a planet in the wake of the Genesis device, an enormous chapter in the Star Trek Universe has ended. . . Or has it?   The movie pits the crew of the Enterprise verses a rather rowdy group of Klingons, bent of obtaining information from the Genesis Project, which the Klingons see as the ultimate doomsday weapon, and against Starfleet, unwilling to let Kirk go back to Genesis to recover the body of his lifelong friend.  And to top it all off, Dr. McCoy seems to be losing his faculties, when it is realized that he is the unknowing carrier of Spock's soul.  <br />This movie is pretty good.  Christopher Lloyd was a pretty good, rather pale, Klingon.  The crew of the Enterprise has always been a tight-knit group, but their utter dedication to one another is paramount in this film.  They are willing to fight and die for one another.  <br />Robin Curtis takes over the role of Lieutenant Savak, played previously by Kirstie Alley.  It is an improvement in my eyes.  Ms. Alley was good, but not quite \\"Vulcan\\" enough for me.  A great deal happens in this film that shapes the course of Star Trek films to come, it is definitely needed to understand how the events at the beginning of Star Trek IV.  <br />Leonard Nimoy sat in the directors chair for \\"The Search For Spock.\\"  It was strange not to see Spock as a main role along Kirk, Mccoy, and Scotty.  But, the movie is good, and fun to watch.  <br />epc
B000075BFK|5.0|I absolutely love this CD, and in fact havn't stop playin it since I got it, but I'm not a new pac fan, I've got all his Cd's and I love em all, I just wish suge would stop trying to kill his music, Nas w/ pac, <BR>and I have no doubt that suge had something to do with the remix of me and my girlfriend,<BR>but hey we all have this one chance to see if pac's alive or dead, because there's no way pac would let Jay-Z get away with that, so If he dies mysteriously, pac's alive, if he lives, pac's dead, either way doesn't matter, he'll always be remembered, WESTSIDE, Haha
B00006CXXU|5.0|...I have to say something.<BR>...<BR>2) There's only one song of the album that actually talks about being a girl who goes out and have some fun just like guys do, and that's Dirrty...<BR>3) Her CD is everything but boring, it includes all varieties of music, so that any lovers of any music genre can easily get into this music.<BR>Also, there might be some pop influenced music like Cruz, can't hold us down, and so on, but this album definitely includes powerful soul&RnB songs such as Walk away, impossible. <BR>...
0385508417|1.0|I was so disappointed in this book.  I saved it until closer to Christmas, wanting to read a holiday book.  But this book does NOT feel like a holiday book at all.  I couldn't find anything to like about any of the characters.  Everyone in this book spends FAR too much time worrying about what everyone else does and what everyone else thinks of them.  Grow up and stop worrying about that garbage!<br />It was also very predictible.  I just kept waiting and wondering which little hitch would cancel the cruise plans.  And the way it was done was ridiculous -- if your daughter is old and mature enough to got to another country AND be engaged, she's old enough to handle the fact that her parents (GASP!) made plans without her.  The idea that she could never find out that they had planned to skip Christmas and go on a cruise was ridiculous.  Aren't parents allowed to have lives away from their grown children?<br />Skip this one!  Maybe Grisham should stick to lawyers?

6301930827|5.0|I have for a long time been a fan of apocalyptic, WW3-type thrillers, and this HBO Original tops my list as one of the best ever!  Based on the novel Trinity's Child by William Prochnau and starring Powers Boothe and Rebecca DeMornay, By Dawn's Early Light is an excellent cautionary tale of what would happen if a nuclear exchange were started by dissidents in another country's military and how the members of two different governments would work together to stop it.  It is also the tale of Captain Moreau (DeMornay) and Cassidy (Boothe), two B-52 pilots assigned to knock out the leadership bunkers of the Russian military, and their struggle to do what they believe is the right thing.  At first they feel themselves bound by duty to their country, but as they begin to grasp the full scope of just what it is they're doing, each of them must struggle with their own doubts and fears about what would happen if the conflict they're involved in were to escalate into an all-out war.<br />Boothe and DeMornay are just two of a very great cast in this film.  Martin Landau turned in a bravura performance as the President of the United States, who is disabled in the aftermath of a nuclear strike on Washington and who alone holds the key to stopping the conflict.  I loved Darren McGavin's trigger-happy Secretary of the Interior who, thinking the President is dead, issues orders that could lead to the destruction of his country.  James Earl Jones was great as \\"Alice\\", commander of Strategic Air Command's \\"Looking Glass\\" plane and a man with moral and ethical doubts of his own about this conflict, and Ally McBeal's Peter MacNicol as Sedgwick, the young Emergency War Orders officer who is with the President when he is injured, was just terrific.  I also want to give a nod to Daniel Benzali as Bascombe, director of the FEMA bunker at Olney.  Although his was a minor role, he made the most of it.<br />As stated before, this is a superb film, but it's definitely not for the faint-hearted.  It probes deeply into the American psyche and forces us all to think of just what we would do in a situation such as the one presented.  Overall, though, it is an excellent film.It probes deeply into the American psyche and forces us all to think of just what we would do in a situation such as the one presented.

B0000640VO|5.0|Last Year's Amelie is plainly put one of the best films ever made. The whimisical blend of picturesque colors vigorating music, vibrant characters, and a beautiful plot. Audre Tutow plays the whimsical Amelie who goes on a personal oddesy following the death of Princess Diana and an encounter which effects everyone. The movie is beatifully filmed with several insightful and amusing.<br />The DVD has several great special features ranginf from outtakes from the cast, The screen tests, interviews and commentary by writer/director Jean-Pierre-Jennet as well as great segments on the Art of Amelie and Theatrical Trailers.<br />This is the perfect gift to any fan of french cinema or for anyone who likes movies
B00005RDSM|5.0|If you don't currently own Peter Pan, and love the movie, you still have time to buy it on video and dvd. But hurry up because Peter Pan and along with Beauty and the Beast, Beauty and the Beast The Enchanted Christmas and Return to Neverland are going out of stock on 1/31/03. Along with some other titles. Whether you believe it or not that Peter Pan's voice died in 1968 because he had been abusing himself and his body was founde by kids playing in an abanded village bulding but I think it took sometime to to discover he was the voice of Peter Pan.
0066214122|4.0|Michael Cricton's story telling pattern is pretty predictable. His story line is rooted in modern research, (how many other fictional thriller novel's do you know that end with an appendix of cited sources), where the outcome is carried to a plausible fictional extreme and wrapped up in a tightly told tale of adventure and mystery. Not that this is bad thing, this pattern offers plenty of room to write original story lines, and in the end Crichton knows how to spin a great yarn. This book brings together nano-technology, computer software and gnome technology. I didn't find this book as good as TimeLine, which was a great book, quite similar to DoomsDay in many regards, but much tighter to read. Nonetheless I enjoyed this book as a quick read, a brief past-time pause, like a cool lemonade on a hot day, refreshing even though it doesn't last that long.[...]
B000006OAM|5.0|I bought this CD yesterday and am glad that I did. I have heard &quot;Kind &amp; Generous&quot; on the radio and thought, &quot;that was a catchy song.&quot; <BR>As soon as I heard the first notes and lyrics to &quot;Ophelia,&quot; I was hooked. &quot;Life Is Sweet&quot; is a good song but a little repetitive at the end. I guess the thing I like about this CD is the chord progressions on it. On &quot;Ophelia&quot; the progressions are unexpected. Overall, it's just a great album. I suffer from depression so, I like this soothing music with it's beautiful piano and orchestration. To those of you who gave it 1 out of 5 stars, it is something for the soul to ponder over, it is not one of those albums that every song is a radio single. I get the feeling that when Natalie wrote the songs, she had something to say and she was not being egotistical at all, but rather subtly telling us that everything was going to be ok. I think my favorite song is &quot;King Of May&quot; because of her beautiful voice and the lyrics. Just buy this and don't even bother to read any of the 1 out of 5 star reviews as they all are wrong.
B00007BH5C|5.0|The Two Towers is an excellent follow-up soundtrack to The Fellowship of the Ring.  Many of the familiar themes from The Fellowship of the Ring appear on this cd.  The Two Towers soundtrack gets your imagination soaring.  For the many Tolkien fans out there, The Two Towers soundtrack makes use of the Elvish languages of Sindarin and Quenya.  There are powerful choral pieces on this cd.  I would recommend it to any Lord of the Rings fan!
B00005JKZT|5.0|That basically much sums up \\"The Two Towers\\", which is the next chapter in J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy novel, as well as director, Peter Jackson's, film version.<br />PLOT SUMMARY: This chapter, contrasted to \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\", is a much darker, more twisted, and evil chapter. The film follows three main subplots: Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) and Sam Gamgee's (Sean Astin) journey through Mordor to Mount Doom; Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), and Legolas's (Orlando Bloom) hunt for the Orcs, which later into the story, turns into a huge battle; and Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin's (Billy Boyd) escape from the Orcs and meeting a giant-talking tree, Treebread (also voiced by John Rhys-Davies). Saruman the White (Christopher Lee) has turned more evil and powerful, and wants nothing more than the Ring, which of course, is what Frodo has. He creates an evil army set out to destroy all the men of Middle-Earth. Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) has also returned, and sets out to help Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas. Aragorn believes the three should help the people of Middle-Earth. When they sought out Theoden, King of Rohan (Bernard Hill), Aragorn urges the old king to persue war against the Ugluk, Saruman's followers, even though there are not enough men left to fight. The Ugluk are getting closer to the castle where the people are staying, and there's no stopping them. So King Theoden finally agrees, and a huge battle begins. Also, while all this is going on, Aragorn is introduced to Eowyn (Miranda Otto), who is Theoden's daughter. Aragorn and Eowyn are attracted to each other, but Aragorn tries to keep his promise to Arwen (Liv Tyler), who has decided to go and help her people, after a lecture from her father, Lord Elrond (Hugo Weaving), about sacraficing her life to become mortal. Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam seem to be lost finding their way to Mordor. No sooner can you say, \\"my precious\\", than are they encountered by Gollum (voiced by Andy Serkis), who has been following them all this time, attracted to the Ring. Sam notices that Frodo has been starting to fall under the evil spell of the Ring, and tries to keep Frodo grounded, especially after Frodo takes the risk of letting Gollum guide them to the gates of Mordor. The final subplot consists of Merry and Pippin, who manage to escape the Orcs after they are attacked by a group of men. They escape into the dark forest, and come across a talking and moving tree, called Treebread. Treebread is from a species known as the Ents, and as he carries them through the forest, Treebread mentions that there are not many Ents left, for Saruman's slaves have been cutting them down. Merry and Pippin at first want to go home back to the Shire, but then they realize that if they don't go and help their companions, then the Shire may be no more when they get there. So they end up persuing Treebread and the rest of the Ents to fight Saruman, which starts a battle all on it's own.<br />OVERALL THOUGHTS: Unlike \\"The Fellowship\\", \\"The Two Towers\\" has more complex plots, which can be confusing if you haven't seen the first film, and they do not go into detail about how the Ring became an evil source of power, also like they did in the first one. I guess Peter Jackson expects that most of the people who go to see \\"The Two Towers\\" have either already read the books, or have at least seen \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\". The acting is quite superb, more so in this one than in the first. The chemistry between the actors is much stronger, and the dialouge is better. The special effects and the CG Gollum are absolutely amazing! The battle sequences are exceptional, visually intense and stunning. There is not as much humor or character development in this chapter, but this chapter was more about the battles and the power of the Ring. Peter Jackson is a true genius, but you cannot give him all of the credit. J.R.R. Tolkien was also a true genius, for creating such abreathtaking story. Even the love triangle between Aragorn, Arwen, and Eowyn was interesting, and didn't take up too much time, either. We only get to see Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) towards the end as she is talking through Elrond's mind. So Blanchett has more of a cameo role.<br />People also might get a little confused since there is no real beginning and no real ending, but most people can soon forgive it...and it makes you eager for the final chapter, \\"The Return of the King\\", due out in theaters next Christmas in 2003. <br />\\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" begins it...\\"The Two Towers\\" continues it...and \\"The Return of the King\\" concludes it. It's <BR>\\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy!<br />I highly recommend \\"The Two Towers\\".<br />Score:<BR>100/100<BR>A+
B00005MM01|5.0|At 17 years old in 1967 I would lie in my room under my psychedelic crystal ornaments and the &quot;Frodo Lives&quot; slogans written on my wall to listen endlessly to Donovan. I dreamed one day of having children of my own to whom I could sing the gentle love songs of the second half of this album. Life passes and I lovingly protected this album and it's beautiful lyric sheets. The songs became the lulabys of my two darling daughters. Late nights with fretfull children... &quot;the silver girl, the wild jewel's neice&quot; and &quot;the raggle taggle gypsy&quot; would sweep them back into sleep. Now my beloved eldest is far away with her love, and for Christmass I am sending him this album ( now a CD) so that he may sing her the songs.... and perhaps someday to new little buds in the garden.
B00000K19E|5.0|Having seen the Matrix on TV One too many times, I finally got the DVD.  It came with so much stuff I was blown away so much you can still see the imprint on the wall!  The \\"Making of\\" is really cool and it comes with bios for the actors.  This is by far one of Keanu Reeves' best films.    Be sure to also check out The Matrix Revisited also a really good DVD.
B00007BH5C|4.0|I really enjoyed the Two Towers soundtrack better than Shore's Oscar-winning FOTR soundtrack.  <br />And I wish people would quit complaining about how part of the score from Requiem for a Dream was BLATANTLY stolen and placed into the Two Towers trailer.  These people act as if it's the first time its ever happened.  Please.  I guess we can go rip the people responsible for the About Schmidt trailer for BLATANTLY stealing from Thomas Newman's American Beauty score.  It happens, get over it.
B000002IWQ|5.0|This album is one of the definitive Rush albums. It combines Alex's amazing guitar skills, with Geddy's thunderous bass and Neil's amazing(if not astounding) drumming along with his lyrical genius.  These songs are definitely a little heavier than those of other albums, but you can still tell it's them behind the music.  Oh, please people: TO ALL THOSE WHO SAY THERE WAS TOO MUCH DRUMMING, GO HOME AND RETHINK YOUR LIFE BECAUSE THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS TOO MUCH DRUMMING.  Thank you to those reading this.  I had to get that out of my system.  Summing it up, this album is a must have for beginners or hardcore fans.  Be sure to check out: Leave that Thing Alone, Double Agent, Nobody's Hero(careful, this ones a little hard to swallow if you're a big fan) and Alien Shore.
B000002C1V|5.0|I don't quite understand why this cd gets so little recognition by most Pink Floyd fans, while indeed it's one of the best. Okay, it's not easy listening but that is its main appeal. It's got stunning lyrics (What else can you expect from Waters) and the music fits perfectly. There is very little of the clasic Floyd sound but another virtue of this band is their ability to evolute. <br />I am deeply moved by all the songs, being my faves the opening cut, Your Possible Pasts, One of The Few, The Gunner's Dream, The Fletcher Memorial Home, the title track and Two Suns In The Sunset, an incredible song. Not Now John is the fast-paced track on the cd, and it's fantastic, with Gilmour's solo, one of his best.<br />The Final Cut is the kind of album Dave would never be able to do, and it's a million times better than Momentary Lapse of Reason. After Roger left, the band lost a lot.<br />5/5.
B000066NW0|5.0|What a talented young women! Avrils Lyrics are down to earth and inspiring, not like many artists today. Everyone can relate to at least one song on this CD. All of her songs have a great message to them and actually mean something. Her music is a great escape if you're feeling down and when you listen you can tell that the words are coming from her heart. Her truthful words speak about issues going on in our world and they make you feel not so alone or confused. This is an amazing CD and everyone should buy it!
B00005QDW5|4.0|I confess I was quite disappointed to see this cd come out, because there is no way on earth to compile the best of Pink Floyd on two cds, simply because everything they did until Roger's departure is awesome.<br />While it's a somewhat decent compilation, I won't get it since I already own the Floyd material I like. The only song I don't have is When The Tigers Broke Free.<br />The tracks included should have been chronologically sequenced - instead of it we have them all over the place. Waters has publicly disowned this compilation, since he almost had no input on it. And I agree with those who claim there are far too many songs from Momentary Lapse of Reason. Learning To Fly is one of their more easy-listening tunes, yet it's featured on Echoes, to the detriment of jewels like A Pillow of Winds, Summer of '68 or Cymbaline, to name a few. The inclusion of Bike is another flaw, since it's quite a disturbing song and not the best Syd wrote. We'd have thanked to have Lucifer Sam instead.<br />Why is there nothing from Atom Heart Mother, More or Obscured by Clouds? And what about the absense of classic songs like Careful With That Axe, Eugene? <br />True that Sheep might have been left out to give way to Dogs, that is better in my opinion. <br />But fortunately not all is complaints. At least those who only know the catchiest Floyd period (That beginning in 1973) have the chance to listen to gems like Astronomy Domine, See Emily Play or Echoes.<br />4/5.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|THIS IS A GREAT ALBUM I WAS GETTING IT FOR MY DAUGHTER AND I GOT ME ONE TOO. IT HAS A FRESH NEW POP SOUND THAT HAS BEEN MISSING IN THE UNITED  STATES FOR ABOUT A YEAR OR TWO.
B00006J3WH|5.0|This cd is a must have for fans of Buffy and good music! I saaw the episode and instantly searched the net praying they had made a cd for it! Particularly good performances by Antony Head who revealed his incredible voice, also Amber Benson and James Marsters - but they were all good. I already have them memorised!<br />Buy it!
B00005JL96|5.0|I thought this was a great film. Lilo is a lonely Hawaian girl, who feeds peanut butter sandwiches to fish, bites and fights another girl and makes friends with experiment 626, a being that is made only for destruction by a \\"mad genius\\" on another planet.<br />Experiment 626, of course, is Stitch, who manages to pass himself off as a dog so Lilo and her sister/caretaker Nani, can adopt him. As if adopting an alien destructive force isn't bad enough, Nani must also deal with the social worker that is trying to assure that Lilo is being well take care of by Nani. (The parents have died before the movie starts, so kids are spared that part of the film.)<br />Aliens are dispatched from Turo to get Stitch back. Mr Bubbles, the social worker, is closing in on Nani, determined to remove Lilo from the home - if the aliens don't get her first. How this plays out and how it is all resolved is a lot of fun to watch, with very little of the terror that sometimes comes along with a Disney movie. (Remember Bambi's mom? I _still_do.)<br />The dvd has some nice extra features, some deleted scenes, some talks with the creator of the characters (Chris Sanders), how to hula and Wynonna doing an amazing job of singing Elvis (among other things).<br />This, in my opinion, is one of the best Disney films of all time. I'd advise buying this movie especially if you have a little one at home or you like animation.
B00005YUNY|5.0|I saw Yes live twice. Once at a small college theater with a packed house of about 2000 early Yes fans. This was the Yes Album tour and acoustics were perfect. Steve Howe burning up the fretboard with the zeal of a musician playing hot new music for the first time in concert. This was the original line up before Wakeman and all his classical influence. Some of which was truly great. Some of which needed more work. This concert had Squire and Bruford keeping time in a more free form Jazz Rock Fusion Billy Cobham/Stanley Clarke type of style. Anderson layered his folk rock melodies over the top of this fusion stew keeping it warm and inviting to the average rock listener. They played long extended versions of all the songs on the Yes Album. This show is definately in my top ten concert list.The second time I saw them was at a 1970's Mega Show touring for Fragile. This time with Wakeman. This show had a totally different feeling. A totally great feeling. They went from a jazz folk rock band into a classical folk rock band. A big fat layered keyboard sound building up to dizzying crescendos. I had to share this one with about 20 thousand in a stadium. The sound wasn't that great until I was about 50 feat from the stage. Of course it got better once I made by way to the front. Yes crowds were very polite. Compared to getting to the front of a Deep Purple or LZ concertSaw this new Yes DVD at a friends and thought it was really good. Agree there is to much editing and Howe should have be brought up. All in All it still gives chills to hear the old classics once more.
B00004Z400|5.0|I don't like too many new bands, i don't like the heartless the strokes, the hives, the white stripes, i hate, hate mall punk and all the junk on Mtv...but Deftones &quot;White Pony&quot; just defies genre and time...they did it for themselves, no one else...it's all heart...it's a masterpiece...Radiohead and Eminem are the only ones even close to making a record that will have the lasting power of this one...it's already a classic among some...and one of those music lovers is me...this album will never, ever go away, and will never be far from my cd player.

B00007BH5C|5.0|When I first got this CD, I wasn't too sure about it after a cursory couple of initial listenings. However, as with the score for TFOFR, it benefits greatly from additional hearings; I would now put this right up there with the first movie CD and cannot wait for ROTK to come out (both the movie and the CD).<br />Both scores for the Lord Of The Rings movies so far have greatly exceeded my initial expectations/impressions and have given me many hours of pleasure. My wife, who is also a score listener, loves these CDs too. I look forward to listening further to this CD and exploring the rich musical textures for years to come. If anyone is listening, Howard Shore deserves another Oscar nod for this monumental work.<br />Additonally I must admit that at first I was not convinced by Gollum's Song as it seemed strange and almost contemporary, but that is now one of my favourite pieces on the CD, especially the instrumentals - it reminded me in a way of some of John Barry's James Bond scores, even moreso after hearing the pathetic Madonna title for Die Another Day.<br />By the way, there are several reviews lamenting the lack of the trailer music on this CD - as has been pointed out, this was from Requiem For The Dream. However I also want to point out that virtually NO trailer contains music from the movie it accompanies, as at the time the trailer is released the music is quite often still being written! 99% of all trailers use recycled music from other sources; a good example is the trailer for Braveheart's use of Morricone's score for The Mission.
B00005JKZT|2.0|Visually this movie is a masterpiece. The sets, the towns, landscapes, the creatures.. everything is right out of middle earth. In this area, the film truly shines and those working on this film are to be commended for it. <br />I found the screenplay to leave a lot to be desired, however. Someone should tell the writers that they don't need to have a climactic moment every 10 minutes. This really killed the momentum of the movie. I was also a little disappointed at how they turned Gimli into comic relief. <br />Watching this film was certainly a pleasure, but I can't say that I'd do it again anytime in the near future.
B00004TDTO|5.0|Jaws was an action film, not realy a horror movie. It is such a great film to watch. The tension is so thick you could cut it with a knife. I always enjoyed this film. Robert Shaw should have won best actor for this role. The end of the film will have you cheering for the heros. I don't suggest any of the other Jaws films, because they are poorly made. Pick this one up. It looks wonderful on DVD!
B00000F1D3|4.0|This was probably the smost unexpected hit album of 1999 *maybe tied with Santana.* Cher hadn't had a gold album or decent hit single since 1991 and the &quot;Love Hurts&quot; album along with the top 20 hit &quot;Love and Understanding.&quot; She had some minor success with the &quot;It's A Man's World&quot; album in 1996, but unfortunately, it didn't go anywhere. Then in 1998, Cher released her dance/pop masterpiece &quot;Believe&quot; and it became a worldwide smash. Here in the US, the single became her 4th solo #1 hit and was the #1 single of 1999. The album &quot;Believe&quot; was a smash too hitting the top 5 on the album charts and going 4x platinum. <br />Of course, the star of the album is the title track. The song is perfection, plain and simple. However, the hidden gem is &quot;All Or Nothing.&quot; Although it was a club hit, this song should've been huge. It's a great dance track and has a great chorus. &quot;Strong Enough&quot; was a moderate hit for Cher also and has a great disco sound to it. &quot;Runaway&quot; is a good listen too along with &quot;Taxi Taxi.&quot; &quot;Love Is the Groove&quot; is cool too but it's a bit repititive. Ending the album is a remix of her 80's hit &quot;We All Sleep Alone.&quot; It's nothing special and I enjoy the original more.<br />Cher really proved once again that she had staying power. She closed the 90's with a bang. What other performer out there can brag about having massive hit singles in every decade since the 60's?
B00004WLXZ|5.0|Simply you can't lose this piece of history if you are interested in the IIWW and in the characters and twisted ideas that were involved. This is the movie of the 1934 Parteitags, day of the nazi party in Nuremberg. An event for the Hitler's party, and unfortunatly for the entire world.<br />You can take a look at the nazi reign through the eyes of an ippeccable artist Leni Riefensthal. You can hear words from men who lost their right way, who were push to crime by the unstoppable Hitler's evil force. And than you can see him, you can hear him, you can study the face of a man who left behind himself every human feeling in order to express his will to dominate the entire world. If you'll see this document you probably will understand a little better how things went and why went that way 60 years ago, when Europe was near to become fire and ash.
B000066NW0|2.0|Sure, the three singles aren't that bad. &quot;Complicated&quot; was good the first five thousand times, then it was overplayed to the point of madness. &quot;S8ter Boi&quot; was overplayed slightly too, but it's such a good song, it was hard to not like it. It took time to grow on me, but the bridge is awesome on this track. &quot;I'm With You&quot; is the latest and is a good song. Avril has a strong voice, there's no denying her of that. Of course, radio is already butchering the song. The rest of the songs just fall flat. &quot;Mobile&quot; is about the only other track I enjoy. The rest of the songs are by no means bad. Avril's voice prevents that. They're just nothing of any interest. They all run together and it's hard to get into them. After &quot;Mobile,&quot; I usually shut it off. <br />There are many out there that think Avril and this album are the best thing since sliced bread. Yeah, Avril is vocally talented, but her image is horrible. She's not punk and needs to ditch the attitude. As far as her dissing other artists like Britney...yeah Avril, has the better voice but i stand fast in that Britney has the catchier songs. &quot;Let Go&quot; may please some but it falls on its face with me.
B00006J3WH|5.0|I must say, this is probably one of the items in my Buffy collection I treasure the most. I LOVED the episode, and I was ultimately stoked when I discovered there was going to be a soundtrack. Naturally, I snapped it up the first day it arrived in stores. ;) It's a must-buy for any Buffy fan. Even if you're not a Buffy fan, any musical-lover will love this. I even find my college roommate humming a couple of tunes from it once in awhile, which she always denies - even she likes it, and sadly, I can't get her to understand the joys of the Buffyverse. *sigh* Anyway. Back to the review.<br />The fact that Joss Whedon was not credited with an Emmy nomination for this work is an insult. Of course, the Emmy people said they fixed it, blah blah, but whatever. The fact that he wrote all of the songs make it even more special. The man is definitely multi-talented - he even lends a bit of his voice to the final track.<br />However, it is the cast's voices that shine on this cd. Amber Benson and James Marsters in particular were gifted with fabulous, amazing PIPES. They make me wish Amber had a cd and I got to go a Ghost of the Robot concert once in awhile. Sarah Michelle Gellar and Anthony Stewart Head also give notable performances, and the rest of the cast isn't half-bad, either. The best song is probably &quot;Walk Through the Fire&quot;, which includes all of the cast, plus Broadway alumni Hinton Battle.<br />The disc also includes some extra instrumentals, such as the tracks &quot;Sacrifice&quot; from &quot;The Gift&quot; - which always makes me cry - and the excellent suites from Emmy award-nominated &quot;Hush&quot; and season four finale &quot;Restless&quot;.<br />All in all, it's a fabulous compilation. Five out of five stars, all the way.<br />-- ayla
B00003CXXM|5.0|Yeah, I know you're probably going to hang me for the title, but bare with me, pls! ;-) <br />This is a quite interesting film because it has a story that goes deeper then most American action films, the underlying story makes this film something else. <br />It's an interesting film about discovering yourself, all over again and wanting to change your life pattern. <br />And on top of that it has a nice little love story to it as well!
0783225792|1.0|Look, I KNOW this movie is rated R because Martin Scorsese doesn't want little kids to be horribly traumatized by the head-in-vise scene. Well I'm 24 years old and the scene horribly traumatizes ME. Heck, I almost threw up after seeing his eyeball pop out.
B00000JMG7|5.0|Rory Gallagher excelled on every level, as guitarist, vocalist, and songwriter, and this set reaffirms that fact.  This 2-disc set features a both live and studio performances, with an interesting mix of both originals and classic covers of blues classics, and Rory's genius manifests itself throughout.  In particular, the live performances show why Rory was one of the most dynamic, talented, and vastly underrated artists of all time.  Special thanks are due to Rory's brother Donal, who has done a superb job in making Rory's music available, and keeping the legend alive.  This set is a treat for any blues/rock fan seeking some of the best music ever made.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|If you are a Rock 'n Roll fan and don't own this album you owe it to yourself to RUN DON'T WALK to get it (or of course buy it here).  I'm a huge Clash fan, and even up to Combat Rock liked something about everything they did, but this album really nails what the Clash were about.  Soaring and sweet is the guitar work by Mick Jones, witty and sharp as a knife were Joe Strummer's lyrics, all polished up by Guy Stevens in a way that was palatable on the U.S. side of the pond without in any way compromising the integrity of the music and the message.  Writing this review is difficult, but I was inspired to do so by the news I heard today.  Joe Strummer passed away from an apparent heart attack at the all-too-young age of 50, missing by only three months the Clash's induction into the R&amp;R Hall of Fame and an anticipated reunion performance by the Clash.  What the world needs now more than anything is Joe Strummer, and now he's gone.  What a wonderful thing music is, and the fact that this CD will sound as fresh today as it did the day it was released.  The song Clampdown could have been written with John Ashcroft in mind, IMO.
B00003CXCK|2.0|Spielberg, like most of his lot, is a pimp.  Do yourself a favor and read \\"The Holocaust Industry: Reflections on the Exploitation of Jewish Suffering\\" by Norm Finkelstein.
B00003CXPJ|1.0|I got this movie thinking it might actually be funny. NO<BR>I thought the idea sounded good and could be done well. NO<BR>I have never seen a more stupid movie in my entire life. This is even worse than Fargo and Raising Arizona, two movies at the top of the stupid pile.<br />JUST DON'T DO IT
B000002UAX|5.0|Although &quot;The Beatles&quot; is credited as a group album, this 1968 classic sounds more like a collection of individual solo projects, and it would hint the band's demise less than 2 years later.  But whether or not the songs feature all 4 members, this much is true: &quot;The Beatles&quot; still stands as a historical event in pop.  Unless you don't get out much (in which case, you have my sympathy), at least a handful of these songs should be familiar to you.  The abrasive rush of &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; shows that McCartney can rock just as hard as the rest when he puts his mind to it.  George Harrison's masterpiece &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; radiates and soars with Eric Clapton guesting on guitar.  &quot;Dear Prudence&quot; and the eye-opening &quot;Yer Blues&quot; have Lennon in top form, and even McCartney's catchy &quot;Birthday&quot; sounds great--even with its admittedly trite lyrics.  It was reported that producer George Martin wanted the members to trim the number of songs down and release a single album instead.  And what did the Beatles do?  They ignored him and released a double album anyway.  Trusting your instincts and ignoring the advice of others has never been demonstrated so perfectly.
B000000XB9|5.0|This is a true greatest hits collection. It includes so many quality songs! The only parts I didn't like were tracks 19 and 20 but that's alright. This is a beautiful set and is worth your money! So if you want to get into CCR or if you are a devoted or even casual fan, but this album.
B00005JL2O|1.0|This is my first review here on Amazon.com, and I felt SO strongly about this movie that I was inspired to write this brief review. In short, this movie was the lamest, dumbest, most idiotic waste of time I've had the displeasure of seeing in a long, LONG time. Am I glad I didn't actually BUY the not-so-silly thing.
B00005JKCH|3.0|Okay, this movie does entertain- at times. But, the story is too simple. I know it's a comic book movie, but at least the climax didn't have to be so cliche- &quot;Who do you choose, Spidey- the girl or the innocent children?&quot; Spidey deserved better than that. This movie entertained and has sold a lot of DVDs, but ten years from now, Spider Man the movie will be seen as a cultural artifact of the period after 9/11/01, not as a great adventure movie for the ages.
B00005JKCH|4.0|Directed by Sam Raimi, SPIDER-MAN is the latest blockbuster adapted from a MARVEL comic. And with X-MEN 2 and THE INCREDIBLE HULK coming to cinemas soon, it would seem that Superhero movies are on the upswing. Surpassing my expectations of this being just another silly superhero film, this is one of the most impressive entries into the genre. Just as Spiderman is Peter Parker, Toby Maguire IS Spiderman. Swinging from skyscrapers, saving kids and beating up bad guys with relative ease. Contrary to what some critics thought, the CG Spiderman is really impressive. The pricipal actors, especially Maguire do a great job. Even creator Stan Lee does a cameo in the film. And of course, every hero need a villain. And this is what stops this from being the best superhero movie ever. William Dafoe is good as Norman Osbourne, but like most people, the Green Goblin is a dissapointing adaption of the classic bad guy. And there is a notable lack of zingy one-liners. That said, there is lots to enjoy here; Peter discovering his unique web-slinging abilities, some terrific action with Spidey swinging and the no-holds barred punch up ending. And Danny Elfman's suitably comic book score adds a lot to the action. Building up to an impressive finale and sending off with a sequel-friendly ending, this is a must-have on DVD. Some minor faults aside, this is a perfect Hollywood popcorn blockbuster. It might not be the best Superhero film ever, but it's very close.<br />The DVD extras are impressive, with 2 discs of extra material. There's an insightful Commentary by director Sam Raimi, Kirsten Dunst, producer Laura Ziskin, and co-producer Grant Curtis, a commentary by special effects designer John Dykstra and visual effects crew. Alos included are trailers, making of docos, director and actor profiles, bloopers, production material and DVD-ROM features. Impressive. Most impressive.
B000021YQV|5.0|One of my most listened to CD's in my collection, Toxicity is one of my all time favorite albums, and System Of A Down is one of my all time favorite bands. <br />Chop Suey- While I'm not sure bout the songs meaning I do know that it is my favorite song on the album, from the moment it was released. Serj's voice is mindblowing and so powerful and beautiful and chaotic all at the same time.<br />Toxicity- This has to be one of the coolest songs from the metal gods, it begins quitely and melodically enough then like a crack of thunder, it SLAMS into this insane onslaught of drum abuse, and brutal guitar riffs. The Bass guitar seems to literally explode, Serj's voice is gentle and powerful and angry, screaming bout the 'disorder' of the city. The toxicity of our city!<br />Aerials- A beautiful yet haunting intro leads this song into a climax that ends in the opening chorus \\"we all drink from the waterfall then turn around and put up our walls.\\"<br />Now what album would be complete without a rocking tribute to the movie Psycho- This song begins interestingly enough with a bass line, then slowly (just like the shower scene, in fact it even has the sound effect.) it builds and builds and builds til it ends on the line, \\"psycho groupie cocaine crazy, pyshco groupie coke\\" Awesome song- Rating 4.5/5 stars.<br />ATWA- This song took me by surprise in the literal sense LOL, i totally am in love with it, beautiful, just beautiful!
B000069HK2|5.0|These guys are just amazing. This album is just great. I'm just going to reveiw each song with a 1-10 scale:<br />1)Maybe Memories - nice heavy song to start off the cd just not a personal favorite of mine. 7/10<br />2)Taste Of Ink - The first single from the album and let me just say its a great one. abviously about that special someone... I like. 10/10<br />3)Bulimic - Nice catchy song.. 9/10<br />4)Say Days Ago - Picking up the pace on the cd this song takes this album to a high level. awesoem song. 10/10<br />5)Poetic Tradgedy - I must say the absolute best song on the cd.<br />the rest......
B000007T1M|5.0|Certainly the best album from system of a down, in my opinion. The song that really gets me is 'spiders' that  song is just so beautiful and powerfully poetic, not something you'd expect from a metal band such as this.
B00006V9A0|4.0|This CD expresses the career that Nirvana had, short, and kick [butt] good. It contains a collection of songs that are some of the graetest pieces of music I've ever heard. Evryone that says that that when you buy this CD you're not a true Nirvana fan. That is BS. You buy this you do your part as a fan. The bottom line is that it's a great collection of the best Nirvana songs.<BR>Long Live Nirvana!
B00005JKZT|5.0|I must say I was a little skeptical of seeing the movies at first. I thought when my friend said the first movie was great that this was like Harry Potter or some other stupid thing.  So I missed the first movie when it came out in theaters.  This August, I watched Fellowship and absolutely loved the movie. I didn't even realize that three hours had gone by! I must have watched the movie 5 times over the next three months. 5 stars doesn't even describe the first movie and Ian McKellan should have won best supporting actor at the Oscars!  Saturday, I went to go see The Two Towers and I was not disappointed. Gollum was a really cool CGI character and maybe one of the stronger characters in the movie. One minute it's \\"Kill Master!\\" to the next being \\"No. Master save us.!\\" Then there is the 45 minute battle scene which was breathtaking to say the least and had me pondering the entire way if they could survive. Absolutely wonderful movie and I can't wait to see Two Towers again or next year to see Return of the King. The Hobbit sounds interesting too for a live action release.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I've listened to everything in my time, and for me this album was my highlight of 2002.  Sure, as with any artist, you can dissect ad infinitum, and ruminate over whether he's more David Gray than Dave Matthews.  Who cares?  This guy is fresh talent, producing well crafted and original sounds, with a neat jazz edge (dig those jazz chords).  Poppy sound, for sure, but in a world of anodyne pop manufactured by marketing departments trying to sell us more Coke, this guy is a refreshing change.  Look, take as you find, but if your acid test is an album of sounds that keep on replaying in your brain, then this album just does the biz.  A bit like Ryam Adams did a couple of years back with Gold.
0385503954|3.0|It took me awhile to get into the story.  By the end of the first part, I was excited to see how the lives of the characters would unfold.  Unfortunately, parts II and III jump so far ahead in time that you feel that you no longer know the characters.  I felt as though I missed the formative years of the characters I had come to care about in the first part.  I would have rather seen McEwan develop Briony's story further during the teen years instead of skipping ahead from age 13 to 18.  Overall, I enjoyed it, but it had so much more potential!
B000000W6R|5.0|Being stuff from both the &quot;Gish&quot; and &quot;Siamese Dream&quot; era, this collection of B-sides and outtakes provides an interesting look at the earlier days of the Pumpkins, and is the 3rd CD to get after purchasing those two classics.  It runs the gamut from simple, inspired moments of improvisation like &quot;Soothe&quot; to climatic wall-of-sound moments that send tinges down your spine like &quot;Pissant&quot; and &quot;Hello Kitty Kat.&quot;  Seriously, it's amazing how the Pumpkins manage to rock even harden than Siamese Dream on those two tracks alone.  Great stuff, but the absolute keeper on this collection is &quot;Starla,&quot; for which epic isn't big enough of a word to describe.  Simple, plaintive, but honest lyrics build to a crescendo of a climax, where guitars seem to come from all sides.  Headphones required for maximum effect.  A couple are throwaways, such as &quot;Blue,&quot; &quot;Girl Named Sandoz&quot; (good cover but nowhere near as amazing or captivating as the band's own sound), and the last instrumental &quot;Spaced,&quot; but this album's by far much more essential than anything that came after it.  If you're addicted to Gish and Siamese Dream and desperately want the same sound, don't hesitate to pick this one up.  Terrific liner notes by the way, outlining little histories behind each song.
B00003CXAE|5.0|I LOVE THIS FILM! I've had to suffer many years watching Grease in it's horrendous pan and scan VHS format. When I first took a look at the widescreen dvd version I was blown away. I was seeing actors in scenes that weren't there before! It looked absolutely beautiful, it was breathtaking. It sounds great, looks great, and IS just spectacular still 24 years later. My only problem with this release is a few special features. We get a featurette with most of the actors talking about the film and a trailer but that's about it. I was hoping for some deleted scenes or outtakes and a commentary. I did love the booklet with all the song lyrics, that was so cool. Overall I am happy with this dvd mainly because it was so long in the waiting and it just looks so well done and everytime I view I remember why it such an important piece of the 1970s.
B00006B1HH|4.0|sounds great on DVD.  Add to your collection.
B000003TAR|5.0|Nevermind was a great album but lacked a harsher sound that some people were looking for. This albim delivered a more heavy, brutal sound. Don't get me wrong, it's still Nirvana. You'd never mistake it for anything else, but it just doesn't have that more &quot;poppy&quot; sound Nevermind had, which in my mind is a very good thing. Although every song is good I would say Dumb, Heart Shaped Box, tourette's, and All Apoligies are the best and Scentless Aprentice and Radio friendly unit shifter (by no means bad songs)are the worst.  Allthough if you are a Nirvana fan you already have this,if you don't I reccomend you pick this up.
0316666343|1.0|this book ...-its a phony book-- its a great idea-- thats all- it goes nowhere really slowly-- i was intrigued-- for a few pages then felt manipualted and bored - and ripped off--- dont waste yer time !
B00006NSZ5|2.0|eminem..he's as talented as he is dreamy eh? haha, kidding.<br />Personally, i love em...and i LIKED 'Lose Yourself'...but after hearing it on the radio a billion times, and still hearing it (as well as his other 20 singles!), i'm gettng sick of him. There are probably only two or three songs on that album that i liked, and 'Lose Yourself' was one of them. But now, me being sick of it, it was a waste of my money. the other ones songs are terrible.
B00000ICN5|5.0|Unfortunately I was not turned onto Stevie Ray unit just after his death.  I had never heard of him, and actually started out with \\"In Step\\".  This is the one artist who in my humble opinion has never put out a bad CD ...  Never have I heard both a vicious soleful guitar linked with such a powerful voice.  God must have needed to expand his band to take Stevie Ray so early, espeically after he had worked so hard to clean himself up.  Stevie always gave credit to those who came before him, and you can hear in both his guitar playing and his singing how much fun he is having doing what he loved the most.  I have read several accounts comparing Stevie Ray to others, but have never found his match.  \\"Love Struck Baby\\", Pride and Joy\\", \\"Texas Flood\\" and \\"Tell Me\\" just leap out of my speakers.  Whether honoring the likes of Buddy Guy, Albert & BB King or Jimi Hendrix, Stevie puts a spin on them that really clicks with me.  If you want to hear music played the way it was meant to be played and heard, this is the artist to buy into.  Of my over 30 years of music listening, Stevie is my #1 favorite artist of all time.  This and his other CD's are well worth the money, and I dare you to not be tempted to play them over and over again.
B000066NW0|5.0|'Let Go' is probably one of my favorite albums of all time. Avril Lavigne on the other hand......i'm not going to get into that. I bought the CD, not knowing what to expect. I heard 'Complicated' once, and i ended up seeing the commercial for it on TV about twenty times. Convinced that it was haunting me, i persuaded myself to buy it. But that was because i was in one of my moods, looking for new music, and feeling a little punkish...meaning i felt like listening to rock music.<br />I came home and and put the CD on, and i wasn't disappointed. The songs on this album are definitely ones i can relate to, and LOVE to sing along to. But after hearing &quot;Sk8ter Boi&quot; about a billion times on the radio, and hearing all the flack about her, i got sick of her. But trust me, this album is nothing like 'Sk8ter Boi'. It's probably one of the ONLY pop-ish songs on there.<br />Not to bag on her, but i think her music makes a bigger statement for herself...
B00006CXSS|5.0|You simply can not go wrong with this package.  I missed the HBO series and this completely fulfilled any and all my Band of Brothers needs.
0451196716|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing.  I was drawn in from the second I started reading it.  My friend suggested it and the idea sounded quite weird.  So I entered this book with an open mind and absolutely loved it.  It is one of my favorite reads along with Road to Perdition.  <br />Who would have thought a book could be written about a walk?  Well King did it under the pseudonym \\"Bachman.\\"  I am absolutely amazed with this novel and will definitely have to check out some other novels under \\"Bachman.\\"<br />Bottom Line--- Any doubt, Check it out!!!!
B000075BFK|5.0|i'm a BIG fan of tupac, i listen to his music alot and the ones on &quot;Better Dayz&quot; are like the best songs ever released, 20 out of the 27 are new released never heard before and the 7 are remixes including intro and outro, the first cd has the best songs of pac ever released in my opinion, the second cd has some good songs but i like the first one better, but this cd is like one of the best 2pac cds. If i were you the first thing i would do is buy the cd.
B00005JL96|1.0|I have just seen the DVD and I can't believe that so many liked this film.  The characters are very hard to like and the constant violent behavior (with no consequences) was shocking.  The inconsistencies in the story really ruin it.  Please rent this movie before buying it; I wouldn't have it in the house, myself.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I was very surprised by this release. I usually do not like... well, this kind of music. Lately, though, it seems my variety has been widening a little. I heard the song \\"Dirrty\\" and thought, \\"hey, it's a groovy little jam\\" so I don't know what I was thinking, and went out and bought the album.. and I am really glad that I did.<BR>Not all songs are like \\"Dirrty,\\" in fact, I doubt there are any that are like that on here, besides of course the song itself. On here, you'll find a mix of ballads (that aren't cheesy), dance/groove songs, and others that I cannot seem to classify right now. Here's my take on things:<br />1. Stripped intro- 8/10 - it's an intro... pretty good way to begin the album, though.<BR>2. Can't Hold Us Down- 9.5/10 - I like this song, it's up-beat, feminine, and I think Christina is basically trying to tell you who she is, and how most women feel.<BR>3. Walk Away- 8/10- a jazzy little ditty. It's pretty good, but goes on a little too long.<BR>4. Fighter- 9/10- I like this song, a lot. Good dance song, and a good self-righteous statement, as well.<BR>5. Primer Amor Interlude- it's an interlude, people.<BR>6. Infatuation- 8.5/10- a song that tells a story, and it kind of sends a little bit of a message, as well..<BR>7. Loves Embrace Interlude- #5 ditto...<BR>8. Loving Me 4 Me- 6.5/10- eh, could've done without.<BR>9. Impossible- 8/10- little jazzy tune, I kind of like it.<BR>10. Underappreciated- 8.5/10- pretty good song, good beat.<BR>11. Beautiful- 10/10- best song on the album. Linda Perry, I bow to you.<BR>12. Make Over- 8/10- fast song. it's alright.<BR>13. Cruz- 8/10- sort of a breezy/driving song. it's cute.<BR>14. Soar- 7.5/10- had potential to be an uplifting/encouraging song, but never quite makes it.<BR>15. Get Mine, Get Yours- 9/10- dance club ditty. I like it, it's groovy.<BR>16. Dirrty- 9.5/10- initial reason I own the album, it's still a favorite.<BR>17. Stripped Pt. 2- 10/10- hey, it make only be 45 seconds, but I like it.<BR>18. TheVoice Within- 7/10- zzzz<BR>19. I'm OK- 8/10- an \\"OK\\" song (I'm corny) where she sort of lets you know what's on her mind, yet she's holding back something at the same time.<BR>20. Keep On Singin' My Song- 8/10- not the best way to end the album, but groovy little song of encouragement, sort of her way of saying that nothing's going to stop her from doing what she wants to do.<br />All in all, this CD is definately a good investment. I typically listen to Pink Floyd, Phish, Tori, Further Seems Forever, Saves the Day... but I like this CD, and listen to it often. She really has matured, it seems, and from what I read, she wrote a lot of this stuff herself. She did a swell job, and this girls' voice is AMAZING! She does have talent, I wish her the best, and I would definately recommend picking this album up.
B000022TSV|5.0|What a great flick!  The story is timeless, the music is stellar, the cast is perfect, the performance are spectacular, and the filming is tops.  The story is a clean do-right soldier who falls for a tainted no-good gypsy, losing everything he values due to a bit of bad luck.  The music will dwell in your mind and in your heart long after you've returned to the mundane world.  The cast is unbelievable - instead of actors, you will see Carmen, Don Jose, the solders, the matador, the soldiers, the theives, and the world they inhabit.  When Carmen sings of love, you will wonder why you never understood the concept before and when Don Jose sings of his love, you will understand exactly why he follows Carmen to his doom.  You will never even notice the camera - you flow thru the world of Carmen and Don Jose as if a bird.
157492589X|3.0|Maybe it's been written before, but I'll say it here. The video tape is all 6 hrs. on one tape. There is a misprint on the box and on the tape label saying 4 hrs. Since it was copied in EP (aka SLP) the image is poor. Flat and sans detail. Also it was in mono audio (don't know if DVD is stereo). But I just watched it on tape for the first time having borrowed it for free from the library. After an hour or so I got past the poor video and was lost in this amazing film!<BR> My recommendation is to purchase the DVD. You say you ain't got a DVD player? Buy one immediately. They're coming down in price all the time and their picture reproduction is beautiful. <BR> I myself will be making the Lonesome Dove DVD purchase in the spring, when I'm ready for my second viewing!
0452282152|4.0|If you're familiar with Vermeer's art and the world of 17th century Holland this is definitely a fun book.  I found the main storyline a little hard to believe, but who cares?
B000002HHB|5.0|This album is Natalies debut after leaving 10,000 Maniacs and shows her maturity as songwriter and singer. Special attention to Jennifer Turner on guitar. She is fantastic...and beautiful !
B000007MVM|2.0|If Syd Barrett's first of three solo albums means anything, it means what happens when a singular talent is the victim of his own fragility-inspired self-destruction. With extremely few exceptions in which his uncommon knack for pop sensibility survives (&quot;Terrapin,&quot; an oddly affecting, almost childlike blues; &quot;No Man's Land,&quot; maybe the most bristling piece of rock and roll Barrett was able to cut after the meltdown that prodded him out of Pink Floyd; and, &quot;Golden Hair,&quot; where he gave James Joyce a shimmering - and sad - reading), this is an album only for those who absolutely must have every last thing bearing Syd Barrett's name on it. When you're one of the unquestioned innovators of your time, you've still got ideas running as lunatic as commuters running late for the last train to work in the morning, but you've blown about two-thirds of the faculties needed to make most of them make sense, it isn't pretty. It's sad. Add a star if you're that convinced that there's still genius to be found when listening to the inside of an acid casualty's shattered mind.
B00004VVND|4.0|For those who have not visited Delos, please remember when this movie was made. The special effects are long in the tooth from todays ultra modern effects labratory's quality.<br />Delos is the entertainment resort of tommorrow. Perhaps ideas for Star Trek's Data character came from here. Robots inhabit 3 different \\"Worlds\\" of entertainment for tired and weary businessmen and women.<br />Westworld is where Yul Brenner is, and this is the Wild West. Very cool ! You can shoot and drink and even fool around with pleasure robots and no one actually gets hurt. If you try to shoot at another guest your gun will not work.<br />Medieval World is for those who want to be knights and kings, and looks fun with all its handmaidens.<br />Roman World is the height of decadent behavior.<br />Now with all this good fun, what could possibly go wrong ?<br />Watch this movie and you will check all your friends hands for little circles to see if they are real or not !<br />They made a sequal of this one for those who do not know called Futureworld, which features a more sinister plot of copying people in positions of power and replacing them with robots.<br />Westworld is much more honest and just tryin to give the people clean good fun. Too bad no one told the robots !<br />A fun movie to watch, remember its age though so your not disappointed by outdated special effects and those awful polyester clothing styles of the 70's.<br />Elliot Gould very much in his normal role and character, if your a fan of his, he is the star of the movie who unravels what went wrong.
B00005JL1C|5.0|This is one of the greatest movies ever made! It is very well acted and the characters are likable and believeable. They show teenagers as real people and not just sex crazed maniacs. This is right up there with Say Anything, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, and Ferris Bueller's Day Off. If you have good taste, I suggest picking this masterpiece up in any way that is possible. Believe me it is worth your money. It is one of my favorite movies, and I'm sure it'll become one of yours as well. Hope you enjoy it.
B00004VVNB|5.0|It has been blasted by those who called it a shopping mall of scantilly clad teenagers, but to this writer it will always be a world of Wonder and a great movie.<br />I went to see this movie when I was a kid and it was incredible. The scantilly clad women were a big turn on to a little guy like me too !<br />Basically the World as we know it has fallen into a post apocolyptic computer driven world where everyone's life is directed until they reach 30. Then its the red blinking crystal and either wearing a hocking mask and a red flame uniform or learning how to do the 500K dash in a very fast time.<br />This movie is impressive in what it says about society and people. No matter how you arrange our lives we need change and diversity. If you try to program us from birth, our natural rebellion will always seek ways to overthrow the status quo.<br />A very worthwhile fantasy for those who have never seen it, and for the really cheap prices they are asking a bargain !<br />An all English cast reminds viewers that even though they are in post apocolyptic America, that the English may be all thats left of us ! Also sad is the apparent lack of other racial groups in the film. Perhaps it is a social commentary of movies of that time, or perhaps the producers wanted a uniform future. But to this writer, I would prefer a future that has people of all races alive and well, and I have an English background.<br />For those who want to enjoy a fantasy, don't take it as being a blueprint of the future.
0898705525|5.0|After finishing this book I had a question...why can't more books be like this?<br />Chesterton is a masterful writer with humor and wit that entertains and with a sharp mind and tongue that keeps you wanting to know more about his beliefs.  He follows the belief that there is nothing more exciting or dangerous than having an orthodox christian belief.  Writing from a Catholic perspective, he truly is one of the greatest authors of this century.  No wonder CS Lewis admired him so much, Orthodoxy is a masterpiece of literature and storytelling.
B00005JLF5|1.0|For all of those who love The Next Generation and the Original Series, stay far away from this one !<br />Gene Roddenberry hated the original idea and never wanted the show to be made. Only after he died, did the studio go ahead and produce the show. Gene thought it was a TERRIBLE ides. Who wants to see a space station where they never go anywhere ?<br />The characters in this show were also equally below normal trek standards.<br />This show tirelessly goes on and on about racial stereotypes and race bating and hatred with the Bajorans and Cardassians.<br />Its like why did the Cardassians even speak ? They were the most evil creatures in the galaxy and a bunch of agrarian farmers who were very spiritual could overthrow a superior military machine by hit and run attacks led by a woman under a 100 pounds and a bunch of dreadful characters.<br />Also, remember the Ferengi who were in TNG season 1, snarling and wearing bear skins and little fighting machines ? Well, they get replaced by the \\"Nebbish Woody Allen\\" character in Quark, whose only sole appeal could be to very small children. Adults find this show boring.<br />The only saving grace could be the few Klingon shows with Worf and Jadzia and the reunion of Kor, and the other Klingons from the original series in Season 7.<br />Babylon 5 was MUCH MUCH better done and is a thousand times more interesting and unique.<br />I promise most viewers that buying 1 season of this show will insure you never buy another. So buy one of the Worf seasons and at least get a few episodes that are worthwhile.<br />BIG POINT ! The so-called Dominion is NEVER EVER mentioned in ANY OTHER STAR TREK SERIES OR MOVIE. Yet, they become the entire focus of the show. <br />I can't wait for VOYAGER, which at least gives us a ship and new species that we can enjoy instead of hate and call names. Voyager also reunites us with the Borg, and ties nicely into TNG and the Original series.<br />Stay away from Deep Space Nine, Gene Roddenberry was right, this one should never have been made.
B000062TU1|5.0|\\"Harry Potter & the Sorcerer's Stone,\\" or as I understand it's released in Great Britain as \\"HP & the Philosopher's Stone,\\" is a great DVD.  Most critics feel if there's a fault to the film, it's that it's TOO faithful to the book.  It'd been some time since I'd read the book when I viewed the film.  I kept saying, \\"Oh, I remember that!\\"  Chris Columbus has done an excellent job bringing this magical world to screen.  I think Harry Potter, films included, will become as a part of our culture as Peter Pan.<br />The actors are each wonderful in the movie, although action rather than character development is the strength.  Daniel Radcliffe does a great job showing the innocence and bravery of Harry.  Rupert Grint is a hoot as Ron.  Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore gives such a calm wisdom to the part.  Maggie Smith as McGonagall is as wonderful as she was in \\"Gosford Park.\\"  Robbie Coltrane who played a great buddy to Johnny Depp in \\"From Hell\\" does a great job as the half-giant Hagrid.  Alan Rickman perfected screen villany in \\"Die Hard\\" and \\"Robin Hood\\"; so we love to hate his wonderful sneer.  He also performed the great service of seeing Sean Biggerstaff who plays the Quidditch team's head Oliver Wood in a stage play, giving him his first screen break in \\"The Winter's Guest.\\"  Biggerstaff was my favorite of the supporting actors.  Fiona Shaw is delightful as the spiteful Aunt Petunia.  Tom Felton has come a long way since appearing with Jodie Foster in \\"Anna & the King\\" to his role as the hateful Draco Malfoy.  John Hurt as Mr. Ollivander the wand salesman does a nice cameo too.<br />The effects in the film are excellent.  We really believe in Harry's invisibility cloak.  It's such a hoot to see him at night in the restricted section of the library with his hand holding a lantern poking out from under the cloak, as if the hand wouldn't give him away!  The three-headed dog, the plant that smothers and the flying keys are all marvelous effects.<br />The DVD version's second disc takes you on an interesting tour of Hogwarts.  Now, I have to go back and find those deleted scenes!  Harry Potter & the Sorcerer's/Philosopher's Stone is thoroughly entertaining.  Relax & have fun!on's second disc takes you on an interesting tour of Hogwarts.  Now, I have to go back and find those deleted scenes!

B00005T30L|5.0|Excellent movies have an uncanny way of never moving beyond the outskirts of New York and Los Angeles during their theatrical run.  Peter Jackson's HEAVENLY CREATURES (1994) and Atom Egoyan's THE SWEET HEREAFTER (1997) are just two of examples of countless films which are highly-cinematic and end up being seen by many on home video.    <br />Terry Zwigoff's GHOST WORLD is another such film.  It stars the incomparable Thora Birch as a typical high school graduate who is tired of her humdrum life and, like most 18 year-olds, doesn't know what she wants.  However, she does know what she doesn't want, and that's a step in the right direction.  The dialog is terrific and full of wit and hilarity.  <br />Based upon a comic book by Daniel Clowes, this film is awash in bright and garish colors.  The VHS tape is a complete waste.  See the film instead on DVD, preferably on a progressive-scan set-up.  This DVD pressing is good, but I wish that it had included a few commentaries - I personally enjoy such behind-the-scenes anecdotes, and it would have been nice to hear about the translation of the comic book to the final film version.  <br />The fact that I have purchased this DVD virtually guarantees a future Special Edition... <br />Five stars for GHOST WORLD, three stars for the DVD of it.
B00005RY7X|1.0|Just buy the single and save yourself some money. Which single? Any single of his will do. All of these tracks sound identical. The CD begins to get repititous after about 1 1/2 songs. Is party even still a verb? I guess so according to this Einstein.<br />Horrible, horrible CD.
B00006SFLV|5.0|August 25, 1994 saw the debut of MY SO-CALLED LIFE on ABC-TV.  I watched the pilot episode that night and when it was over I felt it just didn't belong on television.  It was too good.  <br />MY SO-CALLED LIFE was in the wrong place at the wrong time.  And yet it was in the right place at the right time.  Each episode is worthy of a theatrical presentation and I would gladly pay to see the entire series presented in such a manner.  The cinematography by Ernest Holzmann and Charles Leiberman is wonderful - warm and friendly, making the Chase's house cozy and inviting.  Ron Rosen's editing calls to mind THE SOPRANOS and the brilliant juxtaposing of characters, storylines, and misunderstandings.  The show has garnered numerous accolades for its portrayal of adolescence.  It is so good, in fact, that it does not feel like television at all.  Each episode unfolds with its own interesting pace and is its own short chapter.  Claire Danes is nothing short of brilliant as Angela Chase.  She possesses a maturity and poise rarely seen in actresses her age.  She lusts after the dreamy Jordan Catalano, a guy whom she is understandably attracted to but who, in the end, is a true dolt.  <br />The rest of the cast is wonderful, too.  Despite their often-annoying idiosyncrasies, you like these people.  The character of Brian Krakow can be unbearable, making you want to punch him in the face, but I think that's a compliment to the actor who portrays him (in a strange sort of way!!)<br />What is truly amazing about this show is that it took place just eight years ago, when the World Wide Web was just coming into its own, and the world seemed still full of possibilities.  The current state of violence - school shootings, anthrax cases, and overall terrorism - today makes these episodes a true joy to escape to.  <br />The show only lasted 19 episodes, and there never was a \\"final\\" episode - it was just cancelled.  Most of the show's most zealous fans caught up with it on its MTV-marathons, but the episodes were slightly cut to add more annoying commercials than you could possibly imagine.  Thank heavens for home video, as the new DVD box set has arrived.  The complete episodes of one of the best shows I've ever seen is now available.  <br />The series is spread out to five discs and they contain only the episodes.  No effort appears to have been made to make this release into a special edition, which is a shame because it would have been nice to have had some commentaries by the creators and performers, as well as on-the-set interviews and the like.  I suppose that once we all buy this set, they'll re-release it with the aforementioned inclusions, which is something that most companies do deliberately today.  <br />The transfers are the best I have seen for this show.  While not stellar, they are better than the broadcast quality.  It's a joy to see each episode in its entirety without commercials destroying your brain every twelve minutes.  The audio is nicely represented as well.  Simply put, if you're a fan of this show, you must own this collection on DVD.  Not VHS, but on DVD.  The Christmas episode with Juliana Hatfield is beautifully lit and is quite moving.  <br />MY SO-CALLED LIFE is proof of just how excellent television can really be.  It's better than just about anything on cable and in theaters now.  I would personally like to thank everyone who was involved with this show for being a part of it and making it what it is.  This is a classic television series that lends itself to repeat viewings.  You do not have to be a teenager to appreciate this show.  I'm now 34 and I still see things that I missed the first time I saw it.<br />Now, if they would only release 1987's A YEAR IN THE LIFE on DVD...
B00006LWSF|5.0|This was an overall excellent album that completley went with the movie.....Everybody that hasn't, see this movie and get the album.....it was better than I expected... Great CD I recommend this CD ...buy this album!
B000002UUX|5.0|After the Peace sells.. Album megadeth recorded so far so good so what and dissapointed me to say the least. After that, Megadeth changed studio, got a new sound and two new members. Marty Friedman and Nick Menza. Mustaine got the name of the album from a vision he had where he imagined all nuclear warheads \\"rusting in peace\\". Anyway, After listening to some of the later more well produced records, RIP was something of a letdown for me the first time I heard it. Over the years it has grown and now I really love it. It's the second best album after Countdown To Extinction. I think that Countdown to extinction is a litter more ballanced and has an uncompromising crushing sund. But the techicue and splendor of this hole album is absolute. Never have I heard someone to pull a solo like that on lucrettia or on hangar 18. The album includes some of the finest metal ever recorded. Holy wars, hangar 18, take no prisoners, 5 magics, tornado of souls and polaris are all divine! It may take a couple of listens before you can get a hold of it but then you realice that this kicks [butt]! Buy now!
B000069AUI|5.0|oh my god! this cd absolutely knocked me off my feet.. whenever i pop any other cd into my player, it feels dry in comparison to this gorgeous album.. honestly, coldplay is practically all i can listen to now. this cd sounds much more confident than &quot;parachutes&quot;, chris martin (lead singer) must have gained some of his confidence back. absolutely wonderful
B00005NWM3|4.0|I was skeptical about Nickelback because of the (...) I had heard on MTV, most notably the song he did for the Spiderman movie.  But after listening to this CD, I turned a complete 180, this band rocks!  I am a huge rap music fan and I am saying that Nickelback is awesome, so it must be good.
B000006OAM|5.0|This one is a keeper; I think of it whenever the time honored question comes up as to what I would bring to a desert island. Anything but pretentious and gloomy Natalie is an inspired singer/songwriter with an angelic voice that haunts and a knack for making personal observations come across as universal truths relatable to any listener who is tired of the shrieking divas ala Mariah, Whitney,Celine and the odious, overmarketed J.Lo. This album is soulful without being overbearing and sad only in so far as depth of feeling is bound to be heavy. Life is Sweet is my favorite track and has become almost something of a personal anthem. If Natalie is performing in a town near you take the time to see her: in live performances she is accomplished, graceful and memorable.
B000002LGW|5.0|Depeche Mode are definitely a live act to be reckoned with and this is a superb example.<BR>Nothing can quite compare to actually being at a DM concert but this comes close enough. Being from SA in the 80s this album was the next best thing. The first time I heard the record I was transfixed by emotion and awe. OK,Im waxing a bit lyrical but without being to subjective this is a strong live album.<BR>The production is excellent and the balance between music and audience audio is perfect,creating enough live atmosphere without detracting from the songs.<BR>Most of the hits up till &quot;MFTM&quot; are on this double CD as well as some great DM standards eg: &quot;Something to do&quot;.Other strong tracks (speaking from a live point of view)for me are, &quot;Behind the Wheel&quot;,&quot;People are People&quot;,&quot;The things you said&quot;,&quot;Black Celebration&quot;(love the ending), and of course the single pulled from the album,&quot;Everything Counts&quot;(the audience singing the outro gives goosebumps). <br />A special album commemorating a special concert and highlight in the bands career, 101 was there final sellout concert for the Masses at the Rose Bowl in Pasedena, a mean feat by any American band, proving that they had what it took to rake them in. After this the band made a conscious decision not to play in such big venues as they felt (and rightly so) that they could not reach there whole audience. They did a pretty good job trying though.<BR>A great add on to this purchase would be the Video Docu &quot;101&quot;<BR>Showing Live footage as well as behind the scenes of the tour.
B000069HKH|3.0|I'm a longtime Springsteen fan, grew up in central NJ. I loved Born to Run at first listen. Followed by his first 2 albums I soon purchased after BTR like most fans. Each future album was anxciously awaited and adored when received. Even the weaker efforts and the pop commercial Born in the USA were, though not Bruces best, still better than most anything around. Even with the band back together and plenty of time to write back in Jersey Bruce really hit a low point with this album. He may as well have come out with A SPRINGSTEEN XMAS. With few exceptions this album is boring and lifeless not to mention an attempt to make money on other peoples loss of life and family members. I hope he stops to think next time he makes a CD. I'll definitely have to listen first next time before spending money on any more of the Bosses works. I'll always still have the great memories of his top notch work but this one is a major black mark on a shining career.   <BR>                                tramps like us . . . . .
B00006NSZ5|3.0|The songs \\"Lose Yourself\\", \\"Love Me\\", \\"Rap Game\\", \\"8 Miles and Running\\", \\"Battle\\" and \\"Rabbit Run\\".  The rest are average.  Nas, Rakim and Xzibit dissapoint.  \\"Adrenaline Rush\\" has a great beat, but the excessive cursing ruins it.  In this limited edition, there is a cd with 6 songs.  The best are: Rap Name by Obie Trice, Stimulate by Eminem and The Weekend by Brooklyn.  A great buy.  I would actually give it 3 1/2 stars.  (The DeskSite is excellent)
B00003CXAA|5.0|Rarely is there a DVD collection that is a true, &quot;must have.&quot;  This Godfather trilogy is it.  This collection means you can show your children, your grandchildren, even your parents how the Corleone family started, how it became glorious, and how it adjusted to modern times.  The first two movies are clearly in the top 10 movies of all time.  Rarely do we get to witness these type of movies, movies that are the caliber of &quot;Silence of the Lambs,&quot; or the &quot;Lord of the Rings trilogy.  You have to get this collection of DVD's.  While this series is not for the faint of heart, there are so many lessons of leadership, loyalty, and family, there is something for everyone.  I highly recommend this for your DVD collection.  A+<br />Joseph Dworak
B00005JLWL|5.0|Like many others I knew nothing about this film a few days ago. All I knew was that it stared one of the more talented actors I know, Christian Bale. All I knew about the plot was it was a bit like the books 1984 and Brave New World. Hell, I didn't even know that Taye Diggs (Benny from my favorite musical, RENT) and Sean Bean (Boromir from one of my favorite movies, Lord of the Rings) were in it. I guess that made me even more blown away by this simply amazing movie that is not getting the credit it deserves.<br />The movie is about a man named John Preston (Christian Bale). He is the top fighter in a bleak futuristic society where, as a result to a powerful drug, people have been robbed of the ability to feel. It's his job to burn out every object of the past that might invoke feeling. He can sometimes even tell if someone is feeling by the tone of their voice or facial expressions. But even he cannot prepare himself for what happens when his partner (played by Sean Bean) is found to be a sense offender, he's feeling. Preston kills him, as he's supposed to, but something small inside of him clicks when his partner utters a few lines of poetry before he dies before he dies. That tiny spark of emotion is magnified the next day when he secretly refuses to take the drug that prevents them from feeling. Suddenly everything around him seems wrong, including his job and himself. Preston is being drawn into a new world he's never experienced before where he can feel But if anyone finds out about this he will die for it. What can he do?<br />It's hard to classify this movie. It's an action movie, a drama, a sci-fi film, and something much more deep and philosophical. It's an amazing film with so many twists and turns that you simply don't know what's going to happen next. I even found myself jumping and gasping in areas. The acting is suburb. I was once again reminded by why I love Christian Bale so much. Most importantly it makes you think. Because as scary as this movie may seem, it's possible. If we're not careful, in the distant future, it could happen here.
B00005JKCH|4.0|This much hyped DVD/movie was worth the wait.  I am not a big fan of Tobey Maguire (what were his parents spelling-names challenged?), but he does a great job in this flick.  William Dafoe is the perfect enemy for spiderman, and Kirsten Dunst does a great job of being the flighty romantic lead woman.  All in all, they did justice to the Spiderman legend and this was a great work.  The special effects displayed in this movie were dazzling and the Computer Generated Images were cutting edge.  The sequel, which I am sure they are hot to make another few hundred million dollars on, will be good as well.  This movie rates as an A- in my book.<br />Joseph Dworak
B0000029D1|5.0|This is definitely the CD I would take w/ me on a desert island...the lineup is fantastic, each player is a legend in their own right, and the fusion between each of them is definitely noticeable throughout the recording.  Clarke is so much better live than in the studio, as you will see by listening to \\"school days\\" which is 100x more funky and loud as the 1976 studio verson.  3 of my all time favorite musicians, Clarke, Carlton, and Cobham, and 2 which I've heard for the first time (Najee and Deron Johnson)who were FANTASTIC.  I have listened to this album at least 60 times since I bought it about 6 months ago...and i still enjoy it just as much as i did when i bought it.  Even though there are only 7 songs...this is by far the BEST REAL FUSION album I've ever purchased.  Highly recommended for any jazz or rock fan who appreciates extraordinary musicianship.
B0000636UN|4.0|Sheryl gives us another really good work, it is worth having in your collection.  She never seems to be far from the top with her fun, delightful hooks.  I don't think it hurts that she is a great, captivating performer who just has a feel many artists cannot get close to.  You can tell she works hard at her craft, and this fact shows up big time on all her albums, but this one more than most.  I will be interested in what she does next, but for now Cmon, Cmon... Sheryl... break all of our hearts again.  B<br />Joseph Dworak
B00007BH5C|5.0|This is a great soundtrack and matches up to the glory of the Fellowship soundtrack. There's new themes and sounds, but none of them dull, some even bring back themes from the Fellowship. I was really impressed with Gollum's Song. It has a wonderful medlody and the words fit so perfectly with it. But truth is, every song is on this disk is great. This CD is a must for any Lord of the Ring fan, and I know you won't be disapointed.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Take any typical movie; it has a formula, it has a predictable outcome, it has big name actors... Forget all that! Christopher Nolan's \\"Memento\\" literally breaks new ground in the film department, creating one of the most enticing pictures in the history of filmmaking. Guy Pearce is excellent -- the entire cast is excellent. No thriller deserves any less effort than the amount obviously, and well executedly, put into this film. Additionally, the film's editing, cinematography, storyline and directing were each very creative, definitely representing more than a mere fresh breath of air.<br />The film's conclusion, in which the story's &quot;time periods&quot; meet to reveal a plot twist that satisfies the viewer but does not end the storyline, is so original and mindboggling that it SCREAMED &quot;Give me Oscar!&quot; last March, and was certainly robbed of one.  &quot;Gosford Park&quot; was good; &quot;Memento&quot; was great, and is the best film of 2001.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Honestly, one of the better hard rock albums to come out in quite some time.  More of Tom Morello's signature licks, with Chris Cornell's unique voice.  This album has the potential to become a classic.
B00003CWRX|4.0|A slightly overlengthed film hailed for Russell Crowe's performance should actually be hailed for a few other things; first off, both Al Pacino and Christopher Plummer are magnificent here. Secondly, the cinematography is breaktaking and beautiful, with its vivid use of color, high contrast levels, and focus-changing shots within a small depth of field, perfectly matching the harmonic vocals that complement the movie's poignant score. Lastly, the film's conclusion, with the plot's full Sixty Minutes interview actually airing on television to audiences everywhere with the anti-Tobacco Industry interview, more than makes up for the film's overlength (a trend in 1999, with &quot;The Green Mile&quot; and &quot;Magnolia&quot; each lasting over three hours); the ending is addictively gratifying.
B00005Y228|5.0|I love this CD! It is one of the best CD's of 2002 and the best of Kylie Minogue's spectacular career. The CD's high points include the back-to-back &quot;Love At First Sight&quot; and &quot;Can't Get You Out Of My Head&quot; which both are great dance tunes. Another high point is &quot;Burning Up&quot; which is one of the best tracks on the album. The two bonus tracks are great: &quot;Boy&quot; is really fun and &quot;Butterfly&quot; (which can also be found on the CD &quot;Light Years&quot; [also by Kylie]) is truly amazing. Kylie is better than all those other poppy (or in Britney's case, poopy) girl singers out there. She is the original, the best, the master. You must be crazy if you don't already own this CD because it is awesome. It is a must have for anyone. I love it. It rules! I reccomend it to anyone who likes Kylie or anyone that likes dancing. Enjoy!
B00006F83Y|5.0|This Cd should be the model for future rock bands to get back to the basic good rock of past. This album is revolutionary especially now in a market crammed with rap disguised poorly as rock. Anyways highly reccomended!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I saw it in Texas and fell in love with it. I have seen the actual Moulin Rouge in Paris (simply driving by, not actually seeing the show) which was very exciting. This movie is fabulous, the best movie in a long time! It's really fast paced, which I really liked. It's such an exciting movie and even keeps you interested in the slower parts. I reccomend this movie to anyone. It's true, you either gotta love it or you gotta hate it, your choice. You should watch this movie with an open mind, it's great. I wasn't so sure about it at first, but as it turns out I really enjoyed it! I love Kylie as the Green Fairy. It's really an artistic movie, one that really has to be appreciated. THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME! TWO THUMBS WAY WAY UP! Enjoy!
B00005NKKY|4.0|Bookends, Simon and Garfunkel's heavily applauded 1968 release, is an album of a definitive inspiration: aging. It may seem odd given the fact that Paul Simon was only in his mid-twenties when he wrote them, but almost every song on Bookends, either explicably or implicitly, describes some part of the life cycle. \\"Punky's Dilemma\\" and \\"At the Zoo\\" both convey the mindset of a child, the further extolling an ingenuous confusion and frustration and the latter in a silly spurt of joy. \\"Fakin' It\\" and \\"A Hazy Shade of Winter\\" are steeped in the type of identity crises common to adolescence. The classic \\"America\\" perfectly portrays a young person's urge to roam. \\"Overs\\" must be the most convincing account of divorce ever written by a person yet to experienced it. Most surprising, however, is Simon's fixation on the elderly who are given sympathy on the still-heart-rendering \\"Mrs. Robinson;\\"' teased on \\"Save the Life of My Child,\\" (a decent song spoiled by an unexpected and awkward experimentation with synthesizers); envied on the meditative \\"Old Friends\\" and even given a chance to speak for themselves on \\"Voices of Old People,\\" a somewhat annoying montage of dialogue. Throughout the album, Simon shows the scope, inventiveness and even sometimes, the brilliance, of his songwriting. Bookends is a definitive step in the evolution of one of popular music's truly great songwriters and a top release from a seminal folk-rock group.
B00000DCER|5.0|If you love the electric blues and blues slide guitar, this is a must-have album for your collection.  Many of the songs are instantly recognizable blues patterns that have set the style for generations of blues and rock superstars.  John Lee Hooker is on a par with B.B. King, Robert Johnson and other classic great blues artists.  The repertoire of session musicians from the likes of Carlos Santana, Jimmy Vaughn, Bonnie Raitt, and Eric Clapton are not to be missed.  John Lee Hooker set a blues standard - get this album.
B00005NKKZ|5.0|The fact that over half of the songs on Bridge Over Troubled Water are included on The Best of Simon and Garfunkel is a testament to the strength and consistency of this marvelous album. The album's hits, the South American flavored &quot;Cecilia,&quot; the genuinely moving title ballad and the greatest rock epic ever written, &quot;The Boxer,&quot; among them, are all unquestionable classics, but Bridge's less celebrated tracks, including the devilish &quot;Baby Driver,&quot; and the euphoric gust, &quot;Keep the Customer Satisfied,&quot; and the cover of The Every Brother's &quot;Bye Bye Love,&quot; a notable step up from the original, are also very impressive. The excellence of this album was well recognized upon its release, as Bridge was one of the top-sellers of its decade and was showered with awards (including Album of the Year) at the 1970 Grammys. More than thirty years later, Bridge Over Troubled Water has lost none of its power to charm and move listeners. Truly, this album stands as a major achievement.
0395193958|5.0|There are SO many different LOTR editions out there. It's difficult to know which one to choose. If you want one that is going to hold up over time & through many readings, I say the Red Collector's edition it the best, by far. Forget all the paper backs. They may be cheaper, but by no means as durable. I was torn between the Illustrated edition & the Red Collector's edition. After looking at both of them, it was a no-brainer....the Red Leatherette wins by a Landslide!!!! The book is a nice size....not too big, yet not too little. The beautiful gold, blue & green foil embossing that embellishes the front cover, back cover, & spine add to the book's elegance. It looks like something that fell directly out of Middle-Earth and right onto your lap! The entire Trilogy along with the appendices and a fold out map are contained within the single volume. A sturdy protective slipcover is also included. A wonderful fold-out map of Middle Earth is secured inside the back cover. I have read reviews that complained about the type-set. I think that it is fine. There might be a couple places where a letter, like the top of an \\"a\\" or \\"e\\" might be a little light. But this is few & far between & does not affect one's ability to read this treasured tome. The pages are a soft white...almost like an ecru...not quite yellow, but very easy on the eyes. There are no illustrations, but they are not at all necessary. The Illustrated Edition has illustrations, but just cannot measure up to the Red Book. It's pages are a bright glossy white...harder on the eyes to read.... and although Alan Lee did some wonderful artwork, it really doesn't add too much to the tale. I am happy I purchased the Red Leatherette Collector's Edition. In addition, I also purchased the Green Leatherette Collector's of the Hobbit.It is also simply beautiful! (Read the Hobbit first. The background in it will help make LOTR make a bit more sense to first time readers.) The two collector's editions make a great set that can be treasured & enjoyed for many years to come! You won't be sorry!!!!
B00006YXEK|5.0|George Harrison's final studio album has turned out to be a true gem and by far his best since Cloud 9. Harrison has influenced me tremendously as both a Beatle and solo musician and have always looked up to him in a spiritual way and also a man. Owning all of his albums, I just couldn't wait to get my hands on this baby and wound up purchasing it on it's initial release date. Of course I ended up buying the one with the bonus DVD, guitar pick, & poster. Unfortuntely, my guitar pick was missing, leading me to wonder how many other people have encountered this exact same problem?<br />On the album, it's really hard to find anything wrong with it as all I have is praise for it. There are no weak tracks or fillers, just a lot of beautiful George Harrison songs with his traditional guitar. The first song to really catch my attention and nearly make me come to tears was the instrumental \\"Marwa Blues\\", in my opinion one of his most beautiful compositions, it tends to have a bit of a Hawaiian feel to it. The first single off the album \\"Stuck Inside A Cloud\\" is perhaps the catchiest tune of the album and just a precious song, up there with any of his previous solo material. \\"Rising Sun\\" has a beautiful string arrangement, a brilliant guitar solo and is also a gem. \\"Never Get Over You\\" sounds like it belongs on the Cloud 9 album, almost make you believe it was an outtake. Other notable tracks are \\"Between The Devil & The Deep Blue Sea\\", \\"Any Road\\", \\"Looking For My Life\\", & the album titled \\"Brainwashed\\" featuring Deep Purple keyboardist Jon Lord.<br />This album was completed by Jeff Lynne (ELO) and Dhani Harrison as George Harrison really left most of these in demo form and a blueprint for the album. Jeff & Dhani couldn't have done a better job!
B000075BFK|5.0|I have never really ever written a review on anything but i think that this should be the time to do it. I just bought 2Pacs new CD Better DayZ. I have listened to 2Pacs music in the past but i have never bought a CD of his. I usually just downloaded and sampled his music. I am really glad that i bought this CD for my first 2Pac CD. Its been what 7 years since his death and yet he is still putting out great albums. The songs on this CD are great. \\"Thugz Mansion\\" is a great song and so is the Acoustic version. I have heard about the beef between 2Pac and Nas but thats in the past. Its time to move on. Nas puts a good touch on the \\"Thugz Mansion\\" Song. The \\"My Block Remix\\" is done very well and so is \\"Ghetto Star.\\" If you are a fan of 2Pac or are just getting into his music then go out and grab the new album \\"Better Dayz.\\" You will enjoy it i guarantee it!!
B000001FQI|5.0|I found this album by accident.  I saw a cassette in a discount bin while on vacation in New Zealand and picked it up for some music in my rental car.  I did not know who Tears for Fears was.<br />I was astonished to find out how good this group is.  From the beginning to the end, it is a consistent collection of powerful, punchy ballads, colorful arrangements, and memorable lyrics. 'Advice for the Young at Heart' can still give me goosebumps and 'Famous Last Words' bring a tear to my eye.  And I love the energy of 'Year of The Knife'.  The songs are written with talent and insight and performed to a high standard.<br />The mark of a good recording is that one doesn't tire of it. This one seems almost as fresh as the day I bought it.
B00005JKZT|4.0|It's difficult for me to say this, but I saw the movie yesterday and expected slighlty more. For example : 1- In the trailer for the 2 Towers there is a piece of music incredibly awsome, in the movie it did not sound that part in any part of the film, 2- I expected an encounter between Gandalf and Frodo, it didn't happen. 3- The music almost did not change compared to the Fellowship of the ring, basically the same score. 4- Definetly, the 2 towers is a different concept, in the Fellowship all the 9 people live the same adventures in a serial way. In the 2 towers, because they are separated, each small group lives their own adventures in a parallel way. Anyway, a great movie !!!.
B00007BH5C|5.0|Yes, Howard Shore is a genius! He has done it again with this capivating and beautiful sounding score. I personally love this soundtrack more than the first. On a scale of 1 to 10, i'd give it fifteen, but in this case, its a 5 out of 5. I highly recommend this masterpiece! SO BUY IT!
B000060P79|1.0|I feel sorry for kids nowadays. I mean, sure, when I was young I admit all I listened to was stuff that was played on the radio or tv. But at least then NIRVANA, STONE TEMPLE PILOTS, SOUNGARDEN, SMASHING PUMPKINS, ect. were the rock that was being played on the countdown. What do high school kids have now? This crap? Maybe they just can't see this manufactured formulaic trash for what it really is now...<br />\\"I'm Just a Kid\\"... Honestly, if you kiddies like this now (which I still don't really understand), I guarentee you'll feel weird listening to this in a few years. The title of the song alone makes my spine ache.<br />Why do I even bother with this review? Well, for one, I'm sick of these dorks taking up valuable airtime on my local rock station that could be better spent playing some real music. Second, maybe I can convince some of you to listen to some of those bands I mentioned earlier in capitals. You have heard of them, right? (these days I dunno).<br />Just cause it's \\"NEW\\" and popular doesn't mean it's good, for crying out loud! Remember that!
B00005O3VC|5.0|I absolutely love this film. It keeps you laughing the whole time, and it doesn't lose a thing in DVD format. The Japanese dubbing of the two best scenes in the movie (Trojan Bunny &amp; Knights of Ni) adds a whole new dimension to the silliness. Between killer bunny rabbits and knights who say Ni! you will have a million and a half laughs.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I love the song &quot;All The Things She Said&quot; ,but actually I love all the songs. I have to listen to the whole cd all the time. It was hard to get at my local stores, but I finally found a copy and I fell in love with the whole cd and I'm glad they have the video on the disc too. Buy the cd you won't disappointed! I wasn't.
B000069AUI|5.0|this is a great alblum and would recomend it to any music lover no matter what music you listen to you would love Coldplay
B000021YQV|5.0|hey you see me pictures crazy all the world I've seen before me passing by, i have nuthing to gain to lose all the world I've seen before me passing by, you dont care bout how i feel - ATWA -system of a down- any band that can write a possitive song about somethin that charles manson did (ATWA is AIR TREES WATER ANIMALS a anti pollution act that was created by manson) has got to be a great band. not to meantion songs like prison song, tapeworm, pushing little children, jet pilot, X, chop suey, pogo, the forrest, atwa, science, shimmy, toxicity, psycho, and ariels. man thats enuf said. l8er peace
B000055WIP|5.0|Alright, it's hard to give this film 5 stars for being a great film (in that I liked it, because I did not), but it is easy to give the film 5 stars because it was so well made.  I can never support this film because in many ways it was blasphemous and offensive; I'm an Italian Catholic and not at all in support of images of the defiling of statues inside of a church or a girl violating herself with a crucifix.<BR>However, this film scared me like no other since (perhaps with the exception of \\"The Ring\\"); I remember watching two-thirds of it in my high school screenplay class and walking out because it bothered me so much.  However, I finished the movie about six months later for a little closure.  Yeah, it was that scary.  There are a few misconceptions about the movie, the most notable being that many claim little Regan was possessed by the devil.  She was not possessed by the devil, but rather by a demon lord called Pazuzu (this was explained in the film, for crying out loud).  I'm no demon expert, nor have I read the book of Enoch,  but I've heard it's supposed to be a lord of the upper planes of hell or something like that.  Anyways...<BR>In recap, I'm not one to ever discount a well-made movie, but whether or not you have faith be forewarned that this is a disturbing movie and will scare the $#*! out of you.  Judging from this, it's hard to tell whether or not this movie should have been made...
B000069AUI|3.0|This album would really have benefitted from having its doors opened and being allowed to run free. Everywhere on this album, you get the impression of lovely songs - but have Coldplay really done what they wanted to do? An answer can be found in their live performances. Live, many of these songs take on new forms, showing that Coldplay want to do more with their music than they are currently doing.<br />We'll start with Politik. This song is apparently the loudest that Coldplay have ever written. This isn't saying much. One UK music mag called it 'loud, fast and angry' - this is trying far too hard to say Coldplay have done more than they have. True the riff is slightly edgier than most of the stuff on Parachutes and true the mood more assertive - but where is the guitar solo that the song cries out for to lift it onto a louder plane? Where is the distortion on the guitar in its riff that would bring across the intensity?<br />Another example is God Put A Smile On Your Face: another that needed to be more daring. Listen to the potential in that haunting, semi-gothic guitar motif where the electric guitar comes in. Why not make more of this - instead the guitars in the chorus become floating and typical. Live this song becomes chaotic, with distorted, frantic guitar work and true energy. On record it sounds devoid of this.<br />Track 7, Green Eyes, meanwhile, is the only song on the album which is actually bad. Its poor drab that reminds of Travis: the epitomy of playing it safe and failing to experiment in any way. The title track could be the exact opposite: everything about it: its chord sequence, the lyrics and the mood suggest a song which is bleak in tone and very dark. Again, live, the chorus guitar is madly distorted. Yet again the studio version is crushed with the guitar becoming floaty and boring. <br />The really gentle songs on this album are satisfying because you know thats what they're meant to be like, but the ones with a hint of menace are infuriating because they've been brought down to the gentleness of the other tracks. <br />Overall, this is a lovely album, and as a record in itself deserves 4 stars, but the frustration I felt at how great it could have been if Coldplay had dared to do what they really wanted and got that onto the record means that I can only give it 3. Nevertheless, the hope is that with the next record they will be established enough to be allowed to try something broader and give these songs the arrangements and production that really suits them.
B000069HK2|5.0|the used is a great band with a great cd. the best songs are the taste of ink, a box full of sharp objects,blue and yellow, and buried myself alive. overall the used is a great new band with a great new cd that is a must buy cd!!!!
B00005JL96|1.0|I was shocked at the way the Lilo character was dipicted in this sickening film from Disney.<br />First off, Lilo brutally beats a little girl mercilessly simply because she disagrees with her.<br />Then, her older sister jay-walks then kicks a car and throws an insult at the driver for no reason.<br />Next, we see Lilo living in a house of pure filth and her older sister leaves the stove on while she's not at home. It saddened me to see Lilo's older sister threaten violence against Lilo and then Lilo responds with horrid insults against her sister.<br />This is a very disturbing image of what Disney calls \\"an alternative family\\". This film has absolutely no redeeming value can not teach your child anything about life that he or she couldn't already learn from the gutter...
B000002UAU|5.0|1967, the 'Summer Of Love', and the press speculating about what has happened to The Beatles?<br />Well they was recording a 20th Century meisterwork which was to revolutionise the role of the album in rock music.<br />First there was the full on colour album sleeve, and for the first time, printed lyrics.<br />The music itself drags the listener in all directions and moods, but the album can be enjoyed by anyone and everyone.<br />The album opens with Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, an excellent up-tempo rock song with directly leads into the second anthem-style song 'With A Little Help From My Friends'.<br />After this (until the Sgt Pepper reprise leading into the 'A Day In The Life' climax) the album meanders through a variety of musical styles - notably Indian-influenced 'Within You Without You', Julian Lennon influenced 'Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds' (not LSD as some of the media assumed) and 'Being For The Benefit Of Mr Kite' - derived from an 1843 Circus Poster.<br />'Getting Better', 'When I'm Sixty Four', 'Lovely Rita', 'Good Morning Good Morning' and 'Fixing A Hole' make up the rest of the album and cover all aspects of life and age groups ('Getting Better' is about school and 'When I'm Sixty Four' was written about Macca's Dad!)<br />'She's Leaving Home' deserves special praise for me with an emotional and fantastic use of harps and violins.   <br />The album closes with 'A Day In The Life' with the orchestral climax and heavy piano chord, but never wishing to end an album so clinically, a few seconds after this, a dog's whistle is sounded and after that, some nonsense chatter added onto the end of the record (which originally would run ad infinitum).<br />This album is a must have for any Beatles fan, and a must listen for anyone else.<br />Peace.
B000000Y59|4.0|...after Newport and \\"Kind of Blue.\\" Evans' spare, minimalist instrumentation left you wanting more of his music.  And here you get more -- and less: a trio, with Evans' chord/silence/chord style leaving you hanging on every note.  \\"Blue in Green\\" is great, his stake on authorship of the song; only a few \\"Autumn Leaves\\" have been as colorful and mellow;  \\"Someday My Prince Will Come,\\" predated Miles' version and influenced in subtly; and Evans does delicate things to the old standby \\"What is this thing called love?\\"    I'd buy it if I were you.
B00007BH5C|5.0|After seeing the movie and listening to the soundtrack several times over, I really can't make up my mind which of the two movies has the better soundtrack.  One thing is clear, though.  This is not simply the Fellowship score with a few additions.  I know some people have posted otherwise, butI respectfully disagree.  There is music to tie us back to the first movie, but most is all brand new.  In fact, Shore has done a wonderful job linking the music without simply rehashing it.<br />My favorite is the score for the riders of Rohan.  It features a Norweigan fiddle and is absolutely beautiful. <br />Admittedly, there isn't a lot in the way of lighthearted and comforting music in this one, like there was in the Shire and Rivendell in the Fellowship.  However, this is a darker film, and the music fits it wonderfully.<br />This is a CD worth buying, especially for Rohan's theme.
B00000IMTF|5.0|No enough words in a foreign language to describe such magnificent album !!!<br />Blackmore`s best as a rock musician. A must for all Blackmore followers.<br />Tarot Woman,Stargazer and Light in the black are also a must for everyone who appreciate this kind a music.<br />Sorry Amazon.com only offers 5 stars, this album deserves 10 !!
B00006IUOZ|4.0|Great job by Al Pacino and also Robin Williams.  They play<br />off of each other and some of the other town folks well.<br />Let's have more of this duo, although I don't know if we<br />want to see Williams in this kind of role too often.<br />Maybe blend in with his super radio dj in \\"Good Morning<br />Vietnam.\\" As a radio person, I use his performance there<br />as my early morning drive-time standard.<br />Anyway, check out this film ---fine script, super acting and<br />the wonders of the Alaskan summer, and small town life.<br />However, as a resident of Arctic Alaska, I found the town in Insomnia to be quite civilized and rather urbane, compared with<br />some of the real Alaskan bush communities.  The local restaurant<br />and its menu were almost Seattle-like, not Alaska bush.<br />And it is fairly easy to sleep in the midnight sun, despite Pacino's aversion to sunlight at midnight and beyond.  The<br />big trick is to keep going in the winter when the sun<br />stays below the horizon for several months.  Let's see a sequel with that kind<br />of backdrop!<br />If you are from outside of Alaska, check out the film and<br />then come on up and experience this last frontier for yourself.<br />Enjoy, and bring some aluminum foil in the summer if you need<br />to shut out sunshine coming through your window through the<br />\\"night.\\"
B00005JL96|5.0|I've always shied away from Disney...maybe cause Bambi and Dumbo always made me cry as a kid (I was born in '73), and because I felt like Disney was lately (80's on) going for a very simplistic kind of plotline, with average animation (do all the girls have to have huge, doe-like, eyes?).<BR>With Lilo &amp; Stitch, a very real, very human plotline comes to life. Lilo and Stitch are basically outcasts (I've always loved the 'underdog' role) who aren't sure where they fit in, in their respective (human, and alien) societies. They have the same misfit outlooks on life, and when Stitch is banished from alien society (the product of a 'mad genetic scientist'), he at first lives up to his reputation of being a character of destruction...but soon becomes a 'lost soul' of sorts...searching for a family to call his own...there are references to the 'Ugly Duckling' story...which I always had a very soft spot for in my youthful heart, and remember crying a lot over this little story...a lost little being looking for acceptance...this is the heart and soul of Lilo &amp; Stitch...<BR>If you find yourself rooting for an underdog, with a little bit of bad manners, this is the story for you. I found myself rooting, laughing, cheering for both characters...there is no finer movie to lift the spirits and make one believe that the underdog can come up and blow everyone away!<BR>And, I dare say, that little Stitch is the cutest animation to come along since Roger Rabbit and Dumbo...truly precious!
B00006JJ1O|5.0|t.A.T.u's '200 km/h in the Wrong Lane' is a complete sucess.  I just can't will myself to take the cd out of my cd player.  Julia Volkova and Lena Katina from Moscow, Russia have &quot;#1&quot; written all over them.  Great songs ranging from the upbeat &quot;Not Gonna Get Us&quot; to more serious &quot;Stars,&quot; all of these songs will be played on radio stations nonstop.  I highly recommend this cd, buy it and experiece this for yourself!
B00005QIPH|5.0|If the Strokes really ARE the future of rock and roll, then the world is saved. This is definantly one of the most exciting bands out there. Their music is truly genius, and anyone who tells you otherwise has NO taste in music. This CD is defiantly a must for any music fan.
015626224X|5.0|If you like very good writing with no frills, Orwell is your man.  In this work he has a lot to say: Orwell spent a good bit of his life in poverty in Paris and London.  He describes what it is like to be poor, both in the universal sense and comparing the experience in London and Paris of his day (Paris comes out seeming much superior).  Orwell includes not only interesting tales of these days of little, but also delves into the psychological and political meanings behind the world of poverty.  He makes you think and entertains.<br />More importantly is the writing style.  It is so crisp, so economical.  There are no games here, just tight language, well chosen lines and words.  It moves well but must have been a very delibertaive process when being put down.  Lets hope some of our long-winded New-Yorker type modern writers will learn to write like this past master soon!
B00002E23E|1.0|I have always loved Zep...but give me a studio performance, please!  Robert Plant seemed to be singing to and for himself.  Stairway To Heaven was OK but even that lacked any semblence of energy.  I give the one star for the amusement my teenaged son got from seeing Jimmy Page play guitar with a bow.  Even that got boring as it droned on and on.  <br />This DVD starts off with a 20's-style mob hit that I never figured out what it had to do with the rest of it.  Maybe you gotta be stoned to enjoy this one; I wasn't, and I didn't.<br />I truly do enjoy their music.  But this one was truly a stinker all the way around.  The sound was terrible.  No matter how we tried, we couldn't get it adjusted right.  If you can find this one for a buck at a garage sale, that'd be okay...maybe.  I'm afraid this one'll sit on our video shelf for a long, long time before it ever sees the inside of the DVD player again.
B000002P5W|5.0|To all you out there who were not around when this genius was alive, to all of you who were not yet born and never got to see him play, all I can say is buy this CD! All of them! Buy the live sets, put on a pair of headphones, close your eyes, and pray to the higher forces of the Universe that He comes back. This is one of the greatest musical artists that ever walked on Earth, a 20th century Mozart. Jimi and Wolfy would have really rocked together.      All bow down before the altar of Hendrix. Every song is a little gem to be examined from each angle, like a ruby or a sapphire or an emerald. Each has its own color, own vibe and own eternal energy. My favorites? Little Miss Lover, Spanish Castle Magic, Little Wing (listen to him do it live at London Royal Albert Hall if you can...heartrending). But I also love \\"You Got Me Floatin', One Rainy Wish, Bold As Love...32 years Later, I cherish these songs as the greatest art I have witnessed in my life.    I first saw him play at lunchtime on the UCLA campus at noon. After that, I saw him play anywhere I could get to, and that included flying to San Diego or San Francisco or wherever! He changed my entire life, everything. He was plugged into some kind of energy. In concert, he could make you feel like a warm sirocco wind was  blowing across your body, or a fire was burning above your head, or we were all swimming together in some kind of mystical warm turquoise gold-flecked cosmic ocean. He made you believe in God, stars, forces of the universe. Anything was possible. It took weeks to recover every single time I heard him play. What an aura this guy had around him! Sheer magic!    I miss him every day of my life, and you guys out there have nothing like this in your lives, which is a shame. My heart aches when I think of him, and I want him to come back. I am so grateful I had the opportunity to have heard him.
B00005A46T|5.0|Ok, I'll admit, it took me awhile to actually get this CD. But now that I have it I'm glad I do. Alot of people don't like Slipknot because they say they are profane. Well I say these people are just closed-minded.<br />If you liked Slipknot's self-titled second CD (the independently released \\"Mate,feed,kill,repeat was their first) You'll like this album, the band has discovered more of their sound, the instruments sound better, and Corey sings more on this album than the other (don't worry there is still plenty of screaming)<br />Oh, but if you really don't like cussing, don't bother with this CD.
B000002JPA|2.0|Thanks for the singer I rate it two stars. The guy is simply ANNOYING!!! I just can´t stand his vocals. Anyway, they are fit for Dream Theater, because most of the time these guys are not playing rock and roll or hard rock, they´re just stating to themselves: \\"LOOK HOW GOOD WE ARE! LOOK OUR TIME CHANGES, OUR VELOCITY, LOOK, LOOK!! LOOK AOUR SCREAMING HAIR METAL SINGER\\"<br />The proof that trhis band ios nor for any taste is that it reached cult status: you cané give a less positive review that you´re attacked by all of its \\"Intelligent\\" and \\"Music experts\\" fans...
B000066F6H|5.0|This band has more energy than any I have ever seen before. This si quite possibly the BEST punk album in the last 10 years or so. Who says swedes can't rock? From sincere screaming vocals to fastpaced energenic rock music to lyrics that are sooo cool its unbelievable, this band is flat out amazing.
B00000099Y|5.0|i got into tool far to late, this is the first tool album i bought. as soon as i heard the first track (the dark and powerful giant of an opener 'stinkfist') i started kicking myself,\\"why didn't you buy this cd years ago\\". this album is awesome, in every possible way. it offers brilliant tracks such as 'forty six and two' and the breath-taking title track 'anemia' which will leave you speachless. the only downpoint of this album are the slightly irratating interlude-type tracks like 'useful idiot' (about 10 seconds of weird fuzzing noises), but really, the 'proper' tracks are by far enough to back up any downpoints on this great album. so buy this album, without question and become happy.
B000021XS0|1.0|I am having a difficult time understanding what the terms \\"progressive,\\" \\"experimental,\\" or \\"conceptual\\" are supposed to mean regarding the rock music I am hearing from this band.   It seems to me a front--a rather [sad] excuse for letting the lyrics be ridiculous, the soloing obnoxious, and the form of each song ultimately uninteresting, collapsing under the weight of the pretentious \\"big meaning\\" behind it all.  <BR>     Whatever these guys are trying to convey with \\"Scenes from a Memory\\" does not cover up for the fact that they are nothing more than show-offs, hopping and skipping around their instruments as if necessary burdens in their incredible and profound artistic endeavors.  While there is an idea apparent in this recording, it is not even in the same league with an album like Radiohead's \\"OK Computer\\" or Bjork's \\"Homogenic.\\"  <BR>     Dream Theater needs to freshen up on the work of their contemporaries before they continue labeling their music \\"progressive.\\"
B00005JKZT|5.0|I remembered well from my initial attempts at reading the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" at age 10 that \\"The Two Towers\\" was where I gave up, and hoped that Peter Jackson could work his magic at converting arguably the slowest of the Tolkien books into an epic movie. Where Jackson did a stunning job in bringing the Shire and then the individuals of the Fellowship to life in the previous movie, here I thought he had a more colossal task in front of him.  \\"Towers\\" lacked the whimsy of the  Bag End sequences in \\"Fellowship\\", replacing the fun Hobbits with stilted dialogue between anonymous human soldiers. I shouldn't have worried, of course.<br />There are three areas in which \\"The Two Towers\\" excels as a storytelling achievement.<br />The Story: Jackson and three other scriptwriters depart from their \\"Fellowship\\" path by taking real liberties with the Tolkien novel. The book that's come to be known as \\"Towers\\" -- really the middle two \\"books\\" of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" -- suffers in that Frodo, Sam and the Ring do not appear until the second half. The movie amends that by redividing its structure equally between Frodo/Sam, Aragorn/Legolas/Gimli, and Merry/Pippin, the three surviving branches of the Fellowship. Considerable more time is spent, of course, on the epic battle at Helm's Deep, in which Aragorn proves his nascent leadership skills to the evolving race of Man. Frodo for his part takes an unexpected detour amonst men, as the character of Faramir (whose brother perished in the last film) becomes far more obsessed by the lure of the Rings than he did in the book. Jackson takes us through the bombardment of Osgiliath -- only alluded to in the book -- and thus allows Sam Gamgee's heroism to be proven at a critical moment.<br />This is important because of what the \\"Two Towers\\" movie doesn't include: a substantial slice of the action from the novel.  You won't get to see the Palantir hurled from the ruins of Saruman's tower, and, most importantly, Frodo, Sam and Gollum do not cross over into Mordor. Jackson & co. deferred a lot of the plot of \\"Towers\\" for the final movie, but they've expanded what's left into a seamless, structurally intact, movie of its own.<br />Helm's Deep: The previous gold standard in movie battle sequences was \\"Barry Lyndon\\". A line of soldiers in period costume marching shoulder to shoulder along the length of 70mm film, to the fife and drum strains of \\"The British Grenadiers\\", is going to be hard to top. Jackson, rather than hire 10,000 extras wearing grotesque latex masks, used sophisticated software to simulate large chunks of the battle, while the most important moments are achieved by close-up shots of actors and stuntmen (a far more satisfying balance than achieved in the almost entirely-digital fights of \\"Spider-Man\\"). The battle at Helm's Deep runs about an hour and sustains interest throughout. The tone of the battle progresses from fearful to dim to triumphan, as a long-missing character rides in to save the day with second digital army.<br />The Digital Spectacle: Let's face it, computerized graphic imaging (CGI) can seem a tremendous step backwards in special effects at times. The Jar Jar Binks presence in the first \\"Star Wars\\" prequel was about as convincingly integrated into the film as were the cartoon characters in 1947's \\"Song of the South\\". Spider-Man's recent efforts flight resembled nothing so much as Mighty Mouse. Here, Jackson has taken a tremendous leap forward by turning Gollum into a Ray Harryhausen effect: Gollum appears on screen all spidery, herky-jerky, more like the stop-motion Beast from 20,000 Fathoms than how you might expect a thousand year-old hobbit to actually move.  Which isn't bad -- this proves that the concept of \\"digital actors\\" is getting easier to realize, month by month.  And the Gollum design is absolutely grotesque and far more imaginative than could have been attained by a man in a rubber mask.<br />The real triumph of the film is Treebeard. A bizarre plot point in \\"Lord of the Rings\\" is here wonderfully rendered in terrific CGI. The plot point (just a chapter or two in the book) is dragged out across the whole of the film's three hours, as the Ents slowly uproot themselves into action, but the script alters the structure of the Ents sequence and thus allows for a more visually compelling conclusion.<br />The lesson of \\"Two Towers\\" is that less is not always more. Jackson shows what Tolkien only alludes to on the printed page, and restructures the script so that a three-hour movie seems as effortless and fun to watch as something half the length.  This will be a film to see at least twice in the theater, and repeatedly on DVD late next year.
B000002B7U|2.0|This, according to Ozzy himself, is his worst album. He used to call it &quot;THE ULTIMATE DIN...&quot;<br />And I´d like to make a correction to the reviewer MILERGY72 (in the &quot;Spotlight review&quot;). He says that these are some of the most profound Ozzy lyrics, but that the songs simply did not help. I agree about the songs (that´s why I rate this album 2 stars only), but I must warn him that Ozzy simply did not write the lyrics for this album (nor for BLIZZARD, DIARY and BARK AT THE MOON). Bob Daisley did it, as he did for the aforementioned albums. For ULTIMATE SIN, Daisley and Jake Lee were completing the songs sctructures, when Ozzy had a fall-out with Daisley and he left the band. Shortly after, Ozzy sended him the tapes and asked him to write the lyrics. Daisley did it.
B00006BTCA|5.0|INTERPOL gives us the rawness of their beloved New York. They provide hope to those of us who LOVED the post-punk genre pioneered by Echo & The Bunnymen, Joy Division, The Chameleons, The Cure, Television, and even Bauhaus. However, this band should never be LIMITED by comparisons to greatness of the past, nor greatness of present day Strokes, Hives, or The Walkmen; they have whole-heartedly done this on their own. They are a simple band, with a simple sound, and simply AMAZING.
B00006F7S4|1.0|While I loved Mutations and thought Odelay was pretty good, I can't get into this one. 3 tries and each time I was ready to fling it across the room. Man, I can dig sad, but this is just downright incoherent and dull. Maybe if you are floating on acid it might work.
B000002UAU|2.0|With all due respect to nostalgia, if one is honest about it there are two (yes, two!) good songs on this album: Sgt. Pepper and A Day In the Life.<br />Given the artist and the time that's lapsed, this piece has become bigger than life, and it's really unwarranted. There is a try at psychedelia with Lucy, but it's really only the title that invokes anything psychedlic, and the rest of the album is just filled with average offerings: Mr. Kite, Fixing A Hole, Getting Better, Help From My Friends...zzz.  We also have to suffer through George's Within You, Without You.<br />Look, the cover art is neat, but don't confuse it with the music. 2-stars.
B000075BFK|5.0|I think this cd is really good too...hes tha best rapper of all time and he alwayz will be 4EVA
B000002UV9|5.0|This is an excellent cd. It has both the songs, guitatr work, production, and right themes for the time. Best I can high energy feel, silent lucidity (the hit) with melancholoy feel, Empire  good guitar riff timely, true message for the time, jet city woman good guitar work feel takes it through. This cd has it all hard rock, high energy, somberness and great songs.
6304698658|5.0|This is by far the best Christmas movie of all time.  What makes it even better for me is I only view this movie once a year on Christmas Eve.  Now it is hard to do, but it makes it about fifty times better.  The movie stars Chevy Chase as Clark Griswold, a father and husband who wants the best for his family but always manages to lure disasters upon them, not to mention himself.<br />Even from the opening scene in the film, Clark nearly creates an early death for the family.  Beverly D' Angelo returns as Clark's uptight wife Hellen.  Now one thing that you should know about Clark is that he always gives 110% with everything he does.  His Christmas tree is about 15 feet tall, and his Christmas lights cause an energy loss throughout the entire city of Chicago. <br />Unlike the other Vacation films, the Griswolds stay home for Christmas and invite just about every relative they have to celebrate the holiday with them.  Even the ones they don't invite show up.  This would be none other than Clark's budweiser-filled Uncle Eddie along with his wife Katherine and two children.  Not to mention a doberman pincher that won't stop destroying the house.<br />\\"Christmas Vacation\\" is a movie that will be sure to attract laughs and will have you wishing it were Christmas everyday of the year!
B000002B1M|4.0|Let me first say that this album doesn't even compare to illmatic. But i dont expect nas to ever make an album better then illmatic or even close to it. Dont get me wrong, It Was Written is still a great album though. The Message starts this album off on a good note; a mezmorizing beat and great lyrics make this song one of the best on the album. Also, I Gave U Power strengthens the album by rapping as a gun. If you dont understand what that means, you probably wont until you pick up the album and check it out for yourself.
B0000524CY|5.0|The Exorcist- The Scariest Movie Of All Time. Everything people say about this movie is all true. It's terrifying, dramatic, compelling, edge of your seat entertainment. You have not seen terror if you have not seen this. Don't let the date it was made scare you off, this film is still amazing even today. It is the most gripping film ever, a major roller coaster ride of a movie that once you get on, there's no getting off.<br />This movie brings out emotions inside you that have never been used. The horror of seeing an innocent little girl becoming a vicious demon is just priceless. It doesn't rely on cheap scares like people with masks jumping out of closets or anything like that. When watching it, you feel your whole life revolving around the movie, swirling uncontrollably. The whole movie has a dense sense of pure evil to it, the kind that makes you want to leave your skin at the seat. Even with the huge feeling you get to turn to movie off at extremely intense parts is overcome by your passion to keep your eyes glued to the screen, trying not even to blink.<br />These are the feelings I got while watching, and I'm guessing most every human would experience them too. Now onto the DVD review: The extras are a little disappointing, but the movie itself with great picture quality that makes evil jump from the screen and sound that makes you fear for your life is worth the price alone. All trailers are good while I'm a little upset that there is no \\"Making Of.\\" All else is fine, packaging, commentary, and other special features worth checking out. However, I felt the ending was a little too extended, but don't let that stop you.<br />Don't consider yourself a brave person until you have seen The Exorcist. It is the king of horror movies and shouldn't be missed by anyone. See this...you won't be sorry you took the time you did.
B000068802|5.0|This is no doubt the best CD I have ever listened to! Buy this album and help support the best band ever!
B00007E8V4|4.0|\\"Steal this album\\" is a good out take cd. The greatest nu metal band System of a down has released another good cd, with good songs such as \\"Innervision\\", \\"Chicken Stu\\", and \\"Boom\\". Even though this is good, System of a down have done much better than this on their album \\"Toxicity\\". This album doesn't deserve a 5 for the fallowing reasons:<br />1. Instead of making a whole cd that is good, this album has the average \\"3-5 good songs\\" on it.<BR>2.\\"Still this Album\\" happens to be fairly boring.Most of the other songs tend to get boring after the first minute.<br />System of a down still reigns the best nu metal.
B0000029GA|5.0|This album is one of the greatest hip-hop albums of all time. It shows everyone what real hip-hop is truely about. Its not about money, cars, bling-bling, and all that other corny stuff that rappers are making their dough off of now; its about nas's perspective of life from the hood and some of his experiences in his short life of 20 years. So if you are you enjoy street hip-hop i suggest you pick this album up immediately.
B00006AFF5|4.0|see this movie.  I admit it.  I am a HUGE Grinch fan.  The cartoon is my favorite Christmas cartoon ever.  So, when I heard they were remaking it, I was appalled.  I swore I would never ever ever watch it.<br />Then, when it was out on cable, I saw most of it.  I missed the very beginning but only that.  I was caught.  I got drawn in against my will and really wound up liking this movie.  <br />It's true to the original while filling in the rest of the time with a working variation of the theme.  The casting is excellent, as as noted by a lot of other people, Carrey does a fantastic job. The scenery and costumes are amazing.  The town seems as though it could really exist.<br />So, yeah... I didn't want to see and I certainly didn't want to like.  But once I *did* see it, I couldn't help but like it.  I think you'd have to be a grinch to not even give it a chance.  It's special and good in it's own way.<br />Not that it'd ever replace the original cartoon.  But this is a lovely and fun companion to it.
B000060P79|5.0|Simple Plan is one of the best new bands around!  They have a great sound and a hot lead singer!  The cd can explain just how you feel at a certain time.  I call it &quot;Me as a cd&quot; because the lyrics are so true to my life! Simple Plan Rocks!!
B00005V9QJ|4.0|Sade's music is intimate, and yet it translates better than expected in a live performance.  It's true that her performance seems better suited to a cocktail lounge than to a massive auditorium, but she and the group respond well to the larger audience.  Of course, that audience does become a bit of a pain.  The reaction of the audience does seem louder and more annoying than is expected in a live album.<br />This is of course, an edited version of the concert and so we miss out on some of the songs and some of the moments of the total concert.  And that is a shame.  <br />However, it is Sade Adu, and it is the group Sade, and they all have some great moments that are captured on this recording.  If you're not familiar with the music of Sade, I would suggest first listening to &quot;Diamond Life&quot; or &quot;The Best of Sade&quot;.  And if you are familiar with Sade Adu and her group's music, this does present the music you know in a new light.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|U should buy this cd it is the best. it tell all the thing in a teens life and there lesbians so what. it has 30 minites,show me love. and ALL THE THINGS SHE SAID!
B000069CWE|4.0|OK, u hybrid theory nuts arent gonna like this cd.  I will admit, Hybrid Theory is better than this CD. Hybrid theory wasnt on the sales chart for no reason though. That cd is tough to follow up. But many songs are made better on Reanimation. Paper Cut and Runaway are absolutely awesome. They killed In the End, but that song wasnt that good the first time.  I personally like the old rendition of forgotten, but the remix gives it a whole new flavor and personality.  By the way, if your getting this cd for One Step Closer and Crawling Remixes, you will be disappointed.  Jonathan Davis and Aaron Lewis are great artists, but the remixed linkin park doesnt complement themk.
B00005OM4N|3.0|Britney Spears new Album \\"Britney\\" is supposted to be all about Britney Spears developing her own style of music, and about her becoming more of a woman. But heres whats going on, her new CD \\"Britney\\" didnt go 12x Platinum like her 1st CD \\"Baby One More Time\\" and it didnt go 9x Platinum like her CD \\"Oops I Did It Again\\", but this new CD is sooo dull that it probably didnt even go over 1x platinum. The reason is \\"lack of Max Martin\\". If it wasnt for Max Martin she would probably be nothing, he's the reason she's famous today. I think in her 4th Album she should drop the Neptunes and go back to Max Martin. Because if she doesnt do that then she will probably be a lost wonder forever. But I'm gonna give this CD some credit because it has about 4 Max Martin song's in it. I don't mean to DIS Britney Spears because I'm a huge fan of her personally. I was very dissapointed when I first heard \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\". Because it was a different style of music. But this album's main concern was getting rid of the \\"teeneybopper\\" image.
6302293553|5.0|Monty Python and the Holy Grail is full of laughs and ongoing jokes throughout the entire movie. It includes the Trojan Rabbit, Coconuts, Swallows, the Knights Who Say \\"Ni!\\" shrubberies, Scene 24, the French tauntings, the Bridge of Death, the Black Knight, the hand turning the pages, and the Rabbit guarding the cave of Carbano. <br />This movie is hilarious and has the Monty Python gang(Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin) in the main roles as King Arthur, Sir Bedemear, Sir Lancelot, Sir Galahad, and Sir Robin.<br />This is definately one of the best comedies in the history of time, so rent it, buy it, whatever, just watch it.
B00000K0E5|5.0|Bond came back from a seven year hiatus after Timothy Dalton departed after two films with the high tech and high energy Goldeneye.  Bond now is trying to stop rouge Russian Terrorists and a bitter former MI6 agent out for revenge by stealing a powerful new satellite that emits a powerful electormagnic pulse that wipes out all electrical devices in the blast radius.  <br />The plot is somewhat typical for a Bond film, but what else do you expect?  What sets this one apart, like many of Connery Bond outings, is the way the cast and crew go about presenting it to you.  They are compelling action sequences like Bond rampaging aroung St. Petersburg in a tank and the finale in a satellite cradle in Cuba.  Next, Bronsnan was perfectly cast and fits the sarcastic, boyish persona that is Bond like cat leather on Britney Spears.  For God sake's if Bond were a real person he would look like Pierce.  <br />Also, the direction was done with the idea of getting a rise out of the audience and making them remember Bond in a for the new millenium.  Rarely has a bond film been this action packed but still not make you snore a little bit at the interplay between the Bond girls and M (I don't mention Q because Desmond Lleywn because he was always a delight God bless him).  <br />To conclude, the machine behind the Bond franchise at least got this one right with a memorable lead, sexy girls, kinetic direction and a cocksure attidude that had been missing from the bond films for a while.  Grab the popcorn and treat yourself to a Bond film for the ages.
B00004Z459|5.0|I bought Reanimation before i could get ahold of this one(sale stats dont lie, it was hard to find).  Hybrid Theory is better than reanimation, if for no other reason...its completely random. One second you'll be listening to mike shinoda rhyme then all of a sudden chester comes in yelling.  Its a great combination.  This is one of the best CDs i've heard in a long time and it is one of the rare cds where you wont want to skip a single song.<BR>Paper Cut-My favorite song on the cd (remix is even better)<BR>One Step Closer-Very Good, very catchy, and even better cranked up<BR>Crawling-Great song, slower than the rest but seems to have the most meaning of them all<BR>In The End-Good song, but overplayed, and overrated<BR>Runaway-Also a great song<BR>I could gush for awhile but i'm gonna shut up now
B00005JKZT|5.0|Pick at the flaws if you will (this movie deviates the most from the books) but Jackson's adaption of the \\"Two Towers\\" is an emotionally urgent, fierce, and seamless forward march in the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  A word of caution, the movie begins in media res.  You get no prolouge or get put up to speed with a quick recollection of scenes from the Fellowship.<br />We catch up with the fractured members of the Fellowship.  Aragorn (Viggo Mortenson), Gimli (John Ryes-Davis) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom) are off to find and rescue the Hobbits Merry and Pippin from a band of orcs that made off with them at the end of the last film.  We also catch up with Sam (Sean Astin) and Frodo (Elijah Wood) as they try to make their way through the Rocky terrain of Emin Myul to make their way to Mordor to destroy the Ring of Power.  We also see Gollum, a wonder of CGI and masterfully voiced by Andy Serkis.  Eventually, we make our way to Rohan where Saruman (Christopher Lee) has begun his assault on the lands of men. A pawn of Saruman's has taken control of the King and put the influence of Saruman in him.  King Theoden (Bernard Hill)  is powerless on his throne.  This all can get very confusing, especially if you have not recently seen the first movie, which I strongly suggest you do.<br />The performances all around are charged with emotion and feeling, and the story's themes come through loud and clear.  Frodo is beginning to wain under the pressure of the Ring.  The lands of men are growing ever more weak and vulnerable to the growing might of the mordor and Isengard.  infact, the whole of middle Earth is starting to despair, now that they are faced with forces the like of which they have not seen in thousands of years.<br />And for those who want to see blood, guts and grand film war, Jackson delivers some of the most spectacular battle sequences ever caught on film.  Helm's Deep is one that will take your breath away.  Not to mention the opening scene of Gandalf and the Balrog and in the finale when the Ents that Merry and Pippin met in Fangorn Forest storm the walls of Isengard.  And also the scene where the soldiers of Rohan fight Isengard orcs riding ferocious beasts that Saruman had in waiting in his underground caverns.<br />Even with all those high standards, there are a few minor flaws.  For one, Treebeard the head Ent is hard to understand some of the time, we cannot make out what he is saying.   The next is the battle scene at Helm's Deep  goes on just a little too long before it all ends.  But one thing I would like to point out is the matter of the love story between Aragorn and Arwen.  This could have easily have ended up as filler between the film's stronger scenes but instead, we get a haunting vision of their relationship both in the past when Aragorn left Rivendell for the Fellowship and also in their future when Aragorn finally succombs to age and Arwen must live on because she is immortal.<br />To conclude, this is undoutably one of the best adventure/fantasy/action film in the history of movies.  There is grand specacle but it does not cover the story.  To leave you with one final word, you may have to see the movie more than once to fully appreciate it.  I am going later this week to see it one more time, and maybe again, and again, and again, and agian...
B00003CXDB|5.0|Oliver Stone captures Wall Street in the 1980s in this film.<br />Looking back from the perch of 2002, Gordon Gekko's &quot;greed is good&quot; speech is a precursor of today's accounting scandals.  Not that Wall Street has changed.  The sales manager in this film is perfect.  He personifies the &quot;what have you done for me lately&quot; attitude that pervades transaction-based finance.<br />This great film transcends time.
6304576935|5.0|Reviewer: Reginald D. Garrard from Camilla, GA USA<br />Space battles and political intrigue may abound in contemporary sci-fi but the characters portrayed onscreen are remembered long after the last explosion or assassination occurs. &quot;First Contact&quot;, the second feature with the cast of the &quot;Next Generation&quot; series stands out because of the brilliance of Patrick Stewart, Alfre Woodard, Alice Krige, and Oscar nominee James Cromwell. The verbal bouts between Stewart's &quot;Picard&quot; and Woodard's &quot;Lilly&quot; are flawless; Krige's seductive and malevolent Borg queen is villainy at its best; and Cromwell deftly portrays Zephraim Cochran, a scientist torn between his desire to complete the initial warp drive test and the adoration bestowed on him by the futuristic crew for his achievements.<br /><br />Trek has always been more than just a story about space exploration; it is a tale of humanity and its ongoing improvement. The film shows all that is good about mankind, even if it's in the guise of a space opera.
B00006690G|5.0|i think that this cd offers everything you could ask for from emeinem. its genuis, and i think that everyone that says \\"bla bla bla, offensive, same stuff, bla bla\\" should wonder why they bought it in the first place.  buyer beware, this is Eminem were talking about here. its nothing for the children. If you listened to the previouse albums, then you know his style.  i'll admit it's kinda repetitive, but he's a genuis at work.  by the way, i'm not a big rap fan, more rock (KoRn, system of a down, led zeppelin, rolling stones, beatles, MSI, hed pe etc). i like rap but not to into it. eminem is hardcore, thats why i like him.  if your lookin for (stupid to be saying this anyways) jay z, nas, 2 pac, biggie, puff daddy, or flashy cars big money kinda thing, your way outa luck.  <br />Beats: grand, but it could have been better i think. the tracks are all good, but i'll say that some of the beats weren't as good as the previous cd's were. Their were some really good ones though. i give the beats a 8/10 compared to the other albums.<br />Lyrics: dirty, grand, explicit, and expressive. This guy is one of the best rappers out their IN MY OPINION. I gotta say that this album is top notch, like all the other albums in the past, in the lyrical point of view. His words are really discriptive as well. man oh man this guy can flow. the topics are a little overdone, but overdone with style, i could say. 10/10<br />Overall: ill call this album last place.  its REALLY GOOD, but it doesnt top his previouse albums by a long run. i give it a 10/10
B00005RHGK|4.0|I'm a big fan of the horror movie genre and this movie is definitely one of the best and underrated.  I liked the fact that the movie went with a family angle (brother/sister) rather than another overused &quot;romantic couple getaway that turned deadly&quot; kind of film. Another aspect of the film that works is the dialogue. I can't remember their names, but the brother/sister duo had great chemistry together. The movie lives up to its title and I did find it creepy. Another refreshing factor in the movie is the ending. Many horror movies have a certain formula but this one went against your typical hollywood ending. Overall, if you like being scared, this'll do it to you. I didn't give the film 5 stars though because I feel like it ended too quickly and didn't cover enough ground. Hopefully a sequel is in the works and will be a continuation.
B000007XUQ|5.0|After Karen Carpenter passed away, \\"Christmas Portrait\\", and \\"Old Fashioned Christmas\\" were just 33 1/3 LP records, with the move to CD right after that time. The retitled \\"Christmas Portrait\\" CD contained tracks from both LPs (Warning, there are quite a number of items from the CD \\"Portrait\\" on *this* CD) but omitted a number of Karen's songs, in favor of some drivel from Richard on piano. In other words with a 74 minute CD time, Richard could have produced *just about* all the Karen material<br />But did not. And this was NOT the era of the home CD recorder!  I know there was at least one (now mostly forgotten solo record from Richard.)   Richard, sorry, we love you man, but you were *not* the reason we listened.  Karen was.<br />The 2 CD set puts all to right, with ALL the extact material from both albums on 2 CDs (about 51 min. each)  It is very well remastered, with good (but not silly) dynamic range.  I have both LPs, and the 1990 CD, but \\"sucker\\" I am, I *wanted* those missing items (besides *now* can remaster to my heart's content without having to convert LPs)<br />If you have the CD \\"Portrait\\" (as I said lots of material already there), you may not want this.  If you have the right equipment and want to make the one CD Carpenters Christmas album you *really* wanted...
B00005Y228|3.0|I wasn't a fan of Kylie Minogue before hearing the song \\"Can't get U out of my head\\" earlier this year. But that track alone was worth getting the cd. I got it several months ago and didn't really care for it for the first month or so, but although it took awhile, the cd DID grow on me. The \\"Love at First sight\\" album version came off like a Madonna/Holiday rip off, but the radio version made me enjoy the song (unfortunately, this version isn't on the cd). The other songs that I can say are favorites are \\"Come into my world\\" (which is her latest), \\"Burning up\\" and the hidden track \\"Butterfly\\". But other than that, the cd is just kind of blah for me. I will say that its good when you're in an upbeat mood since every track on it is danceable fun pop music but there isn't anything else on there that jumped out at me like the first single.
0385508417|3.0|I am a Grisham fan, but this book let me down.  I am also a Christmas maniac with sappy holiday sentiments which sit me down to watch all the old Christmas movies year after year and continue to build an already too large collection of Christmas music.  With that said, you know my vantage point going into this book.  I was prepared to be amused by this farce - I was let down.<br />Luther and Nora Krank decide to skip Christmas when their daughter will be away in Peru with the Peace Corps.  Its hard to tell by the tone of the main character (written from Luther's point of view)if he really doesn't like Christmas or if he just wants the break from all the fuss.  Sometimes you empathize with the crowded shopping malls, the time crunch to get everything done, the expenses that are probably unnecessary, the whole commercialism, but it remained a little too &quot;Scroogelike&quot; for me.  When he does something truly nice and heart warming at the end of the book, it struck me as too little too late and I didn't find it the redeeming gesture I'm sure it was meant to be.  It was more of a grudging gift when once again Christmas had gotten the best of him.  So if you're in the mood for a light-hearted, feel-good  Christmas read, I wouldn't particularly recommend this one.  Christmas remains the one time of year that I like to lay cynicism aside and this book didn't do that for me.
B000001Y79|5.0|Like many others, I was introduced to No Doubt when &quot;Just a Girl&quot; started blasting on the radio back in the mid 90s. I finally did buy the cd after hearing a couple more songs and was blown away! Out of 14 tracks, there are only two that didn't really do anything for me (tracks 11 &amp; 12) but the rest of it is perfect. Like another reviewer, this has also been my most played cd. I haven't once grown tired of it. I know some people just like to listen to the songs released to radio and the video channels, but if you liked &quot;just a girl&quot;, &quot;don't speak&quot;, &quot;spiderwebs&quot;, then buy this cd. you're going to love the unreleased songs just as much. This cd DESERVES the hype it received.
B00005LANG|5.0|With Time magazine having awarded this album the distinction of Album of the (last) Century, it would be a bit contrarian to give it less than 5 stars, even though it is not my favorite Marley album--Kaya is.<br />What is it that made this skinny, half white, soccer and ganja loving Jamaican such a beloved figure? Well, of course dying young always helps, and like his near contemporary John Lennon, Marley didn't make it into middle age. But Marley was truly one of a kind. His voice is not the kind of voice that you say is a good voice or a bad voice. Like Dylan's it is instantly recognizable as his voice and that is all that counts. The songs are brilliant, all self penned, and rarely covered by other artists. Marley, as far as I know, never performs cover versions of songs by other composers.<br />Marley is seen by many as a quasi religious figure, and I have to confess that though I am no Rastafarian (though I have smoked ganja) nor Christian (though I have taken communion), I find this album spiritually uplifting in a way that I do not find, say, contemporary Christian music uplifting. Marley's songs are replete with Biblical references and echoes, but to compare someone like Amy Grant with Marley would be absurd. However the fact that it IS so absurd is a measure of his status, which is head and shoulders above all but the very greatest artists. You have to put him up there in the pantheon of greats along with the Beatles, Stones, Miles Davis, Hendrix etc.<br />So like all of Marley's recordings, you cannot measure it simply in musical terms, because it is more than just music, it is inspiration too.<br />This album goes from strength to strength. Many albums start with the best track and then go downhill, but this one saves the best for later. Jammin' is probably my favorite Marley track, and you get two versions here. The first sounds very much as if it would fit right in on Kaya, with the booming bass, guitar lines adding a little color, and that voice, ah, that voice with the unique Marley lyrics. The second is a longer jazzier, more instrumental version.<br />Then come Waiting in Vain, Turn Your Lights Down Low, Three Little Birds, and One Love/People Get Ready, before the reprise of Jammin' and Punky Reggae Party.<br />Really, if you like Marley's music, you can't go wrong with this.<br />Since writing the above I have been listening to this album in my car almost every day from weeks and I have revised my opinion. It probably IS the greatest album of the twentieth century. Everything else I listen to now seems to pale by comparison.hat voice with the unique Marley lyrics.

6300271439|4.0|To me, &quot;Who's that Girl&quot; represents the ultimate Madonna movie instead of &quot;Desperately Seeking Susan&quot;. I know this movie received horrible reviews when it was released, but of all the 80s movies I've seen, I think this is good as anything else out at the time. The humor can be cheesy along with the dialogue, but if you love Madonna and you love the 80s, then this is a perfect movie to watch. I found it entertaining and Madonna shines as an actress with this role because she's not trying to be dramatic. Its just campy enjoyable fun.
B00005JLS0|3.0|The romantic comedy genre is pretty generic this day and age and Two Weeks Notice does little to break the mold, but is better than the usual. What praise that can be given to the film is due to the stars, Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant, who work well together to salvage what they can from the generic story and lifeless direction. The duo seem have a decent chemistry and the least you can say about them is that they work.<br />Bullock is Lucy, a liberal legal aide who puts up the good fight for the little guy in the fight to slow development, while Grant plays George, a leader in the high priced NYC development game who the very ideal person Lucy fights against. He needs a new lawyer that happens to be female and a non-bimbo and, as Lucy happens to fit the criteria, they strike a deal in that he'll attempt to save her community center if she'll agree to work for him. They hate each other, of course, and they're falling for each other w/o knowing it, of course, and they get separated just as they are falling in love, of course, and they are brought back together and love meets them in the middle, of course. Aren't clich&eacute;s lovely?<br />But at least it meets the minimum requirements that the lead characters be somewhat likable, and they are definitely that. The story is workable at best, but the actors made due with what was available. Romantic comedy fans are sure to love it while the rest of us our sure to make it through without suffering too much pain.
B0000509C4|4.0|While the first CREEPSHOW was deliciously delightful and was a fright-fest in and of itself, the same cannot be said of CREEPSHOW 2. While still it's three stories are fun and entertaining, and even scary at times, it lacks the punch that the first CREEPSHOW really gave us with its five stories. And I think that's where the main problem lies with CREEPSHOW 2...while running about 90 minutes, something still is amiss.<br />\\"Ol' Chief Woodenhead\\"-This first of the three tales gets things going on an interesting note. It's a tale of revenge done by the Indian statue guarding a little convenience store in the middle of a desolate town. After the owners (played nicely by Dorothy Lamour and George Kennedy) are murdered by a couple of robbers, \\"Ol' Chief Woodenhead\\" has his revenge and kills all three of them. An interesting and entertaining first short tale, but not a less-terrifying one either...just quietly terrifying in its own merits. <br />\\"The Raft\\"-This short tale is a little more livelier than the first, and kind of reminds you of \\"The Blob\\" with the murderous oil slick in a lake that terrorizes four friends who go for a swim in. One by one, the oil blob envelops them, until by tale's end, none are left (you know they weren't about to let Randy get away...he came so close). I'll tell you one thing--Laverne is a very cute girl...too bad the oil slick got her! Terrifying yes; quirky and kind of funny a little too.<br />\\"The Hitchhiker\\"-Actually, this one is very entertaining and offers chills despite being a little bit silly. I think Lois Chiles is just tasty as Annie, the hooker/cheating wife who finds out that when you hit someone who just wants a ride, no matter how many times you try to hit them or outrun them, they'll catch up with you in the end. This is a delightful tale and brings CREEPSHOW 2 to a nice conclusion...not discounting, of course, the short and brief Billy segment with the giant Venus fly-traps.<br />Overall, though, CREEPSHOW 2 would've been much better if there were two more stories. While it lacks the strength and scares of the first CREEPSHOW, it still manages to entertain based on its own scares, charms, and that is enough to make CREEPSHOW 2 a pretty good sequel.
0345448898|5.0|It's not very easy to put this book in a category, or to describe the effect it had on me.  However I have decided it can best be described as a represenation of the story of original sin (Adam, Eve, the serpent, the garden, you know) in our modern theories of physics.  In other words: it is the story of Lyra, in another world, and Will, in our world, and how they change not only their worlds...but all worlds.  It functions as both a book for children on the surface with Lyra, Will, and the absorbing story of the different worlds, as well as a deeper allegory appropriate for adults and even some advanced children.  I don't think I would have fully understood it as a child, but it is a book appropriate for all ages.  It explores morals and philosophy of all religions as well as telling a finely crafted story with a good/evil dynamic that brings Tolkien, Susan Cooper, and others to mind.<br />I admit it: I cried at the end of this book.  It was too good.  You literally do not want it to end, but it does, with possibly the most satisfying conclusion I've ever read.  Can't think of a better book.  Don't let the possible meanings of the book scare you, if you decide to read it--it is first and foremost a story about two children, and if you can handle them, you can manage the rest of the book.  I hope you all enjoy it.
630560973X|5.0|STAR TREK IV: The Voyage Home is considered one of the most entertaining Star Trek films of our time, and it's considered a success due in large part to Leonard Nimoy's directorial efforts and the great interaction between the cast members, especially Kirk and Spock...who, together, provide some funny moments.<br />We pick up where STAR TREK III left off, with Kirk and McCoy and Crew on the planet with the rejuvenated Spock ready to leave on the Klingon bird of prey. When they encounter a mysterious probe in their travels, they decipher it to realize that it is actually the song of a humpback whale. They travel back to Earth to San  Francisco, where we have some of the greatest moments between Kirk and Spock as they travel in San Francisco in search of the woman who is trying to save the whales from being extinct. The crew of the Enterprise comes together to save the humpbacks and it brings some good action into the film, but this is more about the human interaction between the characters in the film, and not so much about the action. It's a refreshing approach, and it gives the film a lot of strength.<br />STAR TREK IV: The Voyage Home is a thoroughly enjoyable film from beginning to end, with a better premise and more enjoyable plot then the film to follow. Consider this: The Voyage Home is considered the best film in the Trek series, but I believe that honor goes to The Wrath of Khan. However, that doesn't mean Star Trek IV isn't as good; The Voyage Home is just as good a film, and makes for a wonderful addition to any Trekkie's film collection.
B00005JLRR|4.0|Not many franchise titles can withstand more than two movie releases. Few can go beyond five.<BR>Star Trek has arrived at its tenth Silver screen movie and hasn't lost its fire yet. Being an avid Trek fan myself, I found much entertainment value even in the heavily-edited-for-time release of Nemesis. From Enterprise crew advancements to some appearances by a few favourite characters (Guinan, Wesley, Janeway - Admiral mind you), the intricacies of the Romulan Empire as well as the main battle sequence, Nemesis doesn't let up.<BR>Some movie (over)analysts might blast Nemesis, however, at some point these individuals seem not to understand either the continuity of Trek or the fact that all movies have a time and budgetary limit. All things considered Nemesis is a must see, even if only to be part of a particular watershed event for the TNG crew (not revealing it just in case...).<BR>Shinzon, the villian of the piece, is topped in dark presence only by Khan (Kirk's arch foe) or Locutus (the other version of an \\"evil Picard\\"). Stellar performances by our usual crew.<BR>My final word for this movie: ignore the critics, watch it for fun.
B00006G8HX|4.0|STAR TREK III: The Search For Spock is almost as good as THE WRATH OF KHAN and THE VOYAGE HOME, but it has its own strengths working for it. It is indeed an essential part of the Trek phenomenon, and there is a bit of action and human essence in this movie.<br />The Enterprise crew is headed for the starbase battered from the raging battle with Khan, that resulted in the birth of the Genesis Planet. When Kirk and crew finally arrive and the Enterprise is due to be decommissioned, Kirk and a few crew members (Scotty, McCoy, Chekhov, and Sulu) highjack the Enterprise and race to the Genesis Planet after they learn McCoy is carrying the soul of Spock, and Spock is alive, aging rapidly like the planet that rebirthed him...but essentially, has none of his marbles which McCoy possesses. When the Enterprise encounters the Klingons and Commander Kruge, it results in the untimely destruction of the Enterprise. Down on the Genesis planet, Kirk and crew find Spock and Valeris, but David, Kirk's estranged son, is dead. After ridding themselves of Kruge, Kirk highjacks the Klingon vessel to get to Vulcan, where Spock and McCoy are put back to their rightful places. <br />Overall, The Search For Spock is an enjoyable edition to the Trek adventures with Leonard Nimoy's directorial talents to go even further with Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home. Star Trek III is essentially satisfying and would be a welcome addition to your Trek collection, no matter what kind of Trekkie you are.
B00005YXZH|5.0|there's not much to be said that hasn't already been shouted by the critics across the states.  worthy of over five stars and definitely a contender for album of the year, challenged only by the releases from beck and the flaming lips.  also great in  concert.  if you don't like it at first, you'll change.  believe me.  that, or you're stupid.  cosmically stupid.
6305350205|4.0|STAR TREK V is probably the weakest Star Trek movie of the bunch, but it still managed to keep me entertained. While it lacks some punch that the other Star Trek movies managed to sustain, THE FINAL FRONTIER still manages to entertain, and I think William Shatner did a good job with this movie...but he could have done a lot better.<br />The movie begins with a silly, but amusing, scene where Kirk, Spock, and McCoy are on a camping trip and take a stab at trying to conjure up some good campfire ditties. However, when the crew of the Enterprise learns that a renegade Vulcan named Sybok is up to no good, they must investigate, only to have the ship highjacked by Sybok himself. Along with some of his followers and a couple of brainwashed crew members, the crew punches through the Great Barrier (which no ship has ever been able to cross before) and finds a place supposedly where God, according to Sybok, exists, a sort of Eden. When Sybok, Kirk, McCoy, and Spock go down to the planet, they later learn this is not the God they were thinking of, but rather, an alien entity that wants a ride on the ship. Enter the Klingons, who, pursuing Kirk in the first place, rendezvous with the Enterprise, but are later persuaded to apologize and make peace again. We then go back to another scene of the resuming camp trip, and Spock plays \\"Row Row Row Your Boat \\" and so ends another Trek film.<br />While this wasn't the best Trek movie I have seen, I was nonetheless entertained by it and felt it still managed to be a good Trek movie. Shatner got bruised by critics and some fans, but this a Trek movie, and you the fan should decide for yourself whether it's good or not. STAR TREK V: The Final Frontier may not be the best of the bunch, but it still manages to entertain, even if it lacks the punch of previous and current Trek films.
B00005JKZT|5.0|I have just arrived home from the cinema after watching The Two Towers. It is all I can think about! I absolutely loved The Fellowship Of The Ring and thought The Two Towers couldn't possibly be any better - but I was proved wrong! Words can't begin to describe how amazing this film is. The Two Towers has gone straight in at No.1 in the US Box Office grossing a staggering $61 million in its first five days of release - did anyone expect anything less? There may be spoilers ahead in this review, so if you don't want to know about it, don't read on!<br />The most noticable change about The Two Towers from The Fellowship Of The Ring - for me - was the increasing addition of violence, power, war and darkness. There is much more of it than in the first edition of The Lord Of The Rings, which is not surprising considering all the stuff that needed to be squeezed in. Speaking of this, I was delighted when realising that The Two Towers isn't full of half an hours' twaddle-talk like The Fellowship Of The Ring; the story begins straight away without any hesitation. At first it seems strange, but after the first twenty minutes or so, you forget all about it and succumb to the powers of this extraordinary film. After The Fellowship was left broken at the end of the first enstallment, there are three main storylines in The Two Towers that follow in the order of Frodo/Sam, Merry/Pippin and Legolas/Aragorn/Gimli.<br />In the Frodo/Sam subplot, the two continue their quest to return the One Ring back to Mordor - the dark and hellish realm of the Dark Lord Sauron - and destroy it in the fires of Mount Doom. The longer Frodo (Elijah Wood) has the ring within his possession, the more chance he has of succumbing to the evil powers of the One Ring. On their way, they meet up with Gollom - the monster who has been following them hoping to claim the \\"precious\\" ring for himself. Hinted at in the introduction of The Fellowship Of The Ring, Gollom (superbly voiced by Andy Serkis) was once the ring bearer but his greed and need for the ring over-powered him and turned him into the monster he is today. The pathetic wretch offers to guide the Hobbits to the dark realm, his tortured mind wavering between servitude and treachery. Sam (Sean Astin) is reluctant to trust Gollom at first, but Frodo is instantly willing for him to help them in their quest to arrive at Mordor. Gollom and Frodo have a special connection that no one else has; they were/are both ring bearers. This friendship, however, threatens the one Frodo has with Sam. Gollom is, quite simply, the greatest CG-creature in cinematic history. It's incredible how a few pixels can turn into a lovable character of whom you share emotion and pity. There are many scenes where it is obvious to the untrained eye that Gollom is computer-generated, but the fascination and interaction with the character overpowers this. In the Merry/Pippin subplot, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) are trying to find them after they were captured by the fearsome Uruk-hai at the end of the last enstallment. The pursuit of Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) takes Aragorn and company to Rohan, a kingdom of Viking-like horsemen. Rohan's king, Theoden (Bernard Hill), has fallen under the spell of the evil wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee) through the manipulations of his adviser, Grima Wormtongue (Brad Dourif). Meanwhile, Merry and Pippin manage to escape and seek cover in the mysterious Fanghorn Forest. While there they meet a strange a surprising army amongst the ancient trees. For me, the Aragorn/Legolas/Gimli plotline was the best because of its power and strength - not only in battle scenes, but in the emotional side of things. The romance between Aragorn and Elf princess Arwen (Liv Tyler) has been further embellished, drawing from the trilogy's appendix. I was rather disappointed of the amount of screen time Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) has. She didn't have much in TheFellowship Of The Ring, so I was expecting more in The Two Towers - but no! The three join forces with Gandalf (Ian McKellen) (who was presumed dead at the end of The Fellowship Of The Ring) to rescue Theoden from the spell of Saruman and guide the people of Rohan to the strongholds of Helm's Deep. However, on their way to Helm's Deep they are attacked by Orcs on wargs. Aragorn and company are joined by hundreds of Rohan village people to attack and defeat an army of 10,000 Orcs. Quite possibly the most intense and awesome battle ever seen on film, it lasts for up to 45 minutes and took months to film. The scene is incredibly dark, but still manages to add the odd pinch of humour from Gimli. This fight scene is the climax to the Two Towers and is experty done.<br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br />Like The Fellowship Of The Ring, The Two Towers was filmed in New Zealand with its stunning scenery. With the scenery a main object of the first enstallment, The Two Towers can focus more of the love/hate/emotion side of the story - and it does, to awesome effect. Peter Jackson is definitely the \\"Director of the Moment\\" and rightly deserves all the praise he is recieving. The Two Towers is bound to be even more of a success than the first enstallment, which will leave you on tender hooks for the third and final enstallment - The Return Of The King.

B000002BE9|3.0|Fiona Apple was a nineteen year-old New Yorker when she recorded this album. It is rare to see a girl so young with such a deep, sultry, mellow voice, whose song lyrics are filled with so much emotion and poetry. In many ways, Fiona Apple rivals the best that Tori Amos and Sarah McLaughlin have to offer us, wedging herself snugly into that compartment between slow rock and bluesy. Yet at the same time, her age does show. Some of the lyrics show a youthful complexity, which is ambitious but naive`. I also could not help but think that many of the songs sounded alike. A lot of them started with the same opening chords, and had the same slow, mournful quality. Without further delay, here is my analysis of the tracks:<br />1. Sleep To Dream--Interesting drumbeat at the beginning. Catchy, yet a little corny in its message about the earthy girl rejecting the overly-idealistic lover.<br />2. Sullen Girl--This one just sort of slipped by me. It was slow and very wistful, so if you are in the mood for that kind of thing, it could work for you.<br />3. Shadowboxer--One of the keepers on the album. It starts out with this rhythm that is both menacing and casual. At first I thought it was a bit lame, but it has really started to grow on me.<br />4. Criminal--THE BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM! I find myself singing along with this one, it is that good. It's probably the fastest one on the album, and I fell in love with it right away. The beginning--\\"I've Been A Bad, Bad Girl\\" makes it irresistible for guys, and the chorus is very catchy.<br />5. Slow Like Honey--Another slow mournful song. Worth noting that at 5:56 it's the longest track on the album. It doesn't hold my interest.<br />6. The First Taste--I'm not crazy about this one. It has this jazz/R&B rhythm which would work wonderfully for Sade, but really doesn't cut it for Fiona Apple.<br />7. Never Is A Promise--This one has the distinction of having a chorus which features Fiona Apple singing at a high-pitch. To me, she soundedtoo squeaky. I think she should stick to her usual alto.<br />8. The Child Is Gone--The opening chords to this one mimic those of Shadowboxer. This one is slow yet rather defiant, with it's whole theme of the innocent girl all grown up... \\"the child gone\\" so-to-speak.<br />9. Pale September--Interesting background music, sounds sort of like rolling dice. Another slow, mellow one.<br />10. Carrion--A nice light rhythm interspersed with heavy piano.<br />Overall, this CD is okay. It makes good background music for when you are working on something. Each of the songs is very lengthy, so this makes it challenging for any artist to hold the listener's attention. Yet all of the songs contain a great deal of well-written poetry, and at times, it is fun to sit back and try to figure out what Fiona Apple is trying to say, because you have a feeling it is worth hearing. As I said, this CD shows promise, but I don't think Apple is quite ready to deliver yet. Hopefully, she has learned her lesson, and WHEN THE PAWN..., released when Apple is twenty-two is the real thing. If Fiona Apple tightens up her songs, makes them more fast-paced, more like \\"Criminal\\", then her next release will definitely be worth checking out.
0553573403|5.0|I won't wax on and on about what a great read this and how well Martin writes.  Others have done so far more eloquently than I ever could.  I will say this is a definite must read for anyone who loves a well developed plot with realistic characters.  When I finished it, I had to go out and buy the next book that day.  What a pleasure to read.  Highly recommended.
6305205620|2.0|Lots of people said this is a great DVD, great show... but I have to disagree. If you are a rock fan you should buy it, but if you are a metal fan, you maybe disapointed. Where is the heavy guitar vibe metallica once had in the past?? It is missed on this DVD. The guitars are recorded with low volume and there is no punch. Tired of wah-wah solos by hammet and what about the bass of jason??? simply terrible. I think that maybe not the production's fault but it was recordable at metallica's worst period (during load and reload releases). If you see the perfomance of &quot;one&quot; you will be throwing up... IT IS HORRIBLE... Please keep the old metallica albuns, and if you want it a DVD, buy Cliff em all instead!
B00001OH7P|5.0|I dig &quot;John, I'm only dancing&quot;. It is good to hear some of those hard to get tunes on this re-issue. Mick Ronson was/is the most on this recording. I think Bowie was VERY LUCKY to have him around, probably Mick felt the same way, they needed each other. Amazingly subtle in a wonderfully over-the-top way

0688101364|4.0|This is an excellent cookie book and every cookie I've made from it has been outstanding. Unfortunately, there's one recipe that temps me over and over again -- even though I've failed at it everytime. It's a divine-looking recipe for a chocolate- and almond-topped toffee called Mahogany Buttercrunch. It looks so-o-o tempting. Unfortunately, I am a novice at candymaking and every attempt to prepare this recipe has been an ignominious failure. I even went out and bought a professional candy thermometer -- didn't help.<br />The instructions are pretty skimpy and don't tell you anything about how (or if) it's possible to rescue the toffee if the sugar crystalizes or the butter separates out (both have happened to me). I've tried to supplement my knowledge by going to candymaking sites on the internet, but they're full of conflicting advice. I should avoid hot days, damp days; I should use a wooden spoon to stir the mixture; I should raise the temperature under the pot and stir continuously; I should lower the temperature and stir as little as possible. If the butter separates, try dumping in a half cup of very hot water; no -- add a little bit of hot water a tablespoon at a time; no -- do nothing but keep cooking and stirring, it might go back in by itself.<br />My advice is to buy the book and make the cookies. However, unless you have candymaking experience, don't attempt the Buttercrunch!
0062502182|5.0|This book has 2 purposes: it is a fable; a story about a shepherd.  It is also a life lesson about the paths that are presented to each one of us.  Which path do you choose?  It is FATE.  You can read this book for the story, or you can read this book for the LESSON.  <br />It only takes about 4 hours to read this book.  It has an AMAZING message within the story.  I have bought this book for 15 of my friends and family.  I have read the book 4 times.  My best advice: relate it to your own life.
0385484518|5.0|This is a moving, emotional book. I can't possibly do it justice in a review, so I will just write this: Don't only buy one copy for yourself - buy a few, and give them to those who you love. It will speak volumes as to how you feel about them.<br />Morrie, I hope you're resting in peace. Mitch, I hope you find time to still spend Tuesdays with Morrie.
B000063DFQ|5.0|I was 10 years old in 1984 and went to go buy Blizzard of Ozz but the record store did not have it. I saw this cool monster picture on Piece of Mind and so I bought it and almost 19 years later I still think it is the GREATEST METAL ALBUM OF ALL TIME. To Tame A Land is certainly one of Harris' greatest epic songs ever. Every song is even very fun to sing along with.
B00005JKZT|4.0|I would have given this movie 5 stars IF this movie hadn't been soooo long.  I've seen movies that were lengthy because the character development and plot warranted the length. I felt like there was just too much time spent on the battle scenes and the talking trees!  The visual effects were stunning and the scenery was breathtaking.  I just didn't see why this movie couldn't have been edited more efficiently so as to make it more enjoyable.
B00006RU5B|3.0|I've been a big fan of rage since as long as i can remember. i wouldnt consider myself a big fan of soundgarden, but i dont despise of their music. i must say that most of audioslave's music is a disappointment. its good stuff, but it needs to be heavier metal. Cochise and Gasoline and a few others are great, but when i heard \\"like a stone\\" and \\"i am a highway\\" i was left thinking ...what the hell? good vocalist...good guitarist...good everything, they just need to work on it. a lot of potential, but like i said, some of their stuff is too soft and is a disappointment of the heavy metal style i was expecting...

B00005IC2H|5.0|Sigur R&oacute;s came out of nowhere in 2001 with Agaetis Byrjun and quickly won me over as a complete Icelandic convert.  This album takes the word &quot;moody&quot; and gives it new depth and emotion that hasn't been seen in many a good while.  To compare them to such artists as Radiohead, U2, and My Bloody Valentine robs Sigur R&oacute;s of their completely unique sound which is absolutely omnipresent on this outstanding work.  Somber strains entertwine throughout the songs combined with beautiful vocals that seem as if ancient Icelandic angels had been awoken from centuries of sleep to sing a melodic funeral dirge.<br />If you are not afraid of stepping out of the bounds of popular music and embracing dark, haunting yet at the same time tranquil sounds then this is an absolute must have.
B00005JLRR|4.0|I have mixed feelings regarding this movie. Overall, it was better than the odd numbered Star Trek movies, and a few of the even ones. I enjoyed the fact that the Romulans finally get involved in a theatrical Star Trek episode. However, it is a clone of Picard that steals the Romulans potential thunder in this one. Instead, the Federation is fighting against the Remans, who have taken some control of the Romulan Empire.<br />Shinzon, albeit young, plays a good Nemesis to Picard. During the movie, we see Shinzon suffering pain, which is his main reason to lead Picard to Romulus. He tries convincing Picard that the new Romulan Empire wants peace with the Federation. Of course, Picard doesn't fall for his subterfuge. <br />This leads to the action of the movie, and falls in line with space action scenes in other Trek movies. <br />Very good dialogue especially between Picard and Shinzon. Data plays a very big role, and early in the movie discovers an android similar to him called B4. B4, will probably be seen in the future, but do not want give away the surprise ending.<br />This movie could have been a two parter on the TV series. It appears that the TNG crew is done. Stewart has announced that this was his last the other day. The Trek movie I'd like to see would be to have a mix of all 4 series tied up to one movie, similar to the Dominion Wars in novel form. That would make a better theater experience
B00005JKZT|3.0|First of all, let me preface this by saying that I loved FOTR.  I thought the editing was perfect, especially in the extended version DVD where the story flowed a little bit better.  The biggest issue for me was that the movie (the parts that were included) was pretty faithful to the book.<br />I will not get too specific because I don't want to spoil anyone's trip to the theatre but there were, at least, two major points in the movie where I felt incredibly let down by what was done.  Faramir, my personal favorite from the books, was diminished somewhat by his actions upon meeting Frodo (completely different from the book for no reason that I can see).  I will also only say that the people of Rohan, upon leaving Edoras, go to the wrong place.  These are only a couple of the things that were changed from the book.  Now, if changes are necessary to move the story along I can understand that...but these changes did not seem to be at all necessary and that bothered me.<br />But, if you're someone who is really into FX you'll definitely want to see this film.  The battle for Helm's Deep is pretty incredible, Gollum is incredible (the interaction between Gollum, Samwise, and Frodo is great), the Ents are just about how I imagined them when I was reading the books. The New Zealand scenery is stunning.<br />Basically, I'm only giving this 3 stars because of how far it strays from the original story...it pretty much ends up in the same place but takes a different (unfortunately, in my opinion) route in getting there.
0066214122|4.0|Michael Crichton has been writing the same story for much of his career: Scientists meddle with Something Best Left Alone. That Something escapes, life as we know it is threatened, and the hero battles greedy corporations who think they can reestablish control and make billions by stuffing the genie back in its bottle.<br />Theres nothing wrong with recycling this old theme. Even the supposed original, \\"Frankenstein,\\" echoes the Greek myth of Icarus, whose wax wings melted when he flew too close to the sun. The success of such stories depends on the cautionary tale they attempt to tell, and this ones target is a good one: nanotechnology. Better, Crichton avoids the \\"gray goo\\" cliché in which runaway nanomachines eat up everything in their paths, like a plague of molecular locusts. Here, the real culprit is computer-driven nanotechnology that is capable of evolving so quickly that nobody can understand it, let alone control it.<br />To enjoy a Crichton novel, you have to be able to accept certain things as givens:<BR>     <BR>1. The story is a vehicle for the science. This one must contain at least 50 pages of exposition about computers, nanotechnology, and biology. Crichton would have made a good science writer.<br />2.  The story will start at the beginning and proceed in sequential manner (except, in this case, for a brief preface). \\"Prey\\" doesnt really get rolling for about 100 pages. <br />3. Characters are not Crichtons strong point. Here the protagonist is better developed than most of Crichtons leadsbut then he undercuts his \\"sensitive male\\" characterization by dashing off into the desert when the plot requires him to do so, risking his life repeatedly and never once questioning what will happen to his children if he dies. Too bad: there would have been a lot more tension if the hero had been more conflicted.<br />4.  Crichton has always been weak when it comes to endings. \\"Andromeda Strain\\" was a great book, but the ending is a severe anticlimax, and the same can be said about \\"Sphere,\\" \\"Congo,\\" and several others. I suspect that Crichton, a scientist at heart, has trouble venturing too far afield from reality. That makes for good near-future science fiction conceptsand poor endings.<BR>That said, this books ending is a pleasant surprise. Theres plenty of action, and a resolution that fits appropriately into the story buildupeven if there are a few disconcerting moments when you realize that youre seeing a movie outline  more than a book.<br />Bottom line: if you like Crichton, youll like this book. Conversely, if you dont like this book, dont buy any of his others.
B00005JLS0|5.0|This movie was HYSTERICAL! The chemistry between Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant was fantastic...they are a very good match. A definitive must-see and when it comes out on DVD --- a definite must-buy!

B00003CXS4|4.0|This is a great British movie - very much British humor, and British intensity. Fast paced and a bit off-the-wall!! Don't watch it unless you can focus exclusively on it as it moves all over the place. Brad Pitt does an extraordinary job on the gypsy part! The accents are all very typical and sometimes hard to follow if you are not used to them - particularly the gypsy for me! The sub-titles are useful until you get to grips with the accents - sometimes you just can't crack these weird ones however!  It's fairly violent, and, in my opinion, not suitable for kids under 16. I enjoyed it and have to watch it again to pick up all the goings on!
0451207521|4.0|If it was possible, I would have given it a 4.5 star. While I was somewhat disappointed with his Code To Zero, Ken Follet is back doing what he know best - writing thrillers about the Second World War. Flick, the  main heroine is a strongly sketched character, the portrayals of Ruby, Helen and the others are also well developed. There are plenty of twists and turns and breath stopping suspense in the plot to keep one hooked. If there is one shortcoming, it is in some of the incidents being too unbelievable in extremes - sometimes it is too easy for the jackdaws and sometimes too difficult. However, it is the element of suspense -the way Dieter Franck is always on Flick's trail, but she just about manages to stay one step ahead - kept me reading late into the night.

B00004NJJR|4.0|A while back, my friend Korey recorded an album of his for me on tape by a power metal band from Finland called Sonata Arctica.  Interested, I said sure.  Music is all about discovering new bands, right?  It's been quite a while since I've last listened to it (I have so many CDs), but Sonata Arctica's debut ECLIPTICA is a very nice album.  Usually when one thinks of power metal, you think of lyrics focusing on Dungeons &amp; Dragons, &quot;Star Wars,&quot; or saving the Earth.  That's not the case here.  Sonata Arctica have wisely chosen to write about modern-day topics a la Dream Theater instead of opting for the medevial lyricism of, oh say, Yngwie Malmsteen.<br />I don't remember all of the songs that much, but there's some that stand out in my memory.  &quot;Blank File&quot; and &quot;My Land&quot; are a great opening combo, with blazing guitar/keyboard interplay, speedy double-bass drums, and soaring clean vocals.  Kudos must go out to the producer of this album, as the double-bass loses that annoying rickety-rackety sound of most power metal albums (I'm looking at you Kamelot).  &quot;8th Commandment&quot; is also a good one.  &quot;Full Moon&quot; has some cool piano work from lead singer Tony Kakko.  &quot;Letter to Dana&quot; is a lovely ballad.  Those are just some of the highlights.<br />If you're in the mood for some uplifting metal that rocks hard without dumbing itself to the cheesiness of most power metal, then ECLIPTICA is the way to go.
B00006WUWN|4.0|Austin Powers in Goldmember was pretty good for a movie and O.k. for the Austin Powers series. Don't get me twisted, I've heard that this will be the last Austin Powers and yes it does go out with a bang in that respect but as far as compared to the first 2, it lags behind a little.<br />First off, this one has a lot of funny parts (eventhough it's nothing you haven't seen before from the Austin Powers series except for the Japanese subtitles) and there are some pretty entertaining scenes as well. Plus cameos by Steven Spielberg, Tom Cruise, Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito, Gwenyth Paltrow, Brittmey Spears, the Osbournes and even John Travolta. <br />Along with returning characters Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, Mini-Me, Fat Bastard, Basil Expeditionm, Number 2, Scott Evil and Frau Farbissina and who could forget the new additions to the seris, Number 3 played by Fred Savage, Foxxy Cleopatra (Beyonce Knowles) and title character Goldmember (also played by Myers). All in all, so many names and so much going on, you are constantly glued when watching this one. And a new addition to the series, TWISTS and TURNS in the plot. Trust me, you'll see!<br />But there are some down sides to this one as well. For starters like I said before, I've heard that this is the last of the Austin Powers series. That knowledge alone brings you down a little. The biggest and most disappointing thing about this one is title character Goldmember. He's not really all that funny. He says a few things here and there but the other things that he does are just disgusting. Even worse than the Fat Bastard/Felicity Shagwell after love scene in The Spy Who Shagged Me. Seriously, Goldmember (the character) is a total loss.<br />Other than that, it's very worth it. For me personally, I had to rewind the Dr Evil/Mini-Me GA State Prison scene over and over because it's just so dang funny! If you already have the first 2 you might as well get the trilogy and complete the series and for those of you not into the Austin Powers series, you'll still get a kick out of this one. In any case, enjoy!
B00003ZA27|4.0|It is exceedingly difficult to write a truly impartial review of this recording.  First of all, I should say that, much as I would like to say otherwise, I think Karajan's rendition here over-emphaises the majesty and sheer gargantuan scale of this work, at the expense of the personal, heart-wrenching feeling of this music.  With most of his recordings, especially from his earlier years, I feel that he has the right balance, but it seems to me that the music here is just not involved enough, if my meaning can be understood.  That aside, I simply do not see what many other reviewers are complaining about here.  To be sure, the sound quality is not perfect, but what do you expect from 1974?  On the other hand, though there are blemishes, the sound is enormously rich and magnificent, fully befitting the rendition that Karajan adopts here.  Also, despite some complaints in other reviews, I do not see anything terrible about either the chorus or the soloists: of course, Janowitz is well above any critique, but the other soloists are perfectly fine as well, and, though I am a better critic of instrumental work, I do not see where the chorus is so terribly out of balance, as others have repeatedly claimed.  Although in some places the horns tend to rush ahead of the orchestra, this is not a major problem, as I see it.  On the positive side, the middle of the Credo and all of the Sanctus are incredibly inspiring, in spite of the generally somewhat bland, monolithic character of the rest of the recording.  Though in hindsight, I might have chosen a different recording of Bach's greatest work, this one is certainly worth the money.  Right now I am filled with ambition to buy Karajan's 1952 recording, with Gedda and Ferrier: despite the fact that the sound is obviosly going to be of poorer quality, I think that the performance will be more intense, most likely.
B00006LLNU|5.0|For anyone else out there with dreams of making it big as a thoughtful/thoughtless, bombastic, enormously talented (and modest) novelist, this is the only album you need for those long stretches into the night, fueled by caffeine and a longing to be someone else. The tracks on ( ) (or, if you will, my favorite pseudo-quasi title &quot;Two Sausages Kissing&quot;) seem to blend into the background, whilst simultaneously oozing into the forefront like lilac wine, feeding that itchy creative bug which makes you want to write in the first place. It neither distracts from the purpose, nor disappears from the pedestal. It merely exists, runs its course (or, if you're like me, plays endlessly on repeat), and electrifies you constantly and completely.
B00006L9ZT|5.0|\\"The greatest work of art of Western Civilization,\\" is what George Bernard Shaw said of Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen. This DVD set is the best introduction yet to this great work of art.<br /><br /> Avoiding a director's natural tendency to become a bit of a prima donna by trying to put one's own stamp on a production, James Levine rises higher, and presents a faithful, authentic production of the Ring. As most folks eventually come to learn, there are invariably compromises in any production. One has better staging, one has better singing, better acting, better lighting, and so forth. This MET production has pretty high scores in all areas.<br /> One of the more outstanding aspects of operatic works on dvd is the added dimension afforded by subtitles. The English subtitles help viewers get so much more out of the Ring, and for those with some understanding of German, switching to German subtitles will help them understand more of the precise meanings of this musical dramatic representation.<br /> James Morris,exhibiting grace and majesty as well as excellent singing, may well be the Wotan of the century. Hildegard Behrens dispels the \\"fat lady\\" stereotype of a Valkry, as she portrays a young, energetic, warrior-daughter of Wotan. Heinz Zednik is a splendid Loge, who seems to inquire of the audience if they can see the implications which present actions will have on future situations. Matti Salminen is the ultimate Hagen, exuding evil from his singing and his cold-blooded stares. I do find I must agree with other reviewers who have suggested that Jessye Norman and Gary Lakes do not make a credible pair of young Walsung twins, even for those who are adept at \\"suspension of disbelief.\\"<br /> Levine and the MET orchestra play superbly. Staging and scenery are traditional and very well-done. Gil Wechsler deserves all his acclaim for his brillance in lighting direction: who can forget Wotan's aria, \\"Diesen Augen, leuchtendes paar...?\\"<br />It would be easy to watch \\"The Ring,\\" again and again, learning more about it, and about life, with each viewing.<br /> All in all, people who like opera, especially opera with a storyline, grand drama, and an invitation to think philosophically about the meaning of life--such individuals will likely find this Metropolitan Opera performance of Wagner's Ring, a delightful addition to their lives.atch \\"The Ring,\\" again and again, learning more about it, and about life, with each viewing. <br /> All in all, people who like opera, especially opera with a storyline, grand drama, and an invitation to think philosophically about the meaning of life--such individuals will likely find this Metropolitan Opera performance of Wagner's Ring, a delightful addition to their lives.
B00005JKZT|5.0|When I saw \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" and realized how fantastic it was, I knew that \\"The Two Towers\\" was going to have a hard time beating it in scope, in talent, in visual poise and grandeur, and when I saw \\"The Two Towers,\\" I was absolutely blown away!  The movie litterally picks up right where \\"The Fellowship\\" left off.  Merry and Pippen are still held captive by the fighting Uruk-Hai, Aragorn, Gimili and Legolas are persuing them and Frodo and Sam are making their way to Mordor.  I knew the movie was going to be great in the first fifteen minutes when my favorite character from \\"The Hobbit\\" was introduced.  Gollum, done completely digitally (although the body movements were created by Andy Serkis, who also voices the creature) was amazing.  He is everyhting I wanted him to be and more.  Merry and Pippen come across the path of the giant tree-men, known as Ents, and the head Ent Treebeard.  These Ents provide some comic relief as well as the power needed to overhtrow Isengard.  <BR>The special effects in this film are amazing.  Much of the film enccompases Sauraman's desire to kill all humans, and his first assault on the people of Rohan and the battle to save them at Helm's Deep.  The last 45 minutes of this movie are unbelievable.  With two epic battle sequences, one at Helm's Deep and one at Isengard, Peter Jackson had his hands full with special effects.  What he accomplished in this film is far better and more advanced than anything George Lucas could ever dream of.  <BR>Another great part of this film is the fact that it is not just an action film.  The story become more emotionally engaging.  You feel strongly for the people of Rohan as the young boys prepare to go to war and you feel for Arwen and Aragorn as their love is tested and objected to.  You feel sorry for Fordo.  <BR>The movie is amazing.  The acting talent is, once again, enheralded.  Ian MacKellan is amazing once again.  Elijah Wood has an impresive turn as the emotionally unstable Frodo and Viggo Mortensen is spectacular as Aragorn.<BR>While this movie does stray from the book a little more than \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" it is still highly enjoyable.  What makes these movies so amazing is Peter Jackson.  Unlike the people who did \\"Harry Potter,\\" Peter Jackson took Tolkien's image of middle-earth and has created his own version.  The story remains ture, but the movie is not simply a way of retelling the book, it is a movie in its own right, and a spectacular film at that.  DO NOT MISS THIS FILM!!!
B00006JJ1O|5.0|These girls are wonderful singers. I love their voices. Their songs are something that everyone can feel and listen to. A nice mix of slow and fast songs on the album. I exspecially like the two russian versions of &quot;Not Gona Get Us&quot; and &quot;All the Things She Said&quot; The enhanced cd makes it even better. You get to see their music video and hear what the girls themselves have to say. Its great, a defenate must have in your music collection.
B00006CXXU|5.0|ok all i have to say is this cd rocks. there is not one song on this cd that sucks she is just the best i think everyone in the world should own a copy of this amazing album.to all the people who are undicided and are thinking about downloading it first dont waste your time and get the real deal buy it you wont regret it! i wish i could give it more stars but she just has an amazing voice
B00006AG5N|5.0|Beyond whatever hype, criticism, or characterization of Elvis' personal life and career you subscribe to; regardless of the unflattering media portrayals, bizarre fans and tell all documentaries, the music remains the essence of the man and eternally enshrines him as the greatest pop icon ever. For those of us alive at the time, we remember life as B.E and A.E and A.E things changed for music and male sexuality forever. Or as John Lennon eloquently put it: \\"Before ELVIS there was nothing!\\" When you become great enough, you cease to be a proper noun and you becomes an adjective; people say \\"He's the ELVIS PRESLEY of this or that.\\" I remember when Vanilla Ice came along and they said \\"He's the next ELVIS.\\" Well there's never gonna be a \\"Next ELVIS.\\" What happened then gripped the world and made music front page headlines. The power of Elvis on T.V enslaved his fans to him. So much for Don Henley's theory that T.V makes Rock & Roll small.... Here's to the next 50 years of ELVIS and to his next Number 1 record or CD or whatever will come after CDs. It's only gonna get better for Elvis as the years go by, as a whole new generation of children have fallen in love with him and his music in this millennium and they will grow up with him and raise their children on him and so on..... and so on..... and so on..... into the next millennium ...and so on...and so on . ....
B000002C25|5.0|alright, this may not be oasis' best record, but no one is perfect all of the time, no one, that is, except for johnny depp. if you were not planning on buying this album, i am here to change your mind. buy this album, not only for it is oasis, and oasis is good, but secondly, johnny depp plays slide guitar on one of the tracks, and if this is not enough to get you to buy this record, you are not human. come on, this is johnny depp we're talking about
0790729725|3.0|The movie itself is fine - I'm not reviewing that.  This is more of a WARNING that you have to FLIP THE DISC OVER after the first hour!  Old-school DVD. Gimme a break. Got this as a gift, glad to finally watch it, suddenly after an hour it stops and I had to actually get up and turn the disc over.  Come on. PLEASE re-release this using current technology. Having to flip it is seriously enough of a &quot;defect&quot; to make me not want to watch it ever again....
B000003TAR|4.0|This would probably come out(Sliver-saying &quot;grandma take me home&quot; over and over doesn't reali get ur point accross cobain). i understood Bleach's raw guitars and emotions, but hey, need a little work on the lyrics, but i noe he's still gowing as a song writer at that time. Anywayz, Cobain felt that he had betrayed the fans of his earlier stuff by making the accidently mainstream Nevermind, which got him a whole wallop of mtv loving posers as fans. so he decided to take a more harsh/anit-mainstream route to making a album. This is full of raw emotion, and the guitars are actually done pretty well, besides the fact that its pretty basic. i gave it 4 stars cuz it made me work, and i'm too lazy to do that. Maybe its my old ears, but when i first heard its, i had no idea what he was saying. So i checked the fan sites to get the lryics, so now i can hear then properly. When i first listened to a whole song(with knowing the lryics and all)i was thinking, this guy is a genious. he expreses himself so well, u can feel how he feels, sad, mad, its all there. and the guitar changes as his mood changes, from loud to soft ect. i highly recommend this album,  i also recommend a good set of ears to listen to it, without having no idea wut he is talking about. So, cuz i had to work to figure out wut he's talking about, i gave this album a 4.5/5
B00006AW2G|5.0|A fantastic album in almost every sense of the word. The silly &quot;Country Honk&quot; should have been deleted, though, and replaced with the original &quot;Honky Tonk Women&quot;. I must have listened to Midnight Rambler and Gimme Shelter a thousand times (honestly) each but I never get tired of them.
0316666343|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I recommend reading it.  Be aware that it is very sad.  I cried through most of it.
B000002HPV|5.0|This album makes up for the weak efforts put out by Bjork for her previous Post album which was a bit disappointing.  This album contains the usual Bjork style of music, enigmatic techno music mixed with string and soft to loud disortions accompanied by echoing vocals.  The songs are good and Bjorks lyrics are typical of her style.  The music is good and eccentric as always.  The first song worth mentioning is Joga.  It is one of the best tracks on the album with haunting string arrangements, electric distortion and the echoing of Bjork's vocals in the background.  Bachellorette offers the same quality of music and rhythm as Joga follwed by my favorite track on the entire album All Neon Like.  The music for this song is very electronic and different. It is difficult to explain the music for All Neon Like, you just simply have to hear it.  This is Bjork's most imaginative and brilliant musical creation in my opinion.  The track Pluto has you envisioning as if you were in between going through a dark tunnel with no way out and a horrible nightmare.  The song can give you a bit of a headache if you are not used to that type of music, Scary!  The last song on the album All is Full of Love  is the perfect track to have you mellowed into a soothing and deep sleep.  The cover for this album is symbolic to what the music is like.
B000075BFL|5.0|This byfar is the greatest Tupac CD to ever come out to this day.  The album features many great songs like \\"Thugz Mansion,\\" and \\"Better Dayz,\\" a duet with Ron Isley.  In this album 2Pac is mainly focused on the world during his last days and his life.  The album is a double disk set and is an excellent selection of songs.  This album is the last album that will be released from 2Pac while under Death Row Records, so you'd imagine they'd save the best for last.  Both CD's are worth the five stars that is was given.
B000006YYM|5.0|This work contains a lot of classic stuff such as &quot;Proclamation&quot;, &quot;No God's a Man&quot;, &quot;The face&quot;, which are fine and solid tracks, these songs being immortal classics... you find also the typical poli-rythms parts and the multi-vocal section, which make this album a classic among others, and a &quot;GENTLE GIANT TRADEMARK&quot;. Their love for madrigals, mixed sometimes with a baroque sound typical of the keyboard oriented TRIO (more ELP oriented), make almost their works original and memorable (along with &quot;Octopus&quot;, &quot;Free Hand&quot; and the majority of &quot;In a Glass House&quot; too, this latter the most original work!!).<BR>But talking about &quot;The power and the glory&quot;, this concept album is very interesting: it tells the story of un unnamed ruler, who in appearance took care of the important values of a nation,including its culture and historical tradition, but when He began to savour the taste of POWER, He started to forget his previous attention to this patriotic sense, by appreciating only his status-quo!! You don't find here the same taste for the experimentations like into &quot;Acquiring the taste&quot;, but naturally it's less boring and more pleasant in comparison to their second work,even though They maintain a certain experimentation with dark mood in the track &quot;Aspiration&quot;, which was also an important reference to V.D.G.G. in the album &quot;Pawn Hearts&quot;!!<br />Highly recommended!!
B000001GBJ|5.0|This album, along with their 2002 release \\"Once in a Red Moon\\", is the best on the market.  This is music for nourishing your soul....both are my all-time favorites!  Enjoy! ...[web address]...
B000006YGY|5.0|Well usually I don't like space/kraut rock as much as neoclassical /classic symphonic PROG MUSIC (After Crying,Isildurs Bane,Anglagard, Mirthrandir, Yezda Urfa, etc.), but in this case, in comparison to the best german space works of Novalis,Grobschnitt or Nektar, this work stands in the same place without reserve !!The concept is about the rise and fall of Atlantis, whose narration -expecially in the track \\"Atlantis' Agony ...\\"- is a bit boring. Nevertheless, it sounds almost like Klaus Schulze and it is quite interesting. However,starting by order, the first track \\"Poseidon's Creation\\" is characterized by heavy organ riffs, enriched with an atmospheric moog theme and a majestic chorus at the end as well !!Besides the instrumental middle section concerning the track \\"The incarnation of the logos\\" is very interesting, making the sci-fi Eloy trademark a secure reference ...anyway their best trademark- the title track- is regarded as a true piece of art music, probably featuring their best stuff, even though I prefer the album \\"Dawn\\", here at Amazon.com not mentioned !!<br />If you love the best space rock, you have to buy this album!!
0066214122|5.0|Not since \\"Jurassic Park\\" has Michael Crichton written a novel as simply entertaining and spellbinding as \\"Prey\\".  The plot is straightforward: a Silicon Valley-based start-up's experiment in the blend of nano-technology and biological engineering has gone horribly wrong, creating a sinister yet virtually invisible malevolence.  Jack Forman, an unemployed programmer married to an executive of the errant startup, becomes the unsuspecting and reluctant hero.  To establish a foundation of credibility, Crichton must devote some time to the basic science involved.  But while some have found these interludes dry or unnecessary, I found these brief side roads fascinating - highly relevant to the story, expertly distilled to the layman's perspective, and well-blended with the story line.  The parallels between distributed programming, for example, and highly socialized animal communities - like termites - added a dimension to this thriller that few contemporary writers besides Crichton could pull off.  Some will have problems with the liberties taken with the science, while others will take issue with Crichton's obvious political views of the subject matter.  My advice: forget the politics and the science - just sit back and be prepared to enjoy one of the best yarns of the last decade.

B000069HK2|5.0|How can I say this? These guys are totally new and seem to have came out of nowhere with a unique refined style. They aren't a copycat band or really a \\"punk\\", \\"emo\\" or \\"hard rock\\" band, they, simply put, are NEW. From the soft, rhythmic Blue and Yellow to the insane yelling of Box Full of Sharp Objects [\\"I feel stronger....AND SHARPER!!!\\"], you will not be able to believe how tight and original this band sounds. If you like \\"screemo\\" or \\"punk\\" music you will like this; over-all, it is a masterpiece that shows this band getting the credit it deserves.
0684857219|5.0|Not only does Arnold give you everything you could possibly want in a book on weightlifting, he makes it so interesting the 800 pages fly by like nothing. I have spent the past year and a half trying to gain mass and find it very easy after reading this book. He makes you realize why you workout and breaks working out to an artform. He gets you in touch with the history of bodybuilding and makes it very interesting. The nutrition section was fabulous and his intricate detail on how to work each muscle and explanations of exactly how to get every muscle to be sculpted exactly how you want is amazing. His posing section puts the competion in perfect perspective and he gives you every pro secret you could ever want.
0226443213|5.0|Dr. Klinenberg helps us as readers, citizens, and media-watchers reconceptualize heat waves as meterological disasters to social ones.  He argues that such a reconceptualization allows us to understand that society is responsible and SHOULD be responsible for deaths.  The brillant part of his book is that he does not pin the blame on any one person, one entity, or one organization. He shows how residents of neighborhoods, the spatial organizations of neighborhoods, politicians, local and national governments, the media, and even history play a role in why these deaths occurred and why the numbers were as significant as they are. Thus, we are all responsible!<br />The book looks at the phenomenon through more than just through the lens of statistics. His ethnographic work helps to look at the lives and qualitative nuances of the numbers.  We hear the explanations and the critiques of the residents in the neighborhoods that were hit the hardest by the heat wave deaths.  In addition, KLinenberg places their voices in conversation with reporters at the time, insiders of the Daly regime, public health officials, and even police officers.  Therefore, we see the phenomenon from both the &quot;official&quot; and &quot;unofficial&quot; sources.<br />Anyone who is an activist, an academic, or a citizen of any American city should read this book. It will change your perspective on how urban areas really operate and SHOULD operate.<br />This book will make Dr. Klinenberg one of the foremost scholars of our time.
B00006LFGD|5.0|This CD is everything you could ask for and then some.    I can idetify with all on the CD and have fond memories of different occasions for each duet.  Love the Barry Gibb, Neil Diamond, and Don Johnson duets. Each of those evoke very special memories for me!!   After you listen to this CD you really wonder why some of the younger singers today still make money------they are all so very far beneath Streisand when it comes to talent and a great voice.
B00005JKG5|4.0|FLASHDANCE - is one of those films back in the 80's that when it opened up it became a huge success. I think mainly because it was a Rocky or Karate Kid-type movie. It had an upbeat theme, great music and characters that had nothing and achieved their dreams.<br />Directed by Adrinne Lynn (Fatal Attraction, Indecent Proposal) the film launched Jennifer Beals ( The Bride, Vampires Kiss ) into stardom over night. Her love interest, played by Michael Nouri ( Captain America, Black Ice ) also had achieved recognition for this film. Even the model/dancer Cynthia Rhodes (Staying Alive, Runaway, Dirty Dancing) went on to achieve great success.<br />The story is simple. As small eats-coast/mid-west town girl has a dream of going to a real ballet school and become a professional dancer. The school is elite, expensive and requires an approval process that included an audition. She is non confident and has little self-esteem.<br />The other thing that makes her feel less adequate is the fact that though by day she work in a welding mill - by night she is a club dancer in a local bar. The odds are against her - and except for her closest friends - no one can think she can make it. Guess what? I leave the rest for you to enjoy. Very positive ad upbeat film about any one can achieve their dreams if the keep on trying and believe in themselves.<br />There are many DVD extra's on it and it would have been nice to hear the cast commentary, or the directors AND the cast (the cast is always more interesting then the directors commentary - unless its Mel Brooks, Woody Allen, Billy Crystal, Carl Reiner - former actors turned directors) but they must have not wanted to pay them. (Paramount that is.) Overall a great film for the spirits to be lifted for everyone who watches it. Let me know what you think. (12-10-02)

B00006AFF5|5.0|THE GRINCH WHO STLE CHRISTMAS - Special Edition (Re-Release) is a marketing tool to get you to buy it again. Why? There is a good reason this time - forgetting the CD-ROM extras, it has a great commentary feature that includes looks and views of behind the scenes, art work and rehearsals and filming. You can watch it with the extras or without. Who's the commentary by Ron Howard (Apollo 13, Backdraft and Splash)<br />The film stars the insatiable talents and comic timing of Jim Carry and it is definitely his movie. Now what also shines are the supporting cast. Taylor Momsen (We Were Soldiers, Spy Kids II)) as Cindy Lou Who, Molly Shannon (The Music Man, Superstar) as Mrs. Betty Lou Who and as Mr. Lou Lou Who (The Laramie Project, A Midsummer Nights Dream) complete the ideal \\"Who\\" family. Not to mention some standout performances by Jeffrey Tambor (The Larry Sanders Show, Muppets From Space) as the town Mayor and Christine Baranski (The Bird Cage, Chicago, Bowfinger) as his almost love interest.<br />Even the female dog playing Max has incredible timing and great looks for Jim to react too. I have reviewed this DVD before on it's original release - but this one has extra features that make it worth having a second copy. (I actually have three - original release full-screen and wide-screen version and now this one.)<br />The DVD Rom features are great! The recipies and things you can do with your pictures and cards is a lot of fun for the whole family.<br />The sets, costumes, designs of the make-up (Designed by Rick Baker and even the score by James Horner make this an exceptional family and holiday film. There is humor for adults and kids alike and the sight gags are incredible. It takes a few liberties here an there from the original novels by J. Geils, but is has a great message and happy ending for the kids - it even borrows directly from the cartoon-like images scene in the classic Boris Karloff original cartoon. (12-10-02)
0689815816|5.0|This book is great for preschool and younger. Depending on how dramatic the reader wants to be. \\"Going on a Bear Hunt\\" is a crowd pleaser. I was a day-care and preschool provider for several years. I worked with at risk children. This book captivated all of them.
B00005JKCH|5.0|SPIDER-MAN - was a great surprise for me. I was excited and although he takes 2nd seat for me next to Superman as my favorite Super Hero, the film was a great and pleasant surprise! Very entertaining.<br />Directed by Sam Raimi (Darkman, The Gift), the film is action packed and intriguing. The story is real and very down-to-earth. It has a heart and it is a positive message for kids to be the best they can be and believe in themselves.<br />An amazing performance by Toby McGuire (Pleasantville, The Cider House Rules) as the web-slinger himself and as his alter ego Peter Parker. Toby has an honestness about his personality that makes it all real for the viewer of this film. Mary Jane is played fantastically by Kirsten Dunst (Bring It On, Small Soldiers) and her believability as a the girl-next door makes Peter Parker's passion to help others even stronger. Also Cliff Robertson (Melting Pot, Charlie) and Rosemary Harris (Wuthering Heights, Holocost)  as Peter's Uncle Ben and Aunt May are very real and important to the story of this film. They set the tone for what Spiderman is to become and is.<br />The standout performance - in a dual role - is given by Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin who terrorizes the city. He plays the psychotic very well. He certainly motivates New York City needing a super hero like Spiderman. His energy and exciting gymnastics, for a man his age, and he did most of his own stunts - is amazing!<br />The DVD extras include some great historical info on Stan Lee and the evolution of Spiderman. There are production shorts and technically information on the computer generated imagery that was done in the film as well as the original screen test for the actors. The commentaries are informative and very interesting. There is also CD-ROM features including a sampling of the video game. This is a good Super Hero DVD to own right next to Superman: The Movie.

B00005YW4H|5.0|This is one of the most listenable CDs in my extensive collection.  Norah Jones' captivating voice and musical talent combine with an outstanding group of exceptional musicians to produce a sound that is fresh, soothing and unlike any other.  It just doesn't get much better than this!
B00005JLRR|2.0|I'm sorry, but I was very disappointed in the movie.  I think they could have left us with the assumption that the crew was out happily exploring space together forever.  Sticking us with Data's learning disabled brother just doesn't do it for me.  Even if they do make another movie, I'll know it's not Data.  I think one of the biggest mistakes the STAR TREK franchise EVER made was killing off Kirk in GENERATIONS.  I loved the sense of mystery about his demise.  How they would reverently mention him occasionally, but never elaborate on what happened to him.  It only enhanced his character's mythical status.  In NEMESIS, I thought Picard squaring off against the villain became very repetitive after awhile.  They can say, \\"Well, we can't<br />showcase all of the characters in two hours\\", but I think that's bunk because they did it very nicely in many one hour episodes.  Worf barely had a line and I couldn't believe Deanna's only function was to cry and be \\"mind-raped\\", something they already explored in one of the episodes.<br />And the cinematography was terrible! The whole thing looked like it was filmed in the dark.  Even in the planet scene at the beginning, the lighting was WAY off. One of the things that made the Enterprise in the original series and in TNG so appealing was its lighting.  It actually looked like a place you would<br />want to work.  That was a contrast to all of the alien ships.  Now the Enterprise looks as grim and forbidding as a Romulan warbird.  And Data's sacrifice, while noble, was a pale copy of Spock's since the writers haven't come up with an original idea since 1994.  I really think it might have worked in a different story, in a different context with more pathos.  But like Kirk's death, I came away thinking, \\"They killed Data for THAT?\\"  All I<br />wanted to do when I got home was watch \\"Star Trek 4: The Voyage Home\\" again.<br />The only part I really liked was Picard ramming the alien ship.  (The only part I liked in GENERATIONS was the Enterprise crashing so I must just really like starship crashes.)<br />I guess the final analysis is that there will always be one hour episodes of TNG that are VASTLY superior to any of the movies.  From the preview of this movie, I thought it involved this interesting character mentally seducing or torturing ALL of the cast, not just slapping around Picard. (Okay, Patrick,<br />we know you're the star.  We know you're making the big bucks.  We get it! Now run off to the set of the X-Men, okay?)Enterprise crashing so I must just really like starship crashes.)<br />I guess the final analysis is that there will always be one hour episodes of TNG that are VASTLY superior to any of the movies.

B00005JLF5|5.0|For those synics out there that never gave DS9 a chance, please do so because it is the finest series of Star Trek ever made. Because the series is set in the same place it meens the crew can not run away from the problems, unlike the starship set series. This makes for some realy interesting and sometimes darker stories. As each season goes by the better it gets. Collect all 7 collectors sets for a realt stunning story. You WILL regret it if you dont.
B000065V41|5.0|I LOVE this movie! I can't let a Christmas pass without watching it 3 or 4 times! I have even been known to watch it in the middle of summer!<br />The dialog by Scrooge and the other characters closely follow the book.  What adds to this story, however, is the running commentary by Rizzo and Gonzo as Charles Dickens.  Sure, they take license by adding a second Marley, but it seems natural, and by changing names of stores - Fozziwig &amp; Mom's, for instance - but it only personalizes it and makes it all the more entertaining.  The music is excellent and there is so much emotion in this movie - much more than in any other version I have seen!<br />I really think that this movie is by far one of the best Muppet movies I have seen. I only wish Jim Henson had been alive to voice Kermit (although he was done superbly!) and to see the end result!
B00004XQP4|5.0|I must admit. Warning is different from previous albums. No, it's not terrible. Not at all. The way I look at is if you respect that the band is maturing then this cd is perfect. Green Day is no longer the pure punk band it once was. I have been a Green Day fan for a long time and it always frustrates me when people say Green Day are sellouts. If you listen to all the albums you'll see the evolution of the band itself. It started with 1039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours all the way to Warning. Take my word for it though, Green Day will always be punk. But maybe a different kind of punk.

I took the CD with me to physical therapy.  The mood of Norah's music and her soft voice was the best thing I could've used for relaxing.  I only wish I could give this album 10 EMPHATIC STARS!  I am anxiously anticipating waht Norah will give us in the future.
B000002H6C|5.0|Metallica just before sissy metal was put on the shelves.  Metallica has never been the same and they WILL NEVER be the same.  &quot;One&quot; is etched in stone by now.
B00006LFGD|5.0|What a great cd. These songs are timeless. My favorites are:<br />\\"You Don't Bring Me Flowers\\", with Neil Diamond, to me a classic, \\"Tell Him\\", with Celine Dion, they're voices are powerful together, and \\"What Kind of Fool\\", with Barry Gibb, you can just feel their emotions in that song. A really great listening pleasure as always.
B000002JQ6|5.0|Best Live Album.  AC/DC comes alive and the production is unmatched.  Sound quality is practically flawless.  You're there in the front row listening in awe.
0316666343|5.0|I have not been so moved by a book in many years! I was expecting one type of story but was pleasantly surprised to find so much more than what i expected. Each character is well developed and the author manages to make the reader really feel what each character is feeling. I felt as though I was going through the whole grieving process with each member of Susie's family and friends. The author takes you on a journey full of emotion and self discovery unlike i have experienced in a long time from a novel.  I read other reviews, and those who found this book disappointing or boring are simply missing the story's purpose.. I was not the least bit disappointed in the ending as others may have felt, because I get what the author was trying to say. Without giving anything away...if you are going into this book, expecting just another murder/whodunnit book....you will be disappointed. I usually begin another book as soon as i finish one, but after reading this, i find myself unable to get it out of my mind and will wait a few days before picking up another. A MUST read!
B000002ILG|5.0|Excellent.  It's that trademark White Lion sound that does it for me every time.  Vito's guitar is simply let loose on this record.  It's free to prowl all over the songs here.  The classics are all there, &quot;When The Children Cry&quot;, &quot;Wait&quot;, and one of my favorite all time rockers, &quot;Hungry&quot;.  The louder you play it the better it sounds, with those booming drums.  Goose bumps, every time.
0316666343|2.0|Initially, I thought this book would be a very interesting read.  The concept of a young girl narrating the story from heaven is very novel.  The description of her rape and murder is graphic, scary, and attention grabbing.  Unfortunately, by the end of the book, there is not a single reason to care about any of the characters.  With the exception of the protagonist, they are flat and unidimensional.  And if you don't feel emotionally attached to the characters, then it is very difficult to actually care about what is going on in the book. I read the first half of the book in a couple of days - - and the remainder seemed to take literally forever to get though.  I must have missed something because the critics loved it.
B000002UUX|5.0|This is the best heavy metal album of all time.
B00005QIPH|2.0|The Hives, the strokes, the vines, and white stripes are all the same band. Dont you see that?  JKing...But see this is what went through the minds of the record company when they put out this band:  \\"Hmmm, theres no good rock bands, why can't we find any?  This rap act is dieing out ,Mr. Smith , we need something new...  i think we should start a different breed of music and call it the \\"saviour of rock\\".  We will call it \\"garage-rock\\".  We will tell people it is the saviour and air it on MTV.  We will find or create bands with the word \\"the\\" in the names.  This will be the new market.  It will get publicity, and people will go buy it.  People WILL like this music.\\"<br />Ok...the problem today is there are not enough good bands.  There are good bands, but not enough.  Record companies need money. So what do they do? They bring this breed of music and sell it to the public. This band is not the saviours of rock'n roll. This is OK music, fine to listen to, but is NOT inspiring. Definetly overrated by the public.  Its just like putting in any other garage rock cd.  If you listen to lyrics more than the music, then you might like this band.  If you grew up with this music or like the atmosphere it gives off, then you might like this band.  I judge music by how inspiring it is.  Not by if it \\"sells out\\", who they are, if they kill cats, or because of their \\"motives\\"...  The saviour of rock n' roll hasn't come yet, but they will.  They'll be billionaires for it.  And there IS much more good music to be written.  It just hasn't been done yet.
B000000OQF|5.0|Regardless of what has happened to the band or what its future is, they made magic here.  That's all that needs to be said.
0440237688|5.0|As I received The Giver I expected another book like all the others that were required for school- boring and useless. Over this christmas break we were told to read the first 10 chapters and even though I'm a person who loves books I reluctantly picked up the giver on friday night, the first night of our break. Surprisanly, after the first few chapters, I could not put it down, and even though my teacher asked us not to read any further, I finished the entire book in one sitting, as I was too absorbed in it to put it down. The Giver teaches life lessons that are sure to grap your heart.
B0000630BT|5.0|This is my favorite Priest record.  It's louder, heavier, than anything they released previously.  Forget everything after this album.  Without Halford, Priest is gone.  &quot;Painkiller&quot; is one of the best metal anthems ever composed.
0316666343|2.0|Why are so many people in love with this book?  I will admit that the first half is so good you don't want to put it down.  That second half is horrid!!!  It is as though the author had to drag herself to finish it and did so with overused cliches.  What was up with the \\"Ghost\\" like out of body sexual experience?-I realize reality had to be suspended since the narrator is dead-but it was just too silly and reminded too much of Patrick Swayze taking over Whoopi Goldberg's body so he could be with his beloved Demi Moore).  I wanted to love this book to the end but it was just not possible.
B000002IRL|5.0|Razor sharp precision on guitar and Blitz's true voice is born here.  Absolute rage, at the perfect tempo.  They've come close, but they've never achieved the same thing that they achieved on Horrorscope.  Just be happy that they have never changed the formula.  Overkill is still Overkill today.
B000069HK2|5.0|real rock is back and back in the form of the used.  as you see i said rcok and not punk well thats because you can't put them in just one group. one song may be poppy then the next hardcore, but it doesn't matter, this band is the future of rock. bert's lyrics are just insprational. songs like, &quot;taste of ink&quot; and box of sharp objects&quot;. it alos helps that bert has the voice of an anjel at times, he can sing with the best of them, but you can't forget his screaming, move ove jon davis, bert has arrived to take you throne. now go out and buy this damn cd
B000069AUI|5.0|I have to admit that after the release of &quot;Parachutes&quot;, Coldplay became one of my favorite bands because of their sound that sets them apart from most of the mainstream pop and rock that is played on today's radio. Their songs have a certain amount of comfort embedded in them that allows you to relax while listening, whether at home or in your car. I didn't think that Coldplay would be able to top their first album, but after hearing &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot;, I was quickly silenced. The band has noticably matured in sound and lyric from their previous love-stricken cd, and &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; is easily one of the favorites in my collection.<br />This cd is definitely worth your money if you enjoy similar bands such as U2, Radiohead, and The Smashing Pumpkins. I know I would never pass up a Coldplay cd.
B00006JIA4|1.0|Is there a reason for this?? NOOO, it doesn't. The first two CDs deals with with great music, but since 1991 (Freddie's death) there is no new music. All the compilations since Greatest hits 2 are only different ways to make money. DON'T BUY THIS COMPILATION
B00004Y6Q5|5.0|This soundtrack is the greatest soundtrack I've heard in a while. It is a unique blend of electronic sounds and strings. Who would have thought a mix like that could create such an excellend soundtrack? Clint Mansell and the Kronos Quartet really did a great job with this CD. I would definatly dub it a must have.
B000066C8G|4.0|This directorial debut for film funny-man Ben Stiller is so stupid, so goofy, so outrageous that it's incredibly hilarious. At some points, I was laughing so hard my side hurt. But take warning: some of the jokes are somewhat offensive. Roger Ebert gave this movie a one-star because he didn't like the fact that the plot centered around the assassination of a world leader from Malaysia. What Ebert failed to understand is that the movie doesn't want to be taken seriously at all! Cool it, Ebert! It's just a joke! Ben Stiller is constantly hilarious as our hero, Derek Zoolander, a male model with \\"3% bodyfat, 1% brain activity.\\" It you like this kind of stuff (which I do) this movie is right up your alley. But if you get offended when the bad guy wants to kill a world leader, go see some Disney movie.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|tatu is the best group ever!!! the cd is perfect!! and their musics are awesome!!!
B000069AUI|3.0|Obviously, my first experience with Coldplay was hearing &quot;Yellow&quot; on the radio a couple years back. I really didn't care for it but then after hearing &quot;Shiver&quot; and &quot;Trouble&quot;, I knew that I HAD to have Parachutes; their first album. Although I never did warm to &quot;Yellow&quot; but I was absolutely blown away by all of the other songs on that album. Then I heard of talk of a new Coldplay Cd and after hearing the first two singles on the radio and loving them, my expectations for this album were pretty high indeed. <br />I have always been a lover of soft, sensitive, emotional ballads and Coldplay certainly serves up a lot of them, which keeps them secure in being one of my favorite new music groups. But, despite the love I have for these beautiful ballads that often make you go run to get that box of kleenex, I have to wonder if maybe it all gets a little too monotonous after awhile.<br />&quot;Clocks&quot;, which was the reason I purchased this cd primarily is easily THE standout track on the album. The melody has a faster and more complex sound to it and the angelic sound of the vocals make this song nearly hypnotic. This song is not only the best song on this album but simply the best song yet. I think another reason of why I like it is because it could have easily fit in with the songs on the Parachutes album. Contrary to popular opinion, I feel that this album does not surpass their previous effort. I feel as if there is something missing here. Like I said before, as great as many of the ballads are, too much of a good thing certainly doesn't help matters.<br />This cd is chock full of slow, simple, quiet ballads( In fact the whole cd is pretty much just that ). A few are fine but after hearing one after the other, it all starts to sound a bit monotonous and, well,...Boring. The first song, &quot;Politik&quot; is likable enough and somewhat catchy. Then comes &quot;In my place&quot; which we already know and like, and then we moveonto &quot;God put a smile upon your face&quot;;a song that I don't really care much for. It's repetition is emotionless and boring in my opinion and the banging in the background is irritating enough to make me skip to the next track. Onto &quot;The scientist&quot;, this song is one of those borderline tracks that I'm pretty much impartial to. It's a nice ballad despite being quite simplistic with the piano and guitar sounds being the dominant ones. This song probably would have been a lot better if nearly half the songs wern't so similar to it. After the magnificent &quot;Clocks&quot;, &quot;Daylight&quot; and &quot;Green eyes&quot; pretty much set the tone left by &quot;The scientist&quot;  that will persist for almost the remainder of the album. Some are better than others. &quot;A warning sign&quot; ismiraculously a pretty good song if you're still awake and paying attention after suffering through the previous two bland and boring tracks. Other than &quot;Clocks&quot;, &quot;Politik&quot;, and &quot;A warning sign&quot;,  the only other standout song that is undeniably great is the final track, &quot;Amsterdam&quot;. This song oozes with the deep emotion that was probably the intent of many of the other songs that fell short of the mark. <br />I think that overall, this album is worth buying if you enjoy somber ballads with melodies that are pretty simple. I think that in this case, the album suffered because it lacked the energy of the previous album. It has a moderate amount of very good songs which will make this cd worth buying but as a whole, it has too much repetition of simple, boring melodies that at times, make this album excrutiating to listen to. It probably would have been better if condensed or if the band had attempted to be a bit more experimental with it's sound like in &quot;Clocks&quot;. Not a bad album but it could have been much better.<br />But still, I'll look forward to their next effort in the years to come.
0066620996|4.0|Let me say the author makes for a fast and amusing read.  Some points that are brought out are interesting and will give you a moment for pause to think.  If you work for a company you will immediately begin to size up your company and how it performs against the many concepts in the book.<br />You will immediately begin to see if your leader has what it takes to be a level 5 leader, if he can truly follow the stockdale principle, and if your company is disciplined enough to only what they do best with the hedgehog concept.<br />Most companies will never make this book, many have shortcomings that with some revamping their thought process they could improve in all areas, but it takes courage to move into this transition.<br />I have found the book to be very insightful and a springboard for further study of companies, their leaders, and their strategic policies.
B00004KD1A|4.0|This disc features guitar genius Rory Gallagher at his best, in a typically dynamic set featuring some of his best songs.  As always, Rory and the band are in fine form.  However, I must concur with the reviewer from East Glenville on one major point.  There is only one basic problem with this disc, which is that poor editing has removed Rory's spoken introductions from some tracks, and on &quot;Shadow Play&quot; (one of Rory's best rockers), the song simply fades out, an unsatisfactory ending to a great song.  It would be nice to have a restored version of this disc; both Rory and his material deserve it.  Notwithstanding that, the performances here are typical of the genius of Rory Gallagher, perhaps the most underrated artist of all time
B000002LE6|4.0|Ok....so he's naked on the cover. When it came out in '88, it was sort of disturbing, but he makes up for it with whats inside. Some pretty funky music.
0140288503|5.0|Black Hawk Down is absolutely the best account of Modern Infantry combat you will find, and also an excellent analysis of America's role and limitations in the post Cold War world (although written before 9-11). I read this work completely mesmerized; Bowden wrote this book like someone would have written their doctoral dissertation-with painstainking research through an astonishing amount of interviews (including many Somalis who were in the battle), penetrating analysis of the geo-politics, and an insightful tribute to the courage and dedication of the men of Task Force Ranger and Delta Force teams. If you've seen the movie and liked it, do yourself a favor and read this book. The real story is intensely more layered, more complex, and ultimately more moving than the movie has time to convey, and drives home the point that the battle of Mogidishu really did set the stage for the climate that exists a decade later: <BR>Writes Bowden, \\"(Somolia) stands as an enduring symbol of Third World ingratitude and intractability, of the futility of trying to resolve local animosity with international muscle.\\" One can't help but think of later events such as the growth and proliferation of terror networks unafraid to confront the US, which of course led to 9-11 and the war in Afganistan. This book is an absolute watershed in that it is already studied at all the major war colleges, service academies, and Security agencies as THE definitive study of the battle that set the stage for American miltiary strategy in the early 21st century.
B000066NW0|5.0|Let Go is an awesome album! It's one of those albums where you can listen to it from beginning to end without having to skip any tracks. Avril is different from other artists out there now and she has a style all her own. There's something on the album for every mood. You can feel her pain and emotions while listening to her songs. Avril is unique, does what she wants. Whatever feels right for her she does and she doesn't just do something because everyone else is. Avril's an awesome skater-punk chick who's gonna take over...
B00005JKZT|5.0|\\"Lord of the rings: the Two towers\\" is undeniably the number one film of 2002. It's an awe-inspiring fantasy. The savagery of warfare and the presence of fatality being imagined with such sumptuousness haven't been this good in a long time. The beautiful cinematography is bound to impress you. The movie does get a little slow around the middle when Aragorn dreams of Arwen but the movie soon paces up quickly. Despite the fact that the movie isn't as hearty as the first one (Fellowship of the rings), this sequel is even better. The suspense, battling the Orcs, and the visual pleasure of the eye-catching landscapes is all wonderful. The movie even has the soothing score to fit the scenes making the scenes perfectly in the mood of the movie. The movie is a mind-blowing, mind-boggling masterpiece of a mess!  The Two towers is the middle third of an epic that will doubtlessly excel as one of the most courageous and victorious films in motion-picture history. It's an epic of grandeur. Spectacular, thrilling, and significantly touching, it's the very description of heroic adventure. It has the fighting that `Star Wars episode II' has, the heroic adventure that `Spiderman' has, the moving scenes that `The good girl' has, and the imaginative creatures not to mention a great novel that `Harry Potter and the Chamber of secrets' has so in short `The two towers' is a wrap-up of all the critically successful films of 2002. Peter Jackson's excellent movie makes you forget that the most horrific and sinister scenes are yet to be seen in 2003's `Lord of the rings: The return of the king'. It's a thought-provoking work of art. It makes you wonder how the third movie will ever compete with the second but that's what we thought when we watched the first movie. The cast ensemble was of coarse excellent and the battle of Helm's Deep is one of the best, most outgoing battle sequences ever to be showed on the big movie screen. The movie will have you at the edge of your seat at all times. You'd forget everything. It's just like actually playing the Two towers game. Now this is filmmaking on a supreme level; inspiring, stirring, and ideal. When the hours long movie is over, you can just not stop wanting more. The movie is definitely built on numbers like the countless numbers of Orcs, the movie budget, the prediction of the movie's box-office gross, and let's not forget the 26,000 extras. <br /> The balance of supremacy is uneven across Middle-earth. Two Towers - the Dark Lord Sauron's dominating place at Barad-dûr and the wizard Saruman's place at Orthanc - have allied to fight in opposition to all civilization, and bring about the ending of the race of Humankind. The mortifying evil of The One Ring, forged by Sauron, has split the Fellowship that stuck together to destroy it. The quest has already claimed the life of the Wizard Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) and the Human Boromir (Sean Bean). Only the Hobbit Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) has shown some resistance to its great power, which makes him solely capable to be the Ring bearer. Now Frodo must face his fate unaided. Accompanied only by his reliable companion, Sam, Frodo goes into evil lands uninformed that he is on the trail of Gollum who previously owned the ring. I won't tell you the rest. It'll spoil it! <br /> Overall it's an exceptional movie. It's something that'll get rave reviews in all reader's (watcher's) response journals. The Fellowship of the rings showed why the ring was important to the characters and now the sequel explains why the ring is important to us. The sequel is something you can watch for a long time on the cinemas while you wait for the third movie in the trilogy. Peter Jackson is like Joseph L. Mankiewicz (Cleopatra-1963) in the way that he uses an expensive budget to make his movie a masterpiece also not caring how long the movie runs for. He is also like David Lean (Dr. Zhivago) in the way that he uses spectacular cinematography to impress us. And last but not least he's like Steven Spielberg in the way that he creates movies that impress the generations and in the way that he will too leave a great effect in motion picture history.
B00006690G|5.0|As an \\"Eminem Show\\" owner for about 7 months, I have to say that this album still remains a favorite. Almost every track caught my attention right away and unlike most albums I've bought, has stayed in my cd changer for more than six months. Because of the substantial amount of material on the \\"eminem show,\\" it always seems to keep me entertained and my head bumping. For the most part, each track has a different beat, with special attention on \\"haile's Song,\\" easily Eminem's best (and maybe only) ballad, in which he shows no shame in displaying he has some ability to sing. Also special notice to \\"cleaning out my closet\\" as one of the songs that has potential to become one of his signatures. Overall, the album brings about Eminem-sympathizers, a previously impossible task.
B00005JL95|5.0|Since the Lion King every disney movie (except pixar) was rusehd for me. Pocahontas, The Hunchback of Noter Dame, Hercules, Mulan, Tarzan and Atlantis were very unlike disney. I was beginning to think that disney was dying until this movie came out. I was so amazed at the amount of effort they put into this film. I thought this was going to be a cartoony piece of junk, but o boy was I wrong. The movie had everything. Drama, Action and Comedy. And the way the studied hawaii was also amazing. I especially like Lilo's tempertantrums and fights with stich and lilo. I also though stich was so adorable. I thought he was int he movie just to cause trouble, but he turned out to actually speak english and was quite lovable. The only thing that I didn't like about this movie was that it didn't have a really good villain.
0800141601|2.0|After viewing \\"first night\\" I spent a great deal of time wondering just why they bothered to imply this story had anything to do with the King Arthur legends.  Change the names of the three main characters and you have a generic and very bland fantasy story.  The tale of Camelot has been retold countless time over countless generations and I am not complaining about the fact that the story was altered.  What I am complaining about is the fact that the story itself was so blatantly disregarded.   A new villainous character Malagant is introduced for no good reason, there are more than enough bad guys in the Arthurian legends without having to create a new one.  I suppose that by creating a new character they writers were able to avoid having to think about motive or character development.  Conspicuous by their absence are the likes of Sir Galahad, Morgan le Fay, the Holy Grail, Merlin, Excalibur, Percival, Mordred and dozens of other interesting and supporting characters.  <BR> <BR>Sean Connery makes for a great Arthur but one wasted here.  I very much enjoyed the idea of Arthur as an old man who is tired of war and conquest who wants to settle down with a beautiful wife in the city he built.  Unfortunately Connery is given so little to do in this movie, largely he stands around looking either worried or regal.  <br />The villainous Malagant (Ben Cross) is simply evil in the worst sort of melodramatic way, he kills innocent women and children for his amusement, he dresses in black, he has an evil laugh, and his castle is even twisted and ugly.  There is no real reason for him to act the way he does he is just there to give Lancelot something to fight.  <br />I am not now and most likely never will be a fan of Richard Gere.  His Lancelot is one of the least memorable performances of that role I can recall.  There is no reason to like or sympathize with Lancelot.  I am at a loss to understand why Guinevere (Julia Ormond) falls in love with him.  To her credit Ormond does a good job at portraying a woman torn between two very different men.  Unfortunately the movie itself robs Guinevere of ever having to make a choice between Arthur and Lancelot, Arthur conveniently dies and Lancelot is declared the defacto new king.  <br />The movie itself looks spectacular but the writing and the casting of Gere leaves it lacking terribly.
B00007BH5C|5.0|Last year I was so excited when I got &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; as a Christmas gift, because the movie didn't even had opened in Brazil and I couldn't take the soundtrack outta my stereo.<BR>This year I went and bought my own presents, and I didn't hesitate to buy &quot;The Two Towers&quot;. Of course I couldn't wait for Christmas, so I'm already listening to the score The lasta song is called &quot;Gollum's song&quot; and is sung by an artist called &quot;Emiliana Torrini&quot; (which voice is quite similar to Bjk) and I was amazed. The darker tone in this score is highly felt, with much more strings than the last. The movie hasn't opened yet, so at least I'll be able to Identify them when I see it. <BR>Go ahead and buy it and you'll be as astonished as I am.
0060523794|1.0|Of course elephants dont dance - they drop stuff on the floor and everyone walks around it pretending not to notice the stink. The problem with Lou Gerstner is that he didnt realize everyone was pretending not to notice his smell.<br />I go with the reviewers who will not buy this book - I looked at it and it made me sick. Why? Because it honors he who did not honor his employees. This book is about a self-centered megalomaniac who thinks in this most aggrandizing way that change comes from the top. First there was no change here. IBM grew during a period where anyone in the computer business would grow. Secondly, anyone who knows anything about leadership knows that real business change and innovation does not cascade down through the organization from the top, any more than change cascades through all of society. If you look closely at successful change efforts in American organizations, you will see that the innovation started from the middle and spread outward.<br />I just wonder how well IBM would have done had Gerstner actually been being a real leader?<br />Don't buy this book thinking you will learn how to manage an organization for the benefit of anyone but yourself. If you plan to get rich at the expense of your employers and stockholders, if you plan to reduce the size and morale of your organization, if you intend to create fear or doubt in your employees, or if you just like to stay out of touch with your employees and pass down non-sensical management edicts to hear yourself talk and impress yourself - hey this book and this mentor is for you. Good luck.
B00004Y7SF|5.0|Easily my favorite Christmas album.  To the other reviewers who trashed it: you just don't get it.  To the Osbornes:  your show is funny, but you are wrong about this album.  This girl can sing, and the combination of pop/jazz/blues works wonderful.  Do yourself a favor and buy this album.
B00005JKZT|2.0|I hated The Two Towers. Now, I'm not such a purist that I hate any kind of deviation from the books, but in The Two Towers Peter Jackson didn't just change some scenes, he also changed major characters and consequently the whole logic behind the story. Why?! I can only think of one reason: everyone in the cinema must be convinced that Aragorn is the one true hero of the movie. Let me explain. In the last half hour of TFOTR we see Aragorn refuse the Ring. In the books it is Faramir who does that. Faramir is a noble character. As noble as Aragorn, but more human and therefore more likable. In the movie Faramir has changed into an evil carbon-copy of Boromir who captures the hobbits and takes them to the city of Osgiliath only to release them after Frodo (who strangely has changed into a Psycho-hobbit, but then *Sam* has turned into Marten Luther King apparantly, with all the speeches he spews - with apologies to MLK) has nearly given the Ring to the Nazgul. Now, what is the one great big underlying logic in the books? Why do Frodo and Sam succeed against such great evil? Because Sauron - being evil - cannot comprehend that anybody who posessess the Ring won't use it. Aragorn looks for that purpose into the Palantir, so Sauron will get distracted (Sauron expects Aragorn to have the Ring and use it) and to buy the Ringbearers more time. That's why the great big battles are being fought, against overwhelming odds, against all better judgement: to buy more time because you cannot fight evil with swords and arrows (hear that mr Bush?). In the movie however, it's all about swashbuckling Aragorn who almost singlehandedly battles 10.000 orks. Everybody else are supposedly idiots who simply don't know what they're doing (Theoden suddenly becomes a stupid stubborn king who leads his people into a trap at Helmsdeep, Faramir turns into a baddie - why should Eowyn ever fall in love with *him*?) and Sauron and the Nazgul are - for all that Sauron is a giant all-seeing Eye - simplyblind: they literary see Frodo with the Ring in Osgiliath, they now KNOW the Ring is carried by a Hobbit near their borders, but they simply ignore that fact and let him crawl into Mordor. Yeah, sure. Add to that a lot of annoying, unnessesary botched details (Gandalf claiming to have lived in Middle-Earth for 300 years instead of 2000, the Warg-fight and Aragorn falling down a cliff - hello? are we talking about the same books here? - and Legolas surfing down some stairs on a shield, not to mention the lost chances in regard to the Ent-scenes) and you know why I exited the cinema with clenched fist, all but foaming round the mouth. If the FotR had been equally bad, I would have just shrugged my shoulders but because the FotR was so utterly brilliant I could have just wept. Such opportunities you had, Peter Jackson, and you botched it! The only reason I give two stars is because Gollum was so spot on. The only one in the entire movie perhaps who stayed in character. Too bad.
B00001NFCY|5.0|When I first bought this album, I bought it solely for the two top single hits, \\"With Arms Wide Open\\" and \\"Higher\\".  But since listening to this album then and now, I've found that actually those two tracks aren't the heart beat of this album but rather just minimal high points.  The album epitomizes rock and lyrical style from beginning to end and still remains a high played CD of mine.  The album begins with \\"Are You Ready?\\" that has the high octane rock sound and is amazing too with good pump up lyrics.  \\"What If\\" follows in wonderful hard rock fashion (and it's even better to see live) while \\"Beautiful\\" talks about how vanity in beauty is meaningless and empty..an awesome song on the album.  \\"Say I\\" is just awesome with lyrics and keeps up the high octane rock of the previous three tracks (and live it's too cool with the hissing on the word \\"say\\").  \\"Wrong Way\\" and \\"Faceless Man\\" are really good tracks too but not the strongest on the album while \\"Never Die\\" is just too cool lyrically.  \\"With Arms Wide Open\\" follows and seems to open up the darker part of the album after it is followed by \\"Higher\\".  \\"Wash Away Those Years\\", my second favorite song on the album, follows next with descriptions of tragedy and violence plaguing the world and it's just lyrically so compelling.  \\"Inside Us All\\", my favorite Creed song ever, ends of the album in heighth with deep penetrating lyrics of encouragement and hope.  The hidden track, \\"With Arms Wide Open\\" encompasses the symphonic version made popular on the radio and still remains a beautiful piece of work.  Human Clay made Creed famous maybe for two songs  but it also gained millions of fans for the depth and complexity of the album from lyrics and intoxicating music, perhaps even better than My Own Prison and Weathered.
B00005QW5X|5.0|Amazing, poignant, moving, thrilling.  Incredible soundtrack, might as well buy that too while you get the DVD because as soon as you finish watching it twice in a row you'll want the soundtrack immediately!  Great story, blah blah blah. Insert superlative here, if it's positive it's true.
0066214122|1.0|This book is not worth the read. I am a fan of Mr. Chichton but this book just doesn't work. The characters are weak along with the plot. I wish Mr. Chichton would stop with the futuristic Science Fiction junk and stick to the more humanistic style stories such as, Rising Sun and Disclosure.
6300214184|4.0|I'll just say the music helped a lot to make this movie great.  If it wasn't the for the music the movie probably would be nothing.  I mean great dancing definitly at the end.  The end of the movie is probably my favorite part out of the whole movie.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|Wow.. this cd blew me away. Every solitare song is a hit. Not one minute of Relationship Of Command i didnt like.. Highly recommend. <br />Fav song - Pattern Against User
B000066C1N|5.0|I have all the Bryan Adams CDs that are released in America.  When I heard he's doing songs for the animation 'Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron' I had to get the soundtrack!  And I have to say this is a GREAT soundtrack and the music and the songs work very well with the movie!  So if you're a B.A. fan this is a must for you collection and I shouldn't stop there... Hans Zimmer did a great job as well so if your his fan then this is also a must for your collection.  B.A. and Hans Zimmer work great together on this soundtrack.  'Here I Am' and 'Brothers Under the Sun' are my big time favorite and also 'Homeland' and 'Run Free.'  So what are you doing still reading, go and get the soundtrack and I promise you will not be disappointed.
B000068QY7|5.0|It simply amazes me that a band that rocked 6 years ago are still making music this good and fresh. Songs such as Stop Crying Your Heart Out and Songbird are so moving it is somewhat mind bending that a band of thugs and louts can make music so good.<br />However fear not, the Oasis of old can be heard on this album too. The Hindu Times, Hung in a Bad Place and Better Man are fantastic (watch out for the outro of Better Man - the song grabs you by the balls and then drags you round the room, by the end leaving you in a heap on the floor begging for more!!!).<br />Now they are going back in the right direction, their next album is all set up to rocket them up to Legendary Status, and I for one cant wait
B00004RYZT|2.0|Ok, well first of all, I don't see what the hype is about Rammstien. Other than a select few songs, I don't think they're too great. But when my two friends freaked out after seeing this dvd I thought I would give it a chance. Unfortunatly, I had just purchased the greatest live dvd in the history of music: And All That Could Have Been, by Nine Inch Nails. So already I had big expectations, even though they love the NIN dvd too. So we all got together and popped in the disc. Right from the start I saw twinkles in my friends eyes, absolutely in awe at what they were watching. Ummmm, well to be honest, I was terribly bored right from the start! Other than a few cool lights and a little pyro-technics from here to there, the show was [boring]! They just stand there and act like puppets, well except for that stupid keyboardist who dances around like a [fool] on stage. Then after the concert they have a long ass interview with the band.....BOOOOORRRRRING! I dunno, this is just my opinion, but I thought the dvd [stunk]. I guess I'm the first non-hardcore Rammstien fan to write a review on it or sumthin, cuz everyone else seems to dig it. So if German Industrial music is your religion, and Rammstien is your God, then check out this dvd I guess, but otherwise....get real, these guys are idiots.
B000075BFK|5.0|I bought this CD when it first came out, I can listen to both CD start to finish, and loving every moment, I don't agree with the guy saying that they are ruining Pac's legacy, this songs still represent what everyone is all about, and all the struggles we go through everyday.  The people behind the scene are not trying to make money off of Pac while he's dead, they are getting him to live on after his death, whats so hard to understand about that?  As far as Nas is concerned, its probably everyone's way of showing that there is peace right now.  I totally give Nas props for doing that, the way he talks about Tupacs mom in the song in everything, shows that there are no hard feelings with Nas.  So Buy this CD, you'll love every song, I do.  My to favs are \\"Fair Exchange\\" and \\"Still Ballin\\"
6301966562|5.0|I love this Electric Dreams so much that I want this movie on DVD as soon as possible as long as you people who wants this movie on DVD demands for it. I thought this Romantic-Comedy movie is as great as War Games when that came out on DVD and yet they didn't release this one on DVD yet... how pathetic. In fact, I think this movie is more popular than War Games and Short Circuit and yet they released both of them before Electric Dreams in which I love this movie the most...
B00005JKZT|5.0|The second movie in the trilogy, while not as true to the book's storyline as the first release, is still absolutely breathtaking entertainment. Some fans of the book will no doubt cry foul at some of Peter Jackson's additions, but the movie was still very entertaining and worth multiple viewings for book and movie fans.  <BR>I thought this movie would be much more violent and overall darker than the first - I was wrong.  Because the movie ends differently than the book, a large portion of that \\"dark\\" part is left for the third movie, \\"Return of the King.\\"  If you could handle the violence in the first one, you should be fine with the second one.<BR>One of the best performances was from Gollum, a.k.a. Smeagol, the creature that's hunting the ring.  Yes, I realize his performances wasn't simply the performance of one man, but a team.  Still, it was absolutely riveting at parts.  He totally lived up to my expectations, and even surpassed them.<BR>If you're interested in some of the additions Peter Jackson added to this film that weren't in the book (or not featured as prominently):<BR>- the romance between Aragorn and Arwen is not touched very much, especially not in the second book.  Not at all to the extent seen in the movie.<BR>- A scene that involves Aragorn (I'll say it's before the Elves come to Helm's Deep... the Elves are also not in the book) is not present in the book. <BR>- Treebeard the Ent, a new character in the second book, is not portrayed quite how I would have done it. He seems surprised to learn of the slaughtered trees, though in the book he knows of it the whole time.  The same result is in both book and movie, but I think Treebeard is a little too hasty in the movie.  Still, I did enjoy him, as the Ents are my favorite characters in the series.<BR>Overall, an entertaining movie that definitely gives you your seven bucks' worth.  And that's what a movie in the theater is supposed to do, right?  (I have a theory about how book-to-movie adaptationsmay be changing with the release of the Fellowship of the Ring: Special Extended Version DVD, but that's for another time and place!)  Enjoy it!
B00005N83M|3.0|This album is better that On the 6.  As usual, the best songs are the singles: Love don't cost a thing, I'm real, Play, and Ain't it funny.  That's not me and Dance with me are also good.  The rest of the songs are mediocre and without substance.  I, for one, hate the I'm Real remix.  Senseless.  I preferred the Ain't it funny remix.  If you only like the singles, wait until the record company releases a greatest hits collection.
0385720920|5.0|I liked this book more than many other that I've read recently. Having read Palahniuk's Fight Club, I was not surprised by this book. But that's a good thing. I liked Fight Club and I was hoping I would like this one as well. Which I did. It's a good, quick read. Just don't read it if you're looking to cheer yourself up.
B00000J7RZ|3.0|I own this cd and although it is not that great, it isn't bad either.  The best songs are the ones released as singles: If you had my love, Feelin' so Good, Let's get loud, Waiting for Tonight and No me Ames (balad version).  The rest are mediocre, to say the least.  If you're not a fan, buy the remix album.  It's better and more dance oriented.
B00004Z459|5.0|This album is straight up great. It's really good. I don't usually listen to rock music this heavy, but Linkin Park makes it really enjoyable.
B00006JU7T|5.0|Before anyone who is expecting a good old-fashioned Good Cop V.S. Bad Asses action thriller, hold your horses. Although it is unlikely that anyone who really enjoys a piece of fine motion picture should be disappointed by \\"Serpico\\", there are no nature-defying stunts, bloodthirsty lengthy shoot-out, or high-speed downtonw car chase. All you will get, is a near-perfect blend of gripping story (based on true event), mesmerizing performances, and skillful yet subtle and minimal directing. \\"Serpico\\" is not a story about a supercop on his way to solve a gruesome crime done by some twisted psychopath, with extreme force or genius instincts. Yes, \\"Serpico\\" is a courageous and heroic figure, but he is also as down to earth as your next door neighbor painting his house. This is about a personal struggle, a tough test on a individual's hope, faith, and moral. While this movie may not be described as an epic masterpiece, it is indeed a milestone in cinematic achievements.<br />By this DVD, Paramount did a great job preserving this film that made Al Pacino being reconized as one of the finest actor in our era. The picture is sharp and clean, though at time the colors may seem muddy. The 5.1 Dolby Digital is as good as you could expect from a sound track remastered from it's mono original. Whileas it may not give your surround system a good workout, it does provide a better dimension to some of the much-needed ambience.<br />For extra, \\"Serpico: from Real to Reel\\" is a short documentary about the birth of this movie, and \\"Inside Serpico\\" is a longer behind-the-scenes featurette which reveals more lights from the history, production, and the public reaction upon its release back in 1973. Most part of these documentaries conisists largely of newly-filmed interview clips with producer Martin Bregman and director Sidney Lumet. To top it off, there is also a 2 minutes, yet somehow redundant \\"Serpico: Favorite Moments\\" interview clips with Bregman and Lumet each talking about their favorite part of the movie. All these could be string together to be a more fluent featurette, but I guess by seperating them this way, they could make the Special Features resume looks more impressive.<BR>There is also a Photo Gallery and a Original Trailor available.
0930289455|5.0|If anyone callously dismisses &quot;comic books&quot; as juvenile reading material, I would direct them to this as a fine example of how wrong they are.  When I read this upon its initial release, it sent chills up my spine.  It is genuinely disturbing in parts, but utterly compelling.  It's nice to see a stand-alone story that grabs you by the throat, takes you along for a chilling ride and leaves you with something to think about.  A marvel this story is and a modern Batman classic.
B000002J20|5.0|This is certainly the masterpiece of Yes, which obviously some listeners will take to mean that Yes never accomplished very much. Other reviewers have explained clearly how to interpret Yes lyrics. It is important not to read too much into them. Anderson's words simply do not stand up to structural analysis. Instead, the bits and pieces that make it through the music of the band create brief moments of thematic focus.<br /><br />The first track, originally an entire album side, is preposterously entitled \\"The Revealing Science of God,\\" which for a baby boomer like me is strongly reminiscent of being an ingenuous college freshman in awe of philosophy and the infinite. Granted, it is a little difficult to ignore such bombast, but the music itself is impressive, beginning with a low-volume chant that builds to a synthesizer crescendo. \\"Starlight movement\\" brings on a second theme, a rocker with good electric guitar riffs, and then the band returns to a set of comtemplative variations on the opening theme. \\"They move fast\\" introduces yet another theme, emotionally charged, before a return to \\"Starlight movement,\\" very King-Crimsonesque with cacophonous piano and mellotron. After over thirteen minutes into the piece, arpeggiated guitars (Steve Howe's classical precision makes this transition especially beautiful)  and flutes lead into a lovely, contemplative section with the words \\"And through the rhythm,\\" quasi-religious sounding and followed by easily recognizable Emerson keyboards during a hard-rocking section,followed by a return to \\"They move fast.\\" a wrenching, plaintive variation on the theme. Ecological destruction and war are painfully evoked by the band singing in three-part harmony.  \\"What happened to this song?\\" a musical question they posed earlier, returns in a stately variation, leading to the informal suggestion that love is the answer, and then we are returned to the very first theme of the piece, grander than ever, and another monotonic chant quietly brings the end.<br /><br />The second \\"movement\\" (by now it should be obvious that Yes aspires to compose on the scale of Bruckners and Mahlers) introduces a sparely orchestrated, simple and pretty theme, introduced by wavering guitars and tri-part harmony.  The largely incomprehensible lyrics and beautiful melody evoke remembrance, nostalgia, dreams and reverence. We hear that \\"they move fast,\\" thus creating cohesion with the themes in the first movement. This theme becomes more powerful when Jon Anderson leaps an octave to reprise it.  Deep bass underlies a spacy interlude trilled guitar and mellotrons. Another verse of the song is followed by yet another contemplative thematic variation on synthesizer over mellotron. A sing-songy tune evokes urban wandering and eventually leads, after another spacy and evocative interlude, complete with ringing overtones on the guitar, to \\"Don the cap\\", yet another theme on the acoustic guitar, and the beat hastens as \\"Relayer\\" takes over for a few bars of rock. Back to sustained chords on the mellotron and synthesizer. Acoustic guitar, more rocking \\"Relayer\\" and a return to the very first theme of the movement, but grand and heavily \\"orchestrated.\\" Another quiet, echoing interlude with soaring synthesizer and guitar that move the heart leads to a grand rendition of \\"they move time,\\" to the tune first sung nearly twenty minutes before. We've gone from simple and innocent to grand and beautiful. I have to emphasize that this is a truly classical accomplishment, and thirty years after its release, this entire work, and certainly this extraordinary movement, is proving to be durable. It is truly symphonic. Maybe I'm just uncritical, but I love Bruckner, Mahler, and I think in so many ways this work is worthy to be considered in the company of grand symphonies by the romantics.<br /><br />A bash on a big gong followed by percussion introduces an intricate, very rapid, repeating xylophonic pattern that serves as background to electric guitar. A slower, echoing section with a continually interrupted pair of staccato chords leads into a march, which then alternates with the dotted rhythm of the previous section. The words are very spare. What follows is another monotonic chant and an instrumental section that features a quirky beat. Back to the chant of isolated words, a subsequent march-like section sounds very much like \\"The Devil's Triangle\\" (King Crimson, \\"In the Wake of Poseidon\\"). Lots of fuzzed guitar over a nervous band. Really quite trippy, with wilder improvisations, and contrasting, quiet acoustic guitar with musical references to \\"Roundabout.\\" Two minutes of this, quite a generous and pleasing dose of Spanish classical guitar technique, leads to a brand-new anthemic song. Questions about the violence of war bring \\"the Ancient Giants under the Sun\\" to a coda on the classical guitar and a country-sounding theme is interrupted once more by the punctuated chords as the electronic instruments spin off high notes into space.<br /><br />\\"Ritual, Nous sommes du soleil (we belong to the sun)\\" opens with a straightforward anthemic melody. This gets fairly repetitive and then makes a transition to a brief melody, \\"Nous sommes du soleil\\" (pronounced \\"de soleil,\\" which is inaccurate). A third melody, another anthem, is accompanied by sitar. The very first theme of the first movement is woven into this, after which a fine climax is reached as the group sings \\"they don't seem to matter at all, at all.\\" Yes then launches into a rocking riff. An abrupt transition ushers in a metallic percussive sequence. This mercifully short, hellish bit (it only lasts a couple of minutes) places the elegiac reprise of \\"Nous sommes du soleil\\" in perspective, making it all the prettier. The loosely organized lyrics hint at the safety of home and the love of family.<br /><br />It's a long trip, essentially structured along the lines of a long rondo rather than the more complex sonata-allegro of classical forms that Yes seek to emulate. The result is quite durable, but obviously will appeal only to those who are willing to hear some fairly talented youngsters, who, using the available technology of the time, attempted, mostly with success, a work of great musical depth, loosely developed poetics, and transparent philosophical significance.uitar.

B00001OH7N|5.0|It was my first exposure to Bowie and I was inlove.  I was in a stereo department and this album was on a turn table, so I thought I'd check it out.  It blew me away and I became a hard core Bowie fan attending concerts glittered out.  <br />But this is pre-glitter and few knew of this album at the time.  This is not Bowie doing Heavy Rock ... this is just Bowie and it's a masterpiece that stands on it's own.  The lyrics are incredible, the beat, and the innovation.<br />One of a kind.  20+ years later ... I made sure to have this in my CD collection.
0884271536|4.0|I particularly liked the analysis of the steel operation, turning from losses to profits within a short period.  Although critical chain, as a concept, was wonderful, I wanted much more information on project management issues.  And the financial discussion at the end was less than satisfactory.  Despite those shortcomings, it's a wonderful book. I reread it every year. There needs to be more &quot;Business Fiction&quot;.
B000002KB8|5.0|This is ultimately the best work of Black Sabbath.  I bought this is as an lp in 1972 and in 2002, I have the album and the CD.  I play it at least once a year.  <br />Terry (Geezer)Butler's bass guitaring on this CD is incredible. It's heavy, it's dark, but it stands alone in innovation and artistic collaboration.  A true masterpiece.

B000003S0P|5.0|The third album of the Fripp-Bruford-Wetton incarnation of King Crimson, it is also their most consistently realized. It's the album that finally puts on tape what Fripp seemed to be trying to conceptualize when he put together a new line-up for Larks' Tongues in Aspic, when he finally shucked off the lyrical hippie-trappings of the founding Crimson in favor of his muse's excruciatingly cerebral logic-rock.  Brainy, however, does not mean anemic in Fripp's world, as he and crew plow their way into a soundscape of the most visceral noises imaginable.  All the more impressively given that this is music from 1974.  Recorded yesterday, it could still cause a stir.  So it seems only logical that, after such a total realization of one's musical vision, that the band was disbanded (until seven years later, when Crimson would rise again in a new, radically altered form).<br />The album opens with the instrumental \\"Red\\", and has more musical interest in the first thirty seconds than most progressive rock albums: a rising scale over a distinctly exotic chord progression modulates around the fretboard three times in 5/4 to end finally on a totally delicious, metallized chord.  The main riff then kicks in (midtempo, heavy, in alternating time-signatures), Fripp's guitar and chord progressions already in wholly new country, Wetton's bass thrumming along underneath and Bruford popping accents in all the right most unexpected places.  This gives way to a middle section of intensely restrained chords under which growls what sounds like an enormously amplified, ultradistorted cello.  The main theme returns, and the song ends as it began, with the opening scales.  It's an exquisitely realized masterpiece, and might even be Fripp's most inspired composition to date.<br />\\"Fallen Angel\\" takes us into more conventional territory musically, but the conventionality actually enhances the song.  On the face of it, the song is initially a rather soulful, semi-acoustic piece, sung with more conviction and power than Wetton has previously managed.  But while the verse is comfortingly conventional, the chorus itself thunders in with a thick, heavy guitar arpeggio (reminiscent of the heavy guitar line from the Beatles' \\"She's so Heavy\\") glossed over with saxophone.  Virtuosity has given way here to (guitar) orchestration and layering.  The richness and thickness of the sounds, and the tact that Fripp displays for instance when he buries a shredding skysaw riff almost entirely in the mix, is what gives the piece such power.<br />\\"One More Red Nightmare\\", by contrast, begins unabashedly with what sounds like a growling, thick variation on the closing lick from \\"Lament\\" (on \\"Starless and Bible Black) with twisted parallel harmonies.  The bridge, still avoiding pure showmanship, has jangly guitar with a heavily wah-wah pedaled \\"lead\\".  As in \\"Red\\", another bridge section has articulated guitar with the bass hammering out the lead, this time with sax and wah-wah guitar to just add even more depth to the sound.  A minor quibble:  Wetton vocally seems not as up to the same level here as he demonstrates throughout the rest of the album.<br />\\"Providence\\", an improvisation from the city of the same name, follows.  Needing to fill out side two on the original album, Fripp finally opts for a live artifact, rather than inventing some unconvincing filler and hiding it behind the label of art-rock.  Like many Crimson improvisations, this one takes a bit to get its legs, but when it finally kicks in full bore, one assumes it was a no-brainer selecting this piece for \\"Red\\".  The remastering really makes itself felt here, bringing out the phenomenal power of the live band.  And, quite frankly, the squawks and shrieks David Cross tortures out of his violin are pretty nifty.<br />The album ends with \\"Starless\\", one of the greatest things ever penned by Fripp.  Opening with a haunting mellotron and lead, the music steps back to let John Wetton have his finest moment at the mic.  (He would hit this highpoint again on UK's \\"Carrying no Cross\\", which structurally resembles \\"Starless\\".)  The song runs through the conventional verse-chorus structure twice, then reprises the opening guitar lead again.  Nothing special compositionally so far-just exquisite orchestration, exemplified by the cello that accompanies Wetton when the verse next returns.  But then comes the bridge, which is pure must-hear.  Fripp alternately twangs away on one note at a time, while Wetton picks out an extremely cool, extremely slow bass line in 13.  Bruford, naturally, is adding color and accents, but it is the guitar and bass that rivets your attention.  Slowly, and very patiently, the bass line (growing more and more wickedly distorted as it goes) and lone twanging guitar note modulate and repeat around the fretboard, until Bruford officially joins in.  The whole thing builds to an exceeding intensity, at which point Fripp unleashes a solo of nothing but wailing, bent notes, the bass fully tweaked up, the drums a forest of cymbals and accents.<br />Unfortunately, a horrible thing then happens.  Wetton repeats the 13/4 riff at about 8 times the original tempo, Fripp uses his guitar as a crash cymbal, and a rather sorry saxophone plows right through the middle of everything.  The second time through this accelerated version of the slow riff there is no sax, and Fripp is replaying his bent-note solo, but the damage is done.  It's this compositional lapse of taste that puts \\"Starless\\" on a tenuous footing for \\"Best Old King Crimson Song Ever\\" (which probably goes to \\"Fracture\\"). Despite this stumble, though, the opening theme then returns with a vengeance, suddenly opening up into a sonic richness that is genuinely breathtaking to listen to.  Here is the grandeur Fripp wanted, but couldn't find, for the closing of \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\".<br />I can only imagine how it must have felt for the band as the final notes of this album first rang in their ears.  I'd've been overwhelmed with the sense of accomplishment.c.  (He would hit this highpoint again on UK's \\"Carrying no Cross\\", which structurally resembles \\"Starless\\".)

B00005K3O0|5.0|Very well made and deserves a rating of 4.5 stars. The only bad part is the girl starts to get on your nerves, just like the dad. But other than that, I think you'll be okay. A little hokey and cliched but effective none the less. Watch it alone in the dark.
B000003S09|5.0|In terms of importance for progressive rock, \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" is one of the milestones.  Compare \\"The Cheerful Insanity of Giles, Giles and Fripp\\" if you really want to see just how far Giles, Giles & Fripp come in a short space of time. (The titles alone are telling.)  Moreover, the remastering has done marvelous things for the sound of this album.  It's certainly never sounded better. Still, I almost never listen to this certain classic, and here's why.<br /><br />The opener, \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\", which is to King Crimson as \\"Aqualung\\" is to Jethro Tull, is a raucous, paranoid, forward-looking, technically proficient song that took England by storm when it first appeared in 1969, as much for its virtuosity as for its mostly unprecedented combination of proto-metal and math guitar, treated vocals, and its intriguing blend of instruments.  As once sporting the heaviest of the heavy riffs, in these days of advanced production and amazing guitar sounds (most frequently from Robert Fripp himself), the song now sounds a bit anemic and dated, even remastered.  Taking nothing from the sheer performance of solo section that follows the opening riff (which matches unparalleled guitarmanship and saxophoning in an intense interplay), it nevertheless comes off sounding very safely within the boundaries of conventional music.  A short, crunchy bridge follows, a reprise of the initial theme, and then a big, blustery, cacophonous coda, that seems more like a set up to the next song than a finale.  The most serious defect of this song is that there are many other, far more compelling live recordings of it, but on its own merits, it is definitely an ear-catching opener.<br /><br />\\"I Talk to the Wind\\" is a too-deliberate study in contrasts to the first song.  It's pretty and mellow and drags on much too long. In sound (and lyrics), it really is a too-conventional piece of peacenik-rock (a genre unobjectionable in its own right) performed well enough, even though the guitar solo, which apparently aims for a marijuana kind of calm, comes off as schmaltzy instead.<br /><br />\\"Epitaph\\" follows, introducing a third King Crimson mood--namely, epic grandeur.  Composition and orchestration, rather than virtuosity, take center stage here, being a continuously inventive and engaging combination of acoustic guitar, mellotrons, grand piano and so forth.  Greg Lake, hands down Crimson's best or second-best vocalist ever, is especially evocative and compelling throughout.  Even the lyrics, with their bombast, avoid being dated and have a kind of mythic ring to them.  The perilously slow middle section, gorgeously orchestrated, is almost enough to make every error on the album forgivable.  This is the highpoint of the album, and originally marked the end of Side 1 back when albums still had sides.<br /><br />Side 2 opens with the initially enchanting \\"Moonchild\\".  As the title suggests, we are once again returned to the late 60s, and the mix, with its uniquely resonant acoustic, electric guitar and mellotron, is soon ceaselessly marred by intrusively kitschy percussion.  The lyrics, while ignorable, are too strained in their attempt at \\"poeticness\\". Even so, the initial impression is that the muse that informed the grandeur of \\"Epitaph\\" has not fled the scene yet. After 2 minutes, however, there then begins 10 minutes of what can be described as brainless noodling (with 90 seconds of \\"Wind\\"-like lyricism to set up the next song).  My patience for even endless waves of white noise has been proven elsewhere by Merzbow and others, but the end of \\"Moonchild\\" is just flat-out boring, goes nowhere and occupied half of side 2 originally.  In a subsequent release of this song, even Robert Fripp decided to axe the noodling, leaving only the original 2 minutes.  This is more than the low-point of the album for me, representing more than one-fifth of the whole thing.<br /><br />\\"The Court of the Crimson King\\", as the title piece and closer, marks a return to the grandiose mood of \\"Epitaph\\" and is obviously intended as a swelling, breathless and grand finale.  But in the first place, the lyrics come off more like an incoherent piece of fantasy fiction compared to \\"Epitaph's\\" mythic note.  The orchestration is lush, and Greg Lake builds up a fine, large choir of himself, but the whole thing doesn't come off as stirring.  There's a hint of the motoric intensity of the opener at one point, a flute solo reminiscent of the second song at another, so that the closer seems a kind of recapitulation of the album as a whole while dragging out its \\"impassioned\\" choir riff.  Seven minutes into the song, it seems to end on a few harmless cymbal chimes, then cuts unexpectedly into a carousel-sounding parody of itself.  A big phased-out drum fill pops up and lo, the grand opening theme comes back all over again on endless repeat for another 90 seconds.<br /><br />In short, the last two songs seem full of filler, the second song is better as an idea than an accomplishment, other (typically slower) live versions of the opener make the opener seem a lesser version of itself by comparison, and \\"Epitaph\\" stands as the single, nearly perfect masterpiece on the album.  As an experiment in texture and composition, as a display of what might be possible in rock music, \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" deserves its reputation, but it's more like a blueprint than a finished building.  A building King Crimson would build successfully with its second album, \\"In the Wake of Poseidon\\".pitaph\\" and is obviously intended as a swelling, breathless and grand finale.

B000002P2V|5.0|&quot;Who are You&quot;, An album that was unexpectally one of their best at least thats what i think. i think the songs were all great due to Roger's voice was Awsome and the sound was new and weird and good for this album it was differnt from their other albums  but I'd say the guys did a great job for keith's last album with the grand slam line-up in the band well deliverd a great end for keith ! One of the best Drummers ever! So i recomand it so buy it if your a person that wants to hear roger's most powerful vocals! Plus its better than the album before this one&quot;The who by the numbers.&quot;
B000003S0F|4.0|...and you just might trick yourself into liking this album.<br />For a band that reinvented itself four times for four albums, it must seem perverse to say that \\"Islands\\" is not like the rest of their output, but the charge still seems just.  Even so, it is hardly the unmitigated disaster many feel it to be, and personally, of their first four albums, I'd rather listen to (a section of) it than \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\".<br />\\"Formentera Lady\\" opens rather inauspiciously with some cello sawing, and then gives way to a very long \\"trip\\" of atmosphere, mellotron, saxophone and most of all some very falsetto falsetto.  One wants to call it all space rock, but space jazz would seem more accurate, though it is far more composed and accomplished than the gratuitous noodling from \\"Moonchild\\" previously.  The song seems to be music best listened to while already in an altered state of mind, as opposed to music that alters your state of mind, and aims primarily at some kind of mood.  It's as if in a weird, not always consistent way, it manages to succeed despite itself, though certainly the lyrics are intrusively silly in spots.<br />\\"Sailor's Tale\\" that follows is one of those instrumentals on the album that contradicts the opinion that the whole thing's a waste of time.  After an energetic, if straightforward, bass, guitar and sax jam, the music slows abruptly and becomes an interesting study in advanced and strange chord progression by Fripp. The ending, with its mellotrons and ominous-edgy guitar, packs no small amount of wallop, even as it resembles a shorter version of \\"Devil's Triangle\\" from \\"In the Wake of Poseidon\\" (or Holst's \\"Mars\\" if you prefer).  The jangly guitar tone alone is almost interesting enough in itself to justify the song, and the sullen, low melody at the end caps the whole thing off marvelously.<br />With \\"The Letters\\", the mood changes yet again.  For one, we have a rather Baroque set of lyrics (with \\"Epitaph\\", some of Sinfield's best, without succumbing to his tendency for kitsch) about marital infidelity and suicide.  Musically, the composition alternates between \\"Cadence & Cascade\\" delicacy and more than \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\" heaviness.  Form fits function here very nicely--even the improvisational-seeming sax, guitar and drum section, with its nervous energy, goes well with the main theme of the song, that culminates in tragedy.  One also has to mention the melody here, which is especially haunting.  All the more so when eerily sung a cappella to end the song.<br />\\"Ladies of the Road\\" is an art-rock take on the sleazy side of groupies.  The song itself is on the slow, driving side and has a saxophone line that totally makes the song--each time it hits, I imagine on top of it that other raunchy line, \\"I know what guys want, I know what guys like.\\"  It fits in perfectly, both musically and thematically.  It's just a nasty, down and dirty song, with ham-handed drums, mule-headed bass, lascivious saxophone, a charmingly disingenuous chorus, and some very raw guitar and vocals. The deliberately crass lyrics are definitely post-Moonchild, and quite nastily apt.<br />\\"Prelude: Song of the Gulls\\" is literally a chamber music piece, pizzicato violins and all.  The melody is very nice, the string arrangement is plausible enough.  I am, however, too familiar with classical chamber music to be charmed by the pleasant triteness of this piece.  It's intellectually interesting that it's included on a King Crimson album, but I'd rather listen to and think about music, than just think about it.  It comes on quite nicely right after the nastiness of \\"Ladies of the Road\\", actually, but shouldn't go on for more than a minute, maybe.  As it is, and for the sake of filling up side 2 it seems, it goes on for five minutes.<br />\\"Islands\\" closes the album, with its very long, slow, mellow lounge-jazz development.  Once again, it is interesting to find this kind of piano-based quasi-ballad on a King Crimson album,but as an experiment in mood there are countless others who've done it better.  Sinfield's lyrics here are sometimes difficult to take, and they sound like he had difficulty writing them too.  The vocalist certainly sounds like he's having a difficult time getting them to not sound contrived.<br />Like \\"Prelude\\" before it, it's difficult to shake the sense that the song \\"Islands\\" is largely just filler for the original side two.  Making this seem an even more plausible is the inclusion of 4 minutes of orchestral outtakes, tuning up, babble and musical directing by Fripp.  It ends finally with Fripp starting to conduct, saying, \\"One two three, two two three...\\" then cuts off.  As if to demonstrate that the music never started at all, which is rather how side two, and hence the whole album, feels.<br />In the old days, I could just never turn the album over and \\"Islands\\" was a more passable listen than \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" for me.  Fripp gets credit for trying new things, but \\"Islands\\" demonstrates that the lyrical hippie-rock, which was half of the soul of the original Crimson (and which finds its fullest expression here on side two) had give way to the cerebral logic-rock he was exploring on side 1, most of all in \\"A Sailor's Tail\\", and much more fully on the next three albums to come.but as an experiment in mood there are countless others who've done it better.

B00005AQE8|5.0|Let me first start off by saying that no matter what anyone says 'All Eyez On Me' is undoubtedly and single-handedly the greatest work of music recorded, released and heard by man-kind! I can go on and on and explain why it's the greatest by anyone in any genre of music but they're telling me I can only use a maximum of 1,000 words so sorry. In brief however, 'All Eyez On Me' turned out to be a cultural phenomenon, changing the face of rap and hip-hop music forever and further solidifying Tupac's tight grip as hip hop's greatest and most influential artist to ever hold a mic. The versatility and range Tupac displays on the album is nothing short of sensational. Not only has All Eyez On Me become the greatest hip-hop album ever made, its significance in history cannot be denied. 'All Eyez On Me' became the first double album in hip-hop and unlike other album's it contained SIX singles! The album also produced SEVEN videos! Its clear to me no album or artist will ever be able to match the level of this album. Furthermore no artist will ever be able to amass what Shakur accomplished. Indeed a genius, Tupac will be known as the greatest artist ever and appropriately his album 'All Eyez On Me' will be known as the greatest album ever.
B000003S0B|5.0|Not many fans of the earliest King Crimson will disagree with me that \\"In the Wake of Poseidon\\" is good, but I become a party of one when I say it surpasses the debut.<br />King Crimson has since long established itself as a band that musically explores and re-explores musical ideas--cannibalizing, re-visiting, re-performing live, innovating on the fly, and so forth.  The \\"copying\\" fans criticize in the songs of \\"Wake\\" could be precisely this, as opposed to a cheap attempt to cash in on the previous success of \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\".  The point of such a re-visitation, in any case, would be to bring out new aspects of the existing songs, presumably with an eye to making them even more profound or better realized.  \\"In the Wake of Poseidon\\" does this.<br />In general, the fact that King Crimson used a structure of three songs in contrasting style (like a classical sonata) for side one on both of their first two albums is not a sign of self-plagiarizing.  No one said Beethoven was copying himself when he used the sonata-allegro form over and over for his sonatas.<br />As to the songs themselves, perhaps I'm tired of \\"Schizoid Man\\" like I'm tired of \\"Aqualung\\", but \\"Pictures of a City\\" seems better realized song overall.  The drums sound better, and Greg Lake isn't forced to howl out \\"Innocents *aped by napalm fire\\" again (which has always struck me as inexcusably purple). As for \\"Cadence & Cascade\\" and \\"I Talk to the Wind\\", both songs are lamely sentimental and seem to exist solely to provide a contrast for the edge of the opening songs. \\"Cadence\\" seems superior for not having something like that listless guitar solo from \\"Wind\\" in it, the removal of which prevents \\"Cadence\\" from dragging on for a dull two minutes more like \\"Wind\\" does.  Comparing the title track and \\"Epitaph,\\" however, is comparing apples and apples.  Both are magnificent, effective, grand and moving.  The fact that they're structurally similar doesn't give precedence to \\"Epitaph\\".  They're both completely keepers.  \\"In the Wake of Poseidon\\" alone justifies getting the album; one could almost say the same of \\"Epitaph\\", except that I'd rather get it from a compilation, than pay for what originally came with it.<br />To compare sides like this also glosses over one major difference, namely the first song on \\"In the Wake of Poseidon\\".  On \\"Court\\", there was a brief wash of urban noise; on \\"Wake\\" we have a very short, but at least developed idea in \\"Peace - A Beginning\\".  More to the point, this little kernel of music opens the album, closes it, and stands in the middle (at the beginning of side 2).  It provides a musical unification to the album that the debut cannot claim.<br />If side one of \\"Wake\\" can only boast of a tenuous improvement over \\"Court\\", with side two, \\"Court\\" gets knocked straight out of the box.  Here, the unifying theme of \\"Peace\\" takes the place of the opening section of \\"Moonchild\\" (with the 2 minute \\"Moonchild\\" being admittedly more interesting).  But instead of the 10 minutes of mindless noodling that follows on \\"Court\\", we get Lake's enthusiastic caterwauling on \\"Cat Food\\" with Keith Tippet's own much more mindful and random-seeming noodling on piano, all in a 5 minute package artistically scaled down from the self-indulgence of \\"Court's\\" original.  There then follows the second genuine masterpiece of \\"In the Wake of Poseidon\\", \\"The Devil's Triangle\\". At 11 minutes, this brooding, heavily armored and textured piece finally taps into the kind of aggressiveness that \\"Schizoid Man\\" and \\"Pictures\\" try to get at with lyrics.  The piece is loosely based on Holst's \\"Mars - the Bringer of War\\", and was a band improvisation for a while.  Wherever it originated, the piece here is one of Fripp's earliest explorations of the kind of harmonic labyrinths and tortures he'd devise later in his career.  To say there is no comparison here with the closer from \\"Court\\" is true, both in the sense that the songs don't resemble one another in any way(except length) and that \\"The Devil's Triangle\\" is massively more inspired and effective when listened to.  The album closes, unexpectedly, with one more reprise of \\"Peace\\", which is especially surprising after the furor of \\"The Devil's Triangle\\".<br />Of the earliest King Crimson, \\"In the Wake of Poseidon\\" is my favorite.  I only regularly skip over \\"Cadence & Cascade\\" and sometimes \\"Cat Food\\". With \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\", I only listen to \\"Epitaph\\", and then less often than I listen to all of \\"In the Wake of Poseidon\\".  Whatever was going on with the band, however up in the air everything was, whatever doubts Fripp had, to my ears, King Crimson got right the second time what they aimed for on their debut.(except length) and that \\"The Devil's Triangle\\" is massively more inspired and effective when listened to.

Suffice to say, this novel has made its mark and has becoming a resounding futurist insight into our short-term future in America and around the world.  Be sure to read it.  And please don't treat it like a sc-fi novel because this is both an historical novel as well as a technological post modern thriller.

B00005YW4H|4.0|In a world where music is high saturated with Boy Bands, Teeny bop Divas, and the never ending race for Record labels to produce the next &quot;Creed&quot; act, it's nice to know that one artist hasn't been caught up in being exploited to be the next American Idol. With her full-length debut album Come Away With Me, Nora Jones shows what it takes to produce an instant classic.  Nora's first love of jazz is quite apparent in her song's &quot;Come Away with Me&quot;, and &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; as well as her rendition of the Hank Williams' tune, &quot;Cold Cold Heart&quot;.  Nora's roots in folk, country &amp; blues are also apparent as subtle hints are blended into songs like &quot;Nightingale&quot;, &quot;Lonestar&quot; and &quot;Feelin' the Same Way&quot;, but giving them all an updated more contemporary sound.  It's good to see that good music is till being made, and sometimes you just have to go against the influences of the masses to find it. But this time it wasn't hard to find at all, as Nora Jones has now become all the buzz.  Nora has a wonderful and unique voice as well as a wonderful band to compliment her.  Nora's style can capture all generations who can truly appreciate great music, and at the young age of 22, she sings her songs as if she was a seasoned veteran in the music world.
B000070WJE|1.0|What is it with this guy, each and every album he produces is different to that of the last one. That has probably been the secret of his success in the UK and Europe, but at the age of 27 surely he should have found somekind of diretion.<br />Alas this album highlights that Robbie Williams just follows the latest fads and changes. When I think of the music produced by British artists over the years I think of Radiohead, The Beatles, The Sex Pistols etc bands that actually pushed the boundaries of music. Now all we get is this guy who seems to think that the world revolves around him, without him actually achieving anything. <br />What with the garbage being churned out in the music industry today it is hard to see how this album will fail.

This CD, a classic work, is one of the high points in Clapton's musical career.  This CD revitalized interest in the old master when many of his contemporaries had long since stopped creating new and innovative music.  If you ever are skiing out west, have a sweet MP3 player, are in a glade of pines in fresh powder, I do not think there is a better CD to listen to than this one.  Clapton never gets old, and this CD will stand the test of time.  A+<br />Joseph Dworak
B000075BFK|5.0|He never droped a bad album, even after his \\"death\\". This CD is packed with good material. I was alittle dissapointed with \\"Never B Peace\\" because the real version is way better but the remixes to trackes like \\"My Block\\", and \\"Who Do You Belive In\\" are better than the original versions beatwise. The best songs were:<br />Still Ballin' (feat Trick Daddy)<BR>Thugz Mansion (acoustic) (feat NaS)<BR>My Block Remix<BR>Thugz Mansion(original)<BR>Better Dayz (feat Ron Isley)<BR>Who Do You Belive In Remix<BR>They Dont Give A F*** About Us<br />CLASSIC. GO OUT N BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ll U Bitch Again&quot;, &quot;Better Dayz&quot; and &quot;Thugz Mansion&quot;) seem to be the album's strongest tracks. On only one track, &quot;Thugz Mansion (Acoustic Version)&quot;, does the addition of another rapper, in this case Nas, help imrpove the track. This album would have been much stronger and probably would have earned a 5 star  review had they just released this as a single disc cd just releasing the second disc and adding the &quot;Thugz Mansion (Acoustic Version)&quot; to it. The second disc is far better than the first, the first 4 tracks are 4 of 2pacs best, and the rest aren't bad either. However the 1st disc is nothing but filler up until the last track. Unfortunately, you cannot buy only one of the discs, so unless you are a die hard 2pac fan who already owns every other 2pac release (besides The Lost Tapes which is just terrible), I wouldn't purchase this. It earns a 4 star rating from me because in my opinion the 5 great tracks, &quot;Thugz Mansion (Acoustic Version)&quot;, &quot;My Block remix&quot;, &quot;Thugz Mansion&quot;, &quot;Never Call U Bitch Again&quot; and &quot;Better Dayz&quot;, combined with 2pacs meaningful lyrics are fair grounds for 4 stars.

0804102988|5.0|Rutherford obviously loves his subject, and for that, we can be eternally grateful. Here he presents the history of England, from the end of the Ice Age to the present day, through the lens of several families he follows through the ages. Rutherford has been compared to Michener, but I feel the comparison is fatally flawed: Michener tends to thedry and pedantic. Rutherford's characters scream with life and vitality. It's a pleasure to allow yourself to get wrapped up in this world (I've just finished my fourth re-reading of this classic). One emerges from its pages with not only a deeper grasp of English history, but a deeper sense of why history in general is so exciting. It's not about places and dates, it's about people, a fact that Rutherford &quot;gets&quot; and shares with us. Like the greatest of magicians, Rutherford adopts an attitude of, &quot;This is really cool. let me share this with you&quot;, rather than the more stand-offish, &quot;Look at ow much I know.&quot; He is the modern day equivalent of a storyteller around a campfire, who welcomes you in and shares stories of simple people doing great things. My most fervent wish is that Rutherford continues to write for a long, long time.

B00006690G|5.0|Eminem gives a more serious album & the beats are more entertaining then those from his other albums. Every song on this cd is just slightly better then from his other albums. & more importantly, the songs don't get boring. You may not agree with me but I found this to be one of the best rap cds because he changes his rap style for the different songs on this CD & hardly any of them sound similar except Without Me that sounds like The Real Slim Shady & Just Loose It. I'll take a look at each song here, not the skits though: <br /> <br />White America- 4.5/5 He attacks Bush & I'm not a big fan of Bush myself but I found this song has a unique rap style to it & is quite entertaining! <br /> <br />Business- 4.5/5 Basic rap Eminem song, it's fun to listen to! <br /> <br />Cleaning Out My Closet- 5/5 He attacks both his parents in this song & if I had parents like that, I'd probably do the same. I can understand where he's coming from on this & that's why I give it 5 cause it is a catchy song! <br /> <br />Square Dance- 4/5 If it wasn't obvious before that he hates Bush, I think it is now! It's a cool song, different from his usual but that's what I like about it! <br /> <br />Soldier- 5/5 One of my fav songs of his! it's very serious & the skit builds up alot of tension for the song! It's just fantastic! <br /> <br />Say Goodbye to Hollywood- 5/5 It's catchy! He's fed up with Hollywood & wants out, well if rapping about helps then feel free cause the song is just great! <br /> <br />Drips- 3/5 Find this song kinda pointless & stupid but it's not bad. I've heard worse in my time. <br /> <br />Without Me- 4/5 it sounds like a couple of songs I mentioned before but I like all of them cause their fun to listen to & dance to! <br /> <br />Sing for the Moment- 5/5 taken from Aerosmith of course but it's a very serious song & makes some very interesting points & is one of his more meaningful songs! I love this song! <br /> <br />Superman- 4.5/5 It's funny, sexy & just a greatsong! <br /> <br />Hailie's Song- 4/5 I give them props for attempting to sing cause he admits he's not very good at it but I didn't mind listening to his softer side! Good job anyway! the rap part is the best though, lol! <br /> <br />When the Music Stops- 5/5 The song alone, makes it worthwhile to buy this album! plus the skit before it is just funny! the rapping is just flawless! LOVE IT!! <br /> <br />Say What You Say- 5/5 Didn't care much for this song at first, thought it went on too long but now is one of my favs! it's cool! Dr. Dre has been around a while & it's songs like this that make me understand why! <br /> <br />Til' I Collapse- 5/5 Eminem raps while spitting practically the whole thing! & that's I like so much about his rap style, he tries different things! this song is absolutely amazing! <br /> <br />My Dad's Gone Crazy- 5/5 It's funny as hell, catchy & a great way to end the cd! <br /> <br />Slim Shady was a legend! too bad he retired cause this to me, was memorable & if you want to get any of his cds, I recommend THE EMINEM SHOW! GET IT TODAY! <br />  <br /> <br />
B00006V9A0|5.0|What is it missing? Polly, possibly the best Nirvana song made. And You Know You're right isn't that great in my opinion, it is good, but not fabulous. But the rest of the CD is. It has almost all of their best songs.
0060926317|5.0|I read this book and it made me feel amazed and a bit depressed at the same time. The message conveyed reaffirmed beliefs that I had, but also made me realize that I must work harder to live a life that is meaningful to me. I think that the point of this book is not to say that you must have the same experiences that Marlo Morgan had, or to rid yourself of all material possessions, but rather to live life as honestly as you can. It doesn't have to be grand, it can mean small decisions, small attentions, and respect for even the littlest things. People may be shocked by this book because the way of life depicted seems so far-fetched or far-off from what most people are living today, but maybe that is something people should think about. For me, at least, life is full of tiny lies and a lot of seeming obligations, but this book made me ask myself why do I feel obligated to tell lies and do things I don't want to do? The book made me examine my life and try to think about what is worth looking out for and what kind of life I want to live. It's an ongoing process and it is sometimes hard because it means being truly honest to yourself. <BR>It seems that many people are worked up over whether this account was fictional or true, but I think that is irrelevant because it is the message that is true, and arguing about the validity of the circumstances is just nit-picking. Would the message be any more true if we had concrete evidence about what happened? It's up to the reader to see how much knowing for a fact gets in the way of really listening to what is said. <BR>I wish I could convey how much this book made me remember truths I had forgotten. It is so easy to let things wear on you until you become indifferent, but once in awhile something comes along to make you care again. That's what this book did for me.
0312265859|1.0|After such a wonderful beginning this series has gone steadily down hill.  The characters are no longer admirable or interesting.  The...sassy heroine is now a total ditz, the hot hero a wimpy whiner, and the numero uno man of mystery a murdering... predator.  The fun is gone and so am I. I won't bother spending another penny on this series.
B00005QVHM|5.0|This is one of the best albums ever produced.  It shows the Clash's amazing versatility.  The classic song London Calling opens up the album wonderfully putting the listener in a state of awe.  It jumps around a bit, but always has the unique Clash style.  A great album that all complete collections should include.
B00007E8JP|4.0|This is an energetic metal CD informed by punk and grunge.  Songs criticize the system, advertising, gun laws and warmongers.  There's probably an anti-pollution/pro-baby seals cut, but I missed it; nevertheless, System of a Down comes off less dogmatic and preachy than brother-politicos Rage Against the Machine.  Machine gun drums, bass far forward and lots of tempo changes invite comparisons to Thinking Fellers, Tool or Slint and, as with any good metal album, there are a couple of pleasant ballads too.  Very enjoyable.
B000005DSN|5.0|First of all, for those considering purchasing the Japanese version that retails here for $$, I suggest you do not.<br />For one thing, on the Japanese verson, the booklet has the first two tracks out of order, Kiss of Judas is actually Black Diamond.<br />Two, regarding the extra tracks; they are not listed on the booklet. <BR>The demo verson of Black Diamond is not that different from non-demo version. <br />As for the live tracks, the recordings are not that good. They would not have made the Visons live cd. The review of them states there are either one or two tracks. I believe it is two combined.<br />As for the non Japanese album, after Stratovarius acquired a vocalist for 4th dimension, subsequent recordings get slightly more commercial, slightly less adventurous and slightly more overproduced<br />Therefore, 4th Dimension gets the 10 rating, Dreamscape 9, Visions 8, Destiny 7, Infinate the 6.<br />Even though Visions is in the middle of the pack, when compared to other power/progressive metal recordings from other bands, it would rate a 9.6/10 as the songwriting quality is top notch.<br />Compared to their well recorded, good sounding \\"Visions live\\" double cd, which contains 5 songs from Visions, I would still recommend buying Visions because of terrific songs not on the live cd.
091581112X|5.0|This is a great book for anyone who is on a spiritual path and desires more information about spiritual growth.  Sanaya's guide Orin walks the reader through various changes in consciousness he or she may be experiencing, and illustrates how it relates to improving one's life.  There are also excellent processes in the book to make your life go more smoothly (for example, sending light to a situation for healing and resolution).  This book has helped me to better understand some of the changes and experiences I have had as I have followed my higher self's guidance in life.  It has also given me tools to get through some seemingly challenging lessons.  There are helpful meditations throughout the book which help you connect with higher realms for clarity, assistance, joy, and guidance.  A very interesting book for those interested in spiritual growth!
B0000039QA|5.0|\\"Cause the greatest rapper of all time died on March 9th.\\"<BR>-Canibus, 2nd Round KO<br />Canibus definitely spit the truth in that line, as the greatest rapper of all time, Biggie Smalls, was killed on March 9th, 1997.  He wasn't alive when this CD dropped, but Biggie still does live on through his music.<br />Life After Death may not be quite as good as Ready to Die, but it is damn close.  Songs like \\"Whats Beef?\\" and \\"I've Got a Story to Tell\\" and \\"The 10 Crack Commandments\\" (I could name every song on the CD) are masterpieces.<br />Rakim was God.  Tupac was Shakespeare. Biggie Smalls was THE rapper.
B00005JKZT|4.0|I'm pretty sure I feel this way because it's the middle of the trilogy...and middles are usually the least of all three.  Because..well...it's the MIDDLE, which means that there really isn't a beginning or an end, and events that are supposed to be triumphant accomplishments come off as hardly climactic; they just make you think: \\"Okay, this is good, but there's far more to come. GET ON WITH THE STORY!!!\\".<br />Now, don't get me wrong, this is a good movie, and if you like the first one, you obviously have to see it. But while \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" is the best, the all-time greatest, THE NUMBER ONE MOVIE EVER MADE, \\"The Two Towers\\" comes off as nothing more than an enjoyable action/war movie.<br />Needless to say, \\"The Two Towers\\" is very different from \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\".  War has broken out in Middle Earth, and the Fortress of Sarumon, has formed a legion with the Tower of Sauron (I forgot the names of both towers...in fact, I don't think either names are mentioned once in the movie!). The story now parts three seperate ways: Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas are now on a quest to rescue Merry and Pippin from the band of Uruk-hai that captured them at the end of the first film.  But they have escaped, into the hands of the kind Treebeard, an Ent.  This part of the story tends to drag, and only kicks in at the end, when the Ents assault on Isengard, and kick those Orcs' butts!  (Watching Sarumon (Christopher Lee) just stand there in the window in disbelief and watching his fortress crumble at the hands of the Ents, while kind of stupid as he doesn't try to do a bloody thing and just stands there doing nothing, is very pleasing to behold.)<br />Now, on to Frodo and Sam, who continue their quest to destroy the One Ring. On the way, they meet up with Gollum, whom they force to lead them to Mordor. Gollum is, of course, computer-animated, but it is barely noticeable.  Over time, Frodo becomes more and more close to Gollum, and the two form an unspoken friendship.  Meanwhile, Sam and Frodo are growing more and more apart, as the Ring begins to consume Frodo.  Andy Serkis, as the voice and movements of Gollum, gives the best performance in the whole movie; you really get to feel for Gollum, and pity him and all the hardships he has faced at the hands of the Ring.<br />This section holds the most drama in the movie, in watching the two hobbits' friendship drift apart, and Gollum's sorrow.  Unfortuanately, the whole story seems far less concerned with the Ringbearer's task (which should be the centerpiece of the movie), and far more with Aragorn, as he bands with the men of Rohan against the army of 10,000 Uruk-hai at the Battle of Helm's Deep, the biggest movie battle perhaps, ever.  However, while the battles in \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" had you literally jumping out of your seats and holding your breath, the battles in \\"The Two Towers\\" don't, and this is ultimately harmful to the movie.<br />Also, the music isn't a tenth as well as in the first installment, which was the finest music ever written.  The only reliefs are when old tunes from the first one are recycled.<br />The characters are really drawn down to two-dimensional status, especially those of Gandalf and Sarumon.  Gandalf comes off as nothing more than a glowing thing who comes to save the day.  Sarumon is now nothing more than a pale spectre standing around and looking menacing.  In the first movie, he was the ultimate screen villain, and made you love to hate him, and hate to love him.  Simillarly, Gandalf was once a powerful personification of all that is good in the universe, and Ian McKellen should've won his Best Actor Nomination at the Oscars. Now, he's hardly even essential to the movie, or so it seems.<br />There is much more background of the love relationship between Aragorn and Arwen, and you truly feel for the love that is shared between them, and for the sacrifices they are willing to make for eachother.  The choice that Arwen must make in theend is devistating, and heart-breaking.  But the addition of another woman in the story is pointless, and does nothing more than add a stupid love triangle.<br />A major plus to the film is the comedic relief mainly based on the relationship between Legolas and Gimli.  It's very funny!<br />\\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" was a fantasy with equal amounts of drama and action.  \\"The Two Towers\\" is hardly as great as that was.<br />The focus is more on the world of men, and %99.9 of the magic and awe that dominated the first film is lost here, and the world of Middle Earth seems no more than an area of our world that is barren of cities. In \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\", you were totally swept away into another world, and forgot all reality. Well, not anymore.<br />Like I said, it's a war movie, as well as the middle of a story.  So the pace is (or atleast tries to be) more hectic, action-packed, bloody, dark....and in the end it is depressing and disappointing, as you'll walk out of the theatre feeling.  (As I did one hour ago.)<br />Like I said, it's worth seeing, but it's nowhere near as good as the first film. Let's just hope that things shape up a bit in \\"The return of the King\\"!  (I'm sure thay will.)
0553573403|5.0|The series has got to be one of the best ever. Beware, it's not for the faint of heart since some parts can be very gruesome. But don't let a little blood discourage you from reading this fine work. The only negative about the series is that you have to wait so long between books.
B00003CXDV|5.0|Only the idea was enough to deserve five stars. THis movie is magic, intelligent, expertly crafted. One of the ebst comedies Ive ever seen.
0393317552|5.0|Recorded history began about 10,000 years ago, but the human species has been around for several million years.  This book covers it ALL, starting seven million years ago, when a population of African apes divided into three populations, leading respectively to gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans.  In a paragraph, Diamond takes us three million years to homo erectus---full-size, walking upright, but with only a half-size brain.<br />Homo erectus was the first pre-human to spread beyond Africa, about one or two million years ago, and fossils have been found in Europe that date to a half-million years ago.  Fossils from that time indicate larger brains, and looking more like homo sapiens. About a hundred thousand years ago was the age of Neanderthals, still less than fully human.<br />Human history at last took off about fifty thousand years ago, with the advent of Cro-Magnons, who used tools, weapons, houses, sewn clothing, jewelry, burial rites, and sophisticated art work.  Diamond calls this period the \\"Great Leap Forward.\\"  He is not so sure whether this leap occurred in one \\"Garden of Eden\\" or many places around the world concurrently.  In Europe the evidence is that Cro-Magnons displaced Neanderthals some 40,000 years ago, with no interbreeding.  (Cro-Magnons are so different from Neanderthals that it strikes me as something of a mystery how they actually originated, or whether they were really descendants of Neanderthals---hmmmmm----)<br />By 20,000 years ago there were humans throughout Europe and Asia, and by 12,000 years ago they crossed the Bering Straits to Alaska, and a thousand years later had reached much of South America.  Diamond touches on many ambiguities in this scientific account of our origins.<br />The above is a summary of twenty pages devoted to this period, which sets the stage for  Diamond's subsequent attempt to answer the question of why some parts of the world developed literate industrial societies, others nonliterate farming societies, and still others remained hunter-gatherers using stone tools.<br />Diamond takes us through the domestication of plants and animals, where and when it occurred with his explanations of why it first occurred in the Fertile Crescent starting about 11,000 years ago, thousands of years later in other places.  He shows that environmental and geographic factors can fully account for the differences in how and when food production capability developed in different places, and the profound impact that had on subsequent development.<br />We then learn how the domestication of animals led to diseases and germs, to steel and weapons, and to some peoples having the capability to conquer or even exterminate other peoples.  Major factors are the geographical axis of the continents (east-west versus north-south) and differences in the natural availability of plant and animal species suitable for domestication.  These factors favored the Fertile Crescent, where the agricultural revolution had it's origins as well as the later spread of agricultural technology throughout Europe and Asia, and later in the Americas.  Germs and diseases developed with origins in domesticated animals that affected humans, who then developed a degree of immunity or resistance to diseases like smallpox.  Populations that lagged in animal domestication were lacking this immunity.  Those with a head start were then able to conquer and sometimes eliminate more primitive cultures, often through the accidental or even intentional spread of diseases.<br />Diamond provides a compelling explanation for the differences in present day modern and primitive societies based totally on factors other than race or genetics.  Some may say it is an elaborate and scholarly rationalization for a politically correct world view, or that many other important factors are neglected.  Diamond discusses a few of these issues in an Epilogue.<br />Maybe it is presumptuous to comment on such a superb, scholarly work that has won a Pulitzer Prize as well as critical acclaim and LOTS of readers---but, for what it's worth, I found it intensely interesting.  The most ambitious account of the history of mankind and human societies I've encountered, and a compelling case against racist views of the differences between cultures.  Highly recommended!!

B00005QK3W|2.0|I can't believe what I heard when I first listened to this album.  McCartney is following up to the greatest album of his career (Flaming Pie) with this?  What is this?  Sounds like he put together this album in five minutes!  Lonely Road and Freedom are the only good songs on this album!  Although I do have to give the guy some credit.  He's in his 60s and still going strong.  Hopefully, he won't do this to us again.
B000000993|5.0|The first CD released by Tool is amazing. Their ability to break the mold is amazing. It may be one of their less experimentive albums, but it is still incredible how unique they sound. Maynard's dark, discordant vocals are truly thought-provoking, while Carey's underlying drum beats are just as interesting in and of themselves. The band's ability to work toghether to create a profoundly new sound is amazing. The instruments blend toghether seamlessly, so that you are not listening to vocals, or guitars, so much as the music itself. I would recommend that anyone who loves music in the least should go buy this now, since it will become a classic, and a staple of the music industry.
1570629706|5.0|Utterly wonderful. Siddarthra is a great story, nothing less. I highly recommend it!
B000002G8H|5.0|Seldom an album has all of its tracks such great, even varying a lot in speed, style and interpretation.<br />Clapton did that in SLOWHAND. The album is simply superb to listen, highly, I mean HIGHLY pleasant.<br />His band for this 1977 album was Dick Sims on keyboards, George Terry on guitar, Carl Radle on bass, Jamie Oldaker on drums and Yvonne Elliman on vocals, basically the same band that recorded 461 OCEAN BOULEVARD back in 1974. <br />This is an album whre one will have absolutely nothing to complain about. It´s that perfect.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|As a child of the 50's and 60's I grew up with Hollywood musicals and love them still.  I was happy to see that perhaps the musical was coming back.  If they are like this one - they can stay away.  I was ready to run outside screaming after watching only half the first disc.  WHAT A MESS!!
B00005YT8U|4.0|On the one hand, I sure hope that the Chieftains aren't leaving their traditional roots, and on the other hand, I enjoy their explorations of different musical styles.  <br />These are all cuts from previous albums, so he who has all of their albums probably won't want this one.  For the rest of us, there are some realy outstanding cuts.  I especially enjoyed Sinead O'Connor's singing of the traditional &quot;The Foggy Dew&quot;.  That one's followed by The Corrs and &quot;I Know My Love&quot;, another traditional with a fresh twist.  Ricky Skaggs joining the group for &quot;Cotton-Eyed Joe&quot; was a real high point, spotlighting the relation of Irish traditional reels and jigs to bluegrass.  Joni Mitchell is one of the greats, and hearing her own &quot;The Magdalene Laundries&quot; backed by the group is a real treat.  And Van Morrison bares his soul in &quot;Shenandoah&quot;, again highlighting the Irish influence on American music.  <br />I was a bit disappointed with Diana Krall &amp; Art Garfunkel's &quot;Morning Has Broken&quot;, which certainly doesn't compare with Cat Stevens.  So you can't win them all.  Sting didn't seem appropriate on &quot;Mo Ghile Mear&quot; either.<br />However, I was pleasantly surprised by &quot;Full Of Joy&quot; with the Chinese Ensemble.  That's one where it sounded everyone was having fun.  And the closing rendition of Bob Marley's &quot;Redemption Song&quot; featuring Ziggy Marley was a winner.<br />All in all, if you don't have most of these on other Chieftain albums, you'll want this one.
B000002IZ4|5.0|I can't believe that some people would put Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Alice and Chains above the Stone Temple Pilots.  You can't even compare them to this great album!  Interstate Love Song is one of the best songs written of all time.  The whole album is packed with heavy riffs, strong vocals, amongst many other things that make an album legendary.  STP have exceeded their full potential that they reached during Core.  It's nice to see a strong talented band in this generation.
B000006TRV|3.0|The Wall is by far the most overrated album of all time. <BR><br />It's essentially a Roger Waters solo album with Pink Floyd playing the music. It lacks soul and lacks emotion in my opinion. It has a lot of great songs on it. I'll even say that Disc 1 is almost entirely consistent, but there was a lot of filler on this album, and calling it Floyd's best is almost an insult because by then, it was Roger Waters and Pink Floyd.
0316666343|3.0|This novel begins with Susie Salmon's death on a cold winter day in 1973. We spend the rest of the novel watching, through Susie's eyes, her family and friends unravel and find a way back again.  What impressed me most about this book was the premise, dead girl watches family and killer from heaven wishing she could communicate and occasionally being able to at times. It was particularly heartbreaking to read about the father's grief and his obsession with catching his daughter's killer.  He feels he must keep his dead daughter in his mind or she will be forgotten while Susie's mother must find a way to forget, to block out the pain. What doesn't work is that somewhere about half way through the book it falls flat.  I lost interest in the story and stopped caring about the characters after their initial reactions of grief.  Maybe I needed to understand more about the heaven Susie was in, Sebold intices the reader with descriptions of places and people but it never really goes anywhere.  There were some good characters, like Grandma Lynn and the people Susie meets in heaven that were never really developed.  The ending is  hokey and contrived it seemed an odd choice for Sebold to make after the mother abandons the family for eight years.  The reader is given very little insight into her life and her emotions after she leaves. The lovely bones refers to the bones growing around the hole left with Susie's death and this is one of the strengths of this novel.  Sebold has beautiful descriptive language that really pulls the reader into the moment. There was alot of hype surrounding this book and it wasn't a bad read but it was mildly disappointing on many levels.
B00005YXZH|4.0|At first listen, I had to think to myself, what the heck is this? It was interesting, but I wasn't sure whether I liked it or not. It only took a second listen for me to realize that Wilco is the real deal. Very laid back, this is the music to put on when your kickin back and hangin out. It's not my favorite CD, but it's essential to any music lover's collection. I can say without a doubt that this band has the potential to be VERY good, if they have not already realized that potential. I'm excited to hear what comes next...
B000000OQF|5.0|This album broke a hole through the shallow facade that had become glam rock in the late 80's. The debauchery of Slash and Axl Rose seemed to win out over the pretension of the hair and makeup brigade. When Def Leppard had its huge \\"Hysteria\\" album and U2 was being drowned in accolades for its \\"Joshua Tree\\" album, Guns N' Roses burst onto the scene with a sound that jumped out of your speakers with a fast, raw thumping energy.<br />1.\\"Welcome To The Jungle\\" - Legend has it that when Axl was young, he got lost in LA one time, and stumbling into the ghetto, someone said to him, \\"you know where you are?/you're in the jungle/you're gonna die. Comparable in subject to \\"Mean Street\\" by Van Halen. Aside from being a great rocker, its commendable for the way it deals with and brings to life the inner city. Much like rap, it sounds menacing because it views an often ignored subject from the perspective of the drug dealer.<br />2.\\"It's So Easy\\" - \\"You think you're so cool/Why don't you just/F... Off\\" Mean spirited, angry and bitchin'!!<br />3.\\"Nightrain\\" - Every time I see an empty bottle of this in the street it makes me laugh cause I think of this song. It's comical how well the lyrics sum up the entire image of the sleazy, violent, urban drunk. You have to laugh cause it's all too real.<br />4.\\"Out Ta Get Me\\" - Theatrical account of Axl's abused childhood.<br />5.\\"Mr. Brownstone\\" - Heroin junkieism in the vein of Lou Reed<br />and David Bowie, updated for hard rock, yet before Alice In Chains ode-to-smack album, \\"Dirt\\". An addictive song.<br />6.\\"Paradise City\\" - A tremendous indictment of the entire LA culture. An almost country opening and tasty riffs lead up to a whistle that kicks off this freightrain of a sing-a-long, chock full of power chords and riffology with a derailing crescendo. Led Zeppelin comparisons are apt here.<br />7.\\"My Michelle\\" - A country western opening morphs into another baddass hard rocker. Axl's girlfriend was a socio-path too.<br />8.\\"Think About You\\" - Best thing here are Axl's hyena vocals.<br />9.\\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\" - Played in the key of C sharp major it sounds even better due to the lead up of \\"Think About You\\" which is played in the relative minor of B flat minor. Slash came up with one of the all time great guitar riffs here, although the song is largely bass driven. Axl's most beautiful lyric: \\"Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place/Where as a child I'd hide/And pray for the thunder/And the rain/To quietly pass me by\\". Excellent pacing and dynamics with a scorching solo by Slash. I used to think the low and high voices on the \\"Where do we go\\" part were two different singers. It displays the huge range of Axl's voice.<br />10.\\"You're Crazy\\" - An on-fire punk-rocker.<br />11.\\"Anything Goes\\" - The obligatory sex song. Great serpentine vocals, caked with guitars.<br />12.\\"Rocket Queen\\" - Great drum and bass groove. A prostitute love song. Not nearly as good a pop song as \\"Roxanne\\" by The Police, but same topic. Check out the break down into the outro in the last 3 minutes! Great dynamics. Just another nasty customer, suddenly turns into a caring lover. Beautiful guitar/vocal medley here.<br />This album truly was a harbinger of the grunge to come. Guns N' Roses differed from pop metal in that the bass was much more punky and prominent, and the playing was more raw, unpolished and out of control. They were just as self-destructive as the glam rockers, but with a more streetwise, honest and to the point outlook. Make no mistake - this album can give you a headache but its great to be able to tap into the this kind of energy and attitude when you want to, without having to do the horrible things these guys did to themselves.
B000003TA4|2.0|What is this?  This album is too overated just because of Cobain's passing.  I guess it has a few good songs on it, definately not a great grunge album.  This guy can't sing or play guitar!  And it turns out that Dave Grohl, the drummer, is the talented one in the band after starting his own (Foo Fighters).  If you want a good grunge album, get Stone Temple Pilots Purple or even Core....
B000005JAK|4.0|Husker Du might've signed with the majors in late 1985, but they do not lose their edge or their diversity. This is an album for a breakup, for most of the songs are about breakups, including the acerbic &quot;Don't Wanna Know If You're Lonely,&quot; to laments such as &quot;Sorry Somehow&quot; and &quot;Too Far Down.&quot; Husker Du still got mad too with its opener &quot;Crystal,&quot; containing some of the best aggressive vocals by Bob Mould. This album is not their best one, but it is still worthy of acclaim.
B000075BFK|5.0|This is a cool album to bump in your ride or chillin at home.  He once again demonstrates why he is the best at what he does.  Hands down, nobody can really compare to his lyrics.  Check out the hidden track 14 on the second CD.  This man is alive and well.  There are tons and tons of real facts that after being added up equal him faking his own death, just do a little research on the web.  The only thing I really do not agree with him on is that he compares himself to Jesus Christ, that is blasphemy and him faking his own death and being a tight rapper has nothing to do with the son of God.  Back to the album...yes, some of the songs have been released before...but once you hear them again with new beats they are still cool to listen to.  It's worth the money to be sure, give it a spin and you'll be glad you bought it.  As for the people that give it a low rating...hehe...just wait until September 13 2003...I am sure we will see a ton of new 2pac songs...after all seven years is plenty of time to write new material...
B00005QG9J|5.0|Wow. That's the word that comes to mind after listening to the latest release from Incubus. It truly is a musical experience. Beautifully crafted songs mixed with Brandon Boyd's awesome lyrics and voice create a simply awesome CD. Let me take you through a track-by-track rundown:<br />Nice to Know You - This song definantly rocks. It is one of the hardest songs on the CD. For those of you who loved Make Yourself, this might be your favorite song. It's very cool with great lyrics like &quot;I'm beginning to notice how much this feels like a waking limb, pins and needles, nice to know you, goodbye.&quot; 9/10<br />Circles - Also a pretty rocking song, but seems a little lacking compared to everything else on the CD. 7/10<br />Wish You Were Here - An awesome song sounding similar to Stellar, very radio-friendly, an all around song. 9/10<br />Just a Phase - A very interesting song, starts out nice and quiet, and has some interesting lyrics. The song kind of plays with you, and then gets loud and hard towards the end. Very cool. 9/10<br />11 AM - Proabably my least favorite song on the CD, not to say it's bad though. It's quiet and sort of relaxing. 7/10<br />Blood On the Ground - Maybe the best on Morning View. Great lyrics, nice hard rock, my personal favorite. 10/10<br />Mexico - Another quiet song, this a little better than 11 AM. I like it, it's very relaxing, calm, and it really deserves a second listen. 8/10<br />Warning - Another radio-friendly song, I really like it. Fairly hard, but not as much as the songs on Make Yourself. 9/10<br />Echo - Quiet, easily one of the best they've ever done. This is an incredibly rafted song, and is a real musical experience. Shows how talented Incubus really is. 10/10<br />Have You Ever - I like this song, it's not the best, but it sounds pretty cool. 8/10<br />Are you in? - This song is kinda wierd, and I don't like it all that much, but still, not bad at all. 7/10<br />Under My Umbrella - A cool song that changes between loudand soft very quickly, all-around cool song. 8/10<br />Aqueous Transmission - Don't drive and listen to this song, it'll put you right to sleep. It's so peaceful, you really feel like you are floating down a river. This song transcends the musical barrier and becomes something deeper than just music. It's soooo cool. 10/10<br />There ya have it, a CD that everyone should own.
B00003W8NM|2.0|Someone said that you either love or hate this film. Well I hated it. and  I    find it difficult to understand how anyone could do otherwise. It is an ugly, squalid, repulsive film about the dark side of human nature. Everything about it is depressing from the brutish thugs who spend their time bashing the hell out of each other, to the dirty, dank, derelict building  in which they carry on their odious activity. And it's unrealistic.<BR>They would all soon end up in Intensive care with broken noses and their handsome faces reduced to pulp. And why should any handsome bloke volunteer to have this done to them? And suffer the pain that goes with it?  It's not only not realistic, it doesn't make sense.<br />Not only  do I hate this film but I find it inexplicable that someone of the calibre of Helena Bonham Carter should be willing to appear in it. It can have done her reputation no good (in my opinion). From the beauty of Merchant Ivory to this pretentious rubbish. What a come down.  However, I must admit I didn't see the whole film; I was so sickened I  couldn't watch any more.
B00006LSM3|1.0|I haven't heard this CD yet, but after hearing Stuck Inside A Cloud on the radio, I'm beginning to think that people are afraid to pan the new George Harrison album because he passed away a year ago due to cancer. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Beatles/Harrison fan.  I love most of his Beatles and other solo songs.  But this has gone too far.  Stuck Inside A Cloud, was a long boring tune.  George Harrison was without a doubt a lengendery musician and I was devestated at his passing, but the line's got to be drawn somewhere.
B00007E8V4|5.0|I GOTTA HAVE THIS...CD!! I WILL NOT SLEEP OR EAT TILL I RECIVE THIS MUTHER CD!! GIVE IT TO ME!! OR PREPARE TO DIE!!                        dont be late for school again......
B00005NWM3|1.0|Nickleback proves once again how bad rock music can get. Now, I love rock, it's about the only thing I listen to, but rock and roll has really gone down the drain, and these Canadians only make it worse. Every song sounds the same, and that's not good if they sound like crap. Musical? I think not. It's loud and annoying, doing nothing that hasn't been down before. There's just no originality here. I mean none. A cover band has more originality than these guys. Meaningless hrad rock chords mixed with Chad Kroeger's annoying yelling voice and stupid lyrics about how life sucks (like that hasn't been done before) make this one of the owrst CD's of the year. I'd buy Brittney Spears before I buy Silver Side Up.
B00005YW4H|5.0|The other reviews I have read here concentrate on Norah Jones' lovely voice, vocal phrasings and the subdued nature of the album.  No one has mentioned that Norah and the other members of her band wrote 11 of the 14 songs on the CD, pretty much evenly spaced among the three members (Jones, Alexander &amp; Harris).<br />How many musical collaborations produce this caliber of album on their first try?  Not a whole lot in my experience, which goes back thirty years.<br />Songwriting.  Arranging.  Instruments.  Vocals.<br />There's a hell of a lot of talent on this disc!
B000002J09|5.0|I admit, Misty Mountain Hop, Four Sticks, and even When the Levee Breaks (though the drum sound is cool) are a bit boring.  But when you focus on the brighter side of this album, you can forget that those songs are even there.  Jimmy Page's guitar playing is even more phenominal than ever before, John Bonham manages to create amzing drum sounds that people still use today, John Paul Jones plays other instrument besides just the bass, and even Robert Plant finally manages to write great lyrics!  I don't know how someone can live without owning this album.  Each and every song changed the way music is played today.  Put down this album if you want, but face it, without its existance, who knows what music would sound like today?  I shouldn't be telling you to buy this album because you should already own it.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|This is one of those DVDs that took a long time to come out, but was definitely worth the wait. You get not only the theatrical version, but also the new IMAX version with commentary and an extra deleted music sequence (&#34;Human Again,&#34; which doesn't simply feel tacked on), and a third version called the &#34;work in progress edition&#34; that represents an early version; it combines the original pencil sketches, animation layouts, storyboards, computer demonstrations, and the final product to create an amazing filmmaking experience. This was first shown in New York in 1992 in front of critics who gave it a standing ovation.<br /><br />I'm amazed by the restoration job done on the theatrical cut; the colors are very vibrant. The film was restored, remastered and remixed in 5.1 and it was given a high definition transfer, but the upgrades never stick out (in ways they do, for example, on the Star Wars Special Editions). Now you have DVD quality with surround sound and three different versions of the film, all with their own unique style with commentary. If you want to buy this and you have a DVD player, I strongly urge you to buy the DVD instead of the VHS tape; it's in widescreen, and it's just much sharper. If you only have a VCR, the VHS looks much better than the older tape, and it has some features to make it worth your while.<br /><br />Buy this now before Disney discontinues this on January 31, 2003. Thank you for taking the time to read my review and feel free to leave me a helpful/not helpful feedback.release and reaction (this is another good feature), and last, but certainly not least, widescreen! Buy this now before Disney discontinues this on January 31, 2003. Don't worry, if you but this version, you'll never need another one. Thank you for taking the time to read my review and feel free to leave me a helpful/not helpful feedback.
B00006F7S4|5.0|There's something about this Beck album that causes it to stay in my cd players continually. I have the mp3s that I encoded in my computer, a copy of the cd in my home player, a copy in my car's cd player, and the original disc kept safe. I have many cds, but this is among my favorites.<br />After you listen to the whole album for the first few times, it starts to stick on you, and you can appreciate the musical talent, lyrics, and effort put into it. Don't listen to other people saying it's a depressing album, or others saying it's not good. They are not giving it a chance, have a biased opinion due to the type of music they listen to, or are expecting an album similar to his older ones. This is no &quot;Odelay&quot; or &quot;Midnite Vultures.&quot; Sure, it's a mellow album, but it's very relaxing, good to the ears, and I never get tired of it.<br />My favorite song would be... wait, all them are my favorite. This is rare in albums these days. Sea Change is a cd well worth a 5-star rating and definitely worth the money.
0694003611|5.0|my girls ask for this story every night! and i love it as much as they do!! every parent should also read THE GRAVEL DRIVE the graveldrive.com by Kirk Martin - a lifechanging story for parents.
B000021XR5|5.0|What could go wrong with a sober, stronger STP? you may wonder.<BR>This album confuses me, it has the hardest and softest STP songs on it!  Some songs (even though they're great) don't belong on this album, and you can tell this by listening to it.  Most of the tracks are way to heavy.  But \\"Sour Girl\\" and \\"Glide\\" have to be the best songs on this album.  Like all other STP albums, it's one that no STP fan should be without.
B000002HEP|5.0|Excellent!!!!  I have been listening to this cd non-stop for the past ten days !<br />The sound is similar to \\"Blues for the Red Sun,\\" but this album blows that one away!<br />Amazing!  Its heavy, melodic, and fantastic!
B00005JKZT|5.0|I know I loved Fellowship of the Rings.  But I hate to admit it fell short compared to Two Towers.  The darkness of the film was fantastic.  The Battle at Helms Deep had me on the edge of my seat, literally.  I was moved to cry, laugh and cheer.  I think of all the films I have seen in theaters this year Two Towers is definately my favorite.  I know Lord of the Rings fans will love it...and I think those who aren't fans will still love it.  I went and saw it twice in a weekend.  And would go again.
B00006LLNU|5.0|the more i listen to () the more i feel each song as an integral part of the album, helping build a powerful contrast between the light first half and dark second half.<br />this is a subtlety that you can't understand with one listen; you must repeat the process a number of times with full attention.  please don't write off () if you haven't really listened to it.
B000002JSR|5.0|This album is incredible!  Who can ignore We're Gonna Groove, Darlene, Ozone Baby, etc...  These are great songs that could have replaced any songs on Presence and In Through the Out Door!  My only complaint is that they should have included the song Hey, Hey, What Can I Do on this album.  Bonzo's Montreux is a great way to remember the late, legendary drummer.  And who can argue with any of Jimmy Page's riffs?  I for one recommend this album, but you can think what you want about it.
B0000027RL|5.0|This cd, well, is a cd that has lyrics that make you think. Who would have known that the song \\"Jeremy\\" would foreshadow things to come a decade later?<br />I know, one of my favorite songs (and my favorite love song), is \\"Black.\\" I especially love this song, because it doesn't have a happy ending. Almost everyone has love and lost, so this is actually a song people can relate too. I love the mourning Eddie portrays in the chorus, it just shows so much pain and emotion you have to relate.<br />Another song I listen to over and over \\"Alive.\\" Yes, it was one of their biggest hits, but the lyrics really captivate me. I don't even know what it is, but it's the lyrics like \\"But I'm still alive....Do i deserve to be?\\" I love that part.<br />If your looking for an album with excellent lyrics, with the music medolic and heavy (oftentimes blended together), pick this up. <br />Excellent.
0066214122|3.0|Even if you're not thrilled with his book, you have to appreciate Chrichton's attempt to get the science right. Crichton certainly did his homework in order to spin his tale in the most realistic, plausible way.
B00005JKZT|4.0|Okay, first off let me say \\"READ THE BOOKS\\"!<br />I was so impressed with Mr. Jackson's first effort, \\"The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring\\", that I had NO anticipation of being disappointed in his second effort.  Especially after his \\"Special Edition\\", if anything, followed the books more closely than the original theatrical release.   It was hard to believe anyone could have done such an excellent job.  Sure there were changes, but the \\"spirit\\" was certainly preserved.<br />I'm not going to give away any plot lines, but I could barely recognize this as the second book.  There were additions, and deletions.   Unfortunately, Mr. Jackson seems to have lost his road, fallen from grace, or in general, not done what I thought he should.  Yeah, I would have probably done much worse than he, but I am critiquing the movie.  I certainly don't envy him the task of putting this work on film, but he started so well, why did he deviate?  Maybe it was because he went from two, to one, to three movies.  I don't know the reason, but I'm truly sorry to say - this one doesn't measure up to the first.  At least, not for the purist fans of the novels.  I'm not saying the movie was bad, I'm saying I was disappointed.  Why did he feel the need to deviate so many times, and in so many places?  Of course, who can argue with his box office?  And, yes it is a good movie; just not a great movie.  I felt after the first movie, we were all in for a marvelous treat, an unparalleled achievement.   Now, I fell like we're in for a treat, just not a breathtaking one.
B00006CXXU|5.0|THIS CD IS GREAT. It mixes all types of genres of music together and is jus hard not to like. Certain songs that stick out on MS. CHRISTINA'S cd's are  &quot;Impossible&quot; which has Ms. Aguilera serenading us  on how impossible it is to love someone who doesn't want to open up. It sticks out and is a BEAUTIFUL ballard and should be her next single because it shows that she is a excellent singer and it's probably one of the best tracks vocally on the album. Which brings us to the next track SOAR. Wonderful track and Ms. Aguilera's vocal soar right off the scale. She sings on how u hould do what makes you happy and SOAR, wonderful song and it is a great song of encouragement. The last song that gets honorable mentionn is the HEAVY ROCK AND ROLL TRACK &quot;MAKE OVER.&quot; I LOVE THIS SONG, IT TALKS OF HOW SHE'S GOING TO DO WHAT SHE LIKES SO DON'T TRY TO MAKE HER BE SOMETHING SHE'S NOT. DON'T GET ME WRONG EACH SONG IS GREAT IT IS JUST THESE ARE THE ONES THAT STICK OUT THE MOST. MS AGUILERA HAD PUT US ON HOLD DOR 3 YRS. AND THIS EFFORT PROVES IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT.
B00005AQGH|5.0|Those are just a few words that describe 2Pac's 6th and final album he had hands on. This album became the subject of controversy not only for its content, but for the time it came out: for it was released just 2 months after Pac's death. All of Pac's first 6 albums are brilliant in their own way, but this final album was phrophetic and haunting, and culminating in what many consider to be his best work ever. Lyrically, this is his most advanced album. His wordplay was getting stronger, and he was developing into a true MC. His subject matter was increasing, and the intensity and passion in his voice was louder than ever. In some songs, he is almost screaming, making you feel his pain [see his second verse in Hold Ya Head for a good example]. It has the uplifting spirit of his other classic album, Me Against The World, and the intensity of All Eyez On Me [but to an even greater degree].<br />However, it wasnt just the fact he was improving so rapidly from album to album. It was the evolution from his debut album to this one. When 2Pacalypse Now came out, his charisma and power was already in place, but he was a mere political rapper....5 albums later, he was a PHROPHET. The album starts off with the intro of a news reporter talking about the east/west coast war, which was at the boiling point during this albums making. It goes right into Bomb First, one of his most angry and energetic tracks ever. He calls out various east coast artists here, and it is apparant things were getting out of hand. Pac kept it diverse though, not letting his beef with Biggie and the east coast consume him.  Alot of people call this a \\"war\\" album, but there are is in fact only one true diss song on the entire album [Against All Odds], though he does make some minor disses in Toss It Up and at the end of To Live And Die In LA. Hail Mary is one of his deepest songs ever, and is one of the many mysterious songs on this album. Many of the lyrics have double meanings, and there are several clues which have made people think he was still alive [Im pretty sure he is dead, but that is another topic I wont get into right now]. Blasphemy, one of his best songs ever, is one of these. In this track, Pac gets deep, REAL deep. He speaks on religion, thug life, and God himself in this song. Just Like Daddy is his usual song for the ladies....White Manz World is probably his most political track since anything he did on Strictly 4 My Niggaz, a powerful composition of racism and oppression. Hold Ya Head is a similiar song, but made for important political figures he feels should be free. The most personal song on the album is Krazy. This has almost a Dear Mama type feel to it, but with a twist. Toss It Up and To Live In Die In LA are more commercial, but are great songs nevertheless, and round out the album well. Less noticable is Life Of An Outlaw, which is a good song, but probably belongs on the All Eyez On Me cd. Pac was getting more advanced conceptually as well. Me And My Girlfriend is the rawest song on the album, a tale about a man and his relationship with a gun, described as a woman in metaphoric form. The dialouge with the lady shouting and the dark beat add to the effect of the song. The album is ended with what is probably his greatest diss song ever, Against All Odds, where he pulls almost everyone's card, from Puffy to the agent who set him up, to Nas. Its hard to choose a fav song on this record, because all of them are pure genius, but Hail Mary, Blasphemy, Me And My Girlfriend, and Krazy stand as four of his best penned songs ever.<br />This is not only an essential 2Pac album, but an essential hip hop album. Though All Eyez On Me is probably his most popular album, and a classic in its own right, this cd stands as his true gem. The way the album is structured, the amazing production WITHOUT any big name producers, and his elevated lyricism and song writing certified him as a hip hop phrophet, and one of the greatest artists of our time. This cd displays every side of Pac imaginable, and is his most thought provoking and intense album to date. If you dont have this album, what are you waiting for?? Stop reading this review and go and buy the damn thing.....we will never see another album like this again. Pac truly outdid himself [and his competition] with this masterpiece. This is as close to flawless as an album can get.
0812550706|5.0|I read this novel about 5 years ago and it is still in my Top 10 of best fiction. I read &quot;Ender's Game&quot; in one night. I could not put it down! <br />Yes, it's &quot;sci-fi&quot; but - more than that - it is an intense character study of a boy under stress we cannot imagine. However, Mr. Card puts us in the heart and soul of Ender Wiggin, we experience his ordeal with him, and when it's all over the reader is left gasping for air. In my opinion, the ending of this book is one of the best ever conceived in the history of fiction.
0767817478|4.0|I think this movie would have been better accepted under a different title. While the monster is very well done and the action and special FX are great, its just not Godzilla. Fans of the \\"real\\" Gojira will most likely be disapointed but all in all a pretty enjoyable film.
B00005QCVT|5.0|This film is too extraordinary for words. An outstanding performance by the cast especially Ellen Burstyn. My heart cried for her lonliness. I felt this movie in every part of my soul. One of the greatest films of all times not recieving an Academy Award............How disturbing!
0385508417|4.0|This charming little book will really strike a chord with many modern Americans who feel slightly oppressed by keeping up with the neighbors, and with all the hectic social obligations piled into the holiday season. The story's plot is classic comedy, made all the more delightful by the recognizable characters who populate the distinctly American &quot;any-town&quot; in which it is set. The American values that come through in the end are truly heartwarming, destining this to become a classic holiday tale.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|Whoever you are...whatever you're into...you WILL love this album.It is powerful,creative and a testament to true love.Yulia and Lena of t.a.t.u encouraged me to learn Russian.Finally there are artists who put life into their music.They are overwhelming and you WILL be missing out if you don't get their album.Buy it...it's money well spent.If you don't love at least one track...something is definitely wrong with you!Luv Ya-*Hannah*
B00007E8V4|5.0|System of a Down rocks out like you wish you could. I own all the System of a Down CD's. And if you don't like rock music. Don't buy the CD.,, I skateboard and all that I have got to do is pop in \\"Steal This Album\\" and turn to track two \\"Inervisions.\\" And I am ready to skate. This album is a total buy.
B00006NSZ5|4.0|This compilation features the overplayed but very good \\"Lose Yourself\\" from Eminem. Also featured are some of rap's best veterans like Jay-Z,Nas,Rakim,and Xzibit bringing some good songs to the soundtrack. I only have one problem with this album and that is the Macy Gray song that I have only been able to put up with through one listen. Her voice is horrible and I dont know why she is even on here. Another great feature is the Shady/Aftermath sampler promo disc which features more songs from Eminem, Obice Trice, and others. Overall this is a pretty good rap album and \\"Lose Yourself\\" alone is worth the price.
B0000542D2|5.0|The DVD from Miramax has a bunch of uninteresting and unneccessary interviews from people associated with the film. Outakes and the inclusion of &quot;You Can't Do That&quot; song restored to the concert near the end of the film would have been better.  With that aside this film took Beatlemainia to greater heights back in 1964, and A HARD DAY'S NIGHT has remained a timless piece of filmmaking influencing many genres of media.  The Beatles greatest strength as a rock/power pop band is that each member had its own distinct personality (furthered by the fact that because they were a very &quot;musical&quot; band one can count on their songs being varied, as each member took on singing duties along with the great harmonies on songs), and that even if one was not a fan, somehow could name each member of the band.  The movie definitely enhanced the Beatles individual members.  Classic songs, innovative direction from Richard Lester (black and white documentary style), pretty funny comedic moments, and decent comedic perormances from the Fab Four themselves, this is a very entertaining film. Great Fun!! Note - Degrees of Separation: Actor John Vernon who plays &quot;Man on Train&quot; in A HARD DAY'S NIGHT also appeared in the James Bond movie GOLDFINGER almost released at the same time (he plays a character &quot;Smithers&quot; in the film when he,&quot;M&quot;, and James Bond are discussing Golfinger).  In the film, James Bond (Sean Connery) states &quot;...drinking Dom Perigon '53 above the temperature of 38 degrees farenheit. That's as bad as listening to THE BEATLES without earmuffs!
B00006CYAD|5.0|no one knows how to rock out like simple plan with their awesome beats and tight lyrics u cant miss out simple plan is the best!
B00005RY7X|1.0|I listen to this album with my friends when we need something to laugh. There is NO WAY to listen to this stuff without cracking up. I Love NYC and Get Ready to Die are especially funny.
B000002JAX|5.0|Yes, like everyone else I have been anxiously awaiting a new album from Peyroux.  Aside from all of the comparisons to Billie Holiday, I can honestly say that she has a wonderful voice and is also a great performer.  I was fortunate enough to see her perform twice about 5 or so years ago.  She sang at the University of North Florida.  I also saw her perform at a cafe with her Lost and Wandering Blues and Jazz Band.  I was very impressed with the more intimate venue.  I will never forget her three piece band which included someone who played a real washtub bass.  After the set, they sold cassette recordings of her and the band.  The cassette is great, but I am looking for a copy on CD.  If anyone knows of this please e-mail me!
0345451325|5.0|Well, what is there to say.  Well lets put it this way, if you liked halo, well then you'll definately love this book (note to the authors, Good job!!!!!!)
B00005MAM2|5.0|theres always a but. I realy didnt get it. the whole movie was great and normal story and then the end just like totaly flew out of control and i didnt get it at all. call me stupid but it made no sense to me. like when the kids were talking at the end and saying stuff like &quot;we should be able to........&quot; and &quot;becuase........&quot; i mean finish your freakin sentence for christ sake! well the ending realy made no sense to me...ive watched it like 19 times i fear i will never understand it but all and all a good movie.
B00005JL78|2.0|Sleepwalking through yet another role Tom Cruise tries bravely to carry the movie on his back.  He's lying there in the hot sun moving his legs trying to turn over but he can't.  And the writer's aren't helping.<br />Whaddya mean they're not helping?<br />I mean they're not helping.<br />Apparently the movie is a test, designed to evoke an emotional response.  The emotion is ennui or malaise or boredom or apathy.  Get VKed on a film like this one and it's gonna be pretty hard to tell whether or not you're a replicant.  However there might be a certain involuntary dilation of the iris as you think of the five portraits of George Washington that are no longer in your hip pocket.<br />I would rate this movie Double-Plus Ungood.  Furthermore I would have the writers sent to the Ministry of Love and have them replaced by novel-writing machines.  But actually, come to think of it, it is entirely possible that Minority Report was written by machines - the literary equivalent of a Quisinart.  All you do is take the standard shlock Hollywood thriller plot formula, add in every old sci fi film you can think of, Metropolis, Blade Runner, Logan's Run, and some old Humphrey Bogart movie I forget the name of.  Hit the pulse button until these movies have been reduced to disjointed fragments, add an emulsifier and you can move out of Central and take the tubeway home early, just in time to feed your electric sheep.
B00005QZWI|5.0|It's been a year since I bought this CD, and I love it! At first I was a little dubious about its quality, but as soon as I listened to it I knew it was perfect. Howard Shore did a magnificent job with this score, and you won't be disappointed. This sountrack came out before FotR was released on the big screen, so by the time I went to the theater I pretty much had all the songs memorized. It was great! I was a little disappointed that the dance song from Bilbo's birthday party was not included. It's a cute, lively track. The CD is wonderful without it, though--a great collection of different themes (including one for the Hobbits, Saruman/orcs, the Fellowship, a GREAT theme for Khazad-Dum and Gandalf's fall, and of course, Enya!). My favorites are Concerning Hobbits (light and lively), The Bridge of Khazad-Dum (heavy, and then hauntingly beautiful), The Breaking of the Fellowship (wonderful!), and May It Be (Enya). If you're a true Tolkien fan who loves music, don't wait any longer to buy this!
0316666343|4.0|Excellent read.  I couldn't put it down.  The first half has moments of brilliance.  As Sebold tries to tie the ends together, she falls into some sentimentality and cliche, but it remains a haunting story with an excellent premise.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|My wife had the Russian CD when we first got married. It took a little while for me to warm up to it but its pretty good stuff. On the pop side of course but good. Looking foward to a second album. If you want expand you music tastes, get the CD. The videos are pretty good too.
0151008116|5.0|A book on how a boy survies on a life boat with a Bengal tiger. Definitaley a very unique idea. The book is well paced and some passages are very very philosophical. I really liked the book.
B000063WDH|5.0|These guys definitely have it.  No joke.  I've heard a lot of modern \\"blues\\" bands that are really really bad.  Usually bands like this genuinely love blues music and want to play some blues themselves.  You see them on-stage and they're going thru the motions and you can admire them for being so passionate about really bad songs, but you leave completely unsatisfied.  This album is everything I could wish for from a modern blues bands. You will not be disappointed.
B00000I07Q|5.0|I have heard \\"yeah I USED to be into that back in the day\\" or \\"I probably still have a copy floating around somewhere\\" with regards to this album (or possibly GNR's Illusions albums) more than any other piece of work.  Again, perhaps you are beginning to notice a thematic motif streaming through all my reviews: WELL WHAT ABOUT BEETHOVEN??????? It's about the most difficult, grandiose, and (unnecessary?) thing to do in the world, compare the New Jersey album to the .... 7th Beethoven Symphony, let's say.... but given I live in America, my freedom of speech is going to let me get on with the idea anyway.<br />   Nobody says \\"yeah man back in the day, the late works of Brahms.\\"  Why is the 80's such a long time ago, and why has it been that way ever since 1993?<br />Well, ranking with \\"Keep the Faith,\\" \\"Blaze of Glory,\\" and \\"Use your Illusion II\\", this fool shall now stick his neck out and put this album on the highest throne -  potentially pushing the buttons of many... or maybe not?<br />Upon becoming millionaires in the prime party time of your life, first of all, a huge hat's off these guys for actually feeling like making a masterpiece after \\"Slippery.\\"  The latter album was great, but from a musical standpoint, there was a career with tenure to be established.  When applying the business sense of using \\"the formula to sell\\", combined with musical talent and significant productivity in the composition department (oh, and a human soul, almost forgot that one), I never have heard a band who has been able to split the difference and play the game to get their point across, better (except for maybe Queen). <br />I was 10 when I first heard \\"I'll be there for You\\", so I'll admit I was somewhat brought into the game of record marketing for the masses... yet still, from day one, I was quite remarkably MORE hooked into Jovi than ANYTHING else that was going on.  I didn't even get into Guns till after Nirvana made them \\"untrendy\\" and \\"embarrassing\\" to listen to.<br />The hooks? The production? The buisness sense? Sure! But STILL, for God's sake, let's not forget that BON JOVI'S \\"NEW JERSEY\\" also has AMAZING SONGWRITING AND MUSICIANSHIP.  Although I am no enemy of the power ballad, I would still like to say that \\"I'll be There for You\\" is probably the best one (maybe because it's actually a song, not just a power ballad, all ye pigeonholers out there) ever written.  Amazing lyrics, immensely tasteful fills by Richie in between all the vocals, and amazingly tastefully guitar solo... and that modulation (or more like tonal shift) into E at the outro chorus! ... or in the case of this song, one of the guys in the band went, \\"you know I think we may have something here if we take this song to the key of God.\\"  All who want to cry \\"music nerd,\\" bring it on, I'm ready.  Just stay away from Dream Theater because it probably has too much brain for you.  This is why I love Bon Jovi more than anything, though... they have brains to overplay, which is telepathically communicated to us in their songs, but they know that they need to reach out to people, or their mission is pointless - and although I'd like to see the current Jovi go back to a little more jamming and going off, I do understand their situation.  So, realizing they have the lowest B.S. content of any humans in the world, they put their hearts on tape - and into the lives of others.<br />But the real gem/masterpiece/lackofwordsforsuchasong  is \\"Stick to Your Guns.\\" The key and chord progressions, being directly before \\"I'll be There For You,\\" may be somewhat exhausting to the listener... but.... I guess that's okay in this case, given that two of the greatest musical compositions ever written are right next to each other.  I didn't even think about the whole cowboy ripoff thing till people started bringing it up SINCE the year 2002.  If you get to what the song is really saying, you'll find you can stop attacking JBJ for the \\"cliche's.\\" You know, I have a philosophy: Cliche's are only cliche's because they are so true, and frequently recurring themes in life.  Some people out there just can't handle repetition.  I will concede, however, there is a fine line between monotonous simplicity and justified \\"in the pocket\\" repetition.<br />   But enough about the greatest songs ever written, that just happen to appear on New Jersey.  \\"Wild is the Wind\\" rips your heart out and makes you bleed, \\"Blood on Blood\\" is on the borderline between anthem and epic, which develops so perfectly you forget over 6 minutes has gone by, \\"Living in Sin\\" and \\"Born to Be My Baby\\" could be considered some of the best stuff ever written WHEN you are in the proper mood, and \\"Love for Sale\\" is one of the first huge posters that read \\"STOP IT WITH THE HAIRMETAL LABELS\\" before the term HAIRMETAL was even a big deal.  What? Diversity? An 80's band? That is correct.<br />This is an amazing album that will be on your moderate to heavy rotation list all your life, if you are not stubborn enough to fall into the \\"It had its day\\" category of obstinate human beings that dwell amongst us.  It may never sell more than \\"Slippery\\" just because there are too many people that go \\"Dude, the original is classic, you can't argue with the classic\\", but in a perfect world  *sigh* it would atleast have longterm critical acclaim.  If you are listening to Matchbox 20, Creed, Dave Matthews, Barenaked Ladies *shudder* or,... I don't know what, but if you think what you listen to is good music and you don't even own this album... AND there were a literal God of Rock and Roll somewhere, then you, my friend, may be committing a mild sin.  But religion is about forgiveness, so ... if you turn your computer off right now and go get it (or order it here right now).... maybe I can convince God to look the other way just long enough....<br />Peace to you and all genuine music out there.<BR>Not cheese-metal... but genuine music.

B00005V9HH|5.0|I have been an avid fan of Brian Singers wortk over the many years.  This film has been a the forefront of all &quot;singerstyle&quot; movies to be released since.  The movie displays the most extravagent style of thinking since zombies live that i have seen in years.  Once the story unfolds you will understand why singer is and all ways will be the king of the thinking mans suspence.
B00006879E|5.0|Every song is the best.  Great vocals!  You can listen to each song 500 times and still want to listen to them all again!
B00005QDW1|5.0|If you're a pop music fan, like me, then you'll soon love this CD.  I was not a &quot;No Doubt&quot; fan before being snagged by &quot;Hey Baby&quot; and &quot;Underneath It All&quot; on FM radio, but these songs strongly tempted me to buy this album.  I soon found that unlike earlier &quot;No Doubt&quot; releases, this was Grade A pop with an 80's electronica sensibility.  For those who hate pop music, or loved the neo-grunge style of the band's earlier cds, you might not like &quot;Rock Steady&quot; as much I do.  My recommended tracks follow:<br />2 - Hella Good<BR>3 - Hey Baby<BR>4 - Making Out<BR>5 - Underneath It All<BR>7 - Don't Let Me Down<BR>8 - Start the Fire<BR>9 - Running<BR>10 - In My Head<BR>13 - Rock Steady<br />  Track number one is a slice of Track 13, an introduction only, and Tracks 6, 11, &amp; 12, were rather emotionless.  But that leaves  about nine songs to love.  You won't regret this buy.
0385508417|4.0|Loved it!  Although I wasn't sure about the significance of Marty.  If I was a Hollywood producer, I'd be casting:<br />Luther Krank - Jim Belushi<br />Mrs Krank - Marion Ross<br />Daughter Krank - the actress who played the daughter in Father of the Bride<br />Enrique - Enrique Iglasius<br />Marty - Sean Penn
B00007E8V4|5.0|I have each of the system of a down cds, and as a fan of theirs I can honestly say that this was my favorite cd.  I have gone through these reviews, and I am dissapointed with some of the responses.  While some people liked it, they stated that it was all just a continuation of Toxicity.  The people that hate it say that the band all sounds the same.<BR>What neither groups looked at is the overall picture of the cd.  It shows how the band matured from juvenile but amusing sons like 'chic 'n stu' to things like 'Roulette' and 'streamline'.  The band matured, and the overall sound changes.  People who like a band that just repeats itself should go listen to korn, but if you see something in lyrics, a political or ethical message, you should buy this cd
B000002UA2|4.0|During the period after Syd Barrett's departure, Pink Floyd indulged in a good deal of experimentation in an attempt to find its voice now that its principal songwriter and creative light was no longer among them.  It was in these years (1968-1972) that Roger Waters, with significant contributions from David Gilmour, Richard Wright and Nick Mason, wrote songs and incidental music for a couple of Frecn films.  Though the soundtrack albums from these films, &quot;More&quot; and &quot;Obscured by Clouds&quot; have generally not been held in high regard by critics, they both contain som excellent music - both instrumental music and songs.<br />&quot;Obscured by Clouds&quot; in particular is a fine collection of songs, including &quot;Burning Bridges&quot;, &quot;Childhood's End&quot;, Waters' &quot;Free Four&quot;, a happy tune about growing old and decrepit, and Wright's &quot;Stay&quot;, a pretty song about a one-night stand.<br />While not one of their standout albums, &quot;Obscured by Clouds is definitely worth a listen.  It's another illustration that Pink was a talented enough band to lose a great songwriter and musician like Syd Barrett and still make some of the finest music around.
B00005JKCH|4.0|Great Special Effects, Great extras, and a pretty good plot. Very enjoyable overall.
0802130208|5.0|Well whats the making of a great novel? Well I laughed out loud many times I got mad many times,and even felt sympathy. In my mind thats the making of a great novel. The preachings and philosophies of Ignatius are out of this world,and the reactions he creates from bosses,people on the streets,friends,and anybody he comes in contact with are madcap hilarious.Its a shame Toole let life get the best of him,He would have been stupendously funny.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is a great set, highly accurate portrayal of E Co./506th, 101st Airborne. Every member of the cast truely becomes the  soldier they are playing in this work.(The documentery that comes with the mini-series is excellent as well.) A few scenes differ just slighty from the Ambrose book. Perhaps to make the series more fluid or add more value. My only gripe is that the set comes in a neat little ammo can like tin(which is fine). But the discs fold out on a cardboard style bandolier. They are extremely difficult to remove from those sweet little push buttons. Ive seen better designs, cant someone standardize this little push thing in the center of DVD's??
0345440900|4.0|This booked saved my life. This book was a suggestion of a friend, along with a few others. I read them all and keep this one like a baby bible. The most helpful thing was the section which helps you identify types of cries and baby body language. It was so stressful the first few weeks, but this book helped me understand my newborn and get him on a schedule and we are all sleeping through the night. No one ever tells the truth about what it is like to have a newborn. Sure people make jokes and ask if you are sleeping, but you really do not understand until you have your own little one. The best advise I can give is read and try everything until you find the thing which works. This books works.
B00004BZ0N|1.0|Sorry, boys and girls - London Calling isn't punk and it isn't very interesting, either. Clash's first album, Janie Jones, Clash City Rockers, Career Opportunities - now that's the real deal, along with Never Mind the Bollocks, Ramones, Richard Hell, the Strangler's Black and White, and the Buzzcocks. London Calling gets one star for the title track, especially Strummer's rooster crowing - now that's incendiary and revolutionary, carefree, wild, young and sexy. The rest of this is basically folk music with electric guitars, the Grateful Dead of post-Punk, like a bunch of old men playing. Sandinista is even worse, what a chore it is to labor through that record. Anybody who takes themselves so seriously they can record and release Spanish Bombs is a bore. While the Clash were busy as the house band for Vanessa Redgrave and her unilateral nuclear disarmament rallies, the English voter went out and voted for Thatcher and John Major. So much for \\"the  only band that matters!\\" For some real post-punk with real Punk energy: the Jam's Sound Affects. I'll stick with Janie.
B000005JA8|5.0|Those who found an appreciation for this godsend have an unknown ocean of divine music waiting too pour into them. Those who didnt are just a lost cause.
B00005OM4N|3.0|To be blunt this album is soley Britney's dispossable pop music and sounds like a rehash of her past 2 albums. 3 albums later and has she matured? Hardly. Despite being an adult now she still sings about not being a little girl blah blah blah.<br />This isn't a bad album, its just a \\"yawn\\" thank you for not surprising me Britney. teenage girls will dance round their rooms to some of the songs not noticeing are particularly careing that the songs are shallow and hardly a statement of indipendance wich is what Britney wanted to acheieve with this record.<br />...<br />Why am I stateing the obvious? It was entertaining at first but 3 albums later I expected some maturity. Not just getting the neptunes to make a few songs rnb sounding...wich is probably Brits idea of changing as an artist.<br />This album is very passe. Even her rivals have gone onto better things.<br />This album sounds like it was used with some left over material from the OOps album and rushed out in a few weeks of a summer.<br />3 stars for a sound wich isn't bad, just growing tired. To survive this album is to have slave and not a girl on repeat.
B00004RF11|5.0|My kids and I love this little film! (My 'kids' are 19 and 28) We watch it every time it comes on and I intend to buy it. I love DeVito and M.S. Trenchbowl (sp?) Cute and very funny, I always laugh.
0060934913|4.0|I loved this book and having passed fleetingly in and out of the Food Service Industry at various times in my life, I can attest to its authenticity. Beyond the culinary buccaneering, the cautionary tale of Bourdain's career path, and practical tips for restaurant patrons, I found this book to really be about work, the dignity of labor and the deep, almost addictive satisfaction to be derived from tangible labor, as opposed to the drier (although regrettably more negotiable) rewards 'white-collar' work
B00004XOWM|1.0|This cd is their best, it is really good. If you don't have this cd, you should buy it. You will not be dissappointed. Buy it now if you like good music.<br /> Now, a REAL Review (the previous statements would fit perfectly in the under-13-years-old kid's review form):<br /> This album is more of the same, thrown-together, uninspired mix of rap and rock that was soooo mainstream that they had to jump on it to make money. \\"Hey, rap-rock is happening, so why not do it? I know it was Aerosmith and Run DMC who did it first, but now everybody's doing it. It's hot.\\" These must have been these guys' thoughts and plans for forming a band. Well, here you have the fruitful evolution (not) and innovation (dream on) that they have achieved on their last cd. Durst is still his perennially annoying self, the riffs sound generic, the rapping boring and whiny...all in all, forgettable. A feeble attempt at fitting in on the trend of the moment. If they come back and sell half as many CD's as this one, it is because of the arrival of Evanescence - a band who with their immensely superior music brought new momentum to this genre, which was almost gone. Barney, the purple one (aka Fred) must love the fact that a female-led band would be very influential in determining his band's future. Time will tell.
B00006879E|4.0|I bought the CD after only hearing one song...but believe me, it was worth it because the entire disc is awesome.  Thoughtful lyrics, rhythms that are easy to listen to at any time of day...&quot;Songs for Jane&quot; would be an excellent addition to a CD collection for any music lover.
0679409866|2.0|this applies to all of austen's books. by the time you get to 'persuasion' you get pretty tired of it. same story lines, same themes, same devices. i read this book at the same time as dickens' 'dombey and son'. and after 200 pages of 'dombey', i never picked up 'persuasion' again. i got about half way through before i dumped dainty jane. there's just no comparison when you put them side by side. austen is really not so much a true novelist so much as she is some kind of prose playwright. her novels are really plays embellished by narrative descriptions of what people think and feel. they lack the full recreation of a physical world outside the minds of her characters. one is never even told something as basic as what her characters look like, much less how they dress, act or move. and one gets only the sketchiest descriptions of places and things, much as you'd find in a play. compare this to the rich and vivid imagery of dickens or flaubert or proust and it becomes obvious how far short of novels austen's books really fall. read any play and the resemblances to austen's books become all too apparent. <br />still, austen is a good writer. she just isn't in the same class as the aforementioned great writers.
6305077630|4.0|Another John Hughe's classic.  It falls into the same DVD treatment as 'Sixteen Candles' though.  It was released poorly on DVD, and is no longer in production.  But hold on, there's rumours that this and 'Breakfast Club' and '16 Candles' will get the DVD treatment they deserve in time for their 20th Anniversary!  Weird Science, although silly at times, is a must-have 80's classic with some VERY entertaining scenes.  Wait for the next DVD release, please don't pay high amounts for the used early DVD copy!
B000069AT7|5.0|I buy this Gift set and when i recieve it and see how beatiful this package is,i have no words.There is a great book with beatiful photos from making of E.T.,production notes and screenplay,Senitype and Certificate of Authenticity.But what really gets me is was the set of 3 dvds and cd with soundtrack.It includes the same 2 dvd disc from Collectors edition and dvd (witch i consider with book as one of goals of this edition) with original movie from 1982.The picture is excellent and the same goes to sound.You can really understand what this movie means for Steven.This is simply the best Dvd set in my collection.So if you dont like the new digitalizet E.T.(but i think it is not possible) or are the same fan of this movie like me,buy this version.I think that more movies will deserved edition like this one.
0446310786|5.0|Harper Lee wrote one of the best books of American Literature. More than a coming-of-age tale, `To Kill A Mockingbird' can be a life-changing experience. Her story is so simple, and at the same time so profound that it touchs deep inside. <br />My favorite character is Scout, the narrator. She is a girl that loves being with her brother Jem and their friend Dill. And when they are together she does things that most girls don't usually do. Their father is Atticus, a lawyer that is involved with defending a black man in the court. This experience will change their lives forever and will remain with the kids for their whole lives. Scout is a very precocious child, and her comments about people she knows are funny and sincere. She has a very peculiar view of the world and life itself.  All characters are well developed, but I became very fond of Calpurnia and Dill. <br />Harper Lee's style is easy and effective, her words are simple. This is what makes the book very accessible to everyone. This is the kind of novel that makes you laugh and cry in a turn of page.  I highly recommend this book to everybody. This is a great book, and above all things it is a denounce of human behavoir, and its flaws.
B00006NSGX|4.0|It's not likely that EC will go intoretirement after his recent world tour. He probably won't do the long drawn out, 8 month long stintsthat he completed in 2001. This is a great performance filmed and recorded at the Staples center in L.A. on the last night of this long tour. The quality of the audio and video is superb with many different camera angles not too many shots of the audience as in Paul Mc's recording here for his latest cd/dvd. I gave this only a 4 star rating because of the lack of more good blues material and the strange rendition of Badge that didn't sound close to the original by Cream. All in all a very nice package for EC fans!
B000002QWD|5.0|All I can say is WOW!!!!  Hearing Bing sing these songs sure does put one in the Christmas mood.  \\"White Christmas\\" - the version heard on this recording - is one of the most popular songs of all time.  There's a song for everyone here!  From favorites like \\"Here Comes Santa Claus\\" and \\"Jingle Bells\\" for the kids, to sacred classics like \\"Adeste Fidelis\\" and \\"Silent Night\\" to fun songs like \\"Christmas In Killarney\\" and Mele Kelikimaka,\\" there's something for all Christmas tastes.  Bing was one of the greatest singers of all time and his songs will always live on.<br />The sound on the CD is very good.  Even though most of the songs on this disc do indeed sound like they were recorded in the 40's for 78-RPM discs, they all sound magical.  I'm a sucker for that old sound when it comes to CD's.  <br />Essential listening at Christmas and great for anytime of the year for that little bit of Christmas spirit you need every so often.  <br />Personal Note:  While celebrating Christmas with the family yesterday, we played the 78 RPM record of Bing's \\"Adeste Fidelis\\" (the same recording heard on this disc).  Listening to Bing sing that beautiful song while watching the record spin at close to 80 times a minute almost brought tears to my eyes (and I'm a 19 yr old guy!).  With all the clicks and pops on the record (along with the crack that runs from rim to label; the record didn't skip at all!), it was very uplifting to listen to.  Bing's \\"Silent Night, Holy Night\\" is on the flip side of the record, but I haven't yet given it a listen. <br />Have this album on tape and CD, and may buy another before the day is over!!! (and what a great price!)<br />HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!
B00005JL78|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  You can spot it as a Steven Spielberg film because the hero/lead character does an amazing stunt that would in reality kill him.  I always get a chuckle and think to myself \\"No way\\".  It's fast paced and a nice ride but if you don't particularly care for sci-fi, then I wouldn't recommend it.  You have to follow it carefully.
B00006RU5B|4.0|I was surprised to see so many critics giving this album bad scores. They all seemed to mention that it is very generic and not innovative at all. This is indeed true; the album doesn't really feel like Rage Against the Machine or Soundgarden, it's more-or-less kind of a return to classic rock with those extra touchups, such as Tom Morello, with his unique guitar sound. The whole flow of the songs is generic, and the drumming and bass isn't very impressive except for Tom Morello, of course, because of his unique soloing. These are really my only complaints, however. The songs may be generic but they are well written, lyrically, and they just sound good. It's also good to hear stuff like this after listening to all that 'new' rock and metal music. The singer here is from Soundgarden, replacing the old Rage rapper. I liked Rage better, but this guy still has a great voice, and sounds a lot like the singer of AC-DC when his voice goes high pitch. <br />Favorite Tracks: &quot;Gasoline&quot;, &quot;Cochise&quot;, &quot;Hypnotize&quot;, &quot;Exploder&quot; and &quot;Like a Stone&quot;.
B000002UA0|5.0|This is very much Syd's album. The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn is more whimsical than any of Pink Floyd's later albums. It seems only a shame that he didn't stay longer in the band or indeed make more solo albums. This is Syd in happy times. The drugs were in their joyous effect at this stage and he wrote songs such as Bike which is rather silly when you think about it but somehow rather much the work of a mad genius. But there is plenty to like about this albumif you are a curious old so and so. Astronomy Domine, Matilda Mother and The Gnome are all beautiful songs when you give them time . But the main track here is the near 10 minute version of Interstellar Overdrive and I think it's fair to say that the track lives up to it's name.<br />Incidentally I once played this album when my friends had come over. They were smoking some hash and I played Interstellar Overdrive and Bike. Needless to say most people were in a state of paranoia and needed to get out of the room because the music was too much ... for them. All in all there were about 3 people including myself who were left listening to it. Hilarious<br />But of course this is not going to please everybody. My dad ( who also likes Pink Floyd ) hates this album a lot. He can't stand the silliness of it all and prefers their later albums. This is not uncommon - a lot of people are divided over this album so it's no surprise to me at all. If you heard Bike at the end of the Echoes album should probably get a fair idea if you want the album or not. I say buy it even just to see how Pink Floyd started out or just to see how out of his mind Syd was when he made this album. Either way it should be at least listened to once or twice-by then you should get a clear idea whether this album is for you or not
B00005JKDR|5.0|This one isn't just for the kids! My new favorite movie is Monsters Inc.  There is no one more obsessed with this movie and I'm more than 20 years old. You may call me crazy until you've seen it for yourself. A bit of advice-don't waste the money on renting it, just buy it, you'll love it. It's a laugh a minute. The voices are great and the attention to detail is fabulous!
B000002MJC|5.0|By chance, this was my first DM cd.  And it's my favourite by far and I have to say I was a tad disappointed with the rest of their material.  If I had picked up say, Black Celebration first, I'm not sure I would have gone out of my way to get their other cds.  But as for this album, every track is excellent.  My favourite is definetely Higher Love, followed by a tie between  In Your Room and Mercy in You.  This cd is very dark, and I like it that way.  Yet there is some glimmer of hope sprinkled throughout the tracks.  You wont be disappointed with Songs of Faith and Devotion.
B00007E8V4|5.0|this is the most unbelivable CD i have ever listened to. even if you are not a S.O.A.D. fan you will enjoy this! The song Roulette is absolutly breathtaking and as another fan said \\"you just dont want it to stop.\\" I just can't belive music can be this good.
B00007BH5C|5.0|What a pretty album. Shore's grasp of musicality really shines through, and the instrumentation is powerful. I especially loved the hardinger (the solo violin-type instrument) featured in &quot;Riders of Rohan&quot; and &quot;Helm's Deep.&quot; <BR>   The focus of The Two Towers is the story of Men, in particular the Men of Rohan, and their themes manage to reach the very heart of what Tolkien was writing about. It was sort of like a flash of complete clarity when I heard the music-&quot;That's it! That's what Tolkien meant!&quot; <BR>   My one complaint about the album is Emiliana Torrini's voice in the beautiful &quot;Gollum's Song.&quot; Somehow, her voice isn't quite right to me, but don't let that deter you from buying the album.
B000002BQK|3.0|I'd say this album marks Mariah starting to descend downwards and since \\"Butterfly\\", things have been getting worse and worse.<BR>I don't think \\"Butterfly\\" is awful, but it isn't really an amazing effort for someone who used to be excellent. One of the real low points of the album is the usage of hazy and quite frankly awful vocals (she seems to keep changing from powerful to quiet mode and it really gets annoying).<BR>Here's my review of each track:<br />Honey-8/10- Good dance track although it heavily depends upon its samples.<BR>Butterfly-10/10- Excellent and original sounding ballad which has very beautiful lyrics.<BR>My All- 7/10- The remixes were much better but still sounding quite good. Another typical Mariah ballad.<BR>The Roof-8/10- Very nice sounding upbeat track but once again it depends too much on another song.<BR>Fourth Of July- 4/10- Annoying vocals and boring, not to mention sounding exactly the same as \\"Underneath The Stars\\" from Daydream<BR>Breakdown- 6/10- Sounds like Bone Thugs N Harmony's \\"Crossroads\\"<BR>and is ok.<BR>Babydoll-2/10- Bland mid tempo r and b track. There's nothing interesting about it.<BR>Close My Eyes- 9/10- Top notch ballad which reminds us why we did have hope in Mariah.<BR>Whenever You Call- 9/10- As the last song.<BR>Fly Away- 3/10- A desperate attempt to make a lame dance track.<BR>The Beautiful Ones- 5/10- Dru Hill is much more suited to this track and therefore it seems out of place here. <BR>Outside- 7/10- Very \\"Hero\\" sounding but by no means a bad ballad.
B000002H97|4.0|Metallica's self-titled album was a shot in the dark for me. I bought it because I love Apocalyptica and wanted to hear the originials of some of their songs. I ended up pretty much a new Metallica fan, and find myself singing to the Apo songs now-by the by, I recommend Apocalyptica to Metallica fans also-and I found some awesome new songs. I love especially \\"Wherever I May Roam,\\" \\"The Unforgiven,\\" \\"Nothing Else Matters,\\" \\"Sad But True,\\" \\"My Friend of Misery,\\" and the non-Apo songs \\"The God that Failed,\\" and \\"Of Wolf and Man.\\" The last two are really amazing, and \\"Of Wolf and Man\\" borders on downright creepy at times.
B0000028VT|5.0|This is definitely one of my favourite Mariah albums and it was the biggest selling (over 20 million sales worldwide).<BR>Back in 93 when this was released, Mariah was the most loved diva in the USA and she made decent ballads and dance tracks (unlike today). One warning though; if you don't like very slow tracks then stay away!<BR>Here's my track reviews:<br />Dreamlover-9/10-Excellent and uplifting dance track.<BR>Hero- 10/10- Incredible ballad with 5 star singing and thoughful lyrics.<BR>Anytime You Need A Frind- 9/10- Gospel influenced track which is supported by an excellent melody and a brilliant sounding choir.<BR>Music Box- 9/10- Very slow but a beautiful, spine tingling ballad.<BR>Now That I Know- 8/10- Not a highlight but a good enough dance track.<BR>Never Forget you- 9/10- Babyface production works very well in this upbeat ballad.<BR>Without You- 10/10- A cover version that's actually better than the original! Very dramatic vocals but isn't that what divas do best??<BR>Just To Hold You Once Again-9/10- Yet another haunting ballad that you'll remember over the dull efforts of &quot;Glitter&quot;.<BR>I've Been Thinking About You- 6/10- The least interesting track album and is reasonably boring.<BR>All I've Ever Wanted- 8/10- Not best but still a credible ballad.<BR>Everything Fades Away- 11/10- I don't know if this is on the US version but its absolutely amazing! Not too slow or fast, just a mid tempo ballad but it sounds so good! If you don't get it on the album download it or something!
B00006JJ1O|5.0|Just like the others t.A.T.u's CDs, I don't even have words to tell how perfect this CD is. All the songs are great, without exception and the best thing is that the lyrics really say something. And as much alike as they sound, each one of them had a special touch to give and make this CD even more wonderful!!
B000005843|4.0|For an album that was released nearly ten years ago, you can't help but be amazed at the brutality and quality of the production on this disc. Not only is the production clear, but this is very easily the heaviest, hardest music released by Bolt Thrower, only possibly rivaled by their \\"IVth Crusade\\" album.<br />With \\"...For Victory\\", Bolt Thrower refined their sound even more while not sacrificing any of its hard-hitting nature. Starting with the first track and lasting all the way through, \\"...For Victory\\" provides an aural assault that won't let down. It is also nice to hear a death metal album that forsakes the traditional Satanic references and focuses more on down-to-earth issues such as the horrors of war and the jeopardy created by weapons of mass destruction. Plus, not only is a fantastic war metal disc, but this album easily rivals more recent war metal acts such as Amon Amarth and Bloodthorn, and to think that this album pre-dates the best releases by those other bands by a number of years!<br />For those of you interested in great death metal with superb musicianship and themes of war, look no further than Bolt Thrower's \\"...For Victory\\". Very highly recommended!<br />PS - If you like this album, then you should really also check out Bloodthorn's release \\"Under The Reign of Terror\\". It's more excellent war metal, though maybe not as fast all the way through as this release.

B00004R99L|5.0|I've seen countless other versions of Lewis Carrol's Alice In Wonderland, but none have stood out in my mind like that of the brilliance of Walt Disney. True, this is not as true to the pages of the books as other adaptations are, but it is by far the most fun. Other versions I've seen such as Tina Morojano's '97 film and '99's excuse for an animated extravaganza, are just to long, unentertaining,and utterly boring. The most important scences and characters are here, accompanied by the always excellent Disney songs, &quot;All in a Golden Afternoon,&quot; and &quot;The Unbirthday Song&quot; So go ahead, get a little curious and buy Disney's masterpiece, &quot;Alice and Wonderland.
B00005QIPH|5.0|i thought it was a very good cd   to all thoes people who are saying it is fake and they have no talent, you should look into them.  They never started out trying to sound like anyone.  They never had any sort of great tallent.  Julian was writting some of these songs when he was just learning to play the guitar and he could only play on one string.  How do you expect them to be able to compare to some of the greatest rock legends.  I think that this is a very very good cd with very catchy songs and i would like to see anyone try to do anything better if they are barely learning play the guitar.  It is also true that they are \\"rich kids\\" but so what.  If you base your thought of thier music on thier backround then you have problems.  They went to the rich school and they were outcasts.  They were their own frieds and they all eventually dropped out.  I say screw you to all thoes people who say that they are fakes.  They worked very had to get where they are and they diserve to be where they are.  They are not asking for all the hype.
B00005OAIE|5.0|*Listen up! I have been a JM fan for quite a long time now, before he became popular, and i just have to say that he is one of the most talented, true, real artists of our time. This guy is going to be around for a while! He has honest lyrics that are deep yet light hearted and it's totally easy to listen to. If you haven't purchases RFS yet, i highly reccommend it. Plus he also &quot;inside wants out&quot;, a more acustic album that lets his guitar abilities shine. *
B00005JKZT|5.0|What is up with people writing a review of a trailer? How helpful is that? I have seen the movie twice, and read the books more times than I can count. (I think it's 13)<br />This movie is an unparalleled (except for the first movie) visual achievement. It is breathtaking, and truly transports you to middle-earth just as the first film did. I give this movie five stars with two small reservations.<br />First, Jackson took a lot of liberties with the story this time. I thought his decisions were right on, and made for a better movie than if he'd been truer than the book. Some things work much better on the page than the screen and vice versa. But purists beware! This is not the book on the big screen.<br />Second, I think that even more than the first movie, you need to have read the books to really appreciate it. Some of the nice touches that made fans jump in their seats for joy will not be such a big deal to the non-fan: things like (POTENTIAL SPOILERS AHEAD) Aragorn listening to the ground, Legolas and Gimli having an \\"orc-killing\\" contest, Oliphaunts, and Ents. The Ents struck me as very wooden characters however. Okay, get it...wooden? You can stop laughing and read on, now, that was a joke. I think it's astonishing that just about every line from Gollum is straight from the book.<br />The movie-stealer is Gollum. I had to pinch myself to remember at times that this was not a real person on screen. Even close up, he was very convincing. True, there was something in the eyes that was not totally life-like, but I was totally hooked, not like Yoda and Jar-Jar (who must die, by the way) this was a real character. Andy Serkis, who set the movement for the character and the voice, deserves special recognition. Although we don't see his face in this movie, he is the best actor in it.<br />Aragorn is really turning into the regal King he needs to become for the third movie to really work, and Legolas and Gimli are awesome too, although i'd like to see more of their friendship growing. Oh, well, maybe in ROTK.<br />Sam has become quite the adventurer, but Frodo shows almost no growth in this movie. Let's be fair, I don't think he shows much growth in the book, either.<br />And I know everyone might disagree with me here, but I don't know how necessary the opening scene is. I don't think it was necessary to revisist the Balrog scene (cool to see it from completely different camera angles, though, wasn't it...) especially since when Gandalf returns as Gandalf the White we revisit it for a moment anyway. Those precious minutes could've been re-allocated to the friendship of Gimli and Legolas or something. I know they were trying to keep the movie under 3 hours, probably at the (correct) insistence of New Line.<br />Stop reading these reviews, though, and go see it. These are films that deserve to be enjoyed, and on the big screen, more than once if you can. Alas, this appears to be only my second favorite movie of all time, though. I think I liked FOTR a touch more. But that's like saying I like The Godfather a touch more than The Godfather Part II, or that I liked Blue a little more than Red or White, or Army of Darkness more than Evil Dead 2. You get the picture.endship growing. Oh, well, maybe in ROTK.<br />Sam has become quite the adventurer, but Frodo shows almost no growth in this movie.

B00005JKZT|4.0|I loved the movie.  If you want to know what the movie did right, read the hundreds of other reviews.  They're probably all correct.  The action scenes were fantastic, the music was engaging, and the movie itself was great.<br />All of this was also true of the Fellowship of the Rings movie, however, and Peter Jackson stayed true to the novel with few exceptions, such as Arwen taking Frodo to Rivendell.  This particular change was so female movie-goers wouldn't feel so left out.<br />Unfortunately, Jackson abandons his dedication towards authenticity in favor of his own revisions this time around.  In the middle of the movie, a twenty-minute segment shows up that will not be found in any version of the book.  The scenes prominently feature three characters who aren't even in the Two Towers book.<BR>*Spoilers*<BR>Twenty minutes of Arwen, Elrond, and Galadriel that had no purpose except to let those viewers who for whatever reason thought the Lord of the Rings was a love story have their moments of happiness, and maybe so Jackon could have those actors in all three movies.  The only other purpose of the segment was to provide of a reason for a few hundred Elven archers to show up at Helm's Deep.  <br />Mr. Jackon, if you're going to add elements to the story, you don't have to spend an eighth of the movie setting up for it.  <br />There were numerous other new things (Aragorn going off the cliff, a shameless copy of the gunpowder-\\"keep that candle away\\" scene from Army of Darkness, and the Uruk-hai's use of World War I seamines.  All of these are fine.  Really, they are.  They make the movie more dramatic, give it style.  In my opinion, it's an acceptable transition from book to movie.  The twenty minute segment though...ugh.<br />It's a great movie, but I am of the people who read the book long before this movie was announced.  I couldn't help walking out of the theater with a little bit of disappointment.

0151008116|4.0|The fantastic story of a young man's (Pi) survival at sea after a shipwreck in which his family perished. In the boat with Pi is a zebra with a broken leg, a jackal, an orang utan and a Bengal tiger. After a short while there is only Pi and the tiger called Richard Parker. Their struggle to stay alive during the almost seven months it takes to reach Mexico is a story of animals and life and how we all learn to accommodate each other. It is a story rich in metaphor and humor. Pi, a practicing Christian, Muslim and Hindu has found incredible ways to love God with all his soul. He finds nothing exclusive about these religions and that each one worships the one true God.<br />The story is not the story but a medium for Martel to reflect on life's vagaries and illuminate a deep religious conviction that cuts through the meaninglessness of most lives. I enjoyed the book on many levels. I give it a 4.5/5
0812550706|5.0|Ender's game is a wonderful book full of adventure, love, friendship and courage. It's all about a young six year old boy who has a genius, but agressive brother, and loving, kind and genius sister.... which of coruse makes him in between. He is taken from his house and set to a planet to train to fight the buggers (Aliens). This book is full of excitment... and i promise everyone will love it. At first i thought it soulded stupid, and i really didn't like it, but 10 pages later i declared it was my favorite book, and now i'm trying to get everyone to read it.
B00005J6UP|5.0|The Goonies to this day is still one of my avorites! This is just an awesome movie! It starts out that Mikey (a young Sean Astin) finds out that they have to move because a rich man is buying up their house and putting a golf course down in it's place. <br />While haning out with his friends Mouth (Corey Feldman), Data (Ke Huy Quan) and Chunk (Jeff Cohen), they find a map of their town and on the map it says there is buried treasure. Mikey then gets the idea that if they found the treasure, they wouldn't have to leave! In a wild and crazy adventure from hiding from the criminal family the Fratelli's, who want that treasure too, to dodging booby traps to some good old laughs, this is a great family comedy movie that will entertain the entire family.<br />Now there is some swearing and sexual humor in this movie but it's very minute compared to some of the things these days. It's almost a timeless classic that you'll never get bored of. Pick up this movie and enjoy!

B00006JJ1O|5.0|I rarely buy albums because it's usually only a couple tracks that drives you to buy them in the first place.  After downloading their tracks from the net to check it out (all now deleted I must add!) I decided to order their album.  I must admit to preferring the Russian version best as it seems more traditional Russian than English dance music.  After having to put up with UK's fabricated bands &amp; charts t.A.T.u's music is welcome with open arms.  Future albums will be bought straight away as will all single releases.  All I need to do now is find somewhere I can order the Russian version from.  These girls, even though they're *not* lesbians (who cares anyway?) are going to take the globe by storm!
B0000020T3|3.0|This album gets off to a great start with the amazing title track -- you'd think that a solid proto-punk album influenced by British invasion bands was on the way. Well, the sound was certainly influenced by the bands of the British invasion, but not for the better. The Groovies go on to mimic the Beatles on just about every song, finally covering the \\"Misery\\" near the end of the album. It's not unlistenable by any means, but it's not original, either. Everyone should be familiar with the first song, but the ones that follow are less memorable.

B00005JL78|5.0|&quot;Is it now?&quot; a dazed seer asks Tom Cruise's rogue cop in &quot;Minority Report.&quot; Viewers may well wonder the same thing during the sensational DVD presentation of Steven Spielberg's futuristic film noir.<br />The movie itself coolly transports viewers to a world 52 years ahead -- Spielberg's paranoid vision of life in the nation's capital seems not only possible, but probable at times.<br />Then there are the filmmaking techniques demonstrated on the DVD by the director's effects visionaries -- so cutting edge and visually startling that they seem right out of the movie itself.<br />The first disc (dual layer) contains only the film, no director's commentary. Director Spielberg has his say on the second (single layer) disc, which has a generous selection of bonus materials that are well organized and to the point. Menus have the nightmarish look of the &quot;precog&quot; visions that the film's cops use to predict and halt murders.<br />Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski's other-worldly color scheme -- achieved via an unconventional &quot;bleach bypass&quot; on the negative stock -- comes across with all of its unsettling power. Blacks seem devoid of light, full of despair. The cobalt blues saturate the images, evoking the specter of a locked-and-loaded police state.<br />The DTS and Dolby Digital 5.1 sound are typical of Spielberg's DVDs, with an upfront bias and subdued directional effects. The chilling subwoofer bottom keeps listeners on edge.<br />The featurette compilation opens and closes with Spielberg and Cruise exchanging superlatives (the package actually has a beginning, middle and end). Spielberg talks about how &quot;A.I.&quot; and &quot;Minority Report&quot; fit into his midlife vision quest. The director explains his &quot;dirty, ugly&quot; take on the future of U.S. society.<br />Wisely, most of the extras focus on the effects wizards and craftsmen who realized this future world. DVD content specialist Laurent Bouzereau keeps the featurettes moving along, with little time for the specialists to become tangled up in their thoughts. Fast-paced editing keeps the screen shots and on-set clips fresh.ettes moving along, with little time for the specialists to become tangled up in their thoughts.

0316666343|5.0|The Lovely Bones is on my top ten list for good... I was searching for a new book to read and everwhere I looked, this one seemed to keep popping up. I picked it up to check it out and couldn't put it down. The characters are easy to connect to and the story is very touching. All of the different character's perspectives of one tragic even make the story an all-encompassing journey to understand the meaing of life, family, and love. I loved this book! Read it!!
B000002HRE|1.0|(sigh) Well, the \\"mighty\\" Metallica have done it again. Yes, they've gone into the studio and took a great big dump, recorded it, and named it \\"Reload\\". It's funny, you hear all these Nu-metal kids out there who make excuses for Metallica and try to convince everybody that they've \\"grown\\" or \\"matured\\" when in reality, Metallica got old, fat, & lazy. Or they say, that they've sacrificed music for lyrics, excuse me...the Metallica that I loved would have never (and did not) sacrifice EITHER! I recall a drummer who once said in a Modern Drummer interview from the \\"Justice\\" days saying \\"I don't ever want to be a drummer who just sits in the background and counts to 4, I don't think Metallica will ever be that kind of band\\" Well, guess what Lars...that's you, buddy! This album is more of the same boring, mid-paced-at-best, barely-irritated (much less angry), yawn- worthy tripe. The lyrics are childish and something that I could've wrote when I was in junior high \\"Give me fuel, give me fire, give me that which I desire oooo-yeah-heh!\\" Come on, give me a break. You want some real deep and meaningful lyrics? How about \\"Disposable Heroes\\"? \\"How about And Justice For All\\"? These songs were written back in the day when Metallica not only could write music that blasted you in the face, but lyrics that actually MEANT something that was worth saying.  In other words...they CARED back then. Now they're super-rich and they don't have to care. Trust me, if you want to hear the REAL Metallica, buy one of their first 4 CD's. If all you want to hear is Kirk do ten more of those cheap wah-pedal solos, or hear James say yeah-yeah, or ooo-yeah, or whoa-yeah or whatever and sing about nascar or some other lame subject, buy this one right away! Can't wait for the next one-oooo-yeah-yeah!!!
B000002H33|5.0|This is one of the greatest albums in history.  Though it did not start thrash(kill em all-show no mercy did) and it is not as famous as the black album-it is the best.  Mettalica has faster riffs, and is better than megadeath by far.  Faster and catchier than Anthrax, and maby a little more organized and better composed than slayer (though only very slightly better) and more classic than at the gates. I am not that big a thrash fan, i like death more, but i listen to this album about once a week.  Every track is solid.  The guitar solos by Mike are good, the vocals match the music, and the backing vocals do to.  There is good drumming, and the songs are long as all mettalica songs.  Here is how i would rank them<br />Battery--great opening songone of there best, but not as good as blackened-i'd give it--8 1/3<br />Master of Puppets--amazing song, great chorus, great guitar solo, fun lyrics-one of there best five songs-i'd give it--9 2/3<br />The Thing That Should Not Be--repetitive, good lyrics, cathchy riff, alover good song-i'd give it-- 8 <br />Sanitarium- One fo the best on the album-great chorus-good 2 guitar acoustic intro-shows the real power of composition of mettalica emotionally-sort of a moody song-quite different from the thing that should not be-about the quality of sanitariums--id give it 9 <br />Disposable Heros--WOW-amazing-really a great song, catchy riff-but most of all amazingly catchy vocals, the lyrics are about what it is like to be a soldier-long-and the chorus(back to the front) is goodone of there least recognized songs as a great-and under-rated-id give it a-- 9 1/2<br />Leper Messiah-- from this song until the end it is not as good as the first five, and because i do not listen to it half as much its fun sometimes to play this song-cool lyrics, great vocals but the guitar playing is not as good as in other mettalica songs-i'd give it--8<br />Orion--I don't have anything against instrumentals-but this song is by far the worst on the album-it is just sort of boring, a few solos but nothing really that fast-and vocals in mettalica songs are huge parts of the music--i'd have to say--5 3/4<br />Damage Inc.-- O Yeah-good song not exactly the best on the album but it is the heaviest.  I don't listen to this very often but it is worthy of listenings-not as good vocals-and not as catchy guitar playing, but this is the only song on the album tha all the members of thr band worked on the music composition together, not looked back on as a great song-i'd give it--7 1/2<br />If you add up and average thee scores my average rating forr the songs is 8 1/5- but Master of Puppets, Sanitarium, and Disposoble Heroes are incredible songs.
B00005UW7V|1.0|Despite this movie's fantastic effects and stunning visuals, this movie is absolutely horrible.  Following the doomed life of a boy robot, this story continues inexorably towards an unsatisfactory ending.

There are some particularly disturbing and heart-wrenching scenes, but even these moments are not enough to make the movie worthwhile.

I mean if you are a poser stick to slipknot so we won't have.... people liking metal, but if you just are starting to lke metal, and also like good thrash check ou the Haunted.
B0000042MY|5.0|Often when I view a movie, I find that either the soundtrack is what makes it or breaks it. A fine film and a lousy soundtrack equals a mediocre movie. Not so in this case. I was enthralled by the music when I watched the movie.  But the real test comes when you listen to the soundtrack without the film. Can it stand on its own as a composition?  I have heard some people complain of repetition in this soundtrack.  There are two main themes which are indeed repeated throughout the movie.  What I find fascinating and truely delightful is the manner in which the two themes are interwoven to create a musical tapestry. As the soundtrack progresses, there is a sense of ascending until at last the composition comes to climax which is breathtaking.<br />I found it to be a wonderful work of art with or without the film. It is one of the most beautiful soundtracks I have heard.
B000002BE9|4.0|The girl has a *great* voice, the best lyrics around, and some out-and-out fabulous songs.  She is edgy and Blue-sy and can rock as well. Many of her songs are in the Blues tradition and she sings them skillfully and soulfully.  My favories, however, are the angry ones that she belts out with everything she's got.

Im a Huge Pac Fan, and i Like NAS / and a little jigga, but im not gonna buy this album.  And some of these songs, i already have.  and some that haven't been released.  I totally agree with the other guy. Instead of this album, buy \\"Until the End of Time\\"!!
B00005JLRR|5.0|This was a good movie.  The starship battle scenes were well done and Picard had to fight a formidable foe.  But the central message of the movie -- that we are the product of a life experience rather than our genes could not have been better illustrated.  Picard has to fight a clone of himself who grew up in a horrible environment.  <br />In other words the movie is about making yourself better despite your bad upringing.  But there is a problem with that -- how can you make yourself better if you don't know what is wrong with you?  Or if you are about to die?  Picard's \\"brother\\" does not have a family, and so there is no legacy.  Thus there is nothing really to pass on.  His death means nothing because his life is meaningless.  <br />If we try to better ourselves, we have to do it for a purpose.
B00005YUPO|5.0|I really like these videos. My daughter is 28-month's old and diagnosed with autism. She will only sit for 10 minutes to Book of Pooh, The Wiggles, Rolie Polie Olie and Kipper videos. I thought I'd give these a try after all I've read about them in children's magazines. I think the best two in this series is the animal ones: Neighborhood and World Animals, but Baby Bach is very good as well. <br />In this video there are toys in motion to Bach's music. The toys are stuffed animals, trains, action toys. The motion of the toys fits very well to the music, which is superb. I am surprised my daughter will sit the entire 25 minutes to this tape. I think the quality of these Baby Einstein videos is remarkable. There are two young children in this video along with a few puppets. Not as many puppets as in later Baby Einstein films though. We really enjoy this tape and it is of very high quality.
0446677450|4.0|Be warned, Experts who invest in real estate and stocks will not find this book much useful because it dosen't give specific step by step instructions on how to do advanced deals .  But rather, it's a great book for beginners who don't have one penny in the bank or any investing sense.  It's a pretty easy read with many very clever analogies added in plus amazingly simple charts to follow.  It gives readers a sense how other people work their money rather working a 9 to 5 job.   Even if you never do anything with the advice in this book, it is still a good read.
B0000024PC|5.0|Look<br />(1) You cannot beat that album cover, which Bruce even ripped off for his \\"Darkness at the Edge of Town\\" LP in 1979.<br />(2) There is nothing around any better for feeling great than David Grusin's \\"Sunporch Cha cha Cha\\".  I think I've played this a gazillion times since I was a child in '67. Priceless.  Always reminds me of naughty Mrs. Robinson in her leopard print mini skirt ever-so-anxious to seduce Benjamin.<br />(3) That 8 minute version of \\"Scarborough Fair\\"... almost trance, neo-ambient!<br />(4) Priceless that so many 'consumeroids' were duped into buying this strange soundtrack to hear \\"Mrs. Robinson\\", and all they got were some temp tracks when the song was barely a sketch for the \\"Bookends\\" LP to follow.<br />(5) \\"The Folks\\" is great Goodbye-to-the-age-of-Martini music.  So, bring back the MARTINi!<br />April Come She Will.
0671775308|2.0|I thought this book could have been done in one chapter.<br />I own this book.  The main things this book points out to you are:<br />1.  The average millionaire get rich by owning a business <BR>2.  They are very frugal and save every penny.<BR>3.  They want their children to be a doctor, lawyer or other high paying professions because they know how hard it is to survive in the business they are in.<br />Throw in a bunch of statistics and you have the book called &quot;The Milionaire Next Door&quot;<br />Now that you have already read everything the book has to offer, don't buy it.
B00005JKZT|5.0|Not having seen the first movie, I was a little hesitant to dive into the second, but within minutes of the beginning of the film, I was swept away.  Lost!  Enraptured!  And totally entertained.  I didn't realize how long the film was so my advise to ALL women...  don't drink too much before or during the film!  You won't want to leave, even for a moment!  Enjoy!
B00000JCOV|5.0|This is a fantastic CD from start to finish.  It is difficult to find a band with a sound as original and as unforgiving as Slipknot.  With MTV and the radio bogged down with trendy bands such as Limp Bizkit and or the new punk garbage like Sum 41, Slipknot is like a breath of fresh air.  The lead singer, Corey Taylor, (also of Stone Sour) can yell, scream, and also sing beautifully.  Some may criticize that his lyrics are only composed of the 'my life sucks' and the 'f the world' themes, but if one takes a deeper look, he will find a great deal more than that.  Taylor's lyrics are intelligent and eloquent, and he does a badass job.  Joey Jordison (also of Murderdolls) is one of the most amazing drummers I have ever heard.  The supporting cast of guitarists, percussionists, a sampler and a dj make their sound unlike any other band.<br />If you are looking for something with a serious edge or something with originality, look no further.
B00005JLWL|5.0|This movie is absolutely spectacular.  It's intelligently done, it's got lots of cool action, it's got good music, it's got good dialogue, and it doesn't insult the intelligence of the audience.  The acting by Christian Bale couldn't have been more perfect.  I've seen the movie three times so far and have loved it every time.  The action scenes are definitely the coolest thing in the movie.  The gun battles in this movie are ART. Yes, ART.  You have to see it to understand what I'm telling you.
B00004T9UF|5.0|That's exactly what this album is. Eminem is one of my favorite rappers. I like the stuff he be rappin about cuz some of it's funny as  while other songs be more serious. If another white rapper came on the scene, he wouldn't touch Eminem cuz Em is original...I like this album better than his last one \\"Slim Shady LP,\\" but nonetheless, Eminem is hot!
B0000035E7|4.0|Nirvana. The new kids. If they were lucky, they may have been invited to SUPPORT the Melvins at this stage. I'm listening to it now. What I hear is a raw, fresh, exciting band set loose in the studio to do a full length album for the first time. What I hear is a pure love for the music, when the sound of a guitar turned up to 10 was still exciting. This is Nirvana, at the often-forgotten stage of time when they were STRIVING for success...when the only thing they had was the music. I'm loving what I hear.<br />Even though this is a 'baby' form of Nirvana, I can still hear Kurt's brilliant songwriting through all of the noise. Yes, it's raw- but you have to look past that. It's raw without being, say, 'Scratch Acid' dirty. It's as far into pop because of the songwriting as it is into metal because of the heaviness- but it isn't fully dictated by either of them.<br />Get it, put it on, and imagine you were there. Before any of the media hype, before any of the commercial success. It is the music that is first and foremost here.
B00003CXBH|5.0|&quot;The Mission&quot; is an uncredible movie, that we have been looking for in the United States, in Mexico, in Europe, even in South America where it was filmed, and we can't believe that such a master piece is not published yet on DVD. We're looking forward to know when will u have it, please let me know when can I buy it.
0345413377|5.0|A whole series based on \\"Paradise Lost\\" by Milton, a Seventeenth Century epic peom. Amazing right? Yes, it is. This is the best book that my eyes have ever laid on to words. It's wonderful, dark, intruiging, intimidating and you just cannot put the book down in fear that you will never live to read the rest and find out what happens. Amazing story!
B00003CXA6|5.0|This heroic tale of the three days of the battle of Gettysburg give you the apprecation of where you are from.  Starring Martin Sheen, Jeff Daniels,  and Tom Berenger, you will be pulled into the tale of the bloddiest battle ever fought on American Soil.  It's the Summer of 1863 and the Confederacey pushes north into Pennsylvania, the Federalists running a parallel path only to soon realize they are going to clash and meet at a small hill in the small town where all roads meet. Gettysburg.  Based on the book the Killer Angels,  Ron Maxwell, and Rob Katz make sure to tell the real story of what happened those three dark days in July.  You will enjoy this great story of freedom and learn how the one Idea of the Confederacy and the idea of freedom of the Federalists brought us to where we are today. &quot;One Nation under God Indivisable with Liberty and Justice for All.&quot;
B00007B6RW|5.0|Pink has broke out of her old album and shown her fans a deeper side to herself with this new rocking CD. Songs like Mean Green Lets get this party started are two of the best songs on the CD. If your looking for a deeper song then Family Portrait is the song to tune in to. The song deals with divorce and the feelings going along with it. My personal fav from the CD is Family Portrait. Great CD, all the songs are golden. Pink has shown her true colors and boy are they nice!
B00000099Y|5.0|this album is perfect-period. musically and lyrically no other album from any other band or tool album,(especially lateralus-which is awful)can surpass Aenima.  Anyone who says that Lateralus is a better album needs to get their head checked.  Like all great albums, Aenima grows on you.  I have had it for three years and it gets better every time I listen to it.  If you want an album that rocks, buy or burnany tool album, but if you want an album that you can listen to all the way through and that forces you to think, buy or burn Aenima
0783114222|1.0|This is not a documentary. It is a long movie based on actual events, obviously made by Americans. It has too much \\"gee whiz aren't these American guys just so neato?\\" thrown in for me to enjoy it. Though it may be a matter of pride that we got to the moon first, this volume is too maudlin and patriotic for me to enjoy it as a documentary, which is what I thought it was.
B00006LI4S|4.0|For Pink Floyd and David Gilmour fans out there, a note of caution: this concert has no lasers, no pyrotechnics, and no giant inflatable pigs. In fact, there's just David Gilmour, his acoustic guitar, and a few musicians. Nevertheless, the scaled down sound works for this selection of Pink Floyd songs, some covers, and a (surprisingly) few Dave Gilmour solo pieces. The additional performers - a cellist, an oboist, a small choir, and a pianist, among others - help lend a fresh feeling to the old Floyd standards, but it's the covers and solo pieces such as &quot;Hushabye Mountain&quot; and &quot;Smile&quot; that really shine. &quot;Je Crois Entendre Encore,&quot; from a Bizet opera, and the Richard Wright song &quot;Breakthrough&quot; (featuring the artist himself on piano and vocals) are worth the price of the disc alone, but if you need more there are some good extras and bonus songs to add icing to the cake.
B00007E8V4|5.0|I was a System fan since the first time I heard their self titled album.  To be honest, Toxicity dissapointed me slightly.  It seemed a bit to poppish, too mainstream oriented.  The beauty of the self titled was that it was just a few guys, who really didn't know too much about writing music, getting together and having fun.  They learned a lot of about technical musicianship for Toxicity, but I felt they lost that edge of 4 guys just having fun, the almost like the album was overthought.<br />Steal This Album is a warm return to the 4 guys just having a good time mentality, and even if most of the songs are left over from Toxicity, it seems like they were the more creative ones, rather than the mainstream oriented ones they used for Toxicity.  Then the taste of stuff even earlier than self titled like Roulette, and tracks from around the period of the self titled like Chick' N' Stu, is very refreshing.  While it still does not quite rival their self titled album in raw inhabition and passion, it is much more musically sound, and almost as good to listen to.
B00005TT77|3.0|With Beatles covers it is generally a matter of doing as little harm as possible, and some of the artists on here manage just fine. Ben Harper and Ben Folds do fine versions of &quot;Strawberry Fields&quot; and &quot;Golden Slumbers&quot;, respectively, and Rufus Wainwright is another high point. But Sheryl Crow's torturous rendition of &quot;Mother Nature's Son&quot; is mostly notable for her disgusting poppish slides into just about every note she sings, its ridiculous bubbliness, and the fact that that Crow brings little new to the song. Some of the artists do not seem to grasp the weight of the tunes, instead latching onto the happy feel-good qualities of the songs. And Nick Cave's Let it Be sounds not unlike a version I once heard played on NPR's &quot;Annoying Music Show.&quot; Even those songs which have been re-interpreted in ways that I personally do not like are better than those which are utterly devoid of imagination.
B00005R87Q|3.0|Hollywood produces movies that are dumb, and it also produces movies that are so outrageously silly that you can't help but like them, if only for a guilty pleasure.  &quot;The Fast and the Furious,&quot; the quintissential guy's flick, falls into the latter category.  In this meat-and-potatoes action film, the plot is inconsequential; the acting is wooden, and the stiff dialogue leaves no stone unturned in the cliche department.  Yet, the film is watchable mainly due to the amped-up racing scenes and the onscreen charisma of Vin Diesel, who easily eclipses the blank Paul Walker (who, strangely enough, gets top billing in this film).  To be sure, the beefed-up baldy Diesel is no actor by any stretch of the imagination, but his MetRx-enhanced frame and smoky barritone command virtually every scene he's in.  (This will work for a movie as vapid as this, but if he's not careful, he'll go the way of Jean Claude Van Damme if he doesn't prove himself as an actor.) But this isn't a film for everyone.  If you approach &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; on an intellectual level, then you'll think it's the worst movie ever made.  But if you can put your brain in &quot;park&quot; (the way most 14/15-year-olds seem to do when then watch films like this) and appreciate a great dumb movie, then this playfully trashy flick will pass your time nicely.
B00007BH5C|5.0|okay, this is in response to a review stating &quot;However, as one review noted, the music that accompanies the trailer is not found on the disc. This is probably because it is BLATANTLY stolen from the much better soundtrack to the great Requiem For a Dream.&quot;<br />Although the Requiem for a Dream soundtrack is indead great, it is vaguely repetitive...at any rate, I just thought I should point out that nearly EVERY film trailer uses music from other movies. soundtrack.net has a listing of what music was used. The only time music is ever used from the actual film is on sequels, or maybe the rare event of Harry Potter, which had music John Williams composed specifically for that trailer. So let's calm down.<br />The Two Towers soundtrack gets better with more listens. Although I agree it is not as emotionally charged as the first film's score, it is still great music.
0783230079|4.0|There is nothing in this movie that should be more than ordinary. It's sentimental. It's a tug on every heart string that's been tugged too often before. But it works. It works because of the grace and gracelessness of Robert Downey, Jr. in the lead role and because of his interaction with the ghosts who guide him to his enlightenment. Alfre Woodard (especially), Charles Grodin, Tom Sizemore and Kyra Sedgewick give Downey the life lessons he needs and find their own release. It's a sweet and lovely movie.
B00006CXXU|5.0|A huge accomplishment, this CD.  What a voice.  What sensuality.  Profound sentiment.  This CD is killer.  I predict a bunch of Grammies and other awards, serious legitimization across genre, cross-over everywhere, R&B, pop, jazzy, ooh the ballad, Cruz is my fav (after a Twain intro it moves into a gorgeously simple melody and then rocks--I wanted it to go on for a few more minutes), Get Mine is totally hot.  They'll compare this CD to Thriller.  You heard it here first.  Rocks out with Linda Perry edge.  She's smitten this 41 yr old married father of 3 and one time rock 'n roll drummer.  Not exactly the demographic she's out for but I won't share this with my 11 yr old daughter just yet.  She can't get it out of my hands.  Christina is for real.  She takes it right to the world with this CD.  The world will not be the same.  It must be great to be Christina right now.
B000075BFK|5.0|This is one of pac's best cd's that he has come out with over his carrer.  It has all different kinds of music on it, such as slowed down kind of music or the regular music that pac has.  In # 10 on the second cd, he states&quot; Expect me to come back as you expect Jesus to come back&quot;  Case Closed
B00006RU5B|4.0|Some of us are old enough to remember the hope and anticipation that surrounded the Bad Company/Zeppelin union.  I can remember waiting in line to buy the Firm release. As much as I tried to like it, I couldn't.  The music just seemed forced to me and its shallow vibe left me wanting.  I love both RATM and Soundgarden.  Always will.  Both still get regular play in my house.  Audioslave is much more than I expected. This is no VanHagar debacle thank God!   What more can I say?  I can't imagine any Soundgarden fan not falling for this. Not sure about the hardcocre Rageaholic though.  If you want to get that [angry] angst vibe you can always go listen to \\"todays\\" Rage - It's called System of a Down. <BR>Tim
6304416415|5.0|I dont know why, but I just feel like writing reviews for classic movies today. This was one of my first &quot;real&quot; movies(by real I mean like not kiddie), I was about... 6-7 when I first saw it, now I'm 18 &amp; I still love it to this day. I always enjoy watching it when I need a good laugh:). But yea, everyone can agree, it's very behind-the-times- the kid says &quot;Tubular!&quot; for cryin out loud! But so what? Oldies are goodies. The actress who played Amy is pretty hot too :).<br />DO NOT see the sequels- they are both horrible- Shrunk Ourselves doesnt even have any of the original cast other than Rick Moranis!
B00005JKCH|5.0|I THOUGHT THIS WAS A VERY WELL PRODUCED MOVIE.  THE SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE WONDERFUL.  THE MOVIE KEPT CLOSE TO THE STORY AND<BR>WAS VERY ENTERTAINING...........
B00006NSZ5|3.0|When buying this CD, you need to remember you are purchasing a soundtrack.  It isn't an Eminem album (unfortunatly).  The Jay-Z song is catchy and 50 cent is real good too.  The rest of the songs leave something to be desired.
B00005JJX8|3.0|The movie is an evergreen; Hitchcock with less twist and more romance.<br />  The DVD, that's something else.  Sound quality is so - so; but the pix, that's worse.  Not shown in the theatrical 2.35:1 Cinemascope format, such is never more evident than in the Hitchcock trademark scene !  The one early in the film on the bus when the camera pans left-to-right from the lady with the bird in the cage, past Cary Grant/John Roby to one-half (!) of Hitch sitting next to Roby.  The pan'n-scan 4:3 version at least gets all of Hitchcock's dead pan on the screen.<br />  With so many lesser works getting better technical treatment, it is disappointing that the publisher didn't make a better effort; guess they cried all the way to the bank !
B00005JKCH|5.0|I recived this DVD for Christmas.The movie is rated PG-13. It is everything you want in a DVD.It is for evry kind of person. I'll watch this movie AGAIN and AGAIN.
B000000H3W|4.0|Arise was Sepultura's breakthrough in America, after building a strong fan base through touring and receiving substantial airplay on headbanger's ball. Many rank this as their magnum opus, and while it is a solid display of chugging midpace riffs, there is very little diversity between songs, and many of them run together. Sepultura's 'black album'? Not quite, that honor belongs to Chaos A.D. This is not to say that Arise is a commerical copout or anything short of metal, but the aggression and intensity of Beneath the Remains and Schitzophrenia is less prevalent. <br />Arise benefits from an ace production job, and one of the best opening tracks in metal history: the title track, a thrashterpiece through and through. Dead Embryonic Cells (check out that breakdown... yeah!) and Desperate Cry (my personal favorite) follow up admirably, but the remainder is more or less the same song 6 times over. It does seem that they had exhausted their formula and were running out of riffs. <br />The historical importance of Arise as Sepultura's final stand before incorporating industrial and tribal elements into their music magnifies the music's worth, and I suppose it carries a nostalgic vibe for those who were there. I still pull it out (mainly for those crucial first 3 tracks) every now and then and it gets the head bangin.<br />The bonus tracks are fairly good, especially the cover of Orgasmatron and CIU
B00005MP58|3.0|The current BluRay (BD) edition is fantastic - it is the \\"Extra Special Edition\\". Beautiful color and sound have been restored compared to the DVD edition that I initially reviewed in 2002 (below). There's pretty much nothing about my original review that is relevant any longer, unless someone is going to buy a second-hand copy of the 1996 Special Edition set. We still love the production, and give the BD version 5 stars.<br /><br />I would not have thought that anyone would still be reading the 9 year old review below except for all of the comments ... apparently Amazon has cross-linked the reviews of all editions of this film, making this the 'most helpful critical review'.  For those who said that I copied the review - not true. I reviewed a single product, back when we did not even have names attached to our reviews.  (My amazon review ID now is \\"Karl\\".)<br /><br />Do buy the BD release - it is wonderful.  Five stars.  (The 3 stars are not editable and refer to the 1996 release.)<br /><br />Karl<br /><br />------------------------------<br />The original 2002 review of the 1996 Special Edition DVD set follows...<br /><br />This BBC/A&E production is one of the most well made films my wife and I have ever seen - superb acting, costumes, sets and location, music, directing, editing!!  Like others here, we have watched the A&E VHS edition over and over.  (It is a 'chick flick', but I enjoy romantic movies, too.)<br /><br />Our excitement over getting the DVD faded upon loading both the VHS tape and DVD and comparing the images and sound. The widescreen image on the DVD is definitely more clear on our 50\\" high res screen, and it is a pleasure to see the full images framed as the Director intended.<br /><br />HOWEVER, the colors are not just washed out.  The digital remastering has changed the color tone of the film as if someone used a Photoshop/Premier digital filter without knowing what they were doing.  The VHS and original not only had rich color saturation, but also had a warm tone that felt 'right' with the period film.  The DVD is not only washed out, but has a strong blue-white tone to it that gives a cold modern feel to the scenes.<br /><br />To get the image to look close to decent on our TV, I had to turn the color saturation up as far as it would go, bring the contrast down and the brightness up.  It then almost matched the VHS images except for the blue-ish rather than warm overall cast.<br /><br />The sound is tinny, much of the lower frequencies that are on the VHS sound track being chopped off.<br /><br />There are no subtitles at all (we frequently turn them on for other DVDs when we cannot quite make out the dialog) - much less alternative language tracks.<br /><br />So, why is this edition 'Special'?  The only additions, other than the abysmal digital remastering (digital destruction) are:<br />(1) an 8-page booklet (that mentions only 3 of the actors)<br />(2) some text-only biography screens, that mention only 2 of the actors<br />(3) a 20-some minute 'making of' feature that gives the producer most of the credit (and she did of course put the team together, but the director/editor/actors/choreographer/costumers/etc produced the art) - and which still only visits with 4 of the actors - out of this tremendously talented cast.<br /><br />What was supposed to be a 'special' Christmas gift, ended up being a tremendous disappointment. We can only hope that A&E and BBC will produce an 'Extra Special' edition that gets the color and sound back to the director's intention (did he even get to review this DVD?).  That, and a rebate for all of us who bought this defective edition, would make us happy enough.  Adding subtitles, profiles of everyone else involved in the production, and stills of the various homes, heritage buildings and towns used would be (delicious, but optional) gravy.m.

B0000666DW|5.0|Relapse Records seems to have it's finger of the pulse of everything that is pushing the boundaries of intensity in today's metal scene. From the over the top grind of PxDx and Agoraphobic Nosebleed to these guys, the aptly titled Mastodon, they sure know to pickem. <br />One part Dillinger Escape Plan, the other part Kyuss, Mastodon are uncomprisingly heavy, yet they still manage to make dynamic and memorable music. &quot;Dynamic&quot; is the key word here... &quot;aesthetics&quot; would be another one. Mastodon shift from texture to texture flawlessly, creating soundscapes that bring to (my) mind cosmic planes, windtorn deserts, and other such imagery. Musically, they use dense riffage and intricate signatures to the fullest, without sounding too frenetic... in fact, it is possible not to notice their technicality on the first listen, a result of their ace songwriting. <br />The most extraordinary thing about Mastodon, however, is their drummer, Brann Dailor. Holy cow, this guy tears up the kit on this one, dropping mind boggling fills and snare tricks almost every few seconds. The Remission is one of the only albums I own (tool's lateralus is another..) where it's easy to pay more attention to the drums than the band as a whole . THAT is how good this guy is... his cymbal work is commendable as well. <br />I don't know if I would use &quot;stoner rock&quot; to describe Mastodon, but the droning guitar tone and penchant for ear candy does nothing to revoke it. If you dig on the whole Relapse scene you should have no trouble falling for Mastodon... excellent band.
B00003CXXM|3.0|An entertaining piece in its own right, but a rather large departure from the book.  Fans of the book will be dissapointed, mostly.  For anyone who has seen the movie, read the book.  I enjoyed both respective of their origins, and am of the opinion that this is a quality movie with good acting and action.
B000001A3H|5.0|This is the album that put Kyuss on the map back in 91, the fuzzed out meisterwork that spawned a million imitators and turned young children across the country onto generator powered, marijuana fueled grooves of the southern california desert. Although I prefer Welcome to Sky Valley, Red Sun is a classic in it's own right. <br />For the uninitiated, Kyuss played fuzzed out, reverb soaked, Sabbath tinged metal, and were one of the most important bands of their 90s. Describing their sound w/out relying on stupid metaphors or labels is fairly difficult, so I'll just say that they kick arse. A lot of it. Atlantic records signed them in the early 90s and dropped them after a tour w/ metallica failed to help them catch on to the mainstream. Posthumously, their legend and influence grew and now they have a huge cult following and many side projects, most noteable of which being Queens of the Stone Age. <br />Blues for the Red Sun contains many classics, the most prominent being Green Machine, a stoner anthem if there ever was one, a burner that sounds like the Stooges on overdrive. Thumb, Freedom March, and (my personal favorite) Writhe represent the jam nature of Kyuss, particularly Josh Homme's fuzzy, droning guitars and John Garcia's (one of the best vocalist all time IMO) searing vocals. <br />So if you want to get to the roots of stoner rock and take a 50 million year trip, pack your bowls tightly and let Kyuss work their magic.
B00005JL2O|5.0|The funniest movie I have ever seen; the begining was absolutly hilarious and the rest was great! A comedy masterpiece! I will watch it over and over again without getting bored!!!
B00004Z459|5.0|I've owned a lot of cds and in many different genres, but this is far and away the one I like the most. This is the cd I take into the bathroom with me when I shower and sing along with. I put em right up there with Pantera and Tool, which is saying a lot. Best new artists in decades.
B000003N7R|5.0|The heat of Coltrane combined with the sophisticated cool of Duke make for 35 minutes of pure musical joy. How did I miss this album for all these years ? In a Sentimental Mood will have you hooked instantly as Duke tastefully lays down some Piano chords to Coltrane's delicate and yet intense sax. Duke plays with subtely and nuance on every track ..always complimentary and tasteful while allowing Coltrane to just soar especially on Take The Train. There is something very satisfying about hearing Duke Ellington playing so called modern jazz. Evidence of the versatility of this giant of American music as if evidence were needed. Coltrane is the star of this set but Duke is ..well ..Duke ! How can you go wrong?
B000007T1M|4.0|I originally bought this CD for the one song &quot;Spiders&quot;, because I heard the song online and loved it. When I first got the cd, I didn't much care for any of the other songs on it, but as I listened to it more, each time, I liked it better. You can't help but laugh during parts of this cd, the vocalist is insane, just absolutely crazy! All in all, it has really grown on me, and I really like it, but be fore-warned, it is DIFFERENT. Keep an open mind and listen to it several times before you judge it.
B00002E23E|4.0|Overall, I really enjoyed watching this DVD.It perfectly captures Led Zepplin on stage. Jimmy Page's playing is outstanding, and the rhythm section is rock solid. My only complaint is the poor quality of Robert Plant's voice. He seemed to be strained with every note. He is way off in some parts and it takes away from the song. Don't get me wrong, he is an excellent singer. Maybe this was an off-night for him. Or mabe it's the fact that he blew out his voice somtime around 1972. If you can get by the poor vocal performance, this is an excellent DVD. This is Hard Rock's finest band in concert, an excellent choice for a fan or a casual listener of the band.
B000067CPX|5.0|Buy The CD if you like good music.That is all I have to say.By The Way, What's goin' on Jake, Aliza, Nancy, and all the rest?!
B000066NW0|5.0|I love it. Since i listen to Sk8terboi on the radio, i've been wanting to buy her cds. And when i bought it, just makes me impress more and more about her music. Some of her songs really relate to me because i am a teenager. I've listen to the cds for the tenth time since i've bought it two days ago. Just my type of music. I mean i've listen to Pink's cd and Michelle Branch, but they all sound non-fresh. And i just don't like it as much as AVril Lavigne's voice. In this cd i like all the songs 7 and going up. 8 9 10... so on are okay but i like 7 up songs better. So just go ahead and buy it.
B00005JL78|1.0|It's difficult to imagine how a film in this millenium could be worse.  I would have rated it a zero, but that option isn't available.  I dislike the word &quot;boring&quot;,  mainly because it so subjective.  This doesn't rise to the level of boring.  It probably would be acceptable for a four year old.  Otherwise, it's great,  i.e., the credits and end.  Forget what's in between.
B00006690G|5.0|Just go ahead and by this cd. It's really good. I use to hate Eminem like a month ago. But like my friends, they all love his music, and i use to think what's their problem, the music is so bad with all the cussing and stuff. But when my friend instist that i listen to a couple of songs before confirming my judgment. I did. And it was that bad. It actuall sounds good. And his talent of rhyming words and making the lyrics go smoothly really impress me. I mean the cussing is somewhat his style of writing. If you don't want to listen to cussing then i advise you to not buy this cd, but if you really want to get a taste of Eminem's music but not  sure if you ought to then just go ahead and buy it. I mean listening to one cd it's not going to kill you.
B000062XM3|5.0|I labeled this THE BEST MOVIE EVER(!!!!!!!) from the first time I watched it (the year it came out) UP UNTIL NOW IN 2003.<br />ANYONE WHO *DOESN'T* LIKE FIGHT CLUB JUST DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT.  They need a clue!!!<br />For anyone with a brain will find this gem MINDBLOWING.  The BEST MOVIE IN THE WORLD and has it all.  GREAT Acting, MIND BLOWING Story, Funny, and Cuts the b.s. like knife through swiss cheese.
B00000I07P|3.0|Actually 2.5 stars. Slippery When Wet by Bon Jovi is an average album. It is cleverly produced and written and their looks probably had some big part to due with their sucess. However this is album is very dated and is indeed pop rock. I can hardly call this a hard rock album because this is pop rock. The lyrics are often dull and childish and really this album wont sound fresh to the ears nor unique. I dont hate Bon Jovi Im not just feeling them. This album is not my cup of tea.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I recently turned 18, and in John Mayer's Room for Squares, I found comfort and a sense of belonging. &quot;Why Georgia&quot; is the standout track for me, which I relate to completely. I often find myself wondering where I'm going, seeing my life as &quot;verditless&quot; as so described by Mayer, wondering if I'm truly &quot;living it right.&quot; &quot;1983&quot; helps me to remember that I'm still young , all though I have grown up in away, it wasn't too long ago that I wasn't an adult . As a single girl &quot;Your Body is a Wonderland&quot; is like a dream fantasy; longing to know a man that thinks and would talk to me like Mayer does in the song. John Mayer is a fantastic singer-songwriter that is much need in the recently sugar-saturated top 40 radio rotation. If you have yet to take a listen to John Mayers beautiful insightful songs, I highly reccommend you do so.
B000002L9J|4.0|When I first listened to The Queen Is Dead I did not like it. But then I decided to listen to it again and I fell in love with it. Johnny Marrs guitar is melodic and beautiful and Morriseys lyrics make this album memorable and exciting. The production is also great. This album becomes one of my all time favourites and should be in every music lover record collection.
B000059QYB|5.0|In a decade where the music scene consisted of more one hit wonders than anything else, was were great artists like Michael Jackson, The Police and Billy Idol made fame.  I'm going to say it now that I have never been a huge fan of 80's music.  Personally I think it was the decade where the music industry just fell apart.  It was no longer about the music only the image and unfortunetly that pop culture philosophy still plagues the music industry today!  However one of the few good things that came out of that hideous decade of music was Billy Idol.  A punk-rocker in exile from the late 70's now trying to make a commercial impact.  Using musical influences from the past and adding them  to his punk rock origin Idol managed to create an awesome sound totally his own (with the help of guitarist Steve Stevens of course).  The result was shocking and Idol became a dominant musical force in the 80's.<br />Even to this day the music still stands strong. Which is suprising considering how dated the era is, that this music hailed from.  Still this is the type of cd that everyone should have.  It's simply a strong collection of songs that are totally enjoyable.  The entire cd covers Billy's career from his debt EP 'DON'T STOP' to his last album 1994's CYBERPUNK.  Dance rock hits like DANCING WITH MYSELF, MONY MONY and HOT IN THE CITY are still excellent crowd pleasers at dances.  Whereas rockers like WHITE WEDDING, CRADLE OF LOVE, TO BE A LOVER and REBEL YELL are defining moments in rock history.  Idol also proved he could do more than just 'rock' he could also do some fine love ballads like EYES WITHOUT A FACE, CATCH MY FALL, and SWEET SIXTEEN.  FLESH FOR FANTASY is the ultimate cruising tune.  Idol even had a small portion of his failed CYBER PUNK album shown here with the amazing rocker SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM.  Other tracks like a mildly successful 1986 follow up single DON'T NEED A GUN, a cover of the Doors classic L.A. WOMAN, a live acoustic version of REBEL YELL and a newrecording of the 80's classic DON'T YOU (FORGET ABOUT ME) are nice additions but could have made way for stronger tracks from his self titled 1982 debut ( SHOOTING STARS, COME ON COME ON, HOLE IN THE WALL etc;) and the Rebel Yell album (BLUE HIGHWAY?).  These are still great tracks regardless if they pale in comparison to the classics.<br />Overall Billy Idol's Greatest Hits is an essential recording that no music listener should be without.  Even the casual listener should enjoy this collection of rock songs, dance grooves and restful ballads that have made Billy Idol's career so diverse.  Highly recommended!
B000006045|5.0|Mezzanine is one of my all time favourite albums. Its just that good. the arrangements, the production and the wibe on the album. Its dark and beautiful and the musicianship is also top notch. the Album has many guest appearences and the lads from Massive are geniuses to find the right people to sing the right songs. Teardrop is now a classic and many other songs are also brilliant. I recomend everyone who claims to be a music fan to buy Mezzanine. It is indded one of the best albums of the late 90s and probably of all time.

B00005AFMT|5.0|Discipline was my first King Crimson album.  At the time, I thought Rush was the greatest group ever, and still hadn't weaned myself of a penchant for Black Sabbath (who'd previously been the most talented band in my limited musical world).  I decided to check out King Crimson, because I heard two seniors in high school arguing about whether Neal Peart or Bill Bruford was the better drummer.  Since I thought Peart was god, I could hardly imagine there might be another better than him.  At my local record store, Arlo talked me into the just released &quot;Discipline&quot; as opposed to &quot;Larks' Tongues in Aspic&quot; (which I liked the cover of more)<br />Needless to say, I didn't really know what to make of what I was listening to when I got home.  To say I'd never heard anything like it would be an understatement and, if the truth be told, there still isn't really anything like it, except other similar Crimson or Fripp releases.<br />There's the complaint that 80s Crimson is a sell-out, that it's too commercial (despite the fact that they were never chart-toppers).  The thing that 80s Crimson has that no other Crimson has is restraint.  Even in the frantic wailing of &quot;The Howler&quot; or &quot;No Warning&quot; or \\"Indiscipline\\", there is not the massive pounding of earliest Crimson, nor the total sonic juggernaut of more recent Crimson.  As such, 80s Crimson is charming in a way that no other is as well.  For me, where old Crimson sporadically attempted mellow (&quot;Cadence and Cascade&quot;, &quot;I Talk to the Wind&quot;, &quot;Book of Saturday&quot;) and came off wanting, 80s Crimson nails it, even (comparatively speaking) when drilling away at, say, &quot;Indiscipline&quot;.  It's not that I prefer 80s Crimson to the others, or am saying it's superior.  There are many musics for many moods, and when something more subtly mind-blowing is required than pure, all-out sonic overload, 80s Crimson fits the bill to a tee.<br />In any case, &quot;Elephant Talk&quot; is still a joy to listen to.  Belew's vocals and lyrical sense of play are intensely refreshing breaths of fresh air in the often heavy catalog of Crimson.  The lightness of touch is matched by the intricacy of guitar-line interplay that Fripp and Belew put forward.  Bruford's drumming, distinctly understated but nevertheless a fascinating take on &quot;pop&quot; music, and of course Tony Levin's session-tested instinct for well-chosen notes, makes this song a deceptively simple treasure trove of riches.  The guitar tone during the \\"E\\" words of the lyrics alone makes the disc worth buying.<br />&quot;Frame by Frame&quot; is more of the same, and for anyone who says that this is pop music, show me the pop song where the breakneck riff Fripp picks out over Belew's twangy guitar ever makes an appearance.  Belew's vocals are especially affecting here, and certainly gives him the right to claim to be the most widely accomplished of King Crimson's vocalists.  Though obviously hired at least in part for his ability to play the parts Fripp hands him, nevertheless his more conventional sense of songwriting meshes perfectly as a check on Fripp's own tendency to become overcerebral, as this song displays so well.<br />&quot;Matte Kudasai&quot; is flat-out beautiful, and is probably the most successful, if not the first successful, purely lyrical piece ever by King Crimson.  Belew deserved a Grammy for the vocals here.<br />&quot;Indiscipline&quot; is an example of Crimson excess under restraint.  It may simply be that Fripp has yet to acquire the nuclear arsenal of sound effects he'll amass for later Crimson, but once again, the apparent straightforwardness of this song masks much of its intricacy.<br />&quot;Thela Hun Ginjeet&quot; presents a soundscape that tends to be overlooked in light of the 'cassette tape' lyrics Belew uses here.  The brightness of Bruford's drums in conjunction with the snap of the guitars, Belew's wild, overdriven solo behind it, all conspireto present something still not dated, something still full of interest after all of these years.  Also notable is how well Fripp has finally managed to tailor his particular style of soloing to fit a song, rather than to have it jump out over the top of the mix as usual.<br />&quot;The Sheltering Sky&quot;, a percussion and synth guitar showpiece, in some respects drags, but if one can get into its mood what feels like musical drift becomes a marvelous trip.  The whole swing of how Belew plays the rhythm guitar here eventually seems to get into the blood and realign one's alpha waves, so to speak.  I always imagine this as somehow related to the Paul Bowles novel of the same name, but without success.<br />With \\"Discipline\\", the final song, one is invited to suspect a concept and contrast with \\"Indiscipline\\" that closed side 1.  I, for one, originally never liked this song.  The way the paired guitar lines synch and drift apart did nothing for me, the melody line was a bit too chirpy, the bass and drums a bit over refined, the whole thing a bit stuck on one riff.  I was young, what can I say.  More than anything else, the niftiest part of the song for me now is its blend of sounds.<br />Oh, and PS, Peart can't even hold a candle.to present something still not dated, something still full of interest after all of these years.

B00007E8V4|4.0|System of a Down's \\"Toxicity\\" album is one of my alltime favorites. And while \\"Steal This Album\\" is a good, memorable cd in its own right, it just isn't quite as exceptionally great as its predecessor was. A couple of tracks on STA really stand out as especially awesome. \\"Mr. Jack\\" is a slow-to-fast masterpiece that rivals that of \\"Chop Suey\\" or \\"Toxicity\\" and \\"Roulette\\" is a brillant acoustic work that shows that SOAD can be more than up and down chaos. Other very cool parts of this album, such as the chanting chorus of \\"I-A-E-I-A-O\\" and the nonsensical shouting of \\"Chic N' Stew\\" more then make STA a recommended purchase. It's a good, at times great, work of \\"artistic\\" music, that just ends up falling short of \\"Toxicity\\" itself.
B000002AGN|5.0|Every song on this CD should be a classic, but there are two definite standouts - &quot;Blue Rhondo a la Turk,&quot; and &quot;Take Five,&quot; the former because of its rather daring foray into polyrhthmical expression, and the latter because of its smooth, flawless phrasing.  This recording sets the standard, not only in Jazz, but in both Classical and Baroque composition as well.

B00006X06U|5.0|Joni Mitchell's 2000 recording \\"Both Sides Now\\" was the perfect precursor to this full-blown, ambitious orchestral collection of numerous Mitchell compositions through the years. \\"Travelogue\\" leads the listener on a journey through the evolution of her eclectic musical career. Most of the tunes Joni reprises on this double CD (some of which are by now classics while others are relatively unknown except to ardent fans) all have new life and renewed conviction with the assistance of some amazing arrangements (under the direction of ex-husband and frequent collaborator Larry Klein.)<br />Opening the set is the seldom heard \\"Otis and Marlena,\\" a perfect thematic launching point for Joni's first collection of recordings since September 11, 2001. The lyrics (originally addressing the social and political climate of the mid-1970s) assume a chilling, poignant meaning in the new millenium. The album title, of course, is taken from the lyrics to \\"Amelia\\" (originally recorded on \\"Hejira\\" over 25 years ago.) \\"Amelia\\" once again is a beautiful effort, but not quite as emotionally moving as the version on her live CD \\"Shadows and Light.\\" Many of the tracks, especially near the middle of the first CD take on epic proportions (unlike their original predecessors.) Some of Joni's finest efforts on \\"Travelogue\\" can be found on \\"Slouching Towards Bethlehem\\", \\"Judgment of the Moon and Stars\\" and \\"The Sire of Sorrow.\\" Additionally, there are a few tracks (such as the melancholy \\"Cherokee Louise\\") which are notably more meaningful and melodic than her original versions.<br />Perhaps equally or even more outstanding than the arrangements and musicianship on \\"Travelogue\\" is the incomparable album artwork and design found in the enclosed booklet. Contained therein are numerous recent paintings by Joni, several of them addressing the tragedy of 9/11.

B00006HBUA|1.0|One of the worse movie I have ever watched in my entire life. There is no plot, and the ending is absolutely horrible. It's like another scary movie! I mean come on! Surely the procuders had no idea what he/she wanted to do with the movie, and the story writer had no clue what he/she is writing. I will give some credit to the movie for its effects; it's not bad, but if you want to see a &quot;real&quot; movie, this is NOT it!  Trust me on this one. Unless you have kids who loves scooby, then this would be a buy that you can bare, or else, it will be a waste of you precious bill.

I especially like the rats working in Scrooges office as accountants. They ask Scrooge for another shovel of coal for the fire.

B00004BZ0N|5.0|The Rolling Stone called this the number one recording of the 1980's. Well, forget about that mag. It doesn't matter. It never did. But they were right. This CD is the number one recording of the 1980's, but not because some mag says that it is; rather, it is because of the fact that this is a mature, post punk statement by a band that dared to grow up and challenge itself as much as it challenged it fan base. The Clash were not afraid to evolve past thier roots in ways that thier contemporaries would - or could - not. They experimented with popular, Jazz, ska and Raggae elements, and when they click, man, do they click! \\"Jimmy Jazz,\\" \\"Spanish Bombs,\\" \\"Lost in the Supermarket,\\" and \\"Clampdown\\" are some of thier more clear cut successes here. And lets not forget about a little sleeper number, the unlisted track #19,\\"Train in Vain,\\" or that little protest song (even more apprpriate in the age of USAPATRIOT and TIPS), \\"Guns of Brixton.\\"

B00005JKZT|5.0|It's hard to know where to begin in articulating a coherent summary of so spectacular an epic as Peter Jackson's rendering of Tolkein's masterpiece. Perhaps the most incisive comment I can make is that, having been a fan of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" since I first read the trilogy nearly 35 years ago, I'm impressed by Jackson's fidelity to the spirit of the original literary work.<br />\\"The Two Towers\\" is a very different kind of film than its predecessor. Don't expect the intimacy of \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\"; the evolution of the story precludes it. The dissolution of the Fellowship scattered the principal characters of the first film into three distinct sub-plots: Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), whose capture by the Uruk-Hai takes them into Fangorn Forest and their ultimate influence on the fate of Saruman (Christopher Lee); Legolas (Orlando Bloom), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), and Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), who re-unite with a resurrected Gandalf (Ian McKellan) in the climactic battle of Helm's Deep; and Frodo (Elijah Wood) & Sam (Sean Astin), who continue their quest to destroy the Ring at Orodruin (ably played by Mount Doom) in Mordor. That's a lot of threads to weave into the overall tapestry of the story, and it necessarily calls for some fairly abrupt and rapid scene changes.  The action is so fast-paced that you will barely have time to catch your breath.<br />One of the most personally meaningful aspects of the film -- and so far, it has been true of both \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" and \\"The Two Towers\\" -- is Jackson's uncompromising adherence to Tolkein's vision of the timelessness of the story itself. The author was determined NOT to write a story that served as an allegory for any of the current events of his time, but rather hoped to address much broader issues that are rooted in the fundamentals of human nature. In so doing, the trilogy has remained relevant to the human condition in a way that transcends nationalities, ethnicities, and the various idiosyncratic cultural zeitgeists of any of the historical periods it has spanned. I find real personal relevance in Aragorn's struggle with his own destiny. It's not a predetermined kind of destiny, as in \\"fate\\", but rather the self-determined destiny of one who follows his heart and his own integrity. Ditto for Eowyn (Miranda Otto), whose struggle to fulfill her desire for valor in the service of good is established in \\"The Two Towers\\", and will culminate in the final installment, \\"The Return of the King\\".<br />But Jackson's triumph runs much deeper than his artistry in character development; many great films share that characteristic. It is his mastery in the use of surpassing technological innovation as an aid in the storytelling rather than as an end in itself that raises the bar for all subsequent films. His combination of digital, fabricated, and natural scenery in creating the world of Middle Earth is simply breathtaking. The battle scenes are terrifying without being overwhelming in their reliance on gratuitous violence or gruesome bloodshed. [I will allow my daughters (8 and 12 years of age) to watch the films, and I am probably more protective of their sensibilities than most parents I know.] And Jackson's creation of the creature Gollum (Andy Serkis) is without equal or precedent in filmmaking history. Gollum is more than simply \\"believable\\"; he is real. His role in the story is pivotal, and it was Jackson's test of fire to create an all-digital character whose range of expression and movement could carry such an important part in the story. It is a masterpiece of moviemaking art.<br />It will seem incomprehensible to the uninitiated that my only lament about the three-hour film is that it is too short. That's hardly a criticism, for Jackson has included everything that is relevant to the story line in setting the stage for the trilogy's climax in the third film. As a matter of practicality, the film can't exceed three hours for simple economic reasons. A longer film would mean fewer showings -- not good for the profitability of movie theatres -- or a higher price of admission, which would not be popular with moviegoers. So, the filmmaker has had to accommodate those constraints, and I believe it's a job well done.<br />Still, it's inevitable that one who has read the book will find discrepancies or omissions in the film, but that's not the basis of my wish that the film were longer. Rather, it's more a matter of being sorry that it was over at the end. \\"The Two Towers\\" is so captivating, so utterly engrossing a film-watching experience, that I found myself wanting more. What better statement could one make about the success of the filmmaker who wants his customers to come back for the third and final part of this epic trilogy? The consolation to those who want more will undoubtedly be in the release of the special edition DVD, which -- like its counterpart for \\"The Fellowship...\\" -- will add significant additional footage to the theatrical version.<br />Finally, for all the unparalleled technological excellence of the film, the most compelling reason of all to see it is the story itself. If you love great movies crafted by professionals with vision who tell a remarkable story exceedingly well, you simply must see \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". It's clear that the trilogy has found a special place in moviegoers' hearts. I saw \\"The Two Towers\\" at Edwards Cinema in Brea, California at a matinee showing on December 23, 2002, in a full-house audience of people of all ages. When the initial title \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" appeared on the screen, the audience spontaneously burst into applause. I have never seen that happen at any movie I have ever attended, and for good reason - there has never been a movie like this before.
0440234743|5.0|This book is intelligent and fresh. The story centers around a lawyer (it is a Grisham novel afterall) and a women of faith. I it is one of the only books that I have read that actually treats a person of Christian faith with dignity and respect. The book is a refreshing change from most modern fixtion. It is a a great plot with several twist. The writing is Grisham at his best. Very enjoyable. Well woth the read.
B00005OAIE|4.0|This album is a wonderfully mellow listen, somewhat along the lines of Dido. Nothing earthshattering about John Mayer's lyrics or music, but perfect to just sit back and chill out to.
B00006CXXU|4.0|Loved this album!! Songs were all really well written, and you can tell she will be a fantastic artist in years to come!!! Currently I have bought \\"SHUT UP\\" by Kelly Osbourne (A GREAT ALBUM!!) and it had a whole bunch of catchy hits, with a great tune.. You wont be disappointed...
B000002BYA|3.0|Stevie Ray Vaughan is undoubtedly a legendary guitarist.  On this live recording as on other recordings, Stevie adds so much color to his magnificent solos.  Its a true joy to  listen to the many ellaborate bends, use of feedback, and fast picking on the many blues numbers on this release.  Some people may criticize Stevie's growl of a voice but truthfully I enjoy his stylings in that department.<br />Unfortunately, most if not all of the songs here are three chord blues.  This can be a bit monotonous after a while. The use of the Room Full of Blues Horns on some of the tracks do help a little as a foil most especially on the slow blues tune Dirty Pool.  Somehow I wish the horns and Dr John's organ were given a little more time in the spotlight on other  tracks.<br />Overall, the effort is good but not quite over the top.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|This is a wonderful DVD. It is beautiful to watch and hear! The story is classic and the DVD treatment is worthy of the film. The extras on the DVD are INCREDIBLE and plentiful. This is a DVD that reminds you why DVDs are around in the first place. A must have for your DVD collection!
B0000542D2|3.0|This movie to me is one of the great feel good movies of all time. I was 7 years old and a true Beatlemaniac when it was originally released and it still puts a big smile on my face and has me feel great whenever I see it. Roger Ebert even refers to this movie (on the packaging) as &quot;One of the great life-affirming landmarks of the movies.&quot;<br />What is disappointing to me however is the lack of quality of the DVD release itself. The visual quality of the movie does not appear to have been optimized to be its best and as others have mentioned the quality of the sound is very mediocre too. Also, despite the fact that previous DVD releases of the movie have had subtitles available in different languages these have for some reason been omitted in this release.<br />What is great about this DVD are the interviews with the cast and crew who were associated with the movie. This gave me some great additional perspective around everything that went into the making of the movie itself. For example, I was absolutely stunned to find out that Wilfrid Brambell, the actor who played Paul's grandfather in the movie, was only 51 years old when the movie was made. I always figured that he had to be somewhere between 70 and 80 years old at the time. Also, once the actual filming of the movie was complete the editors had only 3 weeks to edit all of the film and music in order to meet the scheduled release date.<br />Despite the greatness of the movie itself hopefully someday we will see a DVD release of this movie that contains all of the features we know are available.
B00005RFAI|4.0|Loved this album!! Songs were all really well written, and you can tell she will be a fantastic artist in years to come! You wont be disappointed.
B000001EAQ|3.0|Pop is not the most commercial U2 recording on the planet.  Nonetheless, this is certainly an intriuging piece of work.  The band utilizes a lot of creative rhythms and varying tones specifically on such tunes like Discotheque, Please, Staring At The Sun, and Last Night On Earth.<br />The Edge is in fine form on guitar.  Even though the guitar sounds are not always front and center, the solos are pretty unique from track to track.<br />Bono is a bit inconsistent in the vocal area.  On tracks such as Mofo and If You Wear That Velvet Dress, he sounds muffled as it is difficult to make out the words.  However on If God Will Send His Angels and Last Night On Earth the emotion is quite strong.<br />Overall, this is a good effort by U2 as there are seven pretty good to excellent tunes.  They experiment with different sounds without going too overboard.  Change is a good thing.  However, songwise, the effort is a little short of Achtung Baby.
B00005JL96|5.0|This is a dilightful movie. After a string of disapointing films from Disney, Lilo and Stitch again shows us that Disney is a wonderful movie making company. This heartwarming tale of two sisters and their &quot;dog&quot; is refreshing and charming. The story is one of family and acceptance. The movie is both warm and funny. Seeing Stich's Elvis impersonations are well worht the entire film. Still, this movie has a delightful message. The dvd is well made. Don't be fooled by the extras however. The Stitch story throughout the history of Disney is cute but very short and not all it could be. The deleted scenes are in pre-production format and not that interesting. Still the movie alone is worth the purchase.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Not many bands these days can say they are a true rock band, Audioslave can.  When you first hear Cochise your first thought will be, &quot;Man, these guys sound like RATM.&quot; you couldn't be further from the truth.  Audioslave gives us a breath of fresh air in knowing that good rock is still around.  Pick this CD up when you have a chance.
B00005YW4H|4.0|Loved this album!! Songs were all really well written, and you can tell she will be a fantastic artist in years to come! You wont be disappointed.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones is a keeper. This is a cd that you can listen to straight through, rather it be the background to a relaxing night at home or a beautiful, romantic dinner. No skipping around, each song is amazing. I highly recommend it!
B00006LSM3|5.0|I will not spend too much space on trying to describe this masterpiece. How does it rank up there with All Things Must Pass is a good question. Kinda unfair considering one is a 3 album set, the other just 1. My expectations were low initially with this brilliant CD due to the norm being.. \\"Left-over tracks\\" that wern't good enough to make any previous albums/CD's. But this is not the case here. <br />Some Notes:<BR>Favorite track: Hard to say......but Today its \\"Rising Sun\\", tomorrow, who knows.<br />Jeff Lynne Fluff: This set is no where near some of his previous Producer's efforts. This is probably his best Production. (Now only if he would dump the ELO name once and for all!!)<br />Awards: Wouldn't surprise me if this record gets nominated for something.....personally I just wish it wouldn't. <br />Cons: I don't know if there is any. George voice is in tip top condition on all tracks (we can only speculate to how bad George was actually feeling during some of these recordings). There is a song from every element of his career in here and then some. <br />What Else Can We Expect: As previously posted, Harrison Tribute Concert and even an Anthology Set that includes plenty of Unreleased tracks to finally quinch my thirst from the \\"Quiet One\\".....Thanks George!!
B00006879E|5.0|I absolutly recommend this CD to anyone who loves music. This is a great &quot;cruisin'&quot; cd and/or &quot;hangin' out with your friends&quot; cd. I fell in love with Maroon 5 after I saw their video on a college music network and I would love for them to be sucessful in the music industry. So, support their music and buy their cd.
B00006879E|5.0|I just got this cd a couple of days ago from my best friend. Her and I rock out to this cd everytime we are near a cd player or when we are in the car! This cd ROCKS!!!!! I recommed it to anyone who likes Dave Matthews Band!
B000002H33|5.0|First of all, anyone that thinks they are a true metalhead needs to get this album.  I know people that download the mp3's and love some the songs from this album but never have listened to the whole album in its true order.  There is no greater satisfaction for a metalhead than hearing Master of Puppets all the way through.  It all just flows together so well.<br />Usually I can pick out my favorite song from an album, but i can't do this for Master of Puppets.  Starting with \\"Battery\\" and following through all the way to \\"Damage, Inc\\", every song is a definite masterpiece.  I can say that I like \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\" a little less than the rest but it is still a kick ... metal song.<br />As far as lyrics go, \\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\\" and \\"Leper Messiah\\" stand out more but the whole album is chock-full of anti-religion, anti-war and just plain anti-world messages.  When I go back and listen to Kill 'Em All (Metallica's first album), I can definately feel that Master of Puppets is so much more emotionally charged lyrics.<br />So if want to bang your head to the best thrash-metal album ever made, go get Master of Puppets.  Satisfaction guaranteed ...
B00007E8V4|5.0|Okay, here's an example of how good this album is...I do not care for political metal, however, I did like Rage Against The Machine when they were together, and when System Of A Down came along, once again, I did not care for the political attacks in the lyrics, but the music was phenomenal, so I dug them. Now, with the first two albums by System Of A Down, I just liked them, I said okay, here's a decent metal band...But with the latest album \\"Steal This Album\\" out now, I love them, they are truly one of my favorite bands now, this album completely deminishes the first two! I am truly blown away! System Of A Down is one of the top five metal bands out there today, there is no doubt of that!
B00006L7XQ|5.0|In today's world of country music it's refreshing to hear a performer with something to say.  Sadly, great music like this is often overlooked in favor of &quot;country&quot; pop that dominates the airways.  <br />The title cut is simply one of the best Johnny Cash originals ever.  His aging voice adds a sense of wisdom and sadness to many of the cuts especially Give my love to Rose and Sting's I hung my head.<br />This album ranks as one of Johnny Cash's finest and is a must have for any fan of the &quot;man in black&quot;
B00003CX9Q|5.0|\\"E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial\\", is probably one of director Steven Speilberg's best-ever...no wonder he is so proud of the film, even enough today to make the risky decision of digitally remastering the original version!<br />PLOT SUMMARY: \\"E.T.\\" is the unforgettable classic tale of a young ten-year-old boy, Elliott (Henry Thomas) who befriends a strange alien, E.T. (voiced by Pat Welsh) from an unkown world, who has been left behind on planet Earth when his species landed their space craft on Earth for a visit. Elliott is able to feel what E.T. feels the moment they make contact with each other. Soon, Elliott's older brother, Michael (Robert McNaughton) and younger sister, Gertie (Drew Barrymore) are in on his secret, and E.T. becomes emotionally attached to all three children, as well as they become emotionally attached to him. When the FBI finds out about E.T., Elliott must get E.T. back to his space ship before the FBI gets ahold of him so E.T. can go home safely.<br />2002 VERSION: This new version of the film was released in March of 2002. It's digitally remastered, with special effects being better than ever, a digitally remastered score by the absolutely brilliant composer and conductor, John Williams, and two deleted scenes that were cut out of the original. Both scenes were added into the film as they had appeared in the original script. One of the scenes focuses on Elliott and E.T. in the bathroom when Elliott fakes an illness so he can stay home with E.T. from school. The other deleted scene involves Michael, Gertie, and their mother, Mary (Dee Wallace-Stone), on Halloween night when Mary goes out looking for Elliott and finds Michael and Gertie roaming around on the streets.<br />1982 VERSION: This is the original version of the film that was seen in theaters in the year of 1982. Nothing is digitally remastered, and there are no extra scenes or footage. A lot of \\"E.T.\\" fans might say that the original version is better, but I personally enjoy both. The 2002 version is featured on disc one in this collector's edition DVD set, and this 1982 version is featured on disc number two.<br />OVERALL THOUGHTS: This is one amazing film! \\"E.T.\\", I must say, is one of my all-time favorites. It's truly a classic. The acting by the entire cast is brilliant and superb...and I really must take a note on Henry Thomas. He is the one who captured the audiences' emotions and was just plain outstanding as Elliott. There are unforgettable movie lines in this film, as well as unforgettable original music. The script was well-written and solid. Steven Speilberg did an incredible directing job! The special effects were just stunning, too...even in the remastered version. This is not just a children's film--it's a film for the ages. <br />The collector's edition DVD is also a wonderful treasure. This version comes with both the 1982 original feature, and the digitally remastered 2002 feature. The tons of extras include a making of \\"E.T.\\", live performance of John Williams conducting the Orchestra at the 2002 premiere, a documentary of E.T.'s creation and evolution, a \\"reunion\\" interview where the cast, as well as Speilberg and the film's other producer, Kathleen Kennedy, come back in 2002 to discuss their reactions on the film's impact, a look at the 2002 theatrical premiere, advertisments, DVD-ROM extras, and theatrical trailers. This DVD is available in both wide screen and full frame formats.<br />I highly recommend \\"E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial\\".<br />Score:<BR>100/100<BR>A+
B000066NW0|5.0|I love this cd it is the best ever! I get up at 5 and put it in the cdplayer at my house I get into the car and put it in into that stereo. Get to school and put it in my cd player and then listen to it after school from the time I get out till about midnight.  I would recommend everyone to but this Cd!!
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones is bringing back the blues of the past, and adding some of her own modern style to the mix. The songs range from sultry to sassy to sad, displaying a wide range of emotions from a very mature voice. Great for relaxing at home, or on a date.
0679735909|4.0|A novel supremely architected, Possession tells two tales in parallel.  The first tale revolves around two modern day literary scholars, the young struggling Roland Michell and the well established Maud Bailey, who discover an unbeforeknowst love affair between two Victorian Poets, the well known Mr. Randolph Henry Ash and the \\"on the periphery\\" Ms. Christabel LaMotte.  The second tale takes us back in time and lets us relive portions of Ash's and LaMotte's romantic relationship.  Possession reads like a detective novel as Roland and Maud, looking for clues to the relationship, slowly reinterpret the poetry of Ash and LaMotte in a new context (were there entire periods of these two poets' prolific literary careers where their works were inspired by the other and even addressed the other unknown to the rest of the world?).  Roland and Maud even retrace many of poets' trips to the north of Great Britain and on the coast of Brittany.  Meanwhile the reader of the novel is slowly revealed other clues that Michell and Bailey can only guess at through the Byatt's flashback narratives.<br />Possession takes on a great number of themes and part of its success is in tying these many disparate themes together into a greater whole (i.e. in the business world we would call this synergies).  ..., part of Byatt's triumph is in creating Ash's and LaMotte's body of literature, their letters, poems and epics, that in and of themselves would represent literary triumphs compared to many pieces from Victorian literature  (and we're talking poetry here --- while this same reviewer has been unflattering towards previous British pieces due to their \\"warmed other milk\\" atmosphere, there is something to be said for the life and passion of Victorian poetry.)  ...<br />Two thoughts on a more practical note.  First, Possession is extremely difficult to read in small smatterings.  The details are rich and the Victorian language is of course dense.  For slow, word-by-word readers such as myself the challenge of the actual reading can take away from the impact of the message.  Let's face it.  It's hard to be moved by literature when you're having to look up ever other word in a freak'n dictionary.  Second, this reviewer found it sometimes difficult to be sympathetic towards world of academia.  I found myself sometimes thinking \\"tell these people to get a life.\\"
0316666343|1.0|i am reading this book because my mom recommended it to me after reading it herself. being one who likes novels with originality, creativity, and of course, STYLE, i am completely appalled by this book. the only original bit is the idea that the main character is telling the story from heaven. aside from this,the characters are boring and completely predictable. you have the withdrawn mother, the father who is 'on the case' and trying to be strong to solve the mystery, the teenage sister who hides her emotions, and the four year old brother who just doesnt get it. anyone could write this book. if you want a book that will require no thought or provoke any life questions, pick up this book. if you, however, prefer books that arent what chick flicks are based upon, please dont waste your money on this. remember that some of the money you spend to buy this book goes to the author and it is not deserved. buy books that make you think. buy books that make you wiser once you've completed them. buy a book that serves the purpose of a book: not only to entertain but to provide some knowledge. unless you have a completely feeble mind, i assure you this book does neither.
0066214122|4.0|I've &quot;discovered&quot; Michael Crichton long before he made a name for himself having read Sphere and the Andromeda strain when they first came out. Since then Mr. Chrichton has made a quantum leap in terms of the amount of research that goes into each book and in his writting style. As a non-native English reader I find Mr. Crichton's prose exceptionally easy to read, precise - almost crystal clear. And when it comes to the amount of research that goes into each book this is well beyond what any other fiction author would do. There is indeed a swarm (albeit one formed by more intelligent independent agents that those forming the book's swarm) researching each book. The results are always cutting edge and, to a large extent, educational for the layman reader. A most enjoyable book -which I could not put down- combining an exceptionally interesting theme, fast moving plot and excellent prose. I just took one star off for what one could call slightly excessive &quot;poetic (or rather, scientific) license&quot;.
B00006LSM3|5.0|A prime example of an artist bareing his soul in his final work and knowing full well it was his last cd. This is why it is criminal that people burn music for free and steal an artists product. To pay just ...dollars and have the priveledge to listen to this cd is an honour. Buy this cd,don't steal it. By the way the cd is excellent from start to end. Bravo George. Special thanx to george's son and Jeff Lynn for not butchering the recording by over production. Peace on earth
B00005JKCH|5.0|Peter Parker is well played, and Spider-Man looks like the real thing.<br />The movie is an updated version of the comic book.  Spider-Man gets bitten by a genetically altered spider, not a radioactive one.<br />I have a little concern about Peter's refusing MJ at the end.  That may have been a little premature, and it seemed unrealistic.  Parker had not sufferred enough harm to his loved ones by being Spider-Man, and he just eliminated the (first?) Green Goblin with no second one in sight.<br />Otherwise, the movie deserved to get its top ranking for 2002.  It sticks quite well to the story, and it lets the kid inside a middle aged man go back to his comic books.<br />Personally, I preferred several of the 2002 Christmas season movies more than this show, but there was nothing to compete with this movie in the box office since Star Wars episode II.
0767805712|5.0|I think we are heading in this direction w/ genectic structure. Jude definately knows how to act and I love him and ethan in this esp the line &quot;Keep your eyelashes where they belong&quot; or something like that
B00004ZAV3|5.0|No, I'm not gonna buy other cds of the band, this cd is enough for a moderate fan like me! It has the #1 songs in the charts, for the first time, and it's a good starting point for new Beatles fans that want to listen some of the best.<BR>My fave tracks? Difficult to say--I listen to all of them as a whole, almost without noticing some are better than others. Maybe \\"From me to you\\" or \\"She Loves You\\" for its imaginative way of singing with the music, or the precious \\"Hard Day's Night\\". The sad ones are also welcome like \\"Yesterday\\", \\"Hey Jude\\" or \\"Let it Be\\". \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" is a great and different song. By the way, it's impossible not to be moved with \\"The long and winding road\\" as the last track, a perfect farewell to the best rock band ever.<BR>I'm a jazz and soundtrack fan, I don't care very much for rock, yet this album is a must for those who like 60's music a bit. Buy it, now!
0783229526|5.0|Raoul Duke and Doctor Gonzo are the Laurel and Hardy of hallucinogen abuse.  It is perhaps necessary to have delved into hallucinogen abuse on one's own part to appreciate their behavior.  For the abuser, hallucinogen abuse is pure verve existentialism - an alternate human condition that is self-imposed and completely private, rather than the human condition that is universal and imposed from without.  Hemming and hawing about the Human Condition in the latter sense is pure dreary tedium and the very fount of unoriginality.  Existentialism as an intellectual trend was hackneyed from the word GO.  Especially as the operant word of Existentialism is not GO, it is AGONIZE or INTELLECTUALIZE or basically come on like a tough guy in someone elses loincloth.  Albert Camus wrote The Stranger and it is hailed as an existential masterpiece.  What is not mentioned is that he stole the whole idea from reading James Cain's The Postman Always Rings Twice and that book wasn't any good in the first place.  Camus takes it and makes it into something that is pretentious AND no good.<br />In Fear and Loathing Raoul Duke and Doctor Gonzo create their own Human Condition and it is pure paranoid insanity, detached from anyone else's reality matrix.  SEE Fear and Loathing.  Thrill to scenes like the one where Doctor Gonzo sits in sullen, sunglassed, criminal silence while LaCerda tries to tell a cowering Raoul Duke that he is his photographer, finally becomes disconcerted and decides to decamp, being told by Gonzo as he is leaving the darkened hotel suite, \\"We know what you're up to, man\\"

B000000WA4|5.0|It is a great CD. I think it is one of the best ones SP has put out.
0393317552|5.0|I am impressed by Diamond's willingness to dive into areas outside his specialialization. To me that is the great strength of this book, it's an ambitious attempt to give a general theory of human &quot;development&quot;. The problem of course, is that specialists will find fault with the details, that is inevitible in such a work. In general I agree with Diamond's view that the &quot;success&quot; of Europeans in conquering the world came down mostly to geograpical luck. Yes, there is the objection that culture also plays a part, but that doesn't deny that geography was the key thing. Overall, a fascinating book, very ambitious, and readable for non-academics. Not without flaws, but with this approach, that's inevitible, and I don't feel that distracts from the book's considerable strengths.
B00005LC1H|4.0|This is a great Britcom - Hard to believe only 12 were made with such a following. Each one is a gem in itself. No one can do comedy quite like John Cleese. The little nuances; the decor; the intricate character play; its wonderful. If you watch carefully at the beginning of each episode you will also find the twisted spelling of &quot;fawlty towers&quot;. For something made in the 70's, this series has survived and is still enjoyable today.<br />As for the interviews, they are great. With only 12 episodes made its nice to have the interviews filling the blank spots.<br />A must for John Cleese fans and for anyone who loves Britcoms =)
B00007BH5C|5.0|Before i start I'd like to clear some confusion about the music from the trailer. The music isn't on the soundtrack because it had nothing to do with it, it was a remix from Lux Aeturnia (spelling?)from Requiem of a Dream done by a guy who's name will remain nameless for the sake that he doesn't host it anymore, it was actually better than the origional in my opinion.<br />This soundtrack was grand for all it's themes that it could possibly deliver into the movie. Everything from the climactic end to Foundations of Stone to The Hornburg, to fantastic work of Forth Eorlingas. The White Rider still sends chills down my spine at the beginning as it builds up tension. Beautiful vocals and instrumentals in even the battle themed Isengard Unleashed.<br />Definitally a soundtrack worth getting, specially if a fan of the movies. Makes me eager for RotK's release, movie and soundtrack.
B000059XUP|3.0|Ok, the reason everybody has a problem with this movie is, that they believe it tramples on the memory of Brandon Lee because they feel someone else is playing his part. It doesnt, even if he had lived he wouldnt be in this movie. The characters are completely different people for a reason, showing that all kinds of people can come back for vengeance. The problem I had with it is that it was too much like the first, almost trying to copy it(i.e. The similarity of Brandon and Vince's look). I think Salvation did a better job by changing the victims dress, hair, etc.. No movie will ever top the first but, this one tried to, buy using the same formula, long hair, black leather clothes, and a little birdie. Overall it wasnt that bad.
B00005JKZT|4.0|I cannot help but be disappointed in \\"The Two Towers,\\" although I recognize the problem is that J.R.R. Tolkien's middle volume of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy has an inherent flaw.  Tolkien deal with the journey of Frodo and Sam with the Ring in Book Four, while Book Three dealt with the other former members of the Fellowship (ironically, I remember being unhappy with this arrangement when I read the book, wondering when we were getting back to Frodo).  But a major motion picture cannot divide the story into separate halves like this.  Instead, the focus is on four groups comprising the former Fellowship of th Ring, which requires the film to jump back and forth between (a) Frodo and Sam trying to make they way to Mordor, now in the company of Gollum; (b) Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli helping with the defense of Helm's Deep in the land of Rohan; (c) Merry and Pippin in the company of Treebeard the Ent; and (d) Gandalf the White working behind the scenes.<br />That last one is a minor aspect of the film and Ian McKellan will not receive a second nomination for playing Gandalf next year because he has precious little to do in this film.  He is not alone in this regard as Saruman, Elrond, Arwen, and Galadriel have even less screen time in the second film, mainly because we now have the new characters of Th&eacute;oden, &Eacute;owyn, &Eacute;omer, Gr&iacute;ma Wormtongue, Faramir, and Gollum to work into the narrative.  The centerpiece of the film is the battle at Helm's Deep, but the narrative structure of the film requires Jackson to cut away time and time again to the other major plot threads, which works to the disadvantage of all three storylines.<br />One of the strengths of the film is Gollum.  In reading Tolkien's works and seeing some of the animated versions of these stories, I have never felt any sympathy for Gollum.  However, that certainly was not the case in this film.  Andy Serkis' physical performance has been replaced by computer technology, but his voice conveys the duality of Gollum/Smeagol, who argues with himself over what to do about his Master and his precious ring.  The computer-generated character is markedly better than Jar Jar Binks and Dobby, but it is Serkis vocal work that maintains the illusion of reality more than anything else.<br />My favorite scene in the Trilogy involves &Eacute;owyn during the battle of the Pellennor Fields, and I liked how that was set up with Miranda Otto's character in this film, although for the second half she is reduced to looking at Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) with wide eyes while he pines for Arwen (Liv Tyler).  Merry and Pippin no longer work as the film's comic relief, although they spend most of the film riding around on Treebeard, which also sets up the stage for what will happen in \\"The Return of the King.\\"  Now it is Gimli the dwarf that provides almost all of the film's comic relief, but at least John Rhys-Davies gets more action this time around as well.  Bernard Hill as Th&eacute;oden, King of Rohan, makes the best impression of the new members to the cast of characters. However, Frodo (Elisha Wood) is now reduced to looking worried and haggard, and he is supposed to be the heart of the storm.  If anyone, it is Samwise (Sean Austin) who exhibits growth as a character, setting him up as well for what is to come to pass.<br />That is probably the best way of describing this film: setting up what is to happen in the third and final film.  This middle film actually covers less of the Trilogy seeing as how it begins a couple of chapters into Tolkien's novel and ends stops a few chapters short of the end (of both books), which will probably surprise and disappoint many fans (certainly Tolkien's ending would make for a better ending).  The title is meant to suggest the efforts of Isengard and Minas Morgul to destroy the world of men, but the efforts of Saruman's minions are more prominent than those of Sauron.  Yet with all the cutting back and forth this idea is probably lost on the uninitiated, especially since it stops short of the confrontation between Gandalf and Saruman that ends Book Three.  I think few if any fans of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" will find reasonable grounds to consider \\"The Two Towers\\" to be superior to \\"The Fellowship of the Ring,\\" but I do not think any sense of disappointment will ultimately prove enough to stop anyone from seeing \\"The Return of the King.\\"cially since it stops short of the confrontation between Gandalf and Saruman that ends Book Three.

B00006AFUR|5.0|Just buy it, you won't be dissapointed. It is truly original from start to finish and will captivate you the whole way through. Don't be turned off because the frontman (Jared Leto) is an Actor (see him in Panic Room with Jody Foster), in my opinion he is one of the best rock vocalists out there right now. The vocals soar, the guitars are on point and the bass/drums/synth come threw with a mission to enthrall. A must have for any rock lover who needs something new and wonderful for his or her collection. Buy it and welcome yourself to the universe!
B000002J1F|4.0|This album is undeniably brilliant. The amazing virtuosity displayed by each musician, coupled with the intricate arrangements, makes for an intense and exhilarating listen. It is amazing to think that this was released in 1972. It still sounds modern and &quot;avant-garde&quot; to me. But, the only gripe about this album is the slightly unpleasant aftertaste left by the five solo pieces. Although most of them are interesting enough, I can't seem to rid myself of the feeling that I'm listening to filler instead of actual songs. Nevertheless, Fragile is (ironically) a potent statement of advanced musicality.
B000002WPI|5.0|This is, hands down, my favorite album EVER.  It showed me what real hip hop is, guiding me away from the commercial stylings of talentless morons like Jah Rule and Nelly and molding me into the educated hip hop head that I am today. If there could be one word used to describe this album as a whole, it would be 'rugged.'  I've heard that the original version of this album was recorded by Rza on a tapedeck, and it wouldn't surpise me if this were true.  The beats are comprised of dusty drum tracks, menacing bass lines, occasionally pierced by high pitch screeches, and snippets of dialogues from old kung-fu movies.  Yet, they are multi-layered in an ingenious, subtle manner.  The samples are original and innovative, and they [fade] out while giving rise to new ones within the songs.  Lyrically, Wu's rhymes were unheard of at the time.  They are a combination of battle rhymes, street tales, and ancient kung-fu mythology.  Every MC reps it to the fullest here.  Every track is no less than amazing, and the overall atmosphere of the album is more potent than any other in hip hop history.  In short, this is a phenomenal release in a class all its own which will never be equaled.  If you don't have this album make sure that is is the first thing on your list the next time you head over to the record store.
B00006WUWN|1.0|I may have laughed twice during this movie:  once during the Mini-me cameo scene in the beginning, and once at the Styx joke (with \\"Mr. Roboto\\").  Otherwise, this movie just didn't do its job.  Realizing right away that the only way to remain smart and funny was to be self-effacing, Mike Myes takes the inane and nonsensical elements of the first two movies and stuffs the movie with them.  The revelations and character development all becomes more and more ridiculous and downright stupid up to the closing scene.  For instance, near  the beginning, Dr. Evil's idioms when chastising Scott turn into garbled dialogue that doesn't even resemble real English.  Instead of saying \\"Shh\\" or \\"Zip it\\", he now says something along the lines of \\"Rfmsfll\\".  Yeah, very funny.  And the film goes downhill from there, folks.<br /><br />Returning characters such as Fat Bastard and Mini-me have lost the originality that made them humorous.  The new addition, the eponymous Goldmember, is simply not funny at all, and it is a bit difficult to figure out exactly what he's even doing in the movie at all:  it may have been better without him.<br /><br />The only possible redeeming part of this movie could have been Beyonce Knowles as Foxy Cleopatra.  Unfortunately, though she was exceedingly likeable and capable in her role, she and Austin shared absolutely no chemistry whatsoever.<br /><br />Compared to this movie, Wayne's World 2 was brilliant.  Do yourself a favor and watch the first Austin Powers movie again.  Though you've seen it already, it will still be more original than this movie, and at least it will have some sort of plot.
B00004XPP0|5.0|SORRY GUYS I DON'T BUY TAPES ANYMORE, NO DVD FOR STAR WAR....<BR>YOU MUST BE KIDDING....
B00006HBUB|1.0|I lost interest in this movie after trying my best to stay attentive in the first half hour (I kept asking the person I was watching it with to tell me when the movie gets funny). It wasn't funny at all and didn't even completely make sense: where exactly did the monsters come from?  And are we really supposed to believe that Scrappy Doo would go to that length for revenge?  The plot, if you can call it that, was a pitiful rip off of \\"Invasion Of The Body Snatchers\\".<br />Sometimes when a movie isn't funny, you can tell where the jokes are, but you don't laugh at them. With Scooby Doo, I had a hard time even telling what I was supposed to be laughing at: that's how bad the humor was. The plot was stupid and, aside from Matthew Lillard, who did a dead-on Shaggy, the characters were completely uninteresting. At 85 minutes it still felt like it went on way too long.<br /><br />This movie gets one star only because that was the lowest rating possible.  Entertainment for 5 year olds or the recently lobotomized.
B00005JKZT|4.0|Shelob? Who or what is that? If you haven't read the book, don't worry, you'll meet her in the beginning of Return of the King, next Christmas. In Tolkien, however, Shelob appears at the very end of The Two Towers. <br /> There are three major \\"parts\\" to this movie, each \\"part\\" has its own cast. They are as follows: <br /> The Sam, Frodo, and Gollum part: Sam and Frodo continue to take the ring to Mordor, however, they get lost. Gollum, from now on known as Smeagol (Smee-Goal), finds them and promisesss to lead them to Mordor, yesss. As far as CGI characters go, Smeagol far surpasses Yoda. In fact, Smeagol is of the same quality--and perhaps better--than the human-like CGI characters in Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. That's saying ALOT. The best part of the Sam/Frodo/Smeagol part is watching Smeagol have conversations with himself. One part of him is despiccably evil. You hates Smeagol, yesss. The other part of him is rational, trying to be good. You likes Smeagol. <br /> The Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli part: The three are still searching for Merry and Pippin but with no luck. They end up meeting King Theoden and his dark servant (Wormwood? Wormtongue? It's been awhile since I read the book). Gandalf the White appears and performs a sort of excorcism on the possessed King Theoden. Now that he's rational again (sorta), King Theoden marches his people to Helm's Deep, a strong fortress and place of safety. There, the main characters of this part and their forces make a stand against some 10,000 enemies. This last battle is really excellent, except for the fact that Peter Jackson has a nasty habit of getting too close to the action sometimes, resulting in blurry scenes of action. <br /> The Merry and Pippin part: The two hobbits escape from the Orcs and find themselves in Fangorn forest, where they're found by a kindly Ent (A walking, talking tree). This part is very short in comparison but the end where the Ents attack Isengard is worthwhile. <br /> Fellowship of the Ring was very linear but easy to follow. The Two Towers skips around the three \\"parts\\", sometimes making it hard to follow. Also, I found the Two Towers to be much slower moving--especially the middle. But don't let these things prevent you from seeing this movie. It still TOWERS over most fantasy movies and even movies in general.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney Spears is a fantastic, talented singer. She just rocks, and I listen to her c.d.'s every day. Here is my personal rating for each track:<br />1. Slave 4 You- I love this song. You can totally get up and dance to it. It's one of those songs that really show Britney has grown up! Grade- A+<br />2. Overprotectod- Still a great song to dance too, but it kind of gets annoying after a while if you listen too it too much. I do love the vocals, though. Grade- B<br />3. Lonely- Once of the BEST songs on this album. I love everything about it- the melody, the song, the feel. Grade- A+<br />4. I'm Not A Girl- Okay song, but I think that it really dosn't make that much sense, because Britney is 21, for Pete's sake. Isn't that a woman? However, I like to sing along with it. Grade-B-<br />5. Boys- Great song, nice melody, fun to dance to, but I like the remix from Austin Powers 3 better. Grade- B-<br />6. Anticipating- I didn't like this song a lot, but I love listening to it. It puts me in a good mood. It should go on Britney's first album, because it sounds a lot like the bubblegum pop which she used to sing.  Grade- C+<br />7. I Love Rock and Roll- Great new version of the old song, and fun to sing and dance too. I thought it was a little too slow, but terrific song. Grade- A-<br />8. Cinderella- I like this song a lot. It's so much fun to sing and dance too, once again. Plus, every time I hear it I become really happy, for a reason I don't know.<br />9.Let Me Be- I just didn't like this song. If you ask me, I think it's boring, and it's kinda annoying. Grade- C-<br />10.- Bombastic Love- Great song! I love it, it's so \\"Britney\\". The oprah segment was cool, too. Grade- A<br />11. That's Where You Take Me- I dislike this song for the same reasons as Let Me Be. Grade- C-<br />12. What It's Like to Be Me- Without question, the best song on this album. I love it, and I love everything about it, but it's too short! Grade- A+
B00001ZWTT|1.0|All I have to say is, read the heading on this review. That pretty much says it all, folks! Smith and Klein make the worst duo since Wilder and Danny Glover in that forgotten movie in which Wilder ends up in a giant vat of beer? milk? Who remembers? Who cares? Which is exactly my attitude about this boring, cliche \\"period piece\\" (???) comedy/actioner. The special effects are mind-numbing, the sets gaudy and the acting pitiful. The three main stars (Smith, Klein & the lovely Salma Hayek) should stick to what they know...which is dissin' on Tommy Lee Jones, starring as the pompous American in obscure British imports (,i.e.: A Fish Called Wanda, Fierce Creatures) and doing a healthy amount of pole dancing respectively. Hayek's crack was, perhaps, the only thing of any substance in this skewering of a classic. And Buffalo Bill from \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" (Ted Levine) was kooky as the general. zzzzzzzzzz's
B00006JJ1O|5.0|Well, for big t.A.T.u. fans I have good news and bad news. The good news is that the song \\"All The Things She Said\\" is the new theme music for one of WWE's wrestlers. Yup, this is WWE Victoria's new theme/into music. Kinda goes well with her psychotic character. The bad news is, the song will be played over and over and over again. It's going to get embedded into the heads of corporate America and go commercial thanks to the Marketing Machine known as the WWE. Hope you're ready for it. If you don't like it, thank Vince McMahon. Bring on more School Girl H.L.A.!!! God Bless you buddy!
B00003CXCT|5.0|Star Wars is one of the best movies of all time. Now I know the orginal trilogy won't be out on dvd until 2006 but it's worth the wait. I hope george lucas put the orginal version and the special edition versions of star wars, the empire strikes back, and return of the jedi on dvd. Also there is a lot of orginal making of documentarys and the original trailers.
B000059QY2|5.0|I liked this DVD from beginning to end !<br />This is the movie version of Verdi's tragic masterpiece Rigoletto. I must admit, that up to this point, I had not been a big fan of operas that had been made into movies: but I have to make an exception in this instance. Filmed in Italy by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle, the settings consist of real castles, streets and rivers that lend a sublime atmosphere and ambience to the opera being presented here. It would be impossible for a stage version to present such elaborate surroundings. The costumes, throughout, are nothing short of sumptuous and fit perfectly into the era they were intended to represent. The camera angles were well placed with the only negative comment being that some of the facial shots were ultra closeup.<br />This work stars Ingvar Wixell (Rigoletto), Luciano Pavarotti (Duke of Mantova) and Edita Gruberova (Gilda).<br /> Luciano Pavarotti is in his singing prime in this production and his acting, although not great, is passable. Gruberova has a great voice and does justice to her part as Gilda. It is however Ingvar Wixell that commands the audiences' attention with his fabulous interpretation of the tragic hero, Rigoletto. His performance, in my opinion, is worthy of acting honors and his singing voice is as impressive as his stage presence throughout the entire work. He simply carries the show from beginning to end.<br />I was much more impressed with this performance than I thought I would be and could highly recommended it without any reservations: A Rigoletto you will be happy to own.
B00005QZWI|4.0|I really like this soundtack, and I listen to it all the time, especially the hobbity parts.... I especially like the usage of the strings in the beginning of \\"The Breaking of the Fellowship.\\" As I said, I like the Celtic kind of music of the Hobbits, but I think the beginning of \\"The Black Rider\\" is a little too cute.... but oh well. It certainly doesn't outweigh the rest of this beautiful score. The only thing I found truely maddening was the cut out ending of \\"The Bridge of Khazad-Dum\\" which is in the movie but not on the soundtrack (just watch the part where they're all sad after Gandalf falls and listen to the music behind it. It's maginificent, but not on the soundtrack!!! AARRGGHH!!). Well, all in all, this soundtrack is great. It has many different moods and transitions in it and creates an overwhelming feeling.
B000065V41|5.0|This is one of our family favorites. A wonderful telling of the story. We also have a laser disc version in widescreen. Sadly Disney nor Amazon.commention that this dvd version is pan and scan. So I dutifully bought mine, assuming the best. I'm disappointed that Disney didn't go the extra ten yards and either put both editions on the disk or offer a widescreen. The pan and scan loses so much of the visual power. C'mon Walt! Quality counts. But you got me, now I'll have to pay you once more.
1587990717|3.0|If you are looking for a book that includes detailed analysis and supporting data, this is not it.  Fooled By Randomness is composed of a series of very enjoyable stories that illustrate the foibles of many investors and make the key points of the author.  The book is very readable, but ultimately I found it lacking in substance.
B00007E8V4|3.0|I'm sorry but this album feels rushed. Perhaps maybe because all these songs are actually old material remixed. Either way, I can see why this material was scrapped in the past, because most of it just isn't very good, sadly. There are some nice songs for sure, but ultimately, the rest of the cd is a snoozfest with nothing new, or innovative; basically it sounds like Toxicity except most of the songs aren't very well written with the exception of &quot;I-E-A-I-A-I-O&quot;, &quot;Mr. Jack&quot;, &quot;Highway Song&quot;, &quot;Innervision&quot;, &quot;Roulette&quot; and &quot;Ego Brain&quot;. If your a hardcore SOAD fan, then go ahead and get the cd, otherwise just get those songs. Strike for SOAD.
014028009X|2.0|I am probably one of the few who felt this book did not live up to its hype. Sure, there were some funny parts that I chuckled over, but for the most I found it quite disturbing that the protagonist was so embarrasingly desperate for a boyfriend and that she felt that being all of 126 pounds (Oh, the sheer horror of it!) meant that she was too fat. If today's women find that they can easily relate to being obsessed with ridiculous diets (when they are already rather small) and not being secure enough to be happy without a man, then authors such as Kate Chopin and Zora Neale Hurston obviously wrote about their strong female characters in vain. <BR> On the other hand, I do realize it's simply a work of fiction and that every novel doesn't have to have some life-affirming message at the end. So if you find yourself with a few hours to pass, this light,quick (albeit 'fluffy') read is actually not the worst way to go. You might even laugh a time or two.
B00007E8V4|5.0|It is very arguable as to which SOAD album is the best, but really, who cares, this is simply another great achievement for SOAD. 'Steal This Album' isn't very innovative or even that much different then the other SOAD albums, but in this case, it's probably a good thing, so lets keep it that way. This album kind of takes a lot of the 1st album and Toxicity and combines it. You have your usual silly songs, like &quot;Chic 'N' Stu&quot;, then you have your more serious songs like &quot;Mr. Jack&quot;. If your an SOAD fan, go buy the cd, nuff said.
B000001EC1|5.0|Great collection of Hits, the only missing is Born to be my baby.<BR>The two new tracks &quot;always&quot; and &quot;saturday...&quot; are great, I recommend this CD to any Bon Jovi fun.
6300181553|5.0|The movie begins with the song and dance team of <BR>Bing Crosby (Jim), Fred Astaire (Ted)and their female singing<BR>and dance partner (Lila?).  Bing and her are engaged and he's<BR>planning to break the news to her and Ted that he's planning on<BR>leaving show business to retreat to the country and take it <BR>easy for awhile.  But before he can announce it he gets some news of his own.  Ted and Lila decide to get married and she<BR>dumps Bing.  Bing finds out otherwise that life on a farm is not so relaxing getting up at daylight each morning and decides instead to make the farm an Inn open only on Holidays, hence the name Holiday Inn.  A new girl enters into Bings life when she auditions for him at the Inn.  They sing &quot;White Christmas&quot; together.  Ted shows up on New Years eve drunk and dances with Bing's new girl.  Seems Lila dumped him for a Texan supposed to have millions. They are great dancing together.  His agent sees her too (from behind).  The next morning Ted can't remember much of anything.  Ted said he would recognize her though if he ever danced with her again.  He and the agent vow to return to the Inn for the next Holiday to find the mystery woman.  Jim tries to keep them from running into each other.  That is part of the reason for the blackface routine for Lincoln's birthday.  Ted and the agent showed up but didn't recognize her with her face blacked and her hair in pigtails.<br />Bing's girl discovers his plan to keep her from being discovered by Hollywood producers and she leaves with Ted to make a movie based on the Inn.<br />If you're interested to find out if Bing gets the girl you should see this movie.  I enjoyed the Irving Berlin songs and the costumes by Edith Head.  My favorite part of the movie is Fred Astaire's firecracker dance for July 4th.  This is a nice movie for Holiday viewing.
B00005J73X|3.0|I have been a fun of Bon Jovi since 1986. One wild night is their first live album with so many hits I was expecting a better selection of songs what happend with Livin in Sin, Always, Bed of Roses, I'll be there for you, Blaze of Glory, etc.<BR>Buy crossroad instead of this if you want a compilation of Bon Jovi's hits.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I'm the person who buys the entire CD and has to listen to the WHOLE thing about 500 times before I actually like every song on it. But this one, I popped it in, and LOVED EVERY SONG RIGHT OFF THE BAT! Even though the only song I had heard till before I bought it was &quot;All The Things She Said&quot;. I was very skeptical to buy the whole CD, but they didn't have a single so I bought the whole thing. You should totally check it out! If you like &quot;All The Things She Said&quot; then you'll love the whole CD. Tons of heart and soul with an AWESOME beat EVERY Time.. PROMISE
B00005QDW5|5.0|I have been a Pink Floyd fun for the last five years, this CD is an example of their long career. My only complaint is, there are too many song (six) of their last two studio albums, 2 would be enought considering that the Pink Floyd of the late 80's and 90's is not the shadow of Pink Floyd in the 70's. But Echoes is great to listen in your car.
B000059H99|5.0|What can I say?  It's Rocky.  Plain and simple and wonderful.  I won't go over the plot; that's been done in all the other reviews.  I will only say that this is a classic underdog movie that, if nothing else, will make you want to go run a few laps around Philadelphia.  If you haven't seen it, see it.  You'll love it, I promise.
B00004Z459|5.0|this is more like 4.5 stars. i dont care if this is a nu-metal band or whatever. these guys arent even metal. they are, however, rock. i was already sort of into rock, but this is the cd that really got me into rock. and now i listen to punk, rock, and metal. they saved me from all the other awful crap. i have my brother's best friend to thank for introducing this to me. we were all on a ski trip, and he played this in the car. my bro had mentioned these guys before, and i had heard them before and thought that they were okay. when my brother's friend played them, i thought it was good, but it was heavier than what i normally listened to. after a few listens through to it, i realized i loved it, and immeaditely stole my bro's copy, and it didnt leave my cd player for months, until i accidentally lost it. i got the reanimation cd then. i drove all my friends insane talking about them. i then got this cd again for christmas, which i was happy about. i dont like these guys quite as much as i used to, but i still love 'em. heres a quick rating of each song-<BR>1.papercut- this is a great song about paranoia, and is a  cool video. 5/5<BR>2.one step closer- kinda weird video, but awesome, and a cool song, too. 5/5<BR>3.with you- one of my least fav, but still great. 4/5<BR>4.points of authority- this is a good song, but i dont understand why it gets quite so much hype from people. 4.5/5<BR>5.crawling- cool video, good song. 5/5<BR>6.runaway- good. 4.5/5<BR>7.by myself- another cool one. 4.5/5<br />8.in the end- way too overplayed, but it has a cool video. 4/5<BR>9.a place for my head- awesome! one of my favs. 5/5<BR>10.forgotten- another great song- 4.5/5<BR>11.cure for the itch- just mr. hahn deejaying, but still cool. 4/5<BR>12.pushing me away- this was one of the first songs that i loved by then, but i got kinda sick of it. 4/5<BR>overall, an excellent cd which you should check out, if u like rap-rock. i cant wait for their next cd, which is due sumtime in march 2003.rock on, guys!
0385503954|5.0|McEwan is obviously a technically superb writer, but there are many of those about.  McEwan adds a heart for his story and an incisiveness about people that is truly amazing.  With his story, McEwan explores the petty sources of sin and the inordinate price -- indeed, humanly speaking, its unattainability -- of forgiveness.  If you are to read but one fiction book this year, make this one the one.
B000002H2H|4.0|This is a very good metal album.These were the days when Metallica had an Iron Maiden vibe about them and this shows on the title track and 'Creeping Death'. When you listen to the load album you can only stare at your stereo in disbelief comparing it to this.'Fade to Black' is a magnificent song- Metallica's first acoustic song.'For Whom The Bell Tolls'is my personel fav on the album with its thundering bass lines courtesy of the brilliant Cliff Burton and the song's poetic lyrics.I would say it is Metallica's darkest album whilst it does not have quite the same conviction and complexity as the subseqeunt 'Master of Puppets'.'The Call of Ktulu' is a genius instrumental to close the album- an eight minute epic if ever there was one.Yep it don't get much better than this.
B000001F7R|4.0|THis debut is one of Leppard´s best albums, even notoriously counting with a very low budget to produce it. But it´s fresh, it´s rocking, it´s energetic. Drummer Rick Allen really tried to explore his drum kit in those days and they sound explosive (I´m not forgetiing about his accident. In PYROMANIA, he still had both arms, but he practically did not explore his drums due to the new mucical direction chosen by the band, producer Mutt Lange and the record company. HYSTERIA simply sustained that course of action).<br />I enjoy this album a lot.
B00007BH5C|4.0|So far, I haven't enjoyed this soundtrack quite as much as FOTR's, but that soundtrack took a while to grow on me. Obviously, this CD has a much darker tone than the previous one. I personally really like the Rohan theme - it works really well. The first few tracks seem kind of jumpy, moving from one theme or tempo or tone to another too much. This works fine in the context of the film, but just listening to it feels somewhat disjointed. All in all though, it's better than most of the soundtracks out there. Just, if you haven't bought the soundtrack to FOTR, buy that first.<br />Oh, and just a note to the reviewer who said that the trailer \\"BLATANTLY stole\\" the music from Requiem for a Dream. Actually, movie trailers do this all the time. Very very rarely do movies use original music in trailers, because the composer hasn't written music yet. Personally, I thought the remix of Requiem's music worked really well in the trailer, and it will most likely introduce a lot of people to the great soundtrack of that movie.
B00005OADE|3.0|This is a solid Heep output. New frontman Johan LAwton has a great voice, and fills the shoes of David Byron appropriately. Unfortuntely, the dance of musicians would continue to plague Heep for a long time, and Lawton was soon gone, coming their weakest album to date, CONQUEST.
0375707972|5.0|Sure, the translation might weaken the language some.  I've read so many people say that it's an easy read, however so many elements enter this work from so many angles.  I was left with both regret and rejoicing that I have never had a relationship that affected me to the bone--something I could never shake.  <br />The theme of illiteracy should not be taken lightly, I think.  We are such an educated people now.  Can you imagine how devastating the inability to read must have been only a few decades ago?  To think that a Nazi criminal would accept prison than admit that she is illiterate makes me appreciate my education and that of this nation so very much.  Nearly all of us can read, can we not?<br />I highly recommend this book, but take it slowly and ingest it, even though the vocabulary and language is simple.
B000002H6C|3.0|Oh boy, how to review this album?? Musically, it´s great. METALLICA really went for it, tried to make its own mark instead of only copying the British heavy metal bands of the eighties.<br />This was the debut by new bass player Jason Newsted. Clearly a man of integrity and with his own ideas, one was supposed to believe that METALLICA will grow a lot more.<br />BUt the ironic result was that, even with superb and intrincate compositions, the bass simply CANNOT BE HEARD INT HE WHOLE ALBUM!! THis, along with the thin guitar sound, meant doom to us fans. WHy am I saying that?  Metallica, thinking something went wrong in this album, changed producer Flemming Rasmussen, went for producer Bob Rock, and we all know what happened.... Hey never tried again to write such ambitious, intelligent and clever written heavy metal. They went for the mainstream ONCE AND FOR ALL..
B0000648WZ|3.0|If you read Robert Heinlein's book, you're going to be disappointed because this movie has very little to do with the book besides character's names, settings and place in time. It's still a fairly good movie (as far as an action sci fi goes) and yes it's very brutal as well (hence 3 stars and not 1). If you haven't read the book, then you're O.k. because the book really instills the thought of the true horrors that are war whereas the movie just depicts a terrible war between us and them (bugs).<br />In any case, if you read it, leave it at that because you'll be happier and if you haven't read it, then you will definately enjoy this movie.
B000002B35|1.0|Great idea: to listen to DARK SIDE OF THE MOON live, performed by another band, be it: without Roger Waters and with &quot;tons&quot; of extra session musicians!
B00005JKDR|5.0|Monsters Inc is another great hit from the Disney/Pixar series! Monstaers Inc is about the world of Monsters in our closets and why they come out. In the movie, it's established that a scream will give power and energy, that same power and energy is needed to fuel the city of the Monsters. So like factory clock work, the Monsters go in every morning (night for us humans) and scare people to get that scream.<br />Sully (John Goodman) is the #1 Scarer and his partner Mike (Billy Crystal) is there at his side making sure he catches each scream. Their biggest competition for the #1 slot is Randall (Steve Buscemi). After a night's work, Mike decides to go home and Sully stay behind making sure his paperwork is done and that's when Sully finds Randall cheating and helping his numbers by doing unauthorized scares! Realizing this Sully goes to investigate and finds out that by accident, a little girl has broken into the Monster world! It's up to Sully and Mike to hide her from the authorities and get her home dafely. It's a animaterd comedy adventure that keeps you rolling and brings you to tears.<br />I have to admit, I'm not much of a Disney fan anymore ever since the power days of Disney in the late 80's with the Little Mermaid to 1994's The Lion King, but NOW with these great computer animated full features, I can safely say that I can't wait for Disney to do more of these because there are enjoyable for all ages.<br />Plus the bonus DVD has a lot of great extras in it like the short feature &quot;Mike's New Car&quot;, outtakes and other great features. This is a movie that I'd suggest any family to pop in and have a family movie night. And of course if you're looking for more great Disney/Pixar films, check out TOY STORY and TOY STORY 2 and A BUG'S LIFE. You'll be greatly satisfied. Enjoy!
B000001FKY|2.0|Producer Robert John Lange got the midas touch. Working with very different type of artists, he managed to produce three of the best selling albums of all time: AC/DC´s Back in Black, Shania Twain´s COME ON OVER and, on a lesser scale, Def Leppard´s HYSTERIA and PYROMANIA. SO, the guy knows his craft, no doubt about that.<br />But that does not mean that HYSTERIA is such a great album, no way! Much on the contrary, it marked the end of Leppard´s &quot;hard rock days&quot;, and tranformed them into a totally commercial outfit, full of ballads, cliched love lyrics, all fruit of an totally focused effort to appeal to MTV audience and girls.<br />Also the sound production is terribly glossy, rounded, polished. The drums were the worst part of all (I´m not taking awaya the merits of drummer Rick Allen hard recovery after his accident. I´m talking about the highly reverbed drum sound, not the drummer´s technique!)<br />Is imply do not like this album. I prefer their first three albums.
6305627401|4.0|This has to be one of dirtiest movies I've ever seen. There is a lot and when I say a lot, I mean A LOT of swearing in it. There's also a lot of references to homosexuality, perceptions of both Heavan and Hell that are completely insane and of course, the 4 baddest 3rd graders around, Stan, Kyle, Kenny and Cartman.<br />South Park the Movie is a total swearfest, musical that'll make you laugh just because it's that dirty. It starts out as the boys need to see the Terrence and Phillip Movie and from there, they learn all of their new potty mouth slang. BEcause of that, their parents decide that the T & P Movie has to be stopped, BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY. This is a total spit in the face of every Disney musical and pretty much every movie out there.<br />I gotta say as entertaining as the movie was the down side was all of the musical numbers. Now granted yes, they were done to mess with Disney but at the same time, I think this movie pretty much lost me in it's plot after the \\"What Would Brian Boitano Do?\\" number. Other than that, it was great.<br />Now just like the TV show, THIS MOCIE IS NOT FOR ANY YOUNG ONES!!! Seriously, this is an adult movie because of all of the swearing and some of the other things that are in this movie. Other than that, pretty funny. Check it out. Just make sure you don't have any young children around because I assure you they will be uttering some pretty nasty words if they see this.
B00005OW5V|3.0|When everybody (Mick Box included) was thinking that Uriah Heep was gone for sure, the band obtined a new fresh of life recruting Bob Daisley, Lee Kerslake, John Sinclair and the very good singer Peter Goalby.<br />The result was ABOMINOG, a solid hard rock album, with polished production a little bit orientated for mainstream. Maybe because this line up was brand new and still a little bit unsure where to go, 5 of the ten songs on the original album are covers, but very well chosen covers!<br />I really enjoy this album, and it´s not dated. best song for nme: &quot;Running All Night With The Lion&quot;.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Move over Disney because here comes Shrek! This was one of the best animated films that I had seen since Disney last great, The Lion King. Don't get me wrong there have been others as well (like TOY STORY and TOY STORY 2), but Shrek really stands apart from them all because, it's funny, witty and a great movie all together.<br />Shrek (Mike Myers) is an Ogre who just wants to be left alone but because of evil Lord Farquadd (John Lithgow) who has made a declaration to find and rid his land of all fairy tale creatures. In turn, they all getted dumped into Shrek's swamp and he's not too happy about that. Along with his companion Donkey (Eddie Murphy), Shrek sets out to go meet with Lord Farquadd to get all of the fairy tale characters out of his swap. Farquadd then tells Shrek that he will get rid of them if Shrek can defeat a dragon and rescue sleeping Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) so that Farquadd can marry her and become King. It's a movie that'll make you laugh and your kids laugh too.<br />This is a great film! It's very funny and a great story along with excellent animation and the comedy of Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy will keep you laughing for hours. Also, the DVD has some great features as well, if you're into the extras. A perfect movie for anyone. Check this out! You won't be disappointed!
B000063DIR|1.0|They (Ozzy, Sharon, Sony Music and whoever!)took the best two Ozzy albums and destroyed them due to a judicial process (in which they are clearly WRONG) involving bassist Bob Daisley and drummer Lee Kerslake. This is a shame not just to Bod and Lee, but also to Randy Rhoad´s memory, he being a fundamental part of this classic...<br />I cannot believe Ozzy agreed to do it. Bob was hired so many times in the past to save potential floppy releases by Ozzy and to write intelligent lyrics for him.<br />Greedy sometimes appears where you´d least expect it. That Ozzy has almost no talent to write his own songs I already knew...that Ozzy has serious health problems tha may cloud his better judgement sometimes, I already knew...that Sharon conducts his career like if he was a puppet, I already knew... But I also tought Ozzy could be a lovely chap when he wanted to, that was that that was responsible for his charisma... And thenn, all of a sudden, I realize even this is not true...<br />Well, I´ll keep my 1995 release both of Blizzard and Diary. They are the real thing.
B000059QY2|2.0|I showed this at my opera club, and only the newbie was happy with it.  Yes, the sets are gorgeous and evocative, and the singing was very good.  But this DVD suffers from the choice of the director to do so many closeups.  Pavarotti's voice can still make you want to close your eyes in ecstasy -- but he plays a blustery, overbearing Duke, making it hard to see why Gilda falls for him.  (There's already precious little in the libretto to make the Duke sympathetic, and Pavarotti doesn't use what's there.)  He has a disconcerting way of opening his eyes VERY wide and not blinking.  It would be easier for the viewer to maintain an illusion of young lovers if the camera were moved back a bit from *both* romantic leads...  Gruberova's voice is accurate, but after hearing the rich, plush young tone of Desiree Rancatore in the recent San Francisco Opera production, it's just not the same.  Overall, well sung and well set, but ultimately unsatisfying.
B000005DSN|1.0|Well, this band is boring. Utterly boring. Copying. Screaming. No punch. Clean. Polished. Cheesy.<br />Jens Johansson was not a great addition, it´s enough to see some performances of him live with Yngwie Malmsteen. The guy is a session musician, he goes wherever he get paid more.<br />The rest of the band is tasteless and without any real &quot;nager&quot; in their instruments, the should call this style &quot;CLEAN AND SAFE EUROPEAN POWER METAL&quot;. There´s no edge. No guts.
B00006G8HX|4.0|What could be cooler than to steal the Enterprise? Would you ever have thought Kirk & Co. would go that far? STIII is a shocker in many ways. Its character charisma retains well and bands them into (of all things) outlaws in cohoots with the Vulcan Ambassador, Sarek. The movie plays on the feelings left over from the end of STII and creates a gut-wrenching, tight story. III provides, ST fans with new toys...the Klingon Bird of Prey, science vessels, and the \\"great experiment\\" USS Excelsior (a far superior ship than the refitted Enterprise). Although, the Excelsior is not immune from Mr. Scott's handiwork, it's still a nice visual site (as is the interior of Spacedock). The crew goes on a forbidden mission back to Genesis, steals the Enterprise, and duels with the Bird of Prey. These luxuries combine to a few sad moments, a goodbye to a ST mainstay, and the spiritual ending that leaves you wanting for more and anticipating ST: IV. I left one star off because it does have a few boring moments...about 7 minutes worth. The adventure begins, again...
B00005JLS0|4.0|Hugh Grant (as George Wade) went above and beyond in this film, truly brilliant in his comedic timing.  He plays a rich man with no real job, despite the fact that he co-owns one of the biggest companies in NYC with his brother.  As you follow his character, you can't wait to see what he will do or say next to Lucy (Sandra Bullock), his smart, extremely liberal, chief legal counsel.  The only problem is that Bullock doesn't really meet either his wit or charm.  She is cute, and you feel for her character as you watch the interactions between George and Lucy, but the chemistry is only so-so.  She isn't one of my favorite actresses, and I feel she played this character much like she did her character in Miss Congeniality.  Overall though, Grant makes up for all her sometimes on/sometimes off character.  If you like Hugh Grant, definitely see this movie!

0060282983|5.0|This book is nothing short of a masterpiece.  This was the first \\"grown-up\\" book I ever read, and I remember crying my eyes out at the end.  I'm now 22-years-old, and I decided to take the book off the shelf today, dust it off, and read it again, just for old time's sake.  I cried just as much this time around as I did when I was eight and read this book for the first time.<br />Wilbur was born a \\"runt,\\" an under-developed member of a large litter of pigs.  Fern, the daughter of the farmer who owns the barn in which Wilbur was born, pleads with her father to spare his life, so he does.  In order to ensure Wilbur's safety, Charlotte the barnyard spider writes messages in her web describing Wilbur to the farmer in an attempt to convince him to spare Wilbur's life.  <br />The real strength of this story is in the friendship between Charlotte and Wilbur.  While she's just a spider, Charlotte acts as Wilbur's guardian angel.  There are also quite a few comical episodes within the story, and other colorful supporting characters.  <br />While there's an incredible amount of joy and fun in this novel, the author also masterfully handles the tough issue of explaining the concept of death to a child.  E.B. White finds a gentle way of explaining mortality and the circle of life.  <br />I'd recommend this book to any parents who is trying to explain these important concepts to their children.  This is a brilliant and important novel, and no child should ever grow up without having read it.

0790738074|5.0|Every year in music class in elementary school I watched this movie and it is still one of my favorites.  Who can resist Shirley Jones &quot;Marian the librarian&quot; and Robert Preston's  &quot;Professor Harold Hill?&quot;  And let's not forget Ron Howard's adorable lisping character &quot;Winthrop,&quot; plus singable songs like &quot;76 Trombones&quot; and &quot;Ya Got Trouble.&quot;  The acting is great, the songs are great, and the whole movie is great.  Even if you don't enjoy musicals, give this one a try.  You won't be sorry you did.
0783225792|4.0|I love Casino.  The fact that it's based on a true story is probably what makes the plot so interesting.  The movie also gives you a sort of &quot;behind the scenes&quot; look at how Vegas works:  the flow of money to the count room, the surveillance security, etc.  To top it all off, the cast in this movie is rock solid.  Sharon Stone does an absolutely amazing job playing the greedy junky.  Robert De Niro is awesome as the ruthless yet nerdy Ace Rothstein (how about those clothes?!?).  And Joe Pesci does an excellent job playing the violent out-of-control mobster (similar to his role in GoodFellas).<BR> My only complaint about the DVD is the lack of special features.  There's some text about the actors that you can read, but not much else.  I remember at about the time that Casino was originally released in theaters there was a story about Frank &quot;Lefty&quot; Rosenthal (the real-life basis for DeNiro's &quot;Ace Rothstein&quot; character) that aired on DateLine or PrimeTime or one of those news magazine shows.  It was fascinating seeing the true life character that the movie was based on, but for some reason that footage was not included on this DVD.  Why not?
630438551X|1.0|Shakespeare would have rolled over in his grave when he saw this movie! the combination of overdramatic acting, chaos, and Elizabethan language in a present day setting is enough to make anyone roll over in their grave! the movie is so jam-packed with outrageously dream-like sequences that you'd have to be a fool to enjoy it.  it goes by so fast that when you blink it's over.  this movie proves that you can't take 15th century Europe and convert it to 20th century California.
0316666343|4.0|This is the first book I've enjoyed in a long time.  The characters are memorable &amp; if for any reason at all you read this book, it should be because it makes you stop to appreciate life.  It reminded me of the movie &quot;What Dreams May Come&quot; in a very small yet significant way.
0066214122|4.0|He's not merely a great author -- Crichton is one of the most imaginative, inventive writers of our times.  This, his 13th work of fiction, reminds us of the empire he spawned with Jurassic Park -- a story plausible enough to scare us, entertain us, educate us, and grip us from start to finish.  Ironically, the book starts out a little slow, laying the framework for recently turned house-husband Jack Forman, his ex-work circumstances, his family, and his daily routine.  Our author nailed this role so accurately we began to resent the wife's &quot;interference&quot; in the household! The story soon reveals Jack's concerns about wife Julia, an executive at a leading edge tech firm, making &quot;molecular&quot; level devices that work to create artificial vision.  [Here's where a few tutorials about nanotechnology slow us down just a little too.]  But when the swarms of these devices go awry, really bad things begin to happen.  Jack is brought in to solve some potential programming problems, but literal survival, rather than fine tuning coding logic, emerges immediately as the challenge at hand.  We even wonder at one point who the real humans may or may not be.<br />From the extensive bibliography at the end to the author's foreword about the potential for artificial evolution, the book gives every appearance of solid research.  Couple that with a Stephen King-like premise, toss in a hero or two we like, generate some marital tension, and conclude with a fight to survive, and we get 350 pages or so that fly with the wind. Don't miss this one!!
B00006CXSS|5.0|This title is simply the best television production ever made. Period.  There are very few DVD's that I can watch over and over again, and this is one of them.  It was very expensive to make, and every dollar shows.  Glorious!
B000001ZS3|5.0|Many electronic musicians has been influenced somehow by this &quot;Mozart&quot; from the synthetizer era. It is the art of creating an organic symphony by mastering the technique of tweaking a synthetic sound wave.<BR>If you have been into electronic music and computers since the 70's , bet you have heard several versions of his music on personal computers like the 8  &amp; 16 bits Commodores (not the poor MIDI conversions found lately for PC's)<br />I also have a DVD concert and the show is absolutely fascinating as you see dancing fireworks, mind boggling large scale projections and laser-light instruments! many concerts pale in comparision!<br />This is no New Age, Tecno or anything like that... this is pure and genuine synth music at its best!  I got these CDs not only to add value to my music collection, but also as a tribute.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|His fourth album for American Recordings, many people (press and fans alike) have claimed that &quot;The Man Comes Around&quot; is one of the best (maybe the best) albums of Johnny Cash's career.  Not into hype, I had to listen to the album first.  And unlike many other things, this album lives up - and goes beyond - the hype and &quot;great expectations&quot;.<br />From the opening title track, you know that Johnny's tone for the album is solemn and somber.  At 70, and just starting to get the upperhand on his health problems, Johnny must have had plenty of time to reflect on his life, as it is shown in this album.  The pure depression ans sadness of songs such as &quot;Hurt&quot; shows how deep Johnny can go into the dark roads of life.  Yet as the album concludes with &quot;We'll Meet Again&quot;, Johnny seems to see a ray of hope, thus providing a &quot;happy ending&quot; to a dark and deep album.   <br />As for his voice, even after all these years, he's still got it.  If anything, the aging in his voice justs gives the songs more depth and feeling.  At an age where most musicians think about retirement, Johnny shows that he's not ready to quit just yet.

6305265488|5.0|When \\"Ever After\\" came out in theaters several years ago, I had dismissed it as just another chic flick. It wasn't until a year or so afterwards that I decided to rent it and was so impressed by it, that I bought a copy shortly after. While this movie is a romantic rendition of \\"Cinderella\\" (one of my favorite fairy tales), the story is meant to be thought of as real. It takes place in 16th-century France where the orphaned heroine, Danielle de Barbarac (played by Drew Barrymore), lives in the country with her evil stepmother (Anjelica Huston) and two stepsisters (Megan Dodds and Melanie Lynskey, though Melanie is slightly nicer).<br />One day Danielle pretends to be a courtier to free one of her household's servants from being sent to the Americas, resulting in Prince Henry (Dougray Scott) falling in love with her--though they had met previously when she had knocked him flat off his horse by throwing an apple at his head. (She had mistaken him for a thief.) Yet he doesn't realize that's who she really is--a peasant. Danielle knows she cannot keep her identity a secret for much longer, especially with the jealous scheming of her stepfamily--not to mention the growing affection from Prince Henry. But will he be understanding when he finds out the truth about Danielle?<br />Despite this surprising, yet realistic outcome, \\"Ever After\\" is a wonderfully lighthearted and humorous movie, full of beautiful scenery and costumes. My favorite performance would have to be by Anjelica Huston, who plays Baroness Rodmilla de Ghent, the evil stepmother. She's one of my favorite actresses and pulls the spiteful part of with ease. There are plenty of other terrific characters in this movie as well, such as the sympathetic Leonardo da Vinci (played by Patrick Godfrey), who paints Danielle's portrait and offers the prince worldly and romantic advice.<br />I highly recommend this movie!
0066214122|4.0|Perhaps not Crichton's best book ever, but a solidly gripping tale that will hold your interest.  Good suspense.  The characters aren't overly interesting, but they get the job done.  One of the important things Crichton does with this piece is open the dialogue on the ethics associated with micro-, molecular-, and nano-scale cyber organisms.  As he points out in this story, we always think we know what we're doing when, often, we really haven't come close to grasping the ramifications of our actions.   Good food for thought and discussion.  Read it!
B000059MEK|5.0|I heard &quot;Aerodynamic&quot; used as background music in a video game tutorial video, loved it, got the album.  Not only do you get all these great album tracks, you get around TEN bonus tracks when you log on to the DaftClub web site.  Best value for a CD I've ever gotten.  On top of that, it's oddly appealing - I'll leave it in the car and people that I wouldn't think would like it will love it.  It's a great album - if you're in doubt, at least listen to some of the sample tracks (&quot;Digital Love&quot; being a good sample track).
B00006LLJ4|3.0|This movie starts with an interesting premise.  Through a complex technology that utilizes three wired &quot;pre-cogs&quot; emersed round the clock in a hot tub (now there's a job I'll apply for), murders can be interupted before they occur.  In the riviting opening sequence, a woman is in the middle of an adulterous encounter.  Her husband walks in, raises a knife to stab her, and experiences murderous interuptous by Tom Cruise and his pre-crime unit.  The husband is hauled away, and we're left to wonder--did his wife get to finish what she was doing?<br />But this movie has two fundamental flaws.  First, the cold, bleak, futuristic world is just too complicated and hoaky to care about.  The precogs can predict murders, but not other crimes.  The police in their George Jetson getups can zoom around effortlessly, but they can't clunk Tom Cruise over the head with a stick or nail him with a stun gun.  The wierd lighting and photographic tricks can't disguise the truth.  This world is more laughable than frightening.<br />Second, Tom Cruise is quickly emersed in perilous circumstances.  Presumably, we're supposed to care because he is, after all, Tom Cruise.  But no character development has made us care about him.  Sorry about your wife and kid, Tom, but we need a little more.  The wierd lighting and photographic tricks don't help.  We don't care that you're in danger.  The technology of your world is illogical, and that makes us care even less.<br />The movie suffers in comparison with a movie that is, on one level, rather silly: Demolition Man.  Stallone's futuristic flick creates a human world with people we can care about.  We know the good guys will prevail and the bad guy will get it, but we care.<br />The plot picks up as the movie goes on.  There are some interesting twists and turns, but these suffer a bit from their resemblance to other movies.  A good-guy-turned bad that's straight out of LA Confidential, and an incriminating video that only Robocop couldhave taken.  But the escalating intrigue just can't make up for the fundamental flaws.  For most of the movie, I was hoping a nuclear disaster would befall this heartless, overly complicated world and all its inhabitants.

B00006F7S4|5.0|Rumor has it that Wynona Ryder broke Beck's heart, so I guess we have her to thank for this beautiful and at times heart wrenching album.  This is a far cry from his single \\"Loser\\" which had him pegged as a one-hit-wonder (at least in my book).  Sea Change does not contain any of the fun but kitchy \\"two-turntables-and-a-microphone\\" tracks, trading good drum breaks for strings and forlorn introspection.  Sounding more like Scott Walker than a \\"one man dustbowl\\"  Beck shows his true range and capabilities with this release.
B00006V9A0|5.0|It was more than 10 years ago that Smells Like Teen spirit came out from nowhere and rocked the whole world unlike any other song had done before. All these years after, the abscence of Kurt and Nirvana is still very much strongly felt. Currently only few bands have the passion that Nirvana felt, and surely no band has recorded any album that was as ground breaking as Nevermind.<br />About this CD? To be honest I was a little bit dissapointed with this CD. Mind you, 'You know you're right' is brilliant and all the tracks on the album were masterfully remastered ... but, I expected a double album with much, much more songs that were previously unreleased, something that would re-awaken that passion in the music world that has died with Kurt in 1994. Obviously the only selfish person to blame for this is Courtney Love.<br />Listening to wath Dave Grohl is currently doing on his own and with the Foo's makes me wonder what he and Kurt, who died at only 27 years of age, might have done together. God only knows how many more good songs and albums Nirvana could have given us.<br />The only thing we're left with is, some brilliant work, not too much in quantity, but that was enough to change the history of rock music. If don't own any Nirvana record, go out, and buy this one right now for some pure total NIRVANA.

0345404475|3.0|Philip K. Dick, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (Millennium, 1968)<br />This short novel is best known these days as the basis of Ridley Scott's finest film, Bladerunner. The two are as different as night and day, but the two are roughly recognizable in places, in the same way some people will say \\"you look just like your father\\" to an adopted son. And since it's been a few months since I committed any great literary heresies, it's high time for one: Ridley Scott took the meat of this novel and adapted it into something greater, asking some hard questions that Dick avoided (or, perhaps, never thought to ask).<br />For those who've been living under a rock since Bladerunner's 1982 release, the story involves Rick Deckard, a bounty hunter whose specialty is androids. Androids are no longer supposed to live on Earth; they were created as servants and workers for the mass of the populace, who migrated off earth after a nuclear war left most of the planet devastated. (Those reading the book after seeing the movie are likely to wonder where the huge population of LA comes from, given the mass exodus stage up Dick gives us. Oh, yeah, and the book is set in San Francisco.) Those hardy souls who are left Earthside try to eke out a living however they can, and everyone raises animals. There aren't enough animals to go around, though, and not everyone can afford them, so some people have android animals. Those who have android animals keep such things a grave secret, lest their neighbors shun them. (Deckard and his wife, conspicuously absent from the movie, own the electric sheep, also conspicuously absent from the movie, of the title.)<br />You will notice that very little of the above description matches the film version. Neither does much of the book's action. The number of androids loose on earth is larger in the book, and they go to great lengths to try and off Deckard before he offs them (no descriptions of how here, lest I ruin the book for enterprising readers), leading to some of the book's most surreal, and fun, passages. By the time the reader gets to the end, there are questions in his mind as to whether any of it's real at all, or whether it's existed nowhere but in Deckard's head. The most pressing question in my mind, though, was why Harrison Ford didn't have himself an electric sheep in the movie (and why Rachel, a teen in the book, was played by the much older Sean Young).<br />Had Dick's writing style been as stark and minimal as Scott's vision of the future, the book would have worked in spades. However, Dick tended towards melodrama here, and some of the books passages come off as amusingly overwritten given the subject matter therein. Definitely worth reading for Bladerunner fans, but those attempting Dick for the first time may be better off with his brilliant novel Valis.

0812550706|4.0|Orson Scott Card, Ender's Game (Tor, 1985)<br />Orson Scott Card says in his preface to Ender's Game that one of the main criticisms with the book people have is that gifted kids just don't act and talk like Ender and his battle school mates. To which Card usually responds with something like \\"they're just smart enough not to talk that way around adults.\\"<br />Been there, done that. He's right.<br />The main criticism of the book dispensed with, Ender's Game focuses on young Andrew \\"Ender\\" Wiggin, a genetically-engineered genius recruited by the army at the age of six as a potential battle commander in a war against another race of beings from far off in the galaxy. But, as with most good science fiction, the actual science fiction parts of the book are tangential to the main thrust of the book at best; take out the stuff we can't do in modern-day society and put Ender and pals in a present-day prep school, and the human drama at the book's core remains credible. This is a necessity in any novel written in any genre, and Card carries it off with grace and dexterity.<br />The book's only real failing is that some of the minor characters (a number of Ender's schoolmates with small, but key, roles throughout his life) could have been better developed. But what is there is good; unlike most underdeveloped characters, Card's aren't there solely to advance a specific political or philosophical point of view; think of this particular set of underdeveloped characters as paler than usual rather than cardboard cutouts. They also don't get introduced with the words \\"kill me\\" already branded into their foreheads a la Stephen King or Joe Lansdale. It just would've been nice to see more of them, though that probably would have required a change in narrative perspective.<br />Other than that, everything works here. The book is eminently readable, the characters are believable, the plot flows along. I didn't find myself with the same obsessive devotion to it as many of the book's fans have, but it certainly put me in the mood to continue on with the series, and that can never be a bad thing. Highly recommended. ****fans have, but it certainly put me in the mood to continue on with the series, and that can never be a bad thing. Highly recommended. ****

B00004TH83|5.0|It's true that this album is also for Celine Dion-Fans but I think it's better than Celiine's records because the lyrics are a lot better and the songs are more emotional but not in a shmalzy way. This is really a CD worth giving a try even if you don't like Pop-ballads also because of Lara Fabian's amazing voice.<br />Adagio: I love it. It's a pretty emotional ballad. Check Jeanette's &quot;Deep in my heart &quot;. It has the same melody but it's not as good.<br />Part of me: Tsis song is about the light within your soul. Really good.<br />Givin up on you: Nice mid-tempo-song.<br />You are my heart: This is a Celine Dion-like ballad.<br />I am who I am: This is a great song with an awesome beat. It's about loving yourself.<br />To love again: Another ballad about a girl who can't get over  her lovesickness.<br />You're not from here: This is one of my favourites. About a girl who fell in love with a stranger. Truly great (?)<br />Til I get over you: Another dance song. but it's not similar to &quot;IAWIA&quot;<br />Love by grace: Another sweet ballad.<br />Yeliel: I haven't found out so far what this passionate song is about. Maybe about an inspiring person in her life.<br />I will love again: This dance floor-oriented song has nothing to do with Track six. It was a top 20 hit in Austria.<br />Broken vow: Another great song only with piano, violins and Lara'as magnificent voice.<br />Adagio :(Italian) The english version is a little bit better.

0066214122|1.0|I have to admit I read the whole thing, although skimming the action sequences would not diminish the book's value.  &quot;Prey&quot; is like a bag of Doritos; you know its probably not good for you to eat the whole bag, but its hard to stop.<br />Crichton consistently writes down to his audience by inserting technical details in dialogue.  &quot;Gee,&quot; said Jack, &quot;Tell me more about those molecules.&quot;  At the beginning of the book, I actually thought he was going to develop his characters in a more literary way, then, snap!  Back to the screenplay (with detailed instructions to the special effects crew.)<br />I regret putting my hard-earned cash into this entertainer's pocket.  Maybe I can recover some of my loss by selling my &quot;first edition&quot; in an auction (what was the first edition anyway - 10 million copies?)
0792843584|3.0|No, not even close. Looong, yeah. Slow, of course. But how can a film with so much pointless violence, so many exploding peasants, ever be so ruthlessly dismissed by the youth of today? Truly, I cry for America.<br />Seriously, though, if you're looking for an interesting failure, this pretty much fits the bill. The sound mix is still awful, the editing choppy but there are hints of brilliance here which makes you wish Cimino goes back for a director's cut one day. Christopher Walken puts in a good performance (along with a young Jeff Bridges and Mickey Rourke), and the score is truly haunting. I actually had to read Steven Bach's book (Final Cut) to figure out what was going on, but Heaven's Gate is worth a look if you don't build up your expectations too much (or lower them completely) beforehand.
0385508417|3.0|While it isn't Dostoyevsky or Dickens, neither is it the usual pulp that Grisham has been putting out lately (at least it's not Testament).  This would make a good TV Christmas movie (are you reading this PAX-TV?)  and that TV movie would be a classic.<br />Scrooge could take Bah Humbug! lessons from Luther Krank.  Krank certainly tries to give them to his wife, but fortunately they don't take hold as the daughter's phone call proves.  She's come home after a month in Peru, happily engage to a young doctor.  Seemingly, she's fallen head over heels in love, but the ending proves she's got her head on straight about that, too.  Krank has alienated everyone in the neighborhood but his daughter coming home for Christmas proves that friendship and family and neighbors are thicker than snow getting everyone (including the police, paramedics, and firefighters) to help out and fill the house for the traditional party.  Actually, love wins out for the Krank gives<br />a typical Christmassy Scroogelike response to his neighbors' generosity even if he doesn't make a complete turn around (actually that seems more realistic).
B000001EJ8|4.0|This was the second CD I've got from vangelis, the first one was &quot;Friends of Mr. Cairo&quot; which wasn't instrumental and included Jon Anderson in vocals. The first impression that Portraits gave me was the quality of the sound: &quot;I'll find my way home&quot; (and the others) sounds much better on Portraits than on Friends of Mr Cairo (it's the same song, but after listening to it a lot in the old CD you'll hear the difference in the quality on this CD). That's because Portraits is remastered, each and every single track were restored from the original master tapes: they just sound as if Vangelis recorded these tracks in a digital studio yesterday night. Or better, it's like if a sound engineer traveled to the past with modern digital equipment and he hiden it in the studio where vangelis recorded those tracks. As a result, the sound is crisp, as never, and I can say that not always a remasterisation gets that good. <br />The second impression it gave me was the music, and how did Vangelis evolved over the years, you will hear that on this CD. It starts with old(I really mean old) songs like &quot;To the Unknown man&quot; which may be repetitive but that's the deal, does someone ever hear how repetitive &quot;Boléro&quot; from &quot;Maurice Ravel&quot; is? <BR>Then I really get impressed with &quot;La petite Fille de la Mer&quot;(&quot;the little girl from the sea&quot;). Each and every time I hear to that song I wanna cry. I don't understand how can an instrumental song make someone cry. I don't understand how can that make me cry, it is that beautiful? Yes, it is. Absolutely. Just hear to it and find out. <BR>Then, well, now that I know many Vangelis albums, I really can't say if this is a good compilation or not. Let's say it is a good compilation just to find out what is vangelis (before getting in), so this CD will help you at least to know which era of vangelis you'll like, the old, the modern, the soundtracks or the songs with Jon vocals. After I concluded that every era in vangelis is good, I felt this album is not needed anymore. To make a really good vangelis compilation, you'll need to buy each and every album, buy an MP3 CD player, a CD burner, and take 1 day of your time to rip all the songs you want to hear into One and mighty CD with vangelis MP3 inside. Actually, yes, Vangelis is that good. You'll maybe need to burn more than one mp3 CD....
0380789035|2.0|i was excited about this book when it first came out. i'm a big fan of gaiman's graphic novels and i thought that 'american gods' would launch him securely onto the stage of great sci-fi / fantasy authors. the book starts off well. the main characters are evocatively developed and the hints about the upcoming war between the gods are intriguing.<br />the problem with the book is that it's basically a road trip novel. a trip that gaiman obviously took himelf. because of this, he's too anxious to get to the next location so he can reveal some new facet of americana which, as a brit, he must find incredibly exotic. the effect is a rushed travelogue that eventually takes center stage over the main characters.<br />this book reads like it was hard to write. it reads like it suffered from endless revisions and endless edits. the result is impressively stiched together - but it's still stitched together.<br />['are we living in an age where sex and horror are the new gods?' - frankie goes to hollywood, 1984]
B00006CXSS|5.0|I first saw this series on Global (rights bought from HBO) this past fall and was amazed by the detail and the attention to characters.  I am currently reading the book by Stephen Ambrose and I am a little disappointed that the series and the book don't exactly follow each other.  I know it is impossible for Hanks and Spielberg to exactly follow the book, but some parts in the series that are detailed, take place in the book in a paragraph or a page.  I would recommend reading the book first and then watching the series, but if you decide to do it my way, you won't be tremendously disappointed, both are 5 star qualities!
B00005JKNF|5.0|I went to see this movie at the theater and I will readily admit that I was completely baffled by the critical acclaim it received.  I rented the DVD recently because I was going to give it another chance (well I was going to see what was it I was missing that so many other were seeing)  When I fired up the DVD I decided to listen to the writer's comments.  That transformed this film into a remarkable experience.  So much so I will be buying it to add to my collection.  The details and inticacies of the film and the story come alive as I listen to the writer explain how this story unfolds.  I know many will say that well the movie should be able to stand on its on and in a lot of ways it does.  But listening to the writer answer all the question I had in mind and even more was such a delight.  I recommend getting this movie on DVD just for that reason alone.  There are even more features that I did not get a chance to explore that I am sure will make it even better.  I highly recommend seeing this film!

In this film Marlon gives an amazing performance,so amazingly real in fact that a lot of people thought that the rude and violent Stanley was really how Marlon was in real life.  As the crude, immature and violent brute, you can't take your eyes off of him, and you can't help but love him (and may I just add that the man looks amazing in a torn wet t-shirt, wow!).  The rest of the cast is wonderful, especially Vivien Leigh, whose scenes with Marlon are the best in the film.

B000002UVZ|5.0|I agree with Meatsquare - this was the last worthwile album REM submitted.  I would maybe even include 'Dead Letter Office' (a collection of unreleased and B-side tracks)as being better than anything they put out after 1987. Some say REM went down hill after Stipe shaved his head, I think I stopped listening when the lyrics STOPPED being unintelligible and were brought to the front. I much prefered guessing what was being sung (for example, a portion of the lyrics in 'Sitting Still' off 'Murmur' sounded like &quot;we will gather, throw up beer&quot;).<br />I dissagree that 'Underneath the Bunker' or 'Superman' are throwaway tracks. While not necessarily the highlights of the album, they contribute to the overall Southern Gothic atmosphere of the album - like a wiskey-soaked, kudzu-obscured fever dream.
B00005RIKD|5.0|If you love Sting, love his songs, and love an upbeat jazzy tone to some of his latest and greatest music, you will love this CD.  I had the fortunate opportunity to see him live at a warm up session and concert in December 2000 at his Brand New Day tour in Detroit, MI.  What a gentleman.  What a true human being.  Sting is someone who knows his mind, body, and soul and expresses it thru his music.  It is rare to find true talent as Sting possesses.  Since the tour, I have been a major \\"Sting\\" fan![.]  I asked for this CD for Christmas 2002 and received it.  I played it immediately and loved it.  He has jazzed up some of his old tunes and added a few new songs.  If you his live concert tours via CD, and enjoy jazz, as well as re-makes of his \\"own\\" songs, you will love this CD.  Additionally, I felt as though I was at one of his jam sessions listening to this CD.  It sounded as he and the band were all having a great time playing these songs.  Finally, this album was recorded on September 11, 2001 . . . and Sting had the humanity and respect to dedicate this album to all who lost their lives that day.  Also, within the last song . . . he always introduces his band members by name and instrument.  He doesn't forget the musicians and members that make him look good.  I have always been told, surround yourself by people that make you look good and you will look good too.  If you think you are going to look better by having people that are not so good, you are not going to look good either.  Now I am dying to get the DVD to this CD and see him perform live.  I give it 5+ stars.  Get it today![.]<br />Stacie Stevens<BR>Spring Lake, MI<BR>StevensStacie@hotmail.com

B00005RFQ5|4.0|It's been almost 2 years since the last release from Prince. He's back with a message in a totally different direction from his previous works. That's a good thing. Good jazz incorperated rock fusion CD. Reminds me of early Santana, Miles in the early 70's with a few touches of the neo-soul movement. Two things should have been eliminated to push this to a five star review... The slowed down narration voice almost at every break between songs, and that silly \\"Wedding Feast\\" snippet about food. Otherwise it's a pretty decent direction where Prince is taking his music now.
B00006JJ1O|3.0|When I first heard about 2 russian, teenage lesbians creating an album I have to admit I was skeptical. I have grown up in a generation where Boyzone, Nysync, Spice Girls, and Britney Spears (just to name a few) has been shoved down my throat due to immense commercialization. When I was a misguided teenager I actually thought some of it was _good_ *shudder*.<BR>But upon hearing some of the songs from this album, I was a bit more impressed than I was with Justin Timberlake or Shakira. Even if they are just as commercial, at least they can a)sing and b)aren't using their bodies to sell their music (thus far). Sure they are shown kissing and holding hands in the music video to \\"All the things she said\\" but they are, after all, girlfriends. Why would people balk at that and not even blink an eye to deliberate in your face sexual capitalism such as seen in Christina Aguilera, Britney Spears, and Ricky Martin videos. Ahh well people are strange. Back to the album.<BR>The vocals are pretty ok, and I happen to like the accented English. It gives the music a kind of otherworldly sound. And the blonde girl has a strong voice that screams for attention. A bit dancy and technoy with limited lyrics, but overall an interesting (and different) listen. I look forward to seeing more from these two artists.

What truly astounds is the timeless nature of Gerry Anderson's work. Being 40 years of age and fired up about Stingray is a beautiful thing.  And sharing it simultaneously with your kids is beyond words! Going further, I would hint at this being a unique and unforgettable experience that the whole family can enjoy.  Bottom line:  Go for the gold and shell out the clams!  For those tired of the same old same old, rediscover the magic of \\"Supermarionation\\" as only Gerry Anderson can provide.  This truly is marvelous and genius, all wrapped up into one.  It is highly unlikely you will be disappointed with your purchase. Enjoy.
6305311463|1.0|\\"Armageddon,\\" which is at the top of my list of the most awful and embarrassing films ever made, is not entirely worthless. It is a lesson in how not to make a film. It's bombastic, monotonous, loud, over-staged, emotionally empty, crude, humorless, unsophisticated, over the top, and entirely irrelevant. Now, I can already hear the rejoinders: lighten up, it's only a movie. True, but then again, nothing is \\"only a movie,\\" given that \\"Armageddon\\" cost millions upon millions of dollars to make, earned even more, and was seen by countless numbers of people. And given the centrality of film to our culture and the ways in which filmgoers personalize, love, hate, and discuss film, we can't be so complacent to say it's \\"only a movie.\\"<br />Michael Bay is the kind of director who wields his camera as if it were a jackhammer.  Jerry Bruckheimer has his name on many an expensive and high-grossing film but has yet to make a single noteworthy and intellectually important cultural contribution. Put the two together and you get a disaster. \\"Armageddon\\" has caricatures for characters, a silly and wholly unoriginal premise (how many \\"save the world\\" films must we endure?), forgetful and unintelligent dialog, ultra-thin human relationships, comical situations (even though the situations are supposed to involve danger and seriousness), and, above all, what could possibly be the most god-awful, empty, annoying, and artless visual style ever to make it to the silver screen. Michael Bay's visual language is the celluloid equivalent of the Tower of Babel. The rapid-fire editing, in which no image seems to last for more than five seconds, might seem unique and impressive (some excellent films have been made with this type of MTV-style approach), but Bay's style doesn't work because he has nothing to say with his camera, nor does he employ his technique with any sense of authority or judgment; he doesn't understand nor realize the artistic and ideological aspects of such jarred aesthetics.There's nothing deep underneath the surface, and, what is more, the frenetic pacing and editing become monotonous and meaningless the second it becomes clear that Bay does not understand changes and nuances of tone. Instead of being awed, the viewer is pummeled. It's incredibly stupid, to put it blatantly.<br />Everything in the film is on the surface.  Even though a huge meteor is hurling towards the earth (and will wipe out all life -- oh my God!!!), there's no sense of urgency. The emotions are obvious, simplistic, and ham-fisted, cued with visuals and music that tell you what to feel and when (Hollywood films in general are adept at doing this). There's not even a remote sense of passion between Affleck and Tyler (Affleck's delivery is as wooden and perfunctory as usual). And the characteristics of the other characters are presented in the same ham-fisted, egregious manner: yes, yes, we know that Buscemi has some odd quirks; yes, yes, we know that William Fichtner takes his job seriously. And, gee, thanks Mr. Bay for the close-ups of Billy Bob's leg brace, just in case I didn't notice that he was crippled.<br />Of course, one could argue that \\"Armageddon\\" is a fun romp, but it's evident that Bay and Co. intended the film, aside from a few apparently comic situations (which aren't funny at all), to be a serious disaster movie. Well, it's not serious, but it certainly is a disaster.
0060930187|2.0|While many people rave about this story I fail to see where it's brilliance is.  I read it upon recommendation by a friend.  And while I did enjoy the style in which it was written, overall this book left me feeling empty.  I felt I had wasted my time.  Mostly because I could not at all sympathize with the main character except in the most extreme of cicumstances, such as the shock therapy.  Other than those few moments, I did not feel like she was subject to any unusually cruel acts or treatment.  The majority of my disappointment came in the end.  I felt there wasn't any kind of payoff, no real conclusion.<br />Maybe I was distracted by all the little notes my friend had written in the book.  Maybe it's simply because I'm a guy (which I sincerely doubt.)  Personally, I would much rather read Ms. Plath's poetry than trudge this this little volume again.<br />I give it two stars, for while I didn't necessarily enjoy the plot, the prose were downright hilarious at times!...
B0000584V3|5.0|Well, it took me a while to finally buy this cd, cuz all the samples of it are just 30 second snips of 10 minute long songs. So i actually thought they sucked at first. but man was i wrong! this isnt a cd, its an adventure. like i said, dont pop this album in you car stereo if you only have a 3 minute drive, you wont get anything out of it! my piece of advice for you: put it in your cd player, lie down, and just listen. Blackwater Park is beautiful, dark, and incredible. check it out...
B00005JKES|2.0|Disappointed that the pilot episode is not included. It makes it difficult to enjoy a series when the pivotal episode is missing.
B0000004V2|5.0|One of my all time favourite albums. Every song is good and it puts you in a great mood. Ian Browns voice is heavenly beautiful and the music is the best. The production value is also top notch. Its one of my all time favourite albums with great music on it that everyone will enjoy. Hearing this album will put a smile on your face and make you happy and experience an album that youve never experienced before.
6305313687|5.0|Well-acted, surprisingly accurate portrayal of naive but dangerous Neo-Nazi youths in the USA. The films primary fault lies in the unrealistically easy enlightenment of Derek, the films primary protagonist.
1587990717|5.0|If you are an investor or (especially) a trader, this book is a *must* read.  It is not necessarily the easiest read, but it will help you understand several things and debunk some Wall Street myths, e.g. &quot;stocks always go up&quot; (which is false due to survivorship bias).  It will also help you understand why financial &quot;accidents&quot; (e.g. LTCM) happen.
B00006WUWN|1.0|Not the film, but the DVD itself. Whether or not you like Austin Powers is subjective, so I won't bore you with my personal opinions.<br />However, I will tell you a story. I was watching it last night, and had to get up to do something. So I hit the &quot;pause&quot; button.<br />THE PAUSE FUNCTION DID NOT WORK!<br />So I thought, &quot;that's wierd&quot;, and hit &quot;stop&quot; instead, so that the movie would just pick up where it left off when I got back. When I did, guess what...<br />The movie, instead of picking up where I stopped it, actually SKIPPED BACKWORDS TO THE BEGINNING OF THE CHAPTER, which I then had to watch all over again. In addition, there is, in my personal opinion, no excuse why the widescreen and full screen can't just be options on the same disk. <br />I will NEVER buy anything from this product line again. When a modern-day DVD can't even perform basic functions like &quot;pause&quot; or &quot;stop&quot; like the cheapest of VCRs, something is terribly wrong.
0066214122|4.0|Crichton's basic theme throughout most of his fiction is that of runaway technology and how easily it could happen. When we're talking Jurassic Park, Timeline, or even Sphere, we can give this lip service and go on about our business of enjoying the tale and hoping for a movie, not taking the ultimate possibility of this stuff actually happening very seriously. With these caveats Prey is a nice, solid, fast read, not as detailed as Clancy, and not as inspid as the Cat Who mystery series. I agree that the plot is somewhat simple. If you don't understand what is about to happen within a few pages I would submit you're not paying a bit of attention. The 'surprise' ending isn't; and really that's OK.<br />The real issue here is that it would be a shame if people take this book seriously enough to stifle nanotechnology research. Just to put some scope to this, the US spent $116 million on nano research in 1997. In 2003 that figure is $710 million. Worldwide 2001 was $1.5 billion. There already exist the usual suspects who don't want anything technological done at all, for fear it might change something.  As a result we have the ironic situation of the governments of starving African nations refusing food because it has been ever-so-slightly genetically altered.  The odd thing is we've genetically altered plants and animals for the last 20,000 years. We've just used the engine of nature to do it. My cocker spaniel is a descendent of wolves. (Yes I know nano is not genetics, but it's the same idea.)<br />Nano has the potential to great things and be a help to us in our lives, in health, the environment, and in energy consumption.  Yes, let's be careful, but also admit we are not going to stop technology. The key thing is to guide it with discipline to help us, and also guide our over-active imaginations with the same discipline to act reasonably as we pursue nanotechnology to bring about beneficial results.
B00006WUWN|1.0|(My previous review was titled &quot;THIS DVD IS GARBAGE&quot;)<br />You cannot use the &quot;scan&quot; function, either. So if you want to skim through a scene you have already seen, or rewind it a smidge, etc, you CAN'T. You can only skip forward or backword in chapter-sized blocks. <br />I am so...irritated! Grrrrr!
B00006CXXU|5.0|This is highly unusual for me because I usually dis pop stars, and then turn up my Metallica, AC/DC, The Beatles, B.B. King, etc. I have experienced a wide variety of music, and at the heart of all of it I believe is the Blues. Whether it is in the hard paced pulse of Metallica, or the Soft Melodies of the Beatles, or even in the soul of B.B. King the best music has an element of the blues in it. When one of my realitives bought me this album for Christmas I thought, &quot;Oh man another bland pop album!&quot; Yet, for some reason I decided to listen to it, and I was truly surprised for with the exception of &quot;Dirty&quot; the Album is a personal look at the life of Christina from a bluesy, and soulful way. I was forced to take another look at a person who I considered noting more then a Pop Star. I am not saying she is some great new Blues Singer, but instead that a person I saw as having a great voice but formualic music has crafted an album of surprising depth that does not fit the mold for pop stars. This album has blues for a soul, and one of the great voices in the last ten years which leaves you asking for more. I don't consider myself a Christina fan, but if she continues to make music like this then I will definitely will.
0345440900|2.0|While I was pregnant, I read this book from cover to cover, and I really liked it. However, as soon as my first baby was born, the shortcomings of the &quot;Baby Whisperer's&quot; approach became glaringly evident. I became really stressed out as I tried to apply her methods and her ideas about structure and routine. <br />This stress fell away as I did more research on breastfeeding and sleep patterns of newborns. I now barely ever glance at the clock, but rather closely observe my baby. For example, the &quot;Baby Whisperer&quot; says you should feed your baby every 2 1/2 to 3 hours and never let her fall asleep after nursing. All I can say to that is: YEAH RIGHT!! <br />I've started following what my baby needs, and I've been totally relaxed ever since. My baby hardly cries because I respond to her needs - regardless of what the ticking hands of the clock tell me.<br />This book has useful information, but there is a lot of advice which will stress you out if you try to follow it. I believe we should enjoy these precious months and leave the schedules for when our babies are older.
B00006LJ72|2.0|Made in GER in 2002, Serial# 0927-49211-2, Playing Time 176:13<br />Lyrics enclosed; disc 4 contains a multimedia section with a screen-saver, a photo gallery (actually a slide show of the pictures included in the booklet), and a video of &quot;Silent Night&quot;. This box is limited to 20,000 copies (how many will actually sell?)<br />This 4-disc compilation literally floored me!  Not because of the music (that's a topic for another day...), but because of what's been put together in this package; I won't comment on the songs themselves, because, after all, you already know Enya if you're considering buying this set.<br />The box (covered in purple velvet, oooh!) features a booklet that gives the lyrics to the songs, as well as some track-by-track comments (read &quot;meanings&quot;) on each of them.  No biography or truly interesting facts.<br />What's worse, the 4 discs arrive just short of 3 (gasp!) hours of music (when in fact, given some small effort, one could fit over 5 hours!)<br />I'm no mathematician (even if I'm going to sound like one!), but Enya has released 5 albums so far; here's what I would have done to please the fans (or, at least, myself!)<br />Put in ALL of &quot;Enya&quot; (39:28) plus the &quot;bonus&quot; track included in its re-release, &quot;Celts&quot; (a re-recording of &quot;Portrait&quot;, at 3:13); so we're at about 43 minutes;<br />Put in ALL of the second album, &quot;Watermark&quot;, which lasts 43:10;<br />Put in ALL of the 3rd album, &quot;Shepherd Moons&quot;, which clocks in at 43:33, and add the english version of &quot;Book Of Days&quot; for another 2:57 (the original release of the album contained that song but sung in gaelic)<br />Put in ALL of her 4th album, &quot;The Memory Of Trees&quot;, which would consume another 43:53, plus the 2 previously unreleased tracks (&quot;Only If...&quot; and &quot;Paint The Sky With Stars&quot;) from her &quot;best of&quot; entitled &quot;Paint the Sky With Stars&quot;) which would take up 7:34<br />Add to the mixture ALL of her latest album, &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot;, and there goes another 37:35<br />With me so far?  I've used up, with ALL of the 6 albums (including the &quot;best of&quot;) and their various editions, a little under 222 minutes... I have room for 80 (yes, EIGHTY) more minutes!  More than enough for ALL her b-sides (there's a little more than a dozen), the &quot;May It Be&quot; track from the soundtrack to &quot;Lord Of The Rings - The Fellowship...&quot; (which is included in this box set).<br />I would then have her WHOLE CATALOGUE! (who knows, maybe even squeeze in the soundtrack to &quot;The Frog Prince&quot;, which lasts 35 minutes!)<br />Now THAT would have been money well spent... <br />After the record label has already released &quot;Paint the Sky...&quot; and the 3-disc &quot;A Box Of Dreams&quot; (IT lasts 159 minutes, so I could also talk about THAT), I'm now worried that a 5-disc compilation set might be released in 2005, as a 20-year retrospective of her career.<br />But because I love her work, I'll probably buy that too (and complain again?)
B000005Z0G|4.0|This is a really good CD, but it is not Pac's best by a long shot. Me Against The World & All Eyez On Me completely blow this album away. But this does not mean that this is not a good album, because it is. There are a few really good songs like Keep Ya Head and I Get Around, my favorite song on this album is the title track. I think that this CD would be a lot better if the production wasn't so low-quality. I'm not saying that the beats aren't good, but on some of the songs you can barely hear Pac's voice. This is a CD that would be worth a digital remastering. But Overall I would say that this is must-have for any true 2pac fan it is better than 2pacalypse Now and it is definitely better than Until The End Of Time.
B000031XCR|5.0|Very pleased with the promptness of the order. Received CD 3 days after ordering it. Great job!
B000059HAI|5.0|With a focus on the story instead of people, heros or whatever Perl Harbor the movie tried to do, Tora! Tora! Tora! is a much better source of information about the time before and just after the Japanese Attach on Perl Harbor.<br />The DVD has a nice THX encoding, only with a few hickups. But in all, the digitation of the movie and sound makes the movie look almost new, even though it has 30+ years behind it - this was made when M.A.S.H. the movie was being filed. The 30 minutes documentary is impressive too - allthough not much new stuff is rewielded.<br />If I miss anything it's behind the scenes of the movie - but alas, I don't think movies about making movies were fashionable back then.<br />For Movie and history &quot;buffs&quot; I would definately get this one.
