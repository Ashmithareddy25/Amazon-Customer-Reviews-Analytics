B0013D8LOK|4.0|I don't recommend it for everybody.  The story is hard to take, but it's well written, the music is great and the acting and was excellent.  The singing was OK!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My son loves this game and I found it fun too! The fact that it was free was a nice bonus :)
B003JVH7XU|5.0|The fighting sequences are even better than Undisputed 2-- Scott Adkins doesnt disappoint as he is even better in this one
B004GJDQT8|4.0|If you shop amazon, this app can come in handy.  I don't use it to order, I use it mainly to track the items I have shipped.  In that area it works great.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I love this CD.  It is so relaxing and upbeat.  It is a little different from what you might expect, but it is a wonderful change and Andrea' voice is so smooth.  If you are a fan, it is a must get.
B00A4YVHXQ|4.0|Cute little app that the kids enjoyed playing with.  Was pleasently suprised how fun it was.  Well worth the download.
B008FYZIVY|4.0|I played all the DVD's all the through and everything was great but I tried to watch it a 2nd time and the DVD's skipped some went over more than one scene.<br />To be fair, I haven't contacted anyone yet about this because I've been traveling. The package actually shipped faster than expected.<br />Would have rated a 5 star had they not started skipping.
6305428050|5.0|thank you for have this movie I been look for this movie for a long time and I see that you had it
B0045NDVFE|5.0|This is a great country rock album I bought for my wife, but really ended up enjoying myself!<br />Is great even if you're not a typical country listener.
B001OQCV2E|5.0|love it
B0017ZB8M6|4.0|I love all Katy's songs as well as her video's purchased this CD recently and really enjoyed it. Her songs are always up lifting and just have a way of lifting your mood when down.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|i like weather channel  sun sun sun  rain rain rain  ///////////////  .......... good  bye  i check weather in wi. today
B002M9WW30|5.0|All Rocky's in one neat little package.  Too bad one of the movies sucked, but it isn't due to the quality of Blu Ray.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Been waiting for someone to produce a horse game.this one is pretty good for a start. Kids will really like it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Thanks Colleen Hoover!  My house is a mess because I couldn't put this down when I should have been cleaning!!
B0013HYLT0|5.0|My kids love the movie, so I bought the CD.  It's just like I remember from the LP I used to listen to growing up.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is the kind of book that you rush home from work, make dinner, get everyone clean and ready for the next day in record time so you can spend the rest of the night reading!  I can't wait for the next one.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|This is Just a fantastic movie for any lover of comedy/ a capella. All of the songs and performances are fantastic.
B008M87GJK|5.0|A great application to BBC News.  BBC News is a wonderful place to find current news from all over the world.
B00A1EOBJQ|4.0|Nashville doesn't get a 5 star rating from me simply because it doesn't contain more of the music !  I am not a country western music fan but the TV show, Nashville, had me humming and wanting more of the music.  TBone Burnett is truly a genius.  Every song on this CD is great listening.  I cannot recommend it highly enough
B008MG1E4A|5.0|After watching the movie &#34;Zero Dark Thirty&#34;, I had to read this book to see how it all went down. Great book and entertaining read about Owen's first hand experiences as a Navy SEAL.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This is a well made, durable and light weight case.  My son is thrilled with it!  He enjoys the ease of opening and closing as I enjoy the lack of fear I have when he takes it in the car.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|If you want the full experience of joy and sorry, this is your film!  Depicting the devotion and loyalty of both man and beast, it takes one on a journey that tells what honor, hope and love can manage, and what horrors each can survive when really pressed.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I downloaded this app for my six year old and she really loves Cut the Rope, she plays it all the time!  She thinks it is really fun and it isn't too hard for her, nor does it try to make us spend money to keep playing, which makes Mom happy!  Highly recommended for the younger ones!
B0059XTTW8|1.0|I found this story really difficult to follow.  I will try to watch it again.  Maybe the book makes it more concrete.
B008XCJ03K|5.0|I love Passenger and I was so happy when I saw that his CD was going to be only a $5 digital download. I had to get it and it transfers over to iTunes so easily!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|The movie was every bit as good as the book , which I read twice, waiting for the movie.  I wish someone would make<br />a film like this about the black male and the trials they face.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|I LOVE this CD. I like blues a lot, but this is really amazing, proving you don't have to be a southerner to sing the blues.
B0060ZJ7BC|4.0|This is a very interesting explanation of how baseball works behind the scenes.  Maybe I'm the last to understand that<br />baseball success, like all other sports, is never accidental.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|THIS.GAME HAS SAVED MY LIFE. TRUELY AMAZING. I HAVE RECENTLY GOT TO A MILLION IN SCORE AND YA KNOW OK I'VE BEEN SINGLE FOR QUITE SOME TIME NOW (I just entered a new relationship a couple days ago so no I will not date you) AND WHEN I WAS SINGLE I REPLACED THE LOVE OF ANOTHER HUMAN WITH THIS GAME. I HONESTLY DO NOT KNOW HOW I WOULD'VE MADE IT OUT ALIVE WITHOUT THIS GAME<br /><br />THANKYOU
B002JCSWV6|5.0|So much about Africa is misunderstood by our American culture.  This, to me, was real<br />and helpful in understanding an important time in history.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|This movie is extremely wonderful and important. The images are amazing. This is one of the movies you can watch over and over in order to extract more of its beauty and depth. The question posted in this story, how to know god, is answered several times: surrender! Thats it. This is not a movie for fundamentalists of any cute religion who assume to know things so much better than it is. This movie allows us, like any excellent art, to open our mind to the power of eternal nature beyond human concepts, and the underlying transcendent.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its a amazing game sometimes can be slow but not normally. Its a fun game for kids.very addiciting at that.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was fantastic. Heart-wrenching and amazing. It left me guessing; the curve balls make the book! Great read for anyone of all ages!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I was having so many problems getting my kindle fire to recharge...sometimes it would take 10 hours.  This product charges so quick I could not believe it.  Usually 2 hours & I'm able to use it again.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Great story.  Great ending.  Can't wait to start the next one.<br />Percy is a fun character.  It is a must read!
0802473156|5.0|Several people had recommended this book to me at my bridal shower.  I decided to order the book but didn't receive it until after my wedding... My husband and I had fun time going through the book together and taking the quizzes.  This book is a great coversation starter and definitely worth purchasing.
B00A3AYI50|5.0|Phillip's passion comes through in his voice and guitar in his songs.  I love his vocal style and original sound that permeates his music.  A great variety of songs.  Now it is time to see Phillip in concert!
B000GCFO0I|5.0|Loved the movie. No problem with the product. A good price and was shipped quickly. I would recommend this company.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is fun I like to play with horses and I wish I had one of course I don't religiously play but when I do its like owning my own horse
B009LREA1S|1.0|My review is regarding delivery, not the movie itself. Beware that you cannot stream any HD movies to your PC, you need to have one of the devices they list to stream HD.<br /><br />At the top of the listing in the blue bar they say &#34;Available in HD for playback on Kindle Fire HD, Xbox 360, PS3, Roku, TiVO or other HD compatible devices.&#34; Well, my pc is an HD compatible device, but I cannot watch the movie in HD.<br /><br />I stream HD content from Netflix and Hulu daily. So needless to say I am a little irritated.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|It was great to have all the eposides together and not have to watch any commercials or other interruptions. Great show
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Good graphics. I liked the puzzles and the story line. Wished it would have had more content. Would recommend though.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|It was great to have all eposides together and not to have to watch any commercials or other interruptions. Great
B007SGM084|5.0|I was very impressed, excellant reading, I could not put it down.  I would recommend this series to anyone to read.
B003NWS5AO|5.0|Had most of the songs I love to listen to and brings back alot of memories of times in the past
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|Good, sick, shocking fun. Jessica Lange is just the bomb!! Even when it doesn't make sense it doesn;t matter. Its awesome
B0018CWEYY|5.0|This was great. It was good to have all episodes together. Nice not to have any commercial or other interruptions.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love how I can choose to wake up to whatever song I want! Also, very customizable - volume limit, snooze time, math problems to close... favorite alarm clock app!
B000002V1D|5.0|A great mix of Duran Durans greatest songs. The album has a some of my favorite songs including &#34;Ordinary World&#34;.
B004ADH1RI|1.0|I remembered seeing this as a kid and enjoying it.  I thought it would be a great movie to let my kids watch, and went based on it being PG, not even PG-13.  We didn't even get 15 min into the movie and the amount of \\"OMG\\" and \\"S***\\" had us turning it off.  Too bad that \\"PG\\" doesn't necessarily mean appropriate for kids.  Guess my memory blocked out the questionable stuff.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is awesome! It's even cooler than the first temple run! I would recommend it for anyone. The best part of the app is that it's free!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|All good and nice action top rates<br /><br />Good for family and kids<br />Good for all ages<br />Nice mice nice nice
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I really do not see what all the hate on this case was about. Its cheap, durable, and the felt inside kinda cleans the screen. Yes, the stand only works if the kindle is inside but think about it. When are you going to use the case w/o a kindle inside it.
B006L1TT8G|5.0|I hope this album does well when the girls come! The album is just alot of fun! I can't wait to buy it (again) here in the USA!
B005GG0MIS|5.0|The book is an entertaining reading about people and events with which we are all familiar.  Most  ex-presidents do eventually reconcile their differences and develop a mutual respect for each other.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I really enjoy this version of Mahjong, it is really lots of fun, and it keeps my brain working. I recommend it to anyone who likes the game/
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME! SOOOO MUCH COOLER THAN TEMPLE RUN! I think the controls are better n the graphics are nice.  Constantly trying to top my score so I find myself always glued to this awesome game...favorite game in the runner genre (I know because I have tried several).  A must have!
B0071NOU78|5.0|We gave this to our grandson with a Luke Skywalker costume for Christmas.  He loved it!!  Now he's a bona fide Jedi Knight!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Read it in 2 days. Really enjoyed this book. Can not wait to read the next and final book. Enjoy!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addicting and fun. I would recommend it to anyone. Especially since its free. I love how it switches from place to place I just wish I could see the high scores for other people too.
B008RZF1UO|4.0|I find the new CD by Kamelot is decent. I did like it. I must admit Tommy is no Roy but it is not bad. I wanted to give the entire band a chance. I love their music and miss Roy. Tommy is not a bad singer but it does take some time to get used to him. The band maid a great advance in their music with the new cd.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|My wifes therapist recommeded this book and I couldn't thank her enough.  This book is very eye opening.  If you feel that you are not communicating well with your significant other I highly recommend this book.  It is an easy read and is very addictive.
0743270754|5.0|I'm about half way through the book, and I can hardly put it down.  We all know \\"how the story ends,\\" but the details the author has to get into the very lives of these people makes for great reading.  Oh, how I wish we had such statesmen today!
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|I saw this in the theater but had to own it...it was worth adding to my collection...I've watched it twice since I received it...
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Saw part of the movie for the first time the other day on Showtime or something.  Bought the DVD so I could watch it through again.  Awesome movie.  One of the best of the past decade.  Serious and comical, recommend it to everyone.
B000000YG4|5.0|Whether you're a jazz lover or not, just buy this album. It's amazing. I only own a hand few of Jazz albums, I am just getting started in this genre. GREAT BUY! GREAT MUSIC.
B0067R0APK|4.0|I just wish it had more skin color options. The ones they have are not realistic, are dull, or too neon. The weather informatiom is accurate, and interface very user friendly.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really good.<br /><br />Once you get past about 50,000 the character starts to speed up and so does the game.<br /><br />Hope this helped
B00AYDC3CG|5.0|Loved it!  I have a seven and 11 yo, boy/girl, and we always enjoy watching Tim Burton movies!  Recommed it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is super fun but after you get to level 30 it stops telling you what level your on.but besides that it is the most fun game I have and you might not be able to stop playing
B000F1IQNM|4.0|I well buy form them to there do there job on time.I wich them on dvd or ps3 the move
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This app helps me out alot it always tells me if i need to charge my kindle or not its just so helpful:)
B00005JNQS|5.0|i buy form them.that do a good job on time.I well wich them on dvd or ps3 play the move
B002RVZV9K|5.0|this is a great item. happy to have this for collection. would recommend it to anyone that is a fan of them.
B0084AZXKK|1.0|Did not like the book really boring might be a classic .but I'm to good for this horrid book sorry
B00AC8ZJPQ|4.0|I was surprised by it, it was a lot better than I thought it would be. Even if you did not know anything about halo it did not matter.
B007XIC1GI|3.0|It's a entertaining book but I must say I think Manson is full of himself and alot of this book seems like bull. Maybe it's not, I know Manson is a pretty weird guy so it could  be true. The book also seems to jump around to much. Overall it was good but I take everything he wrote with a grain of salt.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|This is my first experience to order things on line. The goods come on time just for my birthday without any damages. Wonderful!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|An amazing book .It almost felt like I was living through the hunger games with catnip and the boy with the bread
B008JFUTUY|5.0|This is without a doubt one of the most moving and inspiring stories I've ever had the privilege of  seeing.  I just finished watching  &#34;SEARCHING FOR SUGAR MAN&#34;, and can't imagine why such a talent was ignored  here for so long.  South Africa was so very lucky to have had his music for so long.  He is a great talent, and a remarkable man.<br />Bonnie C.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Terrific mystery that unfolds slowly over the first four installments. Well-paced, intelligently written with engaging characters.<br /><br />Lots of interesting twists to keep the reader engaged.<br /><br />I highly recommend.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Ran perfectly on my Kindle Fire.  Great game.  Good puzzles.  HOs were good..tho I am not a big fan oc them.  Long satisfying game.  Storyline was interesting.  Well worth the 2.99 I paid.  Hope they do more like this.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Better than I expected from a Bruce Willis science fiction.  Great action flick with wonderful special effects and inventive story line.
B0047WJ12K|4.0|This movie isn't perfect, but it's good enough so that the flaws can be easily forgiven. The science-fiction premise of the story is that it's possible to go into another person's dreams, and manipulate events and perceptions in those dreams, with the intent of extracting information. The supposedly easy task is getting ideas out of a person's head. On the other hand, but putting ideas in, creating thoughts (inception) is infinitely harder. The storytelling structure of the film generally follows a classic caper outline. This being... one man needs to get something secret/difficult/illegal done, so he assembles a team of strange bedfellows, who are often at odds with each other. Along the way the team members exhibit various surprising strengths and weaknesses, and there is at least one twist at the end. Yup, classic. The filmmakers pull it off with style. My only complaint is towards the end of the movie... the film bends a few early-established rules of the dream-universe to make later events fit the story, and the rule bending gets rather flagrant at the very end. But it's a minor irritant that is overwhelmed by the fine production and acting. Leonardo DiCaprio and Ellen Page are electric on screen. This is one of those few films that is fun to watch twice, or three times. I recommend it.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|I came upon this show by accident.  I love scary mmovies, thrillers, and dark stories.  This show is beyond most movies.  Nearly everyone I know who has seen it become addicts.  Jessica Lange is remarkable; she is brilliant, intense, and layered.
B003F3NDOE|5.0|Now Ugly Betty has been my best loves or all loves. Love this comedy. I was able to watch series after series uninterrupted. Can you imagine that? Love the ending..... Funny as always! This was not disappointing to me.
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|I was so disappointed! I really want to love this book because i love Tina Fey but i found myself having to force myself to read it. Like so many others commented, her dry humor is funny but when it's on paper it's kind of...boring? If you think you might be interested, i would check it out at your local library in case you hate it, you dont lose money. Happy reading!
B00782O7IY|5.0|Silent or not ... this is a fun movie to watch.  It was so well done that it's not hard to see why it won so many awards.  Do yourself a favor and pick this one up.  Movie making at it's finest ... Highly recommended!
B006LSZECO|4.0|It kept you interested.  Many twists and turns and I am familiar with the Hannibal, Mo. area.  I can't believe someone could imagine all the things she came up with and the poetry clues were different.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This games is lots of fun and quite challenging. I would highly recommend this one. It could become a real addiction!
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Start :(g cu ha f2f st February and a great book is a great book is a great book is a great book is a great book is a
B002E66C6E|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I gave it four stars instead of five because I thought the acting was a little weak in some cases. Overall, well worth the time.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Wonderful cast and the plot was great!  All around entertaining and fun!  Kids and adults will love it!  thumbs up!
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Any music lover will appreciate this amazing documentary! It's history brought to life and Dave Grohl is a genius! Highly recommend!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is super addictive I cant stop playing it. I love how you can get more people.. its like a better temple run!
B00181JGI2|5.0|you'll love this one.  It did not have the box office taht other Coen brothers films did on release-but it became a cult legend.  For good reason.  Wonderful performances by Bridges, Goodman, Moore, Hoffman, etc.  Brilliant script and cinematography-with nods to film classics.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|I HATE COUNTRY music...that being said its tolerable and made my girlfriend the happiest person ever when she opened it on chistmas...arrived verry quikly for a holliday dilivery and was new so oviously it works perfect and was in great shape.
B000X2H8G4|5.0|my mother has problems hearing me due to a surgery. i do not have to repeat myself or try to raise my voice to talk to her. do not tap on the mic or drop it though, that is very loud
B009I2UH2W|5.0|Extremely smooth. Doesn't get any easier than this. Charger worked perfectly.  I can charge my 5 and my wife's 3GS at the same time.
B0063M22QO|3.0|This is okay. I don't care for the choices of symbols, some of them difficult to tell apart, but it's fine for using when waiting in a doctor's office or something.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am in love with Downton Abbey!  I just happened to stumble upon the series and finished the first two seasons in only a few days.  The characters, the location, the HOUSE!  I love it all.  Best show in a very long time.
B001CTGQBK|2.0|Grease is one of my all time classic movie, i actually bought this for a friend as a birthday gift!the way the item was displayed it came w/ a leather jacket, when i recevied it was just the movie it's self. I was a little dissapointed, i would have returned it and found another buyer but the birthday was the following day, mind you I also payed for next day delivery so it would arrive on time.. overall she loved it!
B000SEIK2S|5.0|After reading lots of positive reviews I gave the book a try, although I was not fully sold on the concept.  I'm glad I did as this was one of the more enjoyable reads I've had in the past year,
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|great game not difficult to play would reccomend if you needed bo waste some time four stars for this one
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Well I like the game other than the fact that when I got on it like the 3rd day I had it..it erased everything that I had like all of my coins and my characters and all my upgrades!!!! But other than that Its amazing
B009CRLTVG|3.0|It was an interesting read as far as the facts and events...I thought the author was a little too self-absorbed and defensive.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|So sad they are over... love love loved these!!!<br /><br />Wish there were more, I could read these all day .. So inticing impossible to put down.
B005LW5J9O|5.0|This is an intelligent, well-researched, very interesting book.  It is very informative, especially with regard to the real philosophy of  epicureanism.  I would highly recommend &#34;The Swerve&#34; to anyone with an interest in history, philosophy, and new insights.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Great movie for the whole family! We will definitely buy this movie. Recommend it for all ages! We loved it!
B0037SQ3C6|5.0|YOUNG ARTISTS DO CHOPIN BEST. THEY HAVE THE PASSION, IF NOT THE EXPERIENCE. GIVE IT A TRY OVER OLDER ARTISTS WHO HAVE RECORDED THESE NOCTURNES.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is handy and best of all the numbers are big and easy to read.  There are more functions available on this app than other apps.
B001F4UHFI|4.0|This is one of Nicholas Cage's best movies ever. If you are going to rent it, I suggest the HD version. The non HD is in widescreen and fills over less than half of your tv screen.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|For any regular Ebay-ers, this is a wonderful way to move around the ebay site. using the Kindle through the browser is clunky and this takes all that clunk away. Very happy
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|Dumb comedy. If you don’t mind lots of “F” bombs and sexual innuendo then you’ll get a laugh.<br />Definitely not for children.
B00267N3DQ|3.0|I hated spending over $50 for a DVD.  However I missed the last blu-ray release, and really wanted Snow White.  So ordered it.  However while I expected the most recent version, I got the first release.  I was pretty disappointed.  Will be more careful in the future to not miss the release before they go back into the vault.
B00B49L7Y4|5.0|great documentary. loved it. I was fifteen when the beatles came to America and the Brirtish Invasion occurred. I know alot about music, especially rock and roll.  so I am just amazed that I never heard of Rodriguez until now.what an injustice. he wrote great songs and the music to them. he wrote them and sang them. he also plays the guitar.  I love the beatles, the rolling stones, and bob dylan. I put Rodriguez above Bob Dylan. he is that good. I am just glad that he is finally getting the recognition he deserves. the movie is awesome. it also amazes me how humble Rodriguez is and how he is not bitter at all about his records not selling in the U.S. when they came out in 1970 and 1971. to me he is a good and great person. he is a good role model. I bougt the movie and I also bougt the soundtrack and his two albums cold fact and coming from reality. I wish him the best.
1594487154|5.0|Everyone should read this book...at least once. Even people who believe they are not in sales. I loved the anecdotes. Daniel Pink is an excellent writer.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|My friend told me to buy it and warned me that it was scary and I don't so SCARY BUT....I bought it because she made it sound so good. OK, i get the movie and wait 4 days until my husband can watch it with me. He decides that he doesn't want to so GREAT, I have to brainwash myself and put my big girl panties on and watch it ALONE. Friday gets here, my BIG day! I pop the first disk in and it had me GLUED to the TV!!! I wasn't afraid...well I kept peeking down the hall and had my sidekick/bodyguard (my cat Roscoe) by my side just in case something jumps off! Needless to say, all was well and I went to bed in 1 piece and woke up Saturday morning to continue to disk 2 with Roscoe by my side again...I didn't feed him in case we needed to move fast off the couch lol!!  Can't wait to watch Season 2 - The Asylum!!! I've heard this one might make me call the paramedics... I'll be the judge of that....
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I would recommend this book for anyone who is struggling with the loss of a loved one.  This book offers hope that when one dies, they go to a better place then here.  It was not a literay masterpiece, but rather a message of peace and comfort for anyone who is grieving.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is cool but stool needs some improvement but like I said its cool and fun to play. A good game to pass time with.
B009JBZH54|5.0|If you liked the Dark Knight series then you will like this.  I had the first movie on standard DVD format, and when this first came out and it was around $26 for all three plus 2 extra bonus discs it was a no brainer.  The quality is great and it's in Blu Ray.  Not sure about the other &#34;bundle's&#34; for this, but I was impressed with this one and would recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have been a good good<br />Good player to play the game and I have been a good player at the game
B003EY7IRC|5.0|i read the whole series and i loved them, filled with action and adventure, romance and friendships lots of twists and turns. i'm putting this series in my top 10!!!!
B008M34INW|5.0|A Mel Gibson classic in the tradition of &#34;The Rockford Files&#34;.  Gibson spends the entire movie outsmarting, not out fighting, every obstacle he encounters.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like this game. The graphics are crisp, clean and attractive. The sound effects are pretty realistic as well. Before I knew it, I had spent over an hour playing the different parts of the game.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|Our whole family enjoyed this movie.  Fun and sweet, and a has such a great cast.  The final scenes were hilarious.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|For me, this app works fine...Great, actually. I have a Kindle fire (the first one) and it works perfectly. No glitches, freezing, working-then-stopping, etc. But, based on all of the bad reviews, I wouldn't get it until there is an update that is proven to work for EVERYONE.
B003QSJVV2|5.0|This is a great moviie. Loved the action. Loved the car chases. Nic Cage played a great role. And yo u can't fgo wrong with Robert Duvall

B007C4ZJ0S|5.0|Gina Carano stars as a former-Marine turned agent for a private security company. This film is reminiscent of the Bourne series in that Carano's character is meticulous, highly intelligent and indefatigable. Director Soderbergh keeps you guessing while Carano is on the run; he uses long, continuous shots in which the viewer doesn't know how the plot will unfold.<br />The plot is a bit hard to follow at first, you have to pay close attention in order to make sense of all of the inside references i.e., \\"I was a devil dog\\", \\"I'm on a 1024...check a New Mexico license for Mallory Kane\\", etc.<br />Carano's performance is steely. She exudes an understated confidence and explodes in her fight scenes with live action that is not in the rapid cutting style of most modern action films. She kicks ass in real time AND Gina Carano is *really* doing it. In real life, Gina Carano is an experienced and very successful mixed martial arts athlete. She does all of her own stunts in the film (with the exception of just one scene in which a stunt woman who specializes in gymnastics performed a fall off of a building in Carano's place).<br />Carano got panned in the NYtimes for not being emotional enough in her role as an action heroine- which is just blatant sexism. Matt Damon was no less stoic in his performance as Jason Bourne and nary a critic complained about his acting. This film is singular for many reasons, one of which is that the viewer is being asked to care about a woman who never gets naked, or behaves as a stereotypical sex object in an *action* movie. Finally, an action movie in which women can relate to the main character and men are invited to identify with a female protagonist who kicks men's asses left and right (as opposed to the age old formula of action hero = man, and female viewers must learn to identify with the male protagonist, regardless of how sexist he may be).<br />Sequel, please.<br /><br />-Daisy C.
B0053FANRC|5.0|ok so i have every one of the fast and furious movies n i really lobe this one bc it doesnt follow the others
B00A8SPNYW|5.0|This game makes you think.  It starts off real easy, but then gets much harder.  The graphics are cute! Makes you root for the mouse.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|ok so i reaaly love this movie is so good i watched like a 1000 times since i got bc thats how good it is
B007EECSFA|5.0|Love Kate Morton's books. Could not put this one down. It was a real page turner. I recommend this book. A good book club book.
B00846REIS|5.0|This is a great story,  but it was too short! Can't wait to read the next one! 50 Shades cousin.
B007ZTLLMK|2.0|It's too difficult to gauge how far you are from objects and walls. Cool concept game though.  Navigation through challenges is annoying.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|I don't recommend this book.<br /><br />I bought this title based on the review ratings, including the glowing support it receives in its product description. I struggled throught the first hundred pages or so and couldn't continue. The writing style, grammar and editing are clumsy and difficult to follow. The dialogue is weak. The imagery, setting and narrative are very thin and juvenile. As an example, I read the description of the king's castle three times to figure out what I was supposed to be \\"seeing\\" and came away with no clue what it might look like. The protagonist's motivation as explained several times makes him seem like an angry brat: \\"I just knew I was meant for something more!\\" The first example of him experiencing his magical power is in combat with a big red lion. The specifics of the fight are vague and uninteresting while the explanation of his use of magic is poorly explained and equally uninteresting.<br /><br />The first few unflattering reviews are a better representation than the balance that follow. The current review rating and poor quality suggest an aggressive marketing campaign to inflate this book's rating.
B0050UEVNM|3.0|This movie has a great cast of charactors. That's why I bought it. It was an OK watch. Seemed to take a long time to develope. But in the end it all came together.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|The case is defective. Callers can't hear me and when on a call the screen is muting and puts the phone on speaker. I do not recommend this case.
068487217X|5.0|absolutely great condition and the book itself's contents, all I can really say is what a wonderful writer. I had much the same experience with my father so I could relate a lot.
B0092QITO2|3.0|The Bluray image is great, the movie isn't that bad.  A different take then Arnold.  Apparently everyone drives Chrysler in the future.
B0096PYUE2|1.0|Again, another needed application from Amazon that doesn't work.  Wish they had a help desk or better products to choose from.
B00138CYD4|5.0|every song on this cd is a winner and then some. buy it and won't be disappointed. an isntant classic
B009H5IS1W|5.0|Criminal minds is one of my all time favorites. Love being able to download and watch it commercial free on my kindle.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I am a huge fan of Bond movies.  I own them all.  I am die hard Connery fan.  I believe his are the best......Until I saw this.  I fell in love with Bond movies all over again.  Craig was great and Dench was amazing.  I know I am a girl and it is a given that girls cry during movies, but I usually do not.  I did at the end.  The story lines a so personal (Something not seen since On Her Majesty's Secret Service) that you really felt as if you were there and knew the characters.<br /><br />If you have no seen it and are wondering if you should rent first... NO!  Just buy it.  You will not be disappointed and make sure you get blu-ray.  you have to watch it right.<br /><br />PS:  I rated based on the movie itself not the dvd obviously.  I am sure it will be great.
B003SI605K|5.0|The movie gives a glimpse into the lives of three immigrant Asian women and their American born daughters.  Certain information about the lives of the mothers before they came to America is given.  The movie centers on the evolving relationships of the mothers and their American daughters and includes some glimpses into Asian, particularly mainland Chinese, culture.  This is the point where the danger begins.<br />It’s too easy to think that the movie’s events only occur in Asia, or because of Asian/Chinese beliefs and practices.  (Viet Nam is mentioned once in the story)<br />I’ve witnessed these same scenes being played in my growing-up West Virginia coal mining village inhabited by immigrants from Eastern Europe and most recently, in middle-class and inner city American communities.<br /> For example, I’ve seen unmarried daughters being forced from family homes when they become pregnant.  I’ve observed children, especially daughters, being left as prey for human predators.  I know American mothers who’ve sold their children to adult men knowing full well that these children would be sexually abused.  I see little difference in the first, second, third, etc wife Chinese practice and the serial monogamy sanctified by divorce that is practiced by many Americans, nor do I see a difference between this Chinese practice and the Islam/Mormon practice of having more than one wife at a time.<br />One of the strongest events of the movie takes place in China:  a Chinese mother of one of the women who comes to America leaves that woman when she was a young child with the mother’s Chinese family.  The Chinese mother becomes Third Wife to a wealthy Chinese man, and then returns and takes her daughter from the family home to the home where she is Third Wife.  The First Wife welcomes the daughter by giving the daughter a string of pearls.  When Third Wife and daughter are alone, Third Wife takes the pearls and smashes them proving them to be fakes.  While doing this, Third Wife makes the statement that First Wife will not buy her daughter so cheaply.  I couldn’t help but wonder: how many of us have sold ourselves for cheap, imitations of the prize we really seek and deserve.<br />The movie is about abuse, betrayal and power.  The immigrant Asian mothers give one solution to end hurt:  one must know what they are worth and demand that worth; one must know who they are and demand respect; and one must know and demand the best quality.  According to the immigrant Asian mothers, it is from this knowing that power comes and abuse ends.is, Third Wife makes the statement that First Wife will not buy her daughter so cheaply.

B00A0SKFLG|2.0|I think if I never saw the 1st movie I wouldn't have judged this so low for ignorance is bliss. It was an ok movie if you have nothing else to view.
B009VB97EY|3.0|hot. but slow story, with a blah ending, wish there was more dancing, but it was good to finally see it.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|I think teddy bears should be able to win an Oscar. Ted rocked. Funny and for those of us that are in their 40's the Flash Gordan references killed me. Can't wait for the next one.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|Really nice and sturdy case. Well made and feels tough. Really have no idea about some of the negative reviews....but I love this case. Great product.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|I was told by friends a while ago to watch this series and alas I have finally succumbed.  I am addicted.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|We had played this with friends and my son requested it for Christmas.  Great game to play as a family and it's never the same because the board changes each time requiring new strategy.  We all loved it.
1250007208|5.0|I'm not sure why I put off reading this book for so long. Maybe because Cinderella isn't my favorite fairy tale. But I'm glad I succumbed to all of the hype and picked it up because I tore right through it.<br /><br />Cinder takes place in a distant, dystopian future, where the world has had to reinvent itself after World War 4. There are cyborgs and a very powerful civilization living on the moon, wanting to take over the earth. There is a terrible disease running rampant, threatening the future of humanity.<br /><br />The twists on the Cinderella story are great. Meyer is able to keep up the suspense, even though everyone knows how the story goes. She has a great ability to freshen up an old story and to take it to new places.<br /><br />Sometimes it did get frustrating how confused and down on herself Cinder was, but that was also true to her character and how she was brought up. However, she has great relationships with the other characters (even the people she hates provide good contrast). I especially love her little robot.<br /><br />I enjoyed Prince Kai and how conflicted he is - not a straight forward romance. In fact, there are lots of great twists and turns in this book, some expected and some not.<br /><br />Overall, I loved Meyer's retelling of this tale and can't wait to get my hands on Scarlet, especially because it is based on another fairy tale (as are the rest of the books in this series).
1574214276|5.0|Now this is the book I recommend to all my friends. This book is a joy! The explanation of Zentangles is far and away better than any other. The illustrations and step by step explanations of how to draw is excellent and easy to follow and execute each pattern. Anyone who states that they cannot draw will learn that they can with this book, and just with a few strokes of a pen, they will be creating great pieces of art. Not only was I drawing in a few minutes when I had finished I found that I was as rested and calm as I am when I have meditated. Of all my art books this is the one I would have if I had to choose only one art book.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I enjoyed learning about flowers from the perspective of the main character.  Victoria had many obstacles to overcome, some which seem to be insurmountable. It held my attention and was hard to put down.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|The movie truthfully depicts the era of pre-war London. The three main actors are excellent and so well selected for the parts that I forgot that it was a movie and that they were actors, and isn't that what one wants a movie to do. Now this movie captured the essence of these three people, at a time when the world was in flux for them and the people of Europe. The lighting was excellent and the costumes just right for the period. I love the way that writer and directors used camera angles that moved the story along and captured just the right setting for the action.<br />I recommend this to everyone who wants a look inside the story of George VI and his wonderful and most cherished wife.<br />J.B-J
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|Well done and thoughtful movie that tells an important story about love.<br />Entertaining as well as thought provoking.<br />I enjoyed it.
B006RXQ2CY|4.0|This movie was a good look inside the life of Elizabeth II. Helen Mirren is an exceptionally great actress and I enjoyed seeing her perform this part. I did not enjoy how much the writer and director left out the fact that the Queen has a sense of humor and enjoys a good laugh. The Queen is a well rounded human being and in this portrayal of her she is depicted as a straight faced, sometimes harsh, woman who cares more for animals than people. A little bit of tenderness would have gone a long way to make this a much more enjoyable experience. That being said I cannot fault the portions of the film that show the palace and castles as a back drop to the story of a woman who has dedicated her life to her people and done an excellent job of it. I have a feeling that the writers' and produces' depiction of Elizabeth is their feelings and not the full measure of Elizabeth.<br />J B-J
B008JFC6F0|3.0|TI have a good sound.  I like some of the songs.  I find the musicianship rather immature.  They must be a young band.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I got this game yesterday for all of my Kindle Fires yesterday and my kids will not put them down. They are enjoying most of the games but some are a little confusing for them. It's not a problem because they just keep getting points from the games they like most.
B006M4RN3U|4.0|I like the lead singer's voice.  The songs are well written,  They seem to run out of gas as the album runs its course.
B0011Z5IVE|5.0|I am from the era when rocked ruled.  This is one great music group, they really know how to rock.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i love it very realistic. I recentIy had to sell my real horses n this helps when I start missing them even if just a biti

B000HEWEJO|5.0|I enjoy watching black and white films. For some reason it makes me focus more on the actors and actresses performance. This Frank Capra classic never grows old with me. I still tear up when George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart) realizes his life positively touched so many of his fellow human beings.<br /><br />The Bailey's may have failed as successful capitalists compared to the curmudgeon Henry Potter but you cannot deny the compassion in their hearts. It's a great Christmas film.
030758836X|4.0|this is a page turner. i hear that her other 2 books are even more disturbing -can't wait to read  them all

B00992CF6W|5.0|the update wont update. but the game is awesome for gold dig straight under trees. don't know about diamemd. hope this helps
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Hope you're not good at the game, because if you get over a certain score it does nothing but glitch.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|First let me address some other reviews... This app never asked me to rate or review it. I am doing this because i want to. Also, yes many of these are on a loop but in order to keep buffer sizes small, I'm sure the audio files had to be short. This makes the loop obvious, but not jarring. The is no decernable breakpoint orgap. The looping is smooth.<br />Second, I found the huge selection of sounds and options to be impressive. Most apps like this only offer one or two sounds and not many control options.<br />The only two drawbacks for me was the activation speed (clicking on a sound would start it seconds later) and the inability to mix sounds. A playlist would also be very cool.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|I think every kid should read this book it was a very funny Book so go read it now what r u doing go get it now right now
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|When i read hopeless, i cried for days, i love Holden and how he loves Hope aka SKY every girl dream is to have a guy like Holden at least it is  mines and i am not a teenager, I mean Ms. Hoover this one you hit the nail on the head, i mean you knock the ball out of the field.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|One of the coolest games I know. Subway Surfer is an awesome game that everyone will enjoy playing. It is easy to play and is good to see the updates it has every time the game improves.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its easy to play and the kids i baby sit really love it! its fast and easy to learn i just wish they had more choices for a couple of things.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is the finest game I ever played u can play with friends on facebook u should install it now
B008CPZNL6|5.0|This app is simply beautiful. The app shows the power of mobile and how you can easily view information on the go. The simple layout is an effective way to give the users with access to the information that they want. They have a wide array of sources and there is something for people with every taste. It is really fun just to relax and take a look at this app and read and look at the news. The best part is, because there are so many images, you don't really have to read, you can just look through the pictures and the captions. Overall, a great experience. The only problem is that it might be a bit difficult for people to use this on a smaller device, or a device with limited touch capability. Works best on tablets :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|The update came out a while ago and my kindle still doesn't have it!! Other than that the app is awesome!!!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|When we're talking about free games, this game might as well hold the top spot. Made by the same people as Fruit Ninja, this app provides people with an amazing experience. The gameplay is really easy to pickup and it is fun to make your way through the different missions. Along the way, you can upgrade your costume and other things and just makes for a great mobile game. I never get bored of this, and it is my go-to game when I am bored!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|If you've read Slammed books you know what I mean to say another tear jerker from Hoover. There are only a couple other authors that have brought me to tears before, so for me it says a lot. This story was sweet and agonizing at the same time. Just like Slammed, I didn't know at times whether to laugh or cry, or to laugh to keep from crying. Great writing, awesome characters, and a little mystery with some twists too. There is much more mature content and tough issues dealt with here than in Slammed though and not necessarily for younger readers. It was a magnificent read!!
B007REV4YI|1.0|I will not buy any movie without a physical and legitimate digital copy. One that I have reasonable access to. Ultraviolet is not that format. It's a waste of time, bandwidth, and is just another way to screw the customer over. Treating your customers like thieves will not win then over. I want a DVD, Blu-Ray, and iTunes copy of my video. Looks like I will save money on movies from now on, because I won't be buying any.
B00AYDC5HY|4.0|I watched this movie with my 8 and 6 year old. They loved it!  They wanted to watch Colossus attacking the turtle over and over again.  The movie is well done. It is a typical Tim Burton movie so expect the weirdness but, that is what I love about his films.
B001F7MSG6|5.0|Love these movies. Love the characters. Ron Perlman is perfect for the role. If you like sci-fi, buy it. Very cool!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it's a great game keeps me entertained would recommend it to anyone who likes horses. I like being able to take care of the horse.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I liked how well the special effects blended seamlessly. Always something to catch your eye. It's a must have sci-fi title.
B005SMGRH0|5.0|This was the perfect gift for an avid fan of this band. I gave it as a gift and the person was thrilled and is looking for more!
B005HSL626|4.0|Graphics look good. Super simple game play. Great if your into mindless game play. Get's boring after a while but you can come back to it and enjoy it again before the boredom sets in which is why I give it a 4 star rating.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|this is a fantastic game but wont open after a few uses. an improvement from tr1 but this has to be fixed before I'm satisfied. after all, its more fun to have an app that works than not. please fix!
B009NPKTN6|4.0|The remarkable Julianne is fun but her voice doesn't really do justice to the hair band classics and head banger anthems.  I don't care for Tom Cruise in general but he killed this roll, in a good way.  He was so good that everything paled in comparison to his remarkable performance and surprisingly, singing. My jaw hit the floor he was so incredible.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|IT's SOOOO FUN.  Because you take care of animals and the animals get to fight.  And you can get a turkey, dog, chicken, penguin, groundhog.  That's it.
B005P1YCNK|5.0|Excellent book, I can't wait to reread it!! Lots of simple step to make a huge difference in life! I would recommend this book

B0087FMUCQ|5.0|just fun! Flick Golf Extreme is a great way to spend down time. Fun and challenging, can play anytime and I'm not a golf fan.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Obviously, there's going to be sex, drugs, and profanity.  There really aren't that many other ways to make a living teddy bear funny.  If you enjoyed the movie \\"Flash Gordon\\" as a child it has a must see ultimate tribute.  If you like \\"The Family Guy\\" it's also a must see.  MacFarlane handles the setups and delivery with his usual wacky randomness.
B000FC13MM|5.0|I can't believe this book has been in my life for almost 20 years. It is fresh and evergreen whenever I read it.<br /><br />This book is everything I want in a YA book. Mythos, struggle, humor, a vividly realized world, and the hero grows up. You might not expect a book about a teenage necromancer to be about the appropriate time to die, but this is about death and life being part of a continuum, and the Abhorsen is the necromancer of keeping things orderly.<br /><br />The world and writing in this book are vivid and excellent without being overwhelming. I wanted to go to her boarding school. I wanted to fly in her magical aircraft and sit in the half-light of Holehallow, and even the lemon-scented inn. And the whole book is filled with sentences like this:<br />\\"He smelled of shaving cream and talc, and was so clean, polished and full of himself that Sabriel immediately catalogued him as some sort of natural bureaucrat currently disguised as a soldier.\\"<br /><br />Although there are excellent sequels, this book is a complete story, and satisfying in its own right. And Nix keeps writing, but this is absolutely my favorite thing he's ever written. It belongs on a shelf with Susan Cooper's Dark is Rising series for sheer awesomeness.<br /><br />Read if: You want to watch a complicated and maturing young woman coming in to her powers. You love the Edwardian/magic interface. You are a worldbuilding junky.<br /><br />Skip if: The gelatinous slap of decaying hands is going to give you nightmares. There are a lot of horrible dead things in this book.<br /><br />Also read: [[ASIN:B003K16P3M Graceling]]

B00170I7GG|5.0|Groundhog Day is a classic comedy that asks a significant question.  Should we waste the days we are given or spend them improving ourselves and the lives of those around us?  We each get that choice every morning.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|There are two different game types that I'm addicted to with Jewels Star... there's the level after level, where each is more difficult that the previous, and there's a Minerals one that is just the same board over and over. It's never dull, and both keep me entertained.<br />I play the minerals one almost all the time now, and it is perfect for work breaks, waiting for an appointment, or during commercials. If the game last longer than the break, you have the ability to pause it and use your phone as normal. When you open the app back up, it's still paused in the background.<br />I had a few glitches at the beginning, but after an update, they all went away.<br />I highly recommend this game. It is oodles of fun.<br /><br />Running on a Samsung Galaxy III

B000JMKQX0|5.0|Fast flowing fun zombie book.  I love how so many of the reactions of the governments follow a true to life response for a global crisis.  Great read.
B002ELM5HY|5.0|Mark is one of my favorite artists.  We listen to his music over and over and this new album is a great addition to our Knopfler collection.  I highly recommend you give this one a try.
B004GHBQ7O|5.0|love green day good cd and dvd love it love it love it works good plays good to<br />love it
B008Y6WPXC|1.0|I could not believe the amount of violence in this movie.  I have noticed a pattern with Suck-it Stallone. His movies have tons and tons of gratuitous violence.  Stallone came out as anti-gun recently even though he made his millions off of gun violence in movies.  He is probably directly to blame for pushing some mental cases to the point of murder and yet he wants to blame an inanimate object. I will NEVER watch another movie that has this jerk in it even if it is free on here.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway sufers is a really cool game I would give it a strait five stars because it is awsome and challanging
B00B0ND67K|5.0|I love singer/ song writers and the talent in this group can be heard<br />in the writing and the sound. There is something special that happens<br />when music naturally comes together and the songs come from the<br />heart. Amazing energy!<br /><br />If you like this album, then check out their version of &#34;Oh Holy Night&#34;!<br />The blending and the harmonies is perfect!
B00117W1HQ|5.0|I think this is the best season of supernatural because it was fresh and new. At this point a show like this had never really been done before.
0756404746|5.0|This book sets the entire story in motion. It was a wonderful read and i rushed out and bought the 2nd one asap.<br /><br />One thing i will say is that the story early one might seem a bit rough but it sets you up for the remainder of the book.<br /><br />Fantasy lovers take joy in this book, its a gem in the rough.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|This is another great MI film, was not a fan of MI 1 or 2 but MI 3 and this film are the two better films, the action, humor, and suspense are here in another IMF adventure that picks up soon after the 3rd film. The locals that the film visits are beautiful and the sand storm is a realistic representation of how they really occur in the desert.<br /><br />I'd recommend this film to anyone who wants a good story but also a film that you can just pick up and watch.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Easily one of the best books I've read in quite some time. I felt obligated to finish the book after reading the first one.<br /><br />Sadly no word on when the third and final installment is coming out.<br /><br />Recommended for anyone who loves Fantasy Adventure.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is homestly my favorote app in the world!!! u can play with friends and walk around!! u can play either creative mode or survival mode ( with zombies) it os truley the best app ever!!! it wont updoate on my kimdle fire tho...
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|So afraid of missing an episode I bought the DVD. Favorite program on TV. Thanks Amazon for fast delivery. Your the best
B003TSEEDY|1.0|I read this book waiting for something to happen, it never did! There is something wrong with this kid, obviously.  Charlie does not exhibit normal, or even semi- normal teenage behavior.  It's been a long time since I was a teenager, but things haven't changed that much!  This cannot be called &#34;a coming of age&#34; story because nobody comes of age this way. Drinking alcohol, doing drugs, exploring sexuality is never given a second thought by any of the young people in this story - which are big issues, instead Charlie focuses on mixed tapes.  And honestly, what sixteen year old male, who is given the opportunity to have sex with the girl he loves, would cry and sleep on the couch! The story leaves the reader with many unanswered questions, and I was quite disappointed at the end.  Read it, you'll see what I'm talking about!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Tells you everything you need to know.. from how long your battery will have left to when it will be charged when plugged in..
0425252868|5.0|I liked this book very much.  It was extremely educational for me because my husband was a navigator on a B-17 during<br />World War 2, and he did not tell me what it was like to experience the war. This book was very well written and I<br />recommend it highly .M. Davis
B00632HWOG|5.0|Easy to use on Kindle fire. Use it almost daily. Not as much trouble as when I use my it on my laptop
B000SW16M6|4.0|Its a great classic from 1982.  A coming of age movie that isn't made any more. Who hasn't danced around in their underwear when no one is around.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|great singing  sometimes can be a little crass but overall very good movie  not for kids under 13  mostly good morales
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Loved the book.  Not what I expected.  I found myself laughing out loud at some parts and with tears in my eyes at other points.  I would recomment
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|When start watching it at first I didn't understand and then I got hook want to watch all the episodes. If you are Jessica Lang fan you will love her in this one because she really good in this series. Also, Peter played good bad as Tate.  I can't wait until the second seasons DVD come out too.
B001684L0A|5.0|This 3-disc set was a gift to myself. My husband and I rented it in the past and wanted to own it. Incredible costumes, scenery, and the topic of the founding of our nation should be reviewed by everyone!
1594135851|5.0|Loved this series, didn't want it to end. If there were more I would buy them in a heartbeat, great stuff!
B009GED3HS|5.0|I love this show! It's so funny and I love the chemistry between the main characters. Robin and Barney all the way!

B004QSQMKE|5.0|I have loved his movie forever and was just adding to my collection, you won't b disappointed, great buy really
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Being a tyro at computter stuff, I was pleased at the amount of information this book gave me.  There were a couple of places in the formatting part that didn't work as well for me...had to puzzle it out.  But I feel that's because I'm such a beginner at this stuff. The language in the book was easy to follow.  With another few weeks of puzzling out how my computer works, I think I'd rate this book even higher.
0439023521|5.0|Loved this series, didn't want it to end. If there were more I would buy them in a heartbeat, great stuff!
B005K2Z2O2|5.0|I purchased two of these sleeves, one for my Kindle Touch and one for my Kindle Paperwhite. This sleeve provides a lightweight padded protection and the interior makes it easy to insert and remove the reader.<br /><br />The sleeve is not bulky and is easy to carry or fit into a purse. I feel confident with the sleeves knowing my devices will be protected if I somehow drop them.<br /><br />There has not been one incident of the interior staining anything. The price could be a little bit less but I have no problem giving it 5 stars.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is the definition of addictive and annoying in one. Definitly worth the press of the free button!<br />Do it
B005FISBTO|5.0|Dexter how do you turn things around every time will keep you on the edge of your seat but, wait til next season
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love having this on my kindle,  it is easy to navigate and I use it alot.  It's easier than hopping on my computer
B005O7PXNS|4.0|This is such a great show! The beginning made me queasy I'm not good with watching surgery scenes but after that I was hooked! Such a great story!
B004GHNIRK|2.0|I downloaded this and I am not a fan,  it's nothing to do with the seller, just didn't like this version of the book
B009GIPDQS|5.0|I'm a Grisham fan and yet again he has not let me down.  I just love the way he writes and once I pick one of his books up, I just can't put it down.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Loving how she connects it's you through the DVD, work outs are amazing!<br /><br />Buzz kill was it won't play on my DVD player keeps saying wrong region so I'm having to play it on my laptop which is annoying.<br /><br />But that's the only bad thing about it
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|An easy read with a nice storyline. A few twists along the way to keep you guessing for a while and a nice ending.
1878424319|1.0|Perhaps the startling number of rave reviews for this book is the clearest indication of our (societies) spiritual deficit.<br />The four agreements seem like excellent common sense, what more to say?<br />Some very informative reviews on here and, on reflection, I have decided to save myself some time and money and not read this book.<br />Am I a fool, or am I displaying great wisdom?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great fun.  If you love horses and want to learn more about caring for them, get ready for every aspect of riding, grooming, feeding, &amp; loving your own horse avatar.
B008MILL9G|5.0|Service was quick for standard shipping and overall experience was amazing!. The movies in it if itself are amazing and the quality of image are spectacular. Another great collection added to my DVD/Blue-ray collection thanks to amazon and its great prices!.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is such a great story of learning about yourself and your own limits. Break out the tissues though, it's an ugly cry kind of story.
B0012QK8OE|5.0|This music is timeless, it sounds just as relevant today as the first time I heard it back in high school over 30 years ago. It was originally released back in 1971.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved how the story kept building and bringing the two characters together; not predictable.  Great character development.  Thank you for this great story, Corie Glavina.
B001OGWY1W|4.0|I Love this film, Heath Ledger was at his best walking a fine line of insanity. Great cast & the momentum of the film never lags.

B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Got hooked on the first season and the second season was even more twisted;;;loved it!...can't wait until season 3!....see if they can outdo themselves
B009GIPDQS|5.0|Grisham does this so well, even though it is out of the courtroom all of the twist of the law from behind the prison walls to the FBI to out of prison and playing the FBI it all makes for a superb read, a real mind tester as the plot unfolds. Buy it,Read it!
0393316041|5.0|Don't expect any physics from this book. This book is about someone who loves to apply his knowledge to trivial/complex problems of daily life. The book is small and funny. Its filled with pranks.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have read most of the Nicolas Sparks books, he gets better as he goes and has outdone himself with this one!  His words painted pictures I could see and I could feel her fear. I hope the movie does this book justice because it deserves it.
B007ZTLLMK|5.0|Helidroid 3D works great (as described).  Easy enough for most poeople to enjoy without getting too frustrated (like many other Helo games).  You can use either GYRO CONTROL or on-screen JOYSTICK type Control.  Both are very sensitive but Smoother and more Forgiving than most other Helicopter apps that I have tried in the past.  This one is EASIER to LEARN and CONTROL so it is a definite KEEPER for me!<br /><br />LIKES:<br />Very Good 3D Graphics, REALISTIC Movements and Good Physics makes great Helo Flying Fun.<br />Controls are the BEST I HAVE SEEN for this type of game with your choice of two good methods.<br />Music and Sound Effects are very nice and can be turned off if you like.<br />30 Well designed levels have Fun Challenges that get progressively harder.<br />Good Tutorial and Instructions for every mission level make playing easier and more enjoyabe.<br />Shooting Missiles at targets is a nice extra but takes practice to learn the right positioning to fire.<br />Game is somewhat forgiving if your Rotor gets too close to objects (does not persistently crash).<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />Exceptional game that let's you have lots Fun instead of Frustrating you like most of this type.  You do not need to be an experienced Gamer to master the controls and get Engaged in the game play.  If you like the Basic Concept of Flight Simulation, you should like this game.  I recommend it.
B002SAUCBC|5.0|Stephen king never disappoints!<br />Loved the story, a bit different than his usual horror!<br />Nice change and great easy read.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|Great price for a classic movie.  We still laugh just as hard as we did the first time/ This has now become part of our Christmas tradition.
0761169253|5.0|I read through the whole thing the day I received it in the mail. Definitely a refreshing kind of attitude! Gives you that extra bit of motivation to be creative. Was so good that I lent it to a friend of mine who has a creative career as well and have yet to hear back but he read the first few pages and was impressed.
0765325950|5.0|I love this book. It is very entrtaining andcaptivating, I would recomoned it to anyone who asks.It is a good book.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Good book, interesting story line. Liked the ending, wish he had elaborated more on the future of the characters.  Look forward to seeing the movie this month.
B0007PAMR4|5.0|This was a entertaining movie. I have suggested it to all of my friends. It is a great and fantastic movie.

B00B99QTM4|4.0|I've seen this movie numerous times and it's still funny and enjoyable to watch. We watched it on Groundhog Day along with our kids (who usually refuse to watch &#34;old&#34; movies) and everyone really enjoyed.  Bill Murray is a perfect fit for this movie.
B004SDEP38|1.0|The number of stars given by others show that I will not pay for the app. I pay only for apps that have 4 stars or better!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|i have redownloaded it like 10 times and after the first time i played, it doesnt open again... very dissapointed :(
B00005614N|5.0|All one can say is that we should listen, learn and wonder, over and over. It's very, very good. Here is taste, skill, reserve, phrasing, balance, beauty, performance enough for all.
034580404X|5.0|These book are amazing, there are a lot of people out there that have negative comments towards the writer and the book, but everyone is entitle to an opinion... but who care, these books are great, the story, the writing..... YES I LOVE THEM!!!!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book gives courage to those of us who are not &#34;religious&#34;.  I like the hope in the message it gives.
B00ATU5JRA|1.0|Did not download security threat came on my kindle fire. Had to delete it. very unhappy with this purchase.  Not a trustworthy app.
B004SDEP38|5.0|Worked like a charm. Was for free on black friday! can't beat that deal! very happy with the download and quality of product that is like a simple ms office for your procket!
030759565X|5.0|I receive Deb's blogs as often as she sends them out. I first experienced her recipes from a friend...salted browned butter crispy treats!  Wow...just to say.  the rest of the recipes are great also.  I bought several copies as gifts...daughters and such...they all receive Deb's blogs also.  Very much appreciated!!!!  Good cookbook....user friendly!
B004SDSSFY|5.0|Worked like a charm. Was for free on black friday! can't beat that deal! very happy with the download and quality of product that is like a simple ms office for your procket!
B004EPYZQC|5.0|Great action movie with hot men (for Mom), fast cars (for boys), decent story continued from previous movies.  I  Loved it and so did my teenage boys.  We have watched it multiple times since buying.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Awesome, fun little game! Very addicting and gets pretty challenging! You have to think carefully and fast about your next move! It's lots of fun!
086571701X|5.0|I have done my fair share of research on aquaponics and I found Sylvia's book the most helpful. It will answer most of your questions and if there is something you can't find in the book, she provides you with quality sources to check out in the aquaponics community. A must read for anyone interested in trying aquaponics.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I know this book is popular, but I wasn't that impressed.  The writing seemed a little amateur and I wasn't impressed by the character development.  I couldn't finish the first one and never bought the rest in the series.  It clearly has a following, just not from me.
0062082353|1.0|I will always appreciate men and women who have done service for their country as I was one my self, but reading this book I imagined a 5'2 guy with horrible short man complex that has alot to prove.  Blowing your own horn in a modest way. Stop trying convincing everyone else that what you did was a right thing, it sounds more like your trying to convince your self. The whole christian agenda gets annoying too. Killing out of necessity is one thing, killing out of enjoyment completely different. Good luck with the rest of your life, but I would imagine you will never have peaceful night sleep.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|It's a great show in general, but this is the season that they introduce Castiel, who is one of my favorite characters on the show. They took a really interesting turn this season, and  I really liked it!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|It was great to watch both seasons all at once; as i was traveling a lot I did not have a chance to follow it on PBS. I was happy that Amazon offered both seasons.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I liked this but I wondered what the point was, not that all books need a point, as it was entertaining and would make a fun movie.  Love conquers maybe but it was lost in the battle.  still I liked it.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I like the game. its fun. but after the second save when I try to do a third the app closes out on me not saving my game. I have negative 4 gems somehow...... please fix
B00AYB0SX4|4.0|Wanted to watch scary movie.  Saw this one and thought it was good.  Not overly scary but had a interesting story.
B000002KY8|5.0|I like it. I'd recommend it to anyone interested in music. Some of the lyrics are funny. This is a replacement copy.
B000QCQ9O8|3.0|The opening chapter narrated by Briony is delightful. For me, it went downhill after that. I found the first third of the book to be so slow that I considered giving up, but I plowed ahead and then was so incredibly frustrated by the ending that I almost regretted my decision. Don't get me wrong, McEwan is a fantastic writer. His writing is so lovely and crystal clear. I just felt like there was something missing here. The characters seem too flat. And the big plot twist at the end? Ugh... There's clever and then there's tricking the reader, and unfortunately, I felt tricked -- and cheated.
0880796863|5.0|I've had other decks. This one was a replacement deck. My very first deck was Rider Waite and I liked it a lot.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|I enjoyed Sweet Tooth more than Atonement. McEwan's writing is fantastic, as always, and Sweet Tooth is a pretty fun story. We feel a distance from the main character, Serena, but that's explained in the end. Even though there's another trick pulled on the reader, I liked this trick so much better than the one in Atonement. In Sweet Tooth, I saw it coming to some extent and it made sense within the overall context of the story.
B000002L68|5.0|More music. This was a replacement copy. I added to my hard drive where I have a growing playlist. I listen to it while I'm working.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Game was pretty cool story line did nit suck Was a good game... fun way to spend a few hours.
B00008KDHQ|1.0|This DVD NEVER work!!!! I guess that chip products gives you chip resolt.... but in this case was even worse, since the DVD NEVER WORK!!!! I will never get another DVD from this company!!!!
B007JMW46U|5.0|This illustrated book adds to the magic of Sherlock Holmes by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. I strongly recommend this book especially when you are getting it free on Amazon. Its not a mystery anymore!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game and it is 20 times better than temple run . It's more easier to play and it has more gaming choices.
B000002JSN|4.0|Really a great part of the Led Zeppelin pantheon of sound.  Essential to any Zep listener.  I particularly enjoyed the first tune on the second side - &#34;Into the Light&#34;.  Very meaningful to me in the hear and now.<br /><br />BTW: if you get a chance do read the lyrics to Kashmir - sounds like something by Lord Byron.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so cool I really enjoy it. The graphic are so cool. Its almost 3d'ish. One of  the coolest game ive. Seen so far
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I'm addicted my 7 year old my toddlers love this game to funny I really enjoy playing this game . I'm up all night trying to beat this game . I'm like crack head getting my fix on. Great game game

B007N5YIUS|5.0|I'm addicted my 7 year old my toddlers love this game to funny I really enjoy playing this game . I'm up all night trying to beat this game . I'm like crack head getting my fix on. Great game game
B0063GORYU|5.0|I used to play spider with 2 decks of cards - certainly was a large layout.  This is certainly easier and more portable.
B007R41E8O|3.0|I enjoyed the game and the storyline. But the game kept freaking out and returning to the main menu and talking about internet connection. If not for that I would have given it 4 stars.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My children ...age 4and 5 ....and I love this game! I play everyday.  I'm addicted...*my data erased twice which is a turn off...but love it
B009A882D0|5.0|SO EXCITED TO GET THIS!  BRINGS BACK FUN MEMORIES WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS<br />I DON&#34;T HAVE ANYTHING NEGATIVE TO SAY
B0031R5K8G|5.0|The book is certainly at its best when you don't know anything about the book before you start reading, do just try the sample.
B00351YEVC|4.0|War is almost never supported by a whole nation. This book takes the reader by the hand and paints a beautiful picture of ignorance.
0062200909|5.0|Purchases always arrive on or before time and as advertised, notifications are always accurate and polite. I will be returning.
B00873GRU4|4.0|great intention underlying the book, suspensful, dramatic, very human...<br />if your looking for a great new herione<br />waiting on the next chapter...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is pretty good. It reset on me losing all my coins, points, characters, ect. I was really mad and I had to start all over, but I guess its an awesome game because I'm still playing it. Well played Subway Surfers, well played.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|I loved every minute of this gigglefest. It is hilarious to see Markup Mark sing and dance badly.  Now that's acting!
0345803485|5.0|I would read it with your significant other. This was a great read. Kept me reading all the way to the end.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|It is so great to have all of the discs together in one box so that it takes up less storage space.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|This book will warm the hearts of all, and is the best free book anyone can read. A book generations will cherish.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|is really good but the sensitivitys are really bad.  But I think it has to be a four star game.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Great game definitely worth the cost but it should have an update for the nether that would make better so do that
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I just got it but I like it soooo much!! It is at least ten times better than temple run, I'm not very good but I still want to keep playing!!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love it. a lot of different games to play.  perfect for entertainment. or just to kill the time.. so I say download and enjoy..
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow Free,I love it, I find it hard to put down and walk away from. Enjoy it greatly. Love the challenges.
B00A3DZ61W|3.0|Angry Birds Star Wars, not fun. illustration hard to view. Find myself playing other games right away. Would not reccomend it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game. Very entertaining to play. Love the game. Everyone should get the game and play. Good for kids.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|This game is BEYOND frustrating. Its is quite fun and addicting but its ALWAYS takes my coins. I get to about 3000 and out of no where all of my coins are gone. I had to delete it because it is glitchy as all get out!
1250006341|5.0|This book is so much fun to read. Many details of the episodes are amplified with simple explanations of historical context. I really enjoyed all the behind-the-scenes pictures. For example, the antique car contrasted by a modern camera crew at work filming it. I recommend this book to anyone who loves the series.
B0001IN07Q|5.0|I love this CD and will listen to it often.  It makes me want to sing!  Thank you Michael!  Enjoy!
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Really? Tom Sawyer needs a review. It's the adventurous story of Tom Sawyer, a young boy who likes mischief! What else needs to be said?
B007XIC1GI|5.0|GOOD MUSIC. BOOK IS AWESOME. REALLY DESCRIBES THE LIFE OF MARILYN MANSON AND HOW FAMILY, RELIGION, AND THE WORLD HAVE SHAPED HIM.
B003UYUP58|5.0|I am a physician with cancer and find the information in this classic book invaluable.  It is well written and full of facts and interplays amongst the different approaches to the somewhat barbaric (to this day) treatment of the many forms cancer takes.<br />Read it, it is one of the best books I've ever read on cancer therapy
B0093QHW7G|5.0|This documentary is not only the ultimate collection of Harrison's work, but it also highlights his spiritual journey. It's sad. sweet and has a lot of humour as well. I highly recommend viewing/buying it. I've seen many documentaries on him, but this one tops them all.
096798467X|5.0|Excellent product, excellent service, be more than happy to recommend this product to anyone who desired it or one like it.
B006ID01OS|5.0|I am working as a strategic consultant, advising the CEO of a well-known firm on new business strategy.  I've read most of the top books on the subject over the past 20 years, but this is still a &#34;must read&#34;.  The Strategist gets straight to the point about why developing the optimal business strategy for a particular company is critically essential, but never easy or obvious.  There are many excellent insights in The Strategist, bringing all of what you've learned so far into perspective.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I have used this to delete unwanted files from the Kindle Fire HD. Very handy, indeed. It's worth every penny.
B00ADQ7JCS|5.0|Quintessentially English, modern prog:<br />Short and long-form musical structures, layered sound and melodic guitar lines over keyboard washes.<br />Changes of tempo and time signature variations; tenor, high tenor or female vocals commonly utilised to compliment the soaring instrumentation and arrangements.<br />Usually takes its lead from classic 70's progressive rock; musically influenced by early-era Genesis and a smattering of YES in vocal arrangements and harmonies.<br /><br />Some bands successfully create their own sound within the above template; others think a little outside the box and expand or even challenge the genre.<br />But many sink into the murky progressive waters, weighed down by a prog-by-numbers predictability and ponderous passages only their prog-mother could love.<br /><br />Lifesigns, the new band project featuring John Young (keyboards, lead vocals), Nick Beggs (bass, stick, vocals) and Frosty Beedle (drums) intentionally and unashamedly follow the first of those three examples.<br /><br />But the album is far more than \\"quintessentially English, modern prog\\" because Lifesigns carries elements of melodic rock and pop, has hooks a plenty and contains complex but not overly-complicated musical sections that never outstay their welcome.<br />The overall character of the album is best described as musically vibrant and bright, primarily due to the use of major keys and their uplifting, tonal qualities.<br /><br />And for those that like their six-string prog sonics melodic solos, harmony lines and guitar textures are present and accounted for courtesy of guest musicians Jakko Jakszyk (Jakszyk, Fripp and Collins), Robin Boult (John Young Band) and prog luminary Steve Hackett.<br /><br />The predictably progmospheric intro to `Lighthouse' leads to a simple but short melody line before it ebbs away and the song surfaces in all its modern prog glory.<br />Truly progressive in arrangement and featuring some driving bass runs from Nick Beggs, thesong carries a melodic groove throughout its opening minutes before a reflective middle section calms the Lighthouse seas.<br />The instrumental finale, featuring waves of stormy but melodic guitar soloing, builds to a crescendo before dissipating to the sounds of thunder, sea birds and water lapping at the Lighthouse rocks.<br /><br />The lighter and charming `Telephone' delivers both a perfect change of pace and more restrained sound.<br />The song could well be a relative of the Genesis soft-rock classic `Follow You, Follow Me' (albeit a second cousin once removed) and its rhythmic vibe owes as much to melodic ambient pop as progressive rock.<br /><br />'Fridge Full of Stars' is also full of atmosphere, the ethereal mid-tempo number featuring lush vocal arrangements and some flute interjections from Thijs Van Leer of Focus.<br />It has some sumptuous, symphonic moments (not dissimilar to Swedish proggers The Flower Kings at their harmonic best) while lyrically capturing what the listener is hopefully experiencing:<br />\\"Watching the world go by, a smile upon his face...\\"<br />Couldn't have put it better myself.<br /><br />'At the End of the World' builds from an almost melancholic and genuinely poignant beginning to a melodically rocking hook-laden number with \\"watch it burn, watch it fall!\\" lyrical finale.<br />The uplifting musicality of the song's end section is seemingly tempered by the lyrical slant but, as is the case throughout the album, the lyrics are open to listener interpretation.<br /><br />The highlight of Lifesigns is the closer `Carousel,' featuring majestic rise and fall right from its rhythmic, pulsating get-go.<br />Dominated by John Young's keyboards and cathedral like sound-scapes, Nick Beggs and Frosty Beedle anchor the piece while driving the rock sections of the multi-faceted number.<br />A musically dynamic end to the album and a progressive soundtrack to the carousel of life.<br /><br />There are some sublime moments on Lifesigns with each of the five tracks perfectly weighted for maximum effect.<br />And all within an album that clocks in at just less than 54 minutes (an EP by today's self-indulgent prog standards).<br /><br />The band worked with sound engineer Steve Rispin to create a warm, layered sound and it's probably not over-stating the case to say Rispin is the fourth member of Lifesigns, certainly as regards the studio band.<br /><br />\\"I'm calling out, too far to hear...\\" cries the plaintive voice of John Young in `Lighthouse.'<br /><br />I hear what you're saying just fine, John; I just hope and trust many others do, too.<br />Because these Lifesigns deserve to be detected well beyond the borders of Planet Prog.
B00433TO52|5.0|This is the most complete book of Shakespeare I have ever found. I cannot say enough about it. There is more to this man than people realize. A lot of Shakespeares writing is political in nature and fights against the abusive &#34;Tudor&#34; rule in England. In a tumultous period of English history, Wm Shakespeare penned some of his finest work. His sonnets are often dedicated to the son he lost at eleven-years-old. Knowing that, you will gain more from this collection than you could have otherwise. Excellent!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|A lot of people say they don,t like this book because it always has different people in Westchester. That's a lie. They cut off and put it in chronological order. And people also say if you remove one chapter it doesn't affect the rest of the book. That is also a lie, you get to see from the point of view of the guy who invented Phalax. That's just 1 example
B00AWTSRZY|5.0|Great story that entire family enjoyed. I recommend part I as well to any fan. Hope to see more of the Justice League as they age
0345803485|4.0|I bought this for my girlfriend thinking i'd get more kinky action.  I did, but not quite as much as I thought.  She actually said she wished it was more kinky.  Which I guess means I should probably marry this crazy woman or something.  But it did produce the desired result a few times.  She's almost done with book two now.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Hi. Get temple run 2 right now .I like that there is a bigger animal. Way better then the first one. Get it now.

1476719071|5.0|Recommend this book to anyone who loves a good love story with a bit of drama, fights, and much much more. The characters' love story was a constant battle, and the relationship between the main characters gave me whiplash(in a good way). Very good story. :) can't wait for the \\"walking disaster\\"
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This book was recommended to me by my mom. I'd never heard of Jack Reacher but I figured what the heck. I'm glad I picked it up, it's a good read -not a fast read but not a difficult one either.  I'm on the 3rd book in the series. If you are wanting to read them \\"in order\\" , you should start with The Enemy and The Affair they both take place before this book. You won't be disappointed in reading these books.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|Interesting as usual from John Grisham. His books should always be made into movies as they are so entertaining. Great!
B00A80SHFM|4.0|I love this musical and I loved the fresh take on the solos pieces I knew and loved. I read a review in another venue and the Reviewer was very unkind to Hugh Jackman, I disagree, I thought he was wonderful, &#34;Bring Him Home&#34; was a beautiful heartfelt solo.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This was an interesting read about a peculiar but genious individual who has changed all our lives. Highly recommend it.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|My daughter kept telling me to read this book and I finally did and couldn't put it down.  I was so surprised that I would enjoy a book like this.  Had to get the second book as this one drew me into what was going to happen next.

B007MAETA8|2.0|I was disappointed with this cd. Not his best work in my opinion. I bought it for cheap, so at least I wasn't out that much money.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed book 2 and 3 the best because a relationship was formed by the two main characters. Would recommend it.
0425263916|5.0|I love this series and can't wait until the next book! I was put on the pre-order list and it was mailed the day it became available.
B003O86FMW|4.0|It was interesting but not as good as the first book which led me right into the second because I wanted to know what was going to happen next.
0345803507|5.0|I enjoyed reading all 3 of these books.  If you read 1 you must continue reading the others to see what happens.  Great story.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I so enjoyed this book.  I grew up in this time period and it was so interesting to think back about how things were and how much has changed since the 60's.  Well written.
0345803485|5.0|Great story!  You need to purchase all 3 books to continue reading the story.  I would purchase these books again!

0345803493|5.0|Great book.  I enjoyed reading all 3 books.  I would purchase any other books by this author.  You need to purchase all 3.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Killer app that saves my sanity.  Very accurate and easy to read results help me track down rogue AP's on my network.  I have other tools for more deep dives, but this is the tool that gets it all started and tells me if I have trouble or not.
B00008G8LG|5.0|Fans of the movie-musical The King and I, starring Yul Brynner and Deborah Kerr, may find Anna and the King takes them deeper into the connection between Siam's King Mongkut (Chow Yun-Fat)and the widowed English schoolteacher Anna Leonowens (Jodie Foster). Based on Leonowens' diaries, this film and its script focus attention on subtleties of body language and dialogue to transform a challenging business relationship into a poignant love story. Musical cues in George Fenton's score and held gazes under Andy Tennant's direction alert viewers to moments in the gradual intensification of Mongkut's and Leonowens' bond. Their shared struggles, sorrows, and triumphs could easily be a part of any couple's slice-of-life. Anna and the King offers one view of how a woman and a man negotiate their differences and grow together in the process.
B007REW8DO|5.0|I love this cd it has so many good songs if you love her music you must buy this ....
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Of course, The Weather Channel has a wonderful reputation for accuracy.  No matter where I end up in my travels I can get up to date weather.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wonderful writing,perfect cast,great step back in time in an extraordinary setting. Would recommend strongly for genre and period authenticity of historical fiction.
B003XQM2YU|5.0|A bit long but worth every viewing minute.<br />Good characterizations, photography, scenery.<br />The Crowe & Blanchette chemistry was very good.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Pornography turned bodice ripper. A man given to various perversions falls in love and begins the process of recovery. Clinically unbelievable and I hope women who are suffering through B&D with their partners don't get the idea that their love can heal.
B004AQR29C|2.0|It has unnecessay violence and bloodshed.<br />Stallone et al clinging to a film genre whose time has past.<br />Attempts at humor lost.
B003B02O7I|5.0|A good adventure and a good read. People at their worst and people at their best. I didn't want the book to end.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun and very addictive! !!!!!!!!!! When u grt this game you will not want to put it downnand you get to kind of compete against your friends to see who can get the furthest ... have fun!!!!!!! (:
B007J4T2G8|3.0|My septuagenarian friends recommended this book so I started it and couldn't put it down. The people are repulsive and unbelievable and one wonders how the author did her research.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I really love this app but it wouldnt let me play it after awhile It constantly brung me back home
B005NNVPOO|5.0|Pink Floyd presented a quite precise and exquisit critic to modern society on &#34;Animals&#34;. Without a doubt, this is one of his masterpieces. A must for every progressive rock fan.
B004H4XLRE|4.0|It appears to be a nice storage space for little cars, but it doesn't shout the cars out with much power when you pull back the lever. I guess it depends on what your purpose was in purchasing this toy.
B009E3EY38|5.0|A must for a so-called rock and roll fan. Although there is no more John 'Bonzo' Bonham in the band, his son, Jason, did an outstanding on the drums. The Hammer of the Gods is back.
B004KKXMSI|5.0|I find a lot of the DVDs and Blu Rays I order come with the case cover being dented and smashed up on the corners. I did not have this problem and was very happy about it.
B000X107GI|5.0|Fast service.<br />Arrived in excellent shape.<br />Well packaged and shipped promptly<br />Will recommend to anyone<br />Works as advertised and described
B0091Q82L8|5.0|Great album, nearly as good as Live At Leeds expanded edition, but very worthy.<br /><br />But here is the thing that confuses me... why is it called a Deluxe Edition?  The label &#34;Deluxe Edition&#34; implies that it is somewhat enhanced over a standard version that exists.  This may be with enhanced cover art or content.  Where is the standard edition off of which this &#34;Deluxe Edition&#34; of Live At Hull is an elevated version of?  To my knowledge there isn't.<br /><br />If in the future they release a cut down version, then that will be a &#34;compact&#34; version a la &#34;Compact Snap&#34; by the Jam.<br /><br />Definitely any of the more recent CD editions of Live At Leeds, other than the original 6 song LP and 1980's CD release, would be somewhat deserving of the &#34;deluxe&#34; label as they are expanded and improved by the inclusion of more music or original artwork packaging.<br /><br />However, when the original set is released as is and there is no other version out there, it is wrong to slap a label on the front of the package labeling it the &#34;Deluxe Edition&#34;.  It is the only Edition that that is available.<br /><br />That said, it's worth listening to.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|this is an exceptional series performed by great actors.  it draws you in to the story, and has historical references to explain the foreign culture from that time.  watched it years ago & bought it for myi husband this year to revisit.  love it the 2nd time around just as much as the first.
B0012DP8A6|5.0|A classic rendition of an amazingly funny and quirky musical. Steve Martin is perfect as the dentist! And Rick Moranis will always be Seymour in my mind.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|One of the best shows out there!!!  The cast is great and I almost always laugh with every show. Def a great buy!
B000AGTPUU|5.0|One of the best movies of all time. We love watching this one over and over. Great for kids. Price was fantastic.
B00B7FXYJG|5.0|If you are into watching DC animation movies, you have to watch this one.  I though Part 1 was good but Part 2 is great.  Just to see them years later or just to see how Bruce and Clark react with one another on how they really feel...classic.
1423140591|5.0|We bought this for a friend's child who had already read the first of the series. She was very happy with the gift and we were happy with the price.
B007G51UV0|5.0|I paired this with the Intel Core i7-3770K and a Noctua cooler with Arctic Silver thermal paste.  Added 16GB of RAM but waiting to upgrade to a better graphics card.  Anyways, combine all of this with a SSD boot drive, I have got myself a blazing fast system that I use regularly for work and play.  I am not a hard-core gamer but this gets the job done without any issues.  I was able to overclock the i7 to 4.2 without much work but the 3700K runs hot.  So I reduced it to 3.9 and I couldn't be happier.  Well until I get some liquid cooling in there so I can go higher.<br /><br />So if you want a really good processor that can handle anything you throw at it for a budget, look no further and combining that with any Asus motherboard is a no braining in my opinion.  I have used Asus motherboards for years and they have not let me down yet.  I would highly recommend this board also without hesitation.
B003MC5N28|4.0|I absolutely loved this book! I should have read this book a lot earlier but I was not impressed by the cover, thinking that it was a boring book about an old man. It turns out that the main character is a young boy, and I fell in love with the Giver's (the man on the cover's) personality! I cannot wait to read the second book.<br />  Some parts I thought were very tragic, but that makes you care for the characters more. This is now one of my favorite books. Hooray for Lois Lowry, a writing genius!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a great app, certainly one that every kindle user should have installed on their fire!! This app is super accurate and the fact that the developer went out of their way to make ads not annoying is saying something! Download it!
B004CFBMRY|5.0|If this doesn't want to make you bust out the door and head off for a run purely for the love of feeling the wind in you hair then you need to read it again - properly this time.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Really enjoying this CD and love almost all of the tracks.  The show has grown on me and as I continue to watch, there is more music that I hope will be released on another CD down the road.  I read an early review of the show that said the music fell flat--I don't agree.  I think it continues to get better and better.
B008CP92ZO|3.0|Cute movie here and there.  Frustrating chemistry between Paul Rudd & Jennifer Aniston on screen detracted from the viewing experience.
0525953728|5.0|really good read.I do not know why that I need to say any more than that,but that is what it says to do
B009H442DG|4.0|Enjoyed the CD.  Was nice to see Olivia Newton John and John Travolta team up.  Gave to two friends as gifts.
0316044695|5.0|I'm sure that I will like it,it was recommened by Chris Kyle,God rest his soul.We lost another great American hero
B00AJLHUWQ|5.0|Shrine Of New Generation Slaves, from 2013, is the fifth full-length studio album by the superb Polish Progressive band Riverside.<br /><br />If you haven't heard Riverside yet, but are a fan of Prog, Neo-Prog or Prog Metal and especially if you are a fan of bands like Pink Floyd, Marillion, Porcupine Tree, Opeth, Pain Of Salvation, Tool and Karnivool, then you really ought to at least check them out. They blend familiar sounds from many types and eras of progressive music into a distinctive and fresh sound all of their own, and manage to write great songs in the process.<br /><br />To call Shrine Of The New Generation Slaves a departure from the band's established sound may be a little bit of an overstatement, but its certainly no repeat of anything they've done before either. Don't get me wrong, the band are still playing creative, interesting and thoughtful progressive music that is accessible but with a bit of depth, and that owes as much to the 1970s as it does to both the 80s and modern Prog and Prog Metal bands like they always do, but the mood of the record is very different.<br /><br />Its a lot brighter, bouncier and almost happy sounding, which is not something you would usually associate with the band, save perhaps 2009's ADHD album. Its definitely closer in spirit to ADHD than it is to 2011's Memories In My Head EP, but then again its really not all that sonically similar to ADHD either when you get right down to it.<br /><br />It feels like the band just want to mix it up a little and avoid becoming stale. The main riff from the lead single `Celebrity Touch' for example sounds more like something from a stoner rock band, or perhaps even Coverdale era Deep Purple.<br /><br />The title track; after a powerful intro reminiscent of the band's Second Life Syndrome material, is a similarly fun and 70s sounding track. There are really heavy bits punctuating it, but the track is primarily constructed from fun bendy riffs and playful keyboards.<br /><br />`Feel Like Falling' has an off-beat and synthetic tinge to it that is very reminiscent of the 1980s. Its fun, but fun in a completely different way. `Deprived' by contrast is moody, hypnotic and jazzy sounding.<br /><br />Then there's the twelve-minute `Escalator Shine', which at first sounds like a modern reimagining of Gentle Giant's `In The Glass House' doing a tour of different moods before it goes off on various tangents. At points, its the closest the band have ever come to sounding like Jethro Tull in a strange, small way but other sections are drenched in keys that remind you of Animals era Pink Floyd, then theirs fast bits that go a little Dream Theater-esque, vocal styles the band haven't tried before and it even kicks off into big groove at one point.<br /><br />The record ends on an acoustic number, which the band have done before, but this one has a much brighter, sweeter and more positive sound than any they've written in the past.<br /><br />If you love the band's early stuff already, don't be scared off by reports of a drastic shift in sound and style. Its not so much a band reinventing themselves but rather the same bad in a different mood. They undeniably do try new things but their core sound is still detectable. There are still lots of proggy moments, bits that calm down into spacey moods and Mariusz's distinctive voice and bass sound still anchor's it to the band's core sound.<br /><br />Regardless of style, the quality of the material is superb. Its brilliant, genuinely fresh and exciting progressive music that isn't too basic, or indeed too dense. There's a mixture of acoustic, electric and electronic components, brilliant clear vocals conveying a mixture of emotions, additional instrumentation in small non-novelty bursts. Everything is tastefully woven together and it flows well as an album. You get small twinges of everything the band have done before and new ground as well. Really, you couldn't ask for more.<br /><br />I'm not sure if this wouldmake a great first Riverside album for a new fan or not, its certainly pretty accessible and very enjoyable indeed, but at the same time perhaps try it in addition to one of their other studio albums as well just to be safe.<br /><br />For existing fans, give it a try. It is a very good and enjoyable record indeed. As long as the stylistic shift doesn't put you off, the incredible quality of the music should convince you. The only real flaw anyone could level against it is that the experimentation results in less cohesion than Riverside albums usually offer, but that' really down to personal taste.<br /><br />Personally, I love this record. It delivers enough heaviness, enough subtleness and enough fun little touches here and there to draw me in. It balances enough of what I already liked and enough surprises to really captivate me as a fan and I haven't been able to take it off repeat since I first heard it.<br /><br />*** If you can, and if its reasonably priced, try and get yourself the special edition of the record. It contains a second disc with two bonus instrumental tracks called `Night Session' parts one and two, which collectively come in at around twenty-two minutes. They're in a completely different style than the album itself, but are a great addition. ***make a great first Riverside album for a new fan or not, its certainly pretty accessible and very enjoyable indeed, but at the same time perhaps try it in addition to one of their other studio albums as well just to be safe.<br /><br />For existing fans, give it a try.

B0010SKSTO|5.0|Brief and skeptical view about body signs we see everyday but don't give the right importante to it. I totally recommend it.

B002LFPAUC|5.0|Anyone who likes John Cleese has to have this. Each episode is full of hilarious snide comments by his character.
B009T3AE1Y|4.0|I thought this was an excellent film.  Robert Pattinson was exceptional in this role.  The final scene with Paul Giamatti was amazing.  I had read the book and thought this captured the essence very well.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It will randomly close out sometimes which is really frustrating cuz I will have wasted coins or lives but my progress won't be saved... other than that I love it!

B008K6HN8I|4.0|This app is almost a must to have if you own a kindle, I had gotten a few books that were not through Amazon and didn't download to my Kindle. Researching I found most everyone said &#34; ES file Explorer&#34; was a must. It did help me recover the 4 books that I got through a different site but could use on Kindle. You don't have to be a rocket scientist  to use it but I do suggest having some PC knowledge.<br />Recommend?? Only if you have a Kindle. I've not seen anywhere else that this app is needed for other readers
030746363X|5.0|I like the way Tim presents his information and data.  Tim's approach is different and I have been able to do things in the gym that evaded me previously.  I am impressed with his approach to sexual adventures, I have tried his swimming style and it makes swimming a lot easier.  There is a lot to read and a lot to learn!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved this book.  Could not put it down.  Loved the storyline and the characters.  Could not wait to get to the next chapter and the next and the next.

0802473156|5.0|This book has aided my relationships in every aspect.  You need to understand other people's language to better understand how to communicate in a way they have the ability to respond to.
B002ZCY7SW|2.0|Some of the episodes skip during play or completely freeze.  Would have returned if I had opened and used sooner then I did.
B00003CX9W|5.0|My belief is the earlier you start a child's introduction to classical music, they're better rounded musically.  What better way to introduce a child to classical music than Fantasia.  To this day, I can close my eyes listening to any classical style and see wonderous adventures of make believe characters.
B0079J28NW|5.0|The art work of the sleeve is great (they also include stickers and transparencies) and the quality of the remastering is terrific as well (sound is exceptional). Nothing to complain about. My kid loves this and this animation carries the right message for developing children.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Dungeon hunter3 is a amazing game. At first it was hard to get money but then it got easier. The only problem is that sometimes the monsters lag and you fail. You should really get this game.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like it but would like to watch an event after I go through it. when you visit other horses I think we should get award for that.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|fully action packed movie. great to see all the actors from so many movies together in one. killer action packed effects. highly recommend this movie for all those who like action movies..
B000LB7G00|5.0|If you're doing 3D work of any kind and you're not using a 3D mouse then you fail! I would not recommend using this mouse unless you have to go portable because the Space Pilot (the big brother) is even more epic. Don't skimp out and say &#34;hey I'll try this SpaceNavigator first and see how it goes&#34;... nope get the Pilot for your desktop AND the Navigator for your laptop.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|great cute movie, very entertaining....kids loved it and so did i.. highly recommend this movie for all ages...two thumbs up..
B007IXWKUK|4.0|It was very interesting, it did keep me reading, it had some nice twists to the story without straying from the main story line.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Dr. Eben Alexander, 111, M.D. wrote this miraculous story of his real life/death experience in a manner that anyone could read and understand!  He made it so very credible and everyone should read it!
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|I expected the 1st movie to be a joke. I watched it primarily out of obligation because I love all the action heroes that are in it. I did not expect much for the quality of the movie and I was completely shocked. It was so good that I didn't have the same reservations about this 2nd one and it didn't disappoint. Non-stop action!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game! It's really great! I just don't like the fact that you have to spend money on coins.
B008VBYN80|4.0|This game is great I love the battles that you get to have and this different things you can do. I don't like that you never have enough diamonds unless you spend a lot of money of a lot of patience.
B005KDDUVS|5.0|Magnífica lectura que te mantiene en suspenso hasta el final.  Te lleva en un viaje por una Barcelona antigua donde se confunden &#34;la realidad&#34; con &#34;la fantasia&#34;.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It's a fun game but like other people have said once you leave the game it won't reload. I've also notice that sometimes the game moves very slow.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|people you have to play this game because it is very cool. you really. need  to play this game because it is cool
B005RAO0GS|5.0|Florence sure knows how to make an album. I love it.<br />It is a wonderful addition to  my music collection and i cant stop listening to it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have read just about all of the authors books and this one really<br />was as entertaining as any I have had the privelage read.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book with twists and turns! Keeps you reeled in right from the start! Highly recommend! But be ready to stay up late as the book begs to be read!
B004LROUNG|4.0|As usual John Grisham continues to hold your interest through the whole book right up to the end - one of the best writers today!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This USB Cable works great.  No problems hooking up.  Kindle charges faster for me.  I would recommened this product for Kindle Fire HD also.
1592402038|4.0|Eats, Shoots, and Leaves is such a fun and funny book! For laughter and learning, Eats, Shoots, and Leaves makes punctuation - yes, punctuation! - exciting. If you have a few questions, or just need to brush up on the rules, this book is reads almost like a novel, casting punctuation marks as Austen-like characters.<br /><br />As much as I enjoy this book, Truss's militant attitude toward punctuation errors threatens to miss the mark of what matters in writing - ideas, organization, and exploration. Additionally, for the beginner, this book could come across as harsh. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone without a decent grounding in punctuation knowledge, for fear they may get discouraged or feel mocked.
B007MAETA8|5.0|I own the entire John Mayer library, and before this album released, I thought that no matter which album I was listening to (or re-listening to) I believed that was his best project.  Once &#34;Born and Raised&#34; came out, I think it is John Mayer's best album...along with every other album he has released.  Do yourself a favor, and buy this album...and then buy any other album of his that you don't already have...because they are all his best!
0205313426|5.0|Clear. Concise. Concrete. The Elements of Style classically informs all - from the budding writer or experienced author - about the foundations of good writing. Though it is often used as a simple reference, a thorough read-through from front to back reveals the wit of the authors as well as their intelligence. The amount of information and expertise in this piece makes it an indispensible resource, especially for the college student.
B008NW67E0|5.0|This is a great album.  I loved their debut album so much, and I was afraid what a sophomore release might lack.  While I still enjoy their first album more, I think this album is incredible.  Not disappointed!
B0058VW36U|5.0|Soooooo addicting. I do wish that the Om Nom superpowers would cost less. Please do this!!! Or... I got nothing.
B0051HNMTI|3.0|Its okay. Not what you would expect. Good for beginners with no background in the gym or working out. At home kind of app.
B009HELT3C|5.0|Awesome. Bit humorous. &#34;Actiony'. These are the feelings I felt while I watched this movie. Though, could you make your movies not need WIFI? Please?
B007TML4EI|3.0|Some levels are straight boring while others were quite challenging. Good way to kill time though! Thanks for the app!
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|It was really cool but then it told me that the demo was over so that was a bummer. Good
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|this game is great but i don't like that they put a timer. don't get this game.TRUST ME! don't waste time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Soooo addicting. Although, I do wish that you could pt different mods on this game. Please do this or...got nothing.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think it is a great game. I love the new ropes and the gocarts. you shoulg get this game.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|I liked how everything would make you crazy because people kept coming in and out in and out. It was a fun experience being a waiter for a restaurant. This is my favorite game!!!!
B009NPKTN6|1.0|Please do yourself a favor and skip. This movie is not even worth it, even out of a sense of morbid curiosity.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|This series is amazing. I cannot put them down. They are long but filled with drama. Like riding a roller coaster.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Phenomenal book, I had hoped for as good as Fifty Shades and found it was better by far in every manner
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great series.  I am watching one chapter a day so it last longer. I love movies about merry old England.
B0066WJLU6|4.0|I like this app. It does what it states it does. Wish it was a bit brighter,  but overall, its good. Like the Colorado change feature.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Nice to wake up to a song of your choice. Like the math problems option.  all in all a good alarm app.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|cute game my kids love playing. not bad graphics,  a little slow loading at first.  over all not a bad game considering it is free.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Very addictive game.  I like the fact you only get so many coins at a time. Makes it easier to play for a few minutes a day and walk away.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is lots of fun to play. It keeps me entertained. I wish there was a little more hands on stuff with the horse and horse care but overall one of my favorite apps.
B000031WYP|4.0|Was a gift to my friend .  He says he likes it,I really don't know how much he likes to listen to it.  I was trying to be nice ,because he gives me some good selections a t time.  Oh well  Cavallera Rusticana.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that subway sufers is a great game.it's so cool to play.I also love the fact that it went threw a up grade to Rio
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|First let me start out by saying that I am and have always been a huge Josh Groban fan. After listening to his latest work, \\"All That Echoes\\" I will have to be honest and say that for me, I don't feel that this album is his best body of work. It pales in comparison to \\"Illuminations\\" or \\"Awake\\". Although I would listen to him sing the phone book and give his voice alone five stars,still it would be just the phone book. This album is lacking energy and spark. I really got excited when I heard that he was covering the Stevie Wonder song \\"I Believe\\" (When I Fall in Love It Will be Forever\\"). Although I enjoy listening to Josh sing it, I have to be completely honest and say that Art Garfunkel did a much, much better arrangement of this song years ago on his \\"Breakaway\\" album. Art Garfunkel's version is much more up tempo, has a better orchestral arrangement and his flawless tenor voice just makes this song come alive. If you have never heard his version, I urge you to listen to it. Art, like Josh has a flawless voice and I would pay big money to see these two perform together in concert.<br /><br />Not one song on this album stands out for me. \\"Changing Colors\\" seemed just a little too slow paced. I really enjoyed/loved his performance of this song on his last tour and I wish that Cavello had let/encouraged him to perform it on this album that way.  I think that Rick Rubin worked better with Josh on \\"Illuminations\\" than Cavello did with Josh on this album. Rubin seemed to  have challenged or pushed Josh to take more chances and in a different direction, and that translated into a brilliant sound due to better song choices. I just felt Josh's excitement and energy more on \\"Illuminations\\". With that being said, I would still recommend that any fan purchase this album, although nothing new from Josh, his voice is always worth the listen and the price of the album purchase.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|Survival craft demo is a good replacement for minecraft, but the demo is WAYYYYY to short. I played this demo for like 15 minutes and then it told me to purchase the full version because the demo is over. Other that that it's awesome.
B009HELT3C|4.0|Great special effects as usual.  Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith were great and I enjoyed the addition of Josh Brolin to the storyline.  Good entertainment.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a quest trying to not get caught by the inspector.You can join Jake and his friends on their amazing world tour.it deserves a Nobel peace prize
B00APUQPX6|4.0|I always enjoy the Ice Age movies.  Great animation and characters.  Light-hearted and good for some laughs.  Bonus for the kids -- there is always a lesson that is learned from the story.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I had a hard time moving to digital books. I have zillions of real books and often seek them out. When I moved to the kindle, this cover at least allows me to think I'm carrying around one of my bound books. I love the look and feel this cover has and it keeps my new kindle snug as a bug!
B00AE2LJVS|2.0|The previews led me to believe that this would be a good movie.  It was very drawn out and the characters weren't interesting.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Great game for when you need something to do to pass the time. A little bit of thinking goes into playing this game. Be careful playing this game, as the minutes tick away. And free is always good.
B001ZG4J00|5.0|Can't believe I never heard him in all these years. This is a spectacular album.  I can't stop playing it.

B009WO7NQO|3.0|Love all the angry birds games and this one is truly special.  But, here we go again with the SLOWWWWW updates!  Why are the kindle fire folks treated like stepchildren?  Give us the update to Hoth like all other devices have had for weeks.  This slow update situation is way past old.  Come on Amazon and Rovio get it together and stop making us wait a ridiculously long time EVERY time there's an update.

B008ER9QLK|5.0|I've not read any of the other 62 reviews of this DVD set.  While Amazon may like a \\"discussion,\\"  I don't.  What is the point of reviewing a review?  To prove that everybody has an opinion?<br /><br />What's NOT to like about the LePage \\"Ring?\\"  Well...it's hard to find, these days, cameramen for TV or movies who don't think extreme close-ups are exciting.  I don't.  When a character's face fills the whole screen, something is very wrong.  Many of the singers in this \\"Ring\\" perspire heavily and there is no need whatever the see rivers of sweat coming down faces.<br /><br />I've seen worse costumes in other \\"Rings.\\"  The costumes here are pretty bad.  Amazingly wonderful, though, is Erda's \\"Siegfried\\" black glass costume.<br /><br />Gerhard Siegel's Mime is by far the worst of the characterizations we see.  Though his singing is fine, he thinks of himself, surely, as the Jim Carrey of opera - full of comic antics which Siegel thinks make his character more interesting - like sticking carrots in his ears.  What Siegel has done is present characterization distractions which hurt Wagner.<br /><br />For me, the best acting and voice comes from Eric Owens as Alberich...particularly in \\"Rheingold.\\"  Owens is the best Alberich I've ever seen...and I've seen 18.  In my view, his is a perfect performance.<br /><br />Particularly fine is Jay Hunter Morris, who, though he looks, with that beard and mustache, like a good ol' Texas country boy, manages to act so convincingly in such an expansive way, one manages to forget the \\"machine\\" for a time.  (It has been said that at the end of \\"Walkuere,\\" Wotan nags Bruenhilde into a coma.  At the end of \\"Siegfried,\\" Siegfried nags Bruenhilde into an orgasm.  And this is accomplished in spite of the \\"machine.\\"  Perhaps Don Ottavio would have been more persuasive with Donna Anna had he had a \\"machine.\\")  Aside from the enormous expense and techical difficulties associated with the \\"machine,\\" the director has a problem avoiding using it for increasingly spectacular effects as the \\"Ring\\" progresses.  It's bad enough to see the Rhinemaidens transported from the Rhine to Niagara Falls.  But when Gunther washes Siegfried's blood from his hands in the Rhine, it changes the whole river red.  The walls of Gibich Hall are an explosion of color.  Why?  It is one thing to use such a \\"machine\\" planks to represent trees, but the director has gone overboard with \\"clever\\" plank effects.  \\"Plank effects\\" are obviously divided into two parts: using the individual planks to represent various natural or architectural structures,  and using the planks as a projection screen.  Certainly, there have been better projected sets in other \\"Rings.\\"  The Valencia \\"Ring,\\" was doing better projections, but to enhance the music rather than to distract from the story, with better-looking Siegfrieds (i.e. Lance Ryan) when \\"The Ring\\" was just a gleam in Robert LePage's eye.<br /><br />The \\"machine\\" in this production is simply too expensive, too dangerous (See Siegfried fall into the fire around Bruenhide's rock.), and too distracting for a show which requires intense concentration.  Do we really need to see a forest bird sitting on Siegfried's lap?  (Is the MET doing anything at all to reduce ticket prices so that ordinaly people can enjoy live opera?)<br /><br />I am torn about Jonas Kaufmann (as Siegmund).  He is so amazingly beautiful, sexy, and fresh, I found myself wondering why he was so completely dressed.  So, is having physical perfection on stage a \\"distraction\\" or a necessary part of the story which our usual old, fat \\"Ring\\" characters cannot approach?<br /><br />In the end, I feel guilty for liking this \\"Ring\\" as much as I did.  It really WAS spectacular!!!<br /><br />P.S.  Bringing a Tarnhelm to a hunt is like bringing a toaster to a grocery store.  If Siegfried longs for Bruenhilde as he is dying, why not simply use the Helm to get him there?  Better, leave the Helm at home!  Also, why go to the trouble of creating aspear for Wotan that is built like a window shade, with a long roll of rune-laden parchment rolled around a thin metal rod?  This strange construction serves no purpose.spear for Wotan that is built like a window shade, with a long roll of rune-laden parchment rolled around a thin metal rod?

0307887448|5.0|This review isn't going to say much that is different from what others who loved the book have said. That being said...this is easily one of my favorite books I've read. I'm not a huge reader, but when I learned that the guy who wrote the movie \\"Fanboys\\" wrote a novel that was packed full of 80's movie/music/video game references, I had to give it a try.<br />I was not disappointed. I grew up in the 80's so the majority of the references were not lost on me. There were, however, some that I was not familiar with (Ex: I only ever played a little D&D and was never a Rush fan) but that was ok. It did not hurt the story at ALL and I never felt lost if I didn't fully get a reference.<br />As others have noted, if you are not familiar with a lot of the 80's pop culture references, you MAY not enjoy this book as much as you could. But don't let that be the reason you don't give it a try. It's still a fun story that keeps you wanting more.<br />I've read the negative reviews here and we are all entitled to our opinion. But I also think that sometimes negative reviews of something stem from an individual's own expectations. This novel (much like the Star Wars Prequels) has been built up so much that some people go in expecting it to be something that it never intended to be in the first place and therefore they come out of it disappointed. I actually went in thinking that I wouldn't like it. The description on the back of the book didn't really pull me in. But I gave it a shot with an open mind and, well, you see how many stars I gave it.
B003Q6D27S|4.0|This one finally wraps up the whole series, although I found the whole series too long and in the end VERY predictable.
B0035LMTZA|4.0|Fun film about a heist gone good, then bad and making up for betrayal. Great Cast and lots of fun.
B004EPYZU8|3.0|My customer is very happy that I could find this movie for him, so he could add it to the collection he plans to take on his cruise around the world.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I watched the Dark Knight Trilogy one a day.  It's magnificent, how each film ties into the previous.  What I liked most, was how Christian Bale portrayed Batman, making the Batman a real person, believable.
B00466HN6S|3.0|It's a little childish, obviously, but with some adult inuendo. Kind of hard to picture Cyclops ever wanting to be the Easter Bunny.
B00190OHD6|5.0|Excellent Movie... kind of sad, but with a great ending, the kind that you need to see.  I had it on my DVR and liked it, but didn't want to erase, so I bought the DVD in order to open up more time on the DVR.
B004EPZ07K|5.0|I don't know why the critics panned this movie so badly. I thought it was done very well and kept a true story line for those of us that actually followed the comic story for years. Definition of a critic=someone who flunked out of actually doing & couldn't get a job otherwise.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|This recording is superb.  I almost didn't buy this because of one review that indicated that it was automated on the recording.  THAT IS FALSE.  This is an excellent production, and was professionally presented with over the top on editing.  The Stage play actually added a bit more than was in the 2004 Movie with Gerard Butler, Patrick Wilson and Emmy Rossem.  But the most incredible part was at the end of the production with Andrew Lloyd Weber, along with all the men that played the Phantom in the various productions.  Glad I made the purchase.

B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Just bought the Amazon MP3 this morning and gave it one listen though.  Initial impression is that it's better than his last release.  His vocals are less dramatic and the tracks less so as well, which results in a steady calming well done album.  Great melodies.  I particularly like his cover of \\"Falling Slowly.\\"  Superb vocal performance.

B004J4WKTW|3.0|Beautiful imagery, but way too wordy, long and then just plain boring. I got tired of picking it up to read and feel I was reading the same thing over and over. This had the makings of a truly unique classic, but the writer got carried away with her own descriptions.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is good. Ut is fun and really easy. Download now ple ase it will get toy addicted to it automwticly
B00B7FXYJG|4.0|One of the best adaptions of a prize winning comic I've ever seen. Only knock on this piece is that there was no appreciable sound track which took away from some if the more dramatic scenes. Art work and animation are A+

B0079Q04LI|5.0|This book is a must read for all pilots. It not only helps broaden your horizons of possibilities during our daily duties but also helps understand ourselves in relation to our work environment and threats better.
B007ZI06FE|3.0|I liked this book, but didn't love this book. In fact, I'm not sure I will continue with the series (and that might be the most damning thing of all).<br /><br />The book started out with a bang, but then it started to wane. I haven't read many steampunk books, so I can't say that I am an expert on the genre, but I did enjoy the world building. I thought it was nice that the author decided to do something other than the normal fang and bite situation - a virus that infects a person and causes them to become a vampire is appreciated. A little more information about this virus, the process and Blade's history would have been appreciated.<br /><br />The parts I did enjoy were the sexy bits and I think they were handled well and definitely caught my attention. I am such a sucker for a sexy vampire :)<br /><br />Overall, a solid 3 stars.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I have read many books written by men and women who have served our country in our armed services.  American  Sniper and Inside Delta Force, by Eric Haney, are at the top of my list of recommended reading.<br /><br />Chris Kyle was a hero and role model to be proud of both on and off the field of battle. This open and honest autobiography of his life in the field and corresponding stress on his family is truly worth reading. Chris has a very candid, relational and sometimes comical way of telling his story. It is almost as if you are sitting on the back porch sharing drinks and barbecue while he recounts the story of his life in the Navy.<br /><br />The excerpts from his wife are true gold. They reveal some of her feelings and stress about having a husband in the military. The fact that they kept their marriage together through it all is testimony of their character and morals.<br /><br />Meeting Chris Kyle was one of my goals in life and I am truly saddened by his death this past weekend. RIP Chris Kyle, my thoughts and prayers are with your family.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great Game. I have it for PC, xbox, and PE and I absolutely love it! I encourage everyone to buy!
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|This is a great adaptation from the graphic novel.  A superbly written story that was a joy to see on the big screen or at least on a joy on my computer screen.
0812971825|2.0|This book was among several on the \\"Free-Help Yourself\\" table at the library.  The blurbs on the back cover made it sound interesting and I wondered if it had been placed on the table by mistake. Au contraire.  The writing was uneven and, in places ugly. It reads as if Ms. Strout had resurrected some old papers from a religious history course and tried to incorporate them into a story sequence while visiting a locker room.  She seemed to be striving for \\"holy\\" with many references to Bonhoeffer and cheap vs. costly grace, but her plot was weak with threads that went nowhere and the result was more \\"holey\\" than holy. Characters were wooden, not fleshed out and inserted awkwardly.  Search elsewhere for grace.
0930289234|5.0|I recommend this for anyone that is interested in writing graphic novel and/or drawing for comics.  This one is truly legendary.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great story very well written. Once you get started you can not put it down. I can't wait to read the next book in the series. Treat yourself.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|This is a simple yet challenging and HIGHLY addictive game. It works flawlessly and has great progression and rewards. You should play it.
B00902MCVY|5.0|Finally, new wintersun. Well worth the wait. Not as fast as the debut, but more epic and just as complex.
B0033PQUXA|5.0|I watched this not knowing what to expect.  Now it is one of my favorite movies. There are a couple different versions and I don't know which one I like best.
1442419814|4.0|This book left me speechless! I could not put it down! Westerfield's vision was so clear, and the story line was amazing. The concept of the book was so different from anything I have read so far. There was never a dull moment for me. I would highly recommend this book to anyone!<br /><br />Tally Youngblood is counting down the days until she turns sixteen. While most girls would be planning parties and getting new cars, Tally is looking forward to becoming a PRETTY! Her best friend Peris has already transitioned to New Pretty Town, the place you get to go once you become a pretty, and is able to do all the things pretties do. They throw extravagant parties, dress in the best clothes, and people actually like them. Uglyville is nothing like that. The uglies usually keep to themselves and refuse to venture out until they have their turn to move to New Pretty Town once they turn sixteen. Tally cannot help but sneak away one night and try to meet up with Peris in New Pretty Town, even though it is against the rules and can probably get her in a lot of trouble. She has been so lonely since he left. This changes on the night she surprises her long lost best friend. He seemed so angry with her for being there, and makes her promise she will not get caught and will not do anything to keep her from becoming a pretty again. In an attempt to flee after being discovered, Tally meets up with another ugly, Shay. She has been sneaking out at night also. Shay and Tally become fast friends, and realize they have more in common than most. They share the same birthday. This means that they will be turned together! They will not have to watch the other one leave without the other. This is why Shay's news of running away to a rebel camp shocks Tally beyond belief! Who does not want to become a pretty?! Although Shay tries to convince Tally to go, in the end Tally decides to stay. Shay leaves her a set of directions just in case she changes her mind, makes her promise to keep everythinga secret, and they part ways. Will she ever see Shay again? Will she ever make it to The Smoke, the rebel camp she left for?<br /><br />Tally cannot believe that her surgery is finally here! This is what she has waited her whole life for! She is going to be a pretty and do all the things the pretties do! Right.... WRONG?! The surgery is put off and Tally is escorted to a place called Special Circumstances. Once here, she meets up with Dr. Cable and is presented with a proposition. She has to infiltrate The Smoke and spy for Special Circumstances in order to become a pretty, or she can stay an ugly for the rest of her life. But what about the promises she has made? Can she keep both promises to both friends? She has no choice. In order to get what she wants, she has to rat Shay out. As Tally embarks on her journey, she begins to speculate about The Smoke. What if she cannot figure out the encoded instructions? Thanks to Special Circumstances, no one even knows where she is! She travels for days until she reaches the field full of beautiful white flowers. Is this the place the letter describes? The smell of fire is what jars her awake the next day. In an attempt to flee, she is \\"rescued\\" by a helicopter full of.... PRETTIES!? They call themselves the rangers and are from another city. Although they are part of the clue, they have never seen The Smoke.<br /><br />\\"Don't you know? The location's a big secret. Smokies don't trust pretties. Not even us rangers. We'll take you to the usual spot, and you know the rest, right?\\"<br /><br />At last, she makes it to The Smoke. Still at odds with herself, she explores the runaway camp. Never does she expect to change her mind about revealing the camp, nor does she plan on falling for a guy her best friend likes! After a couple of days at The Smoke, David, the crush, takes her to meet his parents. Tally is shocked to discover they used to be the operational doctors for the pretties. They share some information that may turn thetables for good. While doing some research, they discovered that they pretties are technically being turned into mindless robots. Suddenly all the rave of being pretty in not enough for Tally. She has found love and a place where she belongs. But happiness is short lived when Special Circumstances appear out of no where. What has she done?! In an attempt to retrieve the pendant, Tally escapes the clutches of Specials. She makes it to a secret hideout and finds non other than David! Thank God they did not catch him! This would be the perfect time to tell him everything. He deserves to know, but Tally just cannot do it. She cannot lose him too! David and Tally know they have to attempt to save the smokies. Without their help, they will all be forced to become mindless pretties.<br /><br />After a couple of days, they make it back to Special Circumstances and with the help of some uglies cause a diversion and make it inside. What they find is quite a shock! Who will be left standing in the end? Make sure you grab this book and find out! It is definitely worth a read!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am a pintrest addict.  I love finding ideas and love this app. I go on this app every day
B0042X9L6A|4.0|small/light speedlight, it has a good performance. TTL doesnt work that very well in every situation, I rather use Manual mode
B008JGSM6G|3.0|It is very easy, so although it is not very challenging when you have had a long day and just need to rest your brain this works great
B001NLKT60|5.0|So far, very interesting. Not fully through reading it but should be as good as the first book. Enjoyable read
1601252463|5.0|Another flawless player addition.<br />Only negative, as with any player book, I always want another with MORE options, but then again I just can't get enough.
0312020309|5.0|Love this Author!  Found him years ago as a child; rediscovered his enthusiasm for life and the Dales!  Timeless and encouraging.  His style is frank yet sensitive, real-life but kindly written!
B003F3NE1Q|5.0|Everything was good to go. I always make a purchase when the DVD's become available. I simply enjoy the show.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I started watching Once Upon a Time only a short while ago and went through seson 1 in only a few days. Season 2 continues the Intriguing plots and characters that I came to love in Season 1.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not put it down! It is such a page turner you will want to buy the whole series.
0736063684|5.0|I was looking for a book that covered a wide range of muscles and exercises and explained the how and why of it. This is the book. I bring it to the gym with me and Taylor my workouts based on the book.
B008EAWP0Q|5.0|Public Reviews Written by You<br />Show:<br /> Page: 1   2<br />pixel<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it unreservedly. I loved the theme of a paid Government assassin going about his cold hearted job, taking out those who deserved nothing more but, at a critical stage, allowing his more humane feelings to get the better of him. What follows is a deep, mysterious plot, not knowing who is behind the twists and turns - and why. Although I did pick out an enemy pretty early on who is only revealed towards the latter stages, it was really well hidden. I feel this would make an excellent movie and there are many young actresses who could play the delightfully sassy fourteen year old Julie. (Oh, for a young Tatum O'Neal!)Right mixture of romance included with the murderous action as well.<br />Will obviously read more of this authors excellent work. - billfranks.co.uk.
B0026IPAJA|5.0|Always fun to watch!  Got one for 3 yr old & One for me / grandma.<br />I Love &#34;Babe&#34; and always wanted it for myself, to have forever!
0802473156|5.0|This book was an amazing start to understanding the cause of many of my relationship struggles and more importantly, how to begin to fix them. The other book I highly recommend reading in conjunction with this one is \\"The 4 seasons of Marriage\\" by Gary Chapman.
B0086700CM|5.0|Quite the action game if you like running away from the monkey guarding the gold idol. My first experience with an action game and I really enjoy it.
B008JF8O9M|1.0|This app is pointless on kindle fire. Don't buy it at all. You only get 5 prints or so out of it anyway.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This will keep you entertained for hours......the games are challenging, frustrating and fun all at the same time. This one is really habit forming.
B005LAIISA|5.0|My kids really enjoyed this family time movie. I thought this was the best by far out of all 4 . I hope they make another one they keep getting better and better.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Came in perfect condition. I loved these movies as a kid and seeing them on BluRay was awesome!!! Worth the money to add it to anyones collection.
B00AREIAI8|2.0|It didn't work on my kindle so I deleted it.  It still sounds like something my grandson would enjoy so I may try it again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway studies is an amazing game it is fun and entertainment.it is one of the bc best games I have played in a while keep it up
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|This is a great app. It's easy to use. you can input data via a keyboard or on the screen.<br />Great for taking meeting notes.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Inspires us to remember the value of our freedom and the need to rebel to protect it. A quick read...and a cliffhanger ending that makes you  want to get to the next book.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|Beware! If you are planning to read or edit office documents using any kind of common fonts, look for another editor! This OfficeSuite ask you to purchase a pack of fonts to render documents correctly, even common fonts like Times, Verdana or Calibri. Don't pay for a demonatration app.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is so cool you can change the world of her own words from title of her life in minecraft pocket edition on kindle fire
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|It is just as a coloring/drawing app should be like! It's fun and easy to use. I recommend this app to anyone who likes to coloring and drawing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really enjoy the game you have created this helps me as i get bored with modern games.Me and my family always compete on who can get the best scores.You always mix it up with a different themes when it gets old.I love hover boreds but you should make it easyer to get coins.I love your game subway surfer.
B002VX3RCW|5.0|I have been searching for toys for my son, and when it comes to things like this it's hard to find any that aren't girly.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE this one, he's so cute and it's not a standard toy that i see a lot!  I love him and so far does my son.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|What a great story! I love Tiffany 's character and love the way Pat and Tiffany play off of one another. I love that this book explores mental illness.... not as something to be ashamed of but to show that those who suffer from depression and Bipolar disorder are just as human as everyone else.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book and I cannot wait to see the movie.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I stayed up many nights to finish this book trying to read through my tears.  May God always bless our Military for doing so unselfishly what they do.  And may God protect my son and the 1487th TC from Piqua, Ohio.  Until they All come home....
B00AREIAI8|4.0|good game cant stop playing.  once i started i thought i would cancel it but know i cant stop playin it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I first was introduced to this game by my niece at church. Later played and I'm very happy to be hooked. Lol enjoy it for yourself.
B000FA5TTW|5.0|Heard about it and finally read it, now gotta see movie<br />Very well written and thought provoking, can't wait to read her next book.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|All of the books in the series are truley amazing! I love them and the ending to this book made me tear up, beautiful!
B008ASGP3U|5.0|Reading mysteries from authors of another country not only keep me in suspense but also I get to learn a little about theri counry.  This book didn't dissapoint me.  Can't wait for the next Ian Rankin book!!!!!
B008QTVNUI|4.0|Good Story.  Touches on quite a few problems, not only with the government and politics but also in the individual lives of the characters in the story.  Nothing in life is simple or straightforward, emotions complicate the story.  The issue of POWs touches all of us from a number of wars/conflicts.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I love this app. It is very useful with all its functions and versatility. Like the many cities it has weather for.
0446401307|5.0|Just started this one but can't put it down. Love all Harry Bosch stories, and books by author Michael Connelly.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|When I first played it it was super fun.but now it's the same pattern each time.the first one is better than this I would not get it
1455519650|5.0|I purchased this think I had a new book, but have already read it. Still price was good & a great story.
B009AMALLM|4.0|I have to admit, I'm a big fan of the PA franchise. I had never seen this one before buying it, and I have to say it wasn't bad. Actually, it was pretty good.<br /><br />At first my wife and I were afraid that it was going to be an unbearable teenage romance, but it wasn't. It was actually really well done, and there were some genuinely creepy moments. There are a lot less of the startle scares that the other PAs are known for but that's fine. This one was just creepy.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is a great book series that I could not put down! Well worth the money. Great for teens and adults
0765325950|4.0|Memory of Light or light!  I don't remember all the lines of the pattern; time to read all 14 books again.  Great farewell to an epic story that had me in tears for lost heroes and laughing at matram's antics.  Bitter sweet.
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|Loved the movie, very funny!!! Jonah Hill did a fine job acting as well as my baby &#34;Channing Tatum&#34; Love Channing!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is AWSOME... I play it on pc and now that i can play it whenever I want is awsome ! The only thing is.... you get the updates late for example the 0.6.0 came out in late January and I still haven't gotten it... That's the only downside, but other than that I love it!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I LOVED THIS STORY!!!!! If this book had a theme song it would be Treacherous by Taylor Swift. This book will make every emotion come out of you. I found myself laughing out loud MANY times. The storyline is unpredictable and that's just one of the things that makes this book SO amazing. You will connect with these characters and you will feel for these characters. I could not stop reading this book until I was done. It's been a week since finishing the book and I still find myself at random moments thinking about the book and how awesome it was.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the game it's so addictive I could play on it 24/7 non stop<br />I love how the game has good quality and high resolution
B00683JK9K|4.0|This works fine on my Asus tablet. Very colorful pictures. Pieces are in a slide box on the side so it makes it a bit easy. Had a little trouble with moving the pieces over from time to time but that just might be me. :) All and all though not a bad app.
B007ZTLLMK|5.0|Hours of fun. Not your run of the mill tablet game.  This takes patience and dexterity.  Great levels you can play over and over.  Great graphics and smooth control.  My new favorite game,
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|my heart lept, fluttered and skipped a beat from beginning to end. beautiful story with a twist i dint see coming. colleen outsmarted, love that
B00B2V66VS|3.0|ok well the first time i played it was awseome but when i tried to get back on it it wouldnt let me. please please a million times FIX IT FOR KINDLE FIRES!!!! i luv luv the games other than that.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|An absolute page turner. Such a beautiful story! I couldn't put it down. One of my favorite books I've read.
B000VK99Z6|5.0|Absolutly loved it. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are brilliant actors. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes these actors
B002SSUQFG|5.0|This item is what was described. Also works perfect.i would recommend to friends for the price don't pass up.great value.
B009KYXEY6|5.0|Love her music...different from the usual crowd.... the Pepsi Cola lyrics crack me up! You'll never hear THAT song on the radio!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Loaded it on my Kindle Fire the only thing I don't like is the pop up ads when you click on the game,
8497597931|5.0|Good item,  I got this item on time<br />Good book<br />It was I expected when I order this.  I recommend.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is a comedy book and anyone that wants a laugh should consider reading this book. You can't help but feel sorry for Greg. But you can definitely relate to him.
B004SIP9W4|2.0|it was not my kind of movie.  I guess I thought it would be more like Pretty Woman.  it wasn't....
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|It's super easy to view and save things on my phone, tablet, and pc! Great for note taking !!! Worth the download!!!
B00A1EOBJQ|4.0|This cd is fun and hip. Very talented artists and actors. The price matches the value. I am very happy with the songs.
B002MT3CIY|5.0|Great to see the live performance of an absolute phenomenal audio recorded venue. Long live Mr. Richard Wright, indeed. Do yourself a favor and pick this up for your library.
B008602KQI|5.0|I loved receiving the Amazon download before I received the actual DVD in the mail. Great behind the scenes extras. Definitely made me a fan of this film and the series to come.
B003O86FMW|5.0|An  Amazingly well written novel that will captivate anyone . It is simply that much better than the average story. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B0087HT36U|4.0|I actually do enjoy this game, but I find it annoying that I have to review to get to the next level. I agree with other users regarding playing on a kindle; certain levels you cannot win the gold crown because the timing is off. If I hadn't gotten this app for free (app of the day) I can't say I would have bought it based on the negative reviews. That being said, I do own it, I do play it &amp; I do enjoy it.
B004J2TPSI|5.0|I purchased this device to pair with my Sennheiser MM550 bluetooth headphones (great also) so I could use the entertainment systems on aircraft due to lots of business travel without wires hanging everywhere.... works like a champ.<br /><br />Kurt
B005KELQEU|5.0|I use this sleeve everyday! It is durable and very easy to store. I protects my kindle very well. I'm glad I got it.
B0040ZA2FE|5.0|This and the next album (Tomorrow the Green Grass) are must haves.  The vinyl really shows off their abilities revealing much more detail than the CD's (I have both).  Great price for the pair on Amazon.  A must have for any record collection.  This group would have ranked right up there with the Byrds, CSN, and any of the great acoustic/electric bands of that earlier era.  Top notch.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|...and by that time it will be on DVD. just Hugo at his most poetic (but sometimes long winded) and a joy to digest.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|As a Christian, I have do not need proof of heaven.  However, it never hurts to get a second opinion.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and have recommended it to everyone I know.
1451696191|3.0|My daughter read this book and said that it was somewhat depressing and a bit hard to follow sometimes.  She would like to see the movie.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|this is great.  it has no creepers but this is the best game.<br />I highly recommend it. this is the bomb.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome and fun for all ages would definitely recommend for anyone could play for hours Gooo! Horses
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I like it its neat.  it doesn't freeze or any thing like that. and its great for horse lover's. I think
B0015AARJI|5.0|Great controller! works perfectly! Looks and feels brand new. Great price also. A great deal for a great controller. Awesome!
B00992CF6W|5.0|mincraft is so awesome I can jump to moon.  Minecratf is so awsome !!!!!!!!!!! I am spaechless. I don't know how I would live without minecraft.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This Temple Run is a more complicated version of the first one. The first Temple Run is definitly better just because its more simple and more of a challenge.
B000MX7V5M|5.0|One of my favorite movies.  It's always a treat to see where Hitch will appear.<br /><br />I noticed in the scene where Cary Grant is dressed in a  grey suit and goes to talk too the Police Commissioner. The pockets on his grey suit jacket appear to change, by the time he exits the scene.<br /><br />About 5 yrs after purchase here on amazon.com and probably 100+ views later; the Honorable Grace Kelly and Cary Grant are the ultimate on-screen Hollywood royalty couple.<br /><br />From a 4 to a 5 stars,  watch the film after 6:00 p.m.
B004LSO7IS|5.0|Loved the movie, watched it several times already. It has laughter, hurt, doubt and other emotions as well . I would suggest watching this movie.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is absolutely the boss! Temple run was good but temple run 2 is the best game it has alot of better graphics! Better at everything buy it!
B000ETRCMQ|4.0|Its a wonderful movie with touching issuses.  However like books don't judge it by its cover, give it a try and decide for yourself.
B004OZOTSQ|4.0|Works good. Worth the couple bucks to upload and download files when you forget your cord. It could be faster but it works.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Sam and Dean just keep saving the world by the skin of their teeth while fighting the world' s most creative and thorny monsters.<br />This season takes you walking on a tight rope over the bastions of hell and the promises of an out of reach heaven, presenting creatures that look at man, as just one Big &#34;Super Sized&#34; meal. The theme of the Dante's Inferno with worldly warnings and the Angels and Demons fight for man, keep resurfacing in a funny and satirical way.<br />The characters and plots are refreshingly unique, campy at times , but also thought provoking.<br />What more can you ask of a team of demon fighting brothers? They are entertaining, comical and generally leave you<br />with a message of hope about a world that is totally lost.
B00683JK9K|5.0|don't know what the negative reviews were about. I was able to save games. rotate pieces and no missing parts. at the menu you click the button to enable rotation. if you think you're missing parts just be sure you haven't. toggled the button to show only edges.  easy to slide the puzzle to look underneath too. when leaving game when I returned I always had the option to resume my game. be sure you have selected the same puzzle picture and your game will be there.<br />beautiful pictures. easy to use. lovely classical music which can be muted.<br />all in all a great game. even better as it was free today
B003FSTN6Q|3.0|I liked the overall series and I may have had some greater expectations for the grand finale.<br />I found most of the plots for the fifth season episodes, a bit cliched and somewhat silly.<br />Their was an overuse of melodrama in a few episodes that made it just a &#34;corny&#34; soap opera or simply ridiculous.<br />Any show on the paranormal with an emotional sub plot needs to be integrated and clever in its delivery. This lacked both.<br />There were a few episodes that were a little creative and made you pause ,wondering it's possibility.<br />I reccomend seeing this just for closure but this was not the best of the show and probably a sign why it left the air.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Not a bad game, good graphics...keeps me entertained for a good period of time, good for horse lovers. Would recommend for anyone who needs to kill time since its free
B009YP9L7U|3.0|As far as romcoms go, this is pretty by the book. A nice little read but don't expect any twists.
B000FC2KL0|4.0|This is a true story one if had same shoes on can relate to one if a kind i can feel his pain.
B0096BIENY|5.0|A wonderful CD by these talented singers - you can just get lost in there music, truely beautiful blend of voices. The songs that are on this CD are beautiful , highly recommended to Il Divo fans.
B007W7P5L8|5.0|Love the color.  Like that it can be used as a stand.  I have only had it for a short time but so far can find nothing wrong with it.
B0036K3OFY|4.0|Loved the action...the story line didn't quite flow but it was well put together. The stars of this film were awesome.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|It is a good app. I use it as an alarm clock every day. It goes off at the perfect time. I only wish I could put my own music set as my alarm. You should get this app but I suggest the Alarm Clock that you have to pay for.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Wow, really loved this book....could not put it down, I read the whole thing with in twenty four hours, Great!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I like that I can take pics and take care of my horse. I love how my horse interacts with me!!!
B00005JKNC|5.0|Lots of heart and soul here. The sets and costumes, the manners and mores, are all totally believable 1950s. Fine acting. The DVD itself was perfect--no scratches, no glitches.
1451648537|5.0|A very engaging book detailing the life of Apple founder and inspirational leader. You probably won't like Jobs much while reading the book or after completing it, but you will certainly respect and appreciate him. In a way, you might even feel sorry for him as he had demons with which he had to deal. Money can't buy contentment and I don't think he was ever content; always another goal around the bend that had to be perfectly tackled.<br /><br />There were many intriguing stories of Steve Jobs and the other creators during the burgeoning technology boom across the world.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This was such an amazing book<br /> Read it in one day.  I love the characters and the story<br />  I laughed, cried and cried our of happiness.
B009VB9VKY|3.0|I'm not sure why but I was actually thinking there would be an actual plot involved lol  The only thing that saved this movie was the awesome eye candy - that gets 5 stars but if you're looking for a thought provoking cinema, this is not it.  Mindless drool fest during a girls' movie night, perfect!
B0059XTV4Y|5.0|This is a terrific movie, very well done. I thought Madonna did an excellent job with this movie. At first, it was a little hard to follow because it involves two characters named Wallis in two different times, but then you get the hang of it. The acting is superb. Both actresses were marvelous to watch.  The moral of the story: \\"The grass is always greener...\\"  The movie is worth whatever you pay for it. Truly engrossing.  Get a bottle of wine and a box of kleenex, cuddle up on the sofa and take it all in!
1419705849|5.0|My daughter collects the Wimpy Kid series in hardback.  This is a great addition to the WK &#34;family&#34; and she's really enjoyed reading it.
B005LAIISU|5.0|My kids and I have always enjoyed the Ice Age series since it was first released so I took both of my children to this movie here locally at the dollar theater. It was the most fun we had had in a family movie for quite some time. This is the best Ice Age so far in my opinion. All of us were laughing throughout the entire show and it was enjoyable for everyone. I promptly purchased the movie upon Blu-ray release and my children have both watched it many times after. Excellent family movie, lots of fun, definitely worth the price.
B0087K3VTW|5.0|Just loved everything about this read. Smart, fast-paced, profound yet light-hearted. Just great. A little like a whimsical Da Vinci Code. (with a better payoff at the end)
B00AQCMK32|5.0|I purchased this game due to a friend's recommendation, and have not been disappointed. At merely $2.50 on the Kindle, this version is only half as expensive as the iOS version, with no cuts reducing functionality.<br /><br />The game neatly sums up the windfalls and pitfalls of the video-game industry, and manages to pay homage to the history of games without resorting to cheap nostalgia laughs or pop-culture jokes.<br /><br />5/5: for clever humor, pretty(but not overdone) graphics, an easy-to-use interface, and intuitive, yet challenging gameplay.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun to.play. it passes the time quickly and its so easy that even novice takers can play.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|No DVD collection is complete without this collection. The transfer and the audio are flawless. One of the best restorations I have ever seen. Make no mistake, buy this. You aren't truly a man until you own the Godfather on BluRay. :D
0345803485|5.0|I've always read romance novels this takes it to new level (loved it!!), shocking at the end can't wait to read Book two!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Could not put this book down once I started reading it.  Sparks has once again done an excellent job. Hope the film is just as good.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I bought this book because it had been on the bestseller list for so long.  When I was reading the book I was astonished that it even made it anywhere near publication.  It boring, redundant, predictable with shallow characters.  It takes a clever, seasoned writer to jump from one voice to another, Gillian Flynn didn't make it by a long shot.<br />I am an avid reader and will read almost anything.  This book didn't even fit in the almost anything pile.
B008XG1X18|4.0|This app is really nicely organized and esay to navigate. For the most part, it hs all the same functions as the full site. It allows me to pop onto pinterest at any given moment and is very convenient.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this, fast and quick and better than the first. I enjoy the upgrades and the level ups. Challenging and addictive.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This sequel retains the fun of the original but with many new twists and challenges. I particularly like the mine car and rope slides.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|If I could add who made the video to the video files name, I would give 5 stars and I might donate
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I just fell in love with the walking dead since my boyfriend showed me the show. Every episode is great, I'd recommend it to everybody.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|great app. just need to find a way to play music other than what you have need a way to get your own music.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|I think it's a great app it gives you different core areas in order to become the best in physical shape
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app. So easy to spend hours playing it. I have horses at my mothers but I live in the city right now, so being able to muck digital stalls and groom digital horses is a blast. The only thing I wish you could do was trade in coins you earn for gems. That would be great. I highly recommend this app for ANYONE who loves horses.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is one if the best books i have ever read, it is a soft beautiful novel. I totally recommend it.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|If you even have some interest in Greek mythology, READ THIS.  All the previous books were amazing, fun, and full of action. This one does not cease to amaze
1451695195|5.0|Dr. Eben Alexander was enjoying a comfortable and pleasant life until he was suddenly struck down by bacterial meningitis, knocking him into a coma that lasted for six days and leading his doctors and family to believe that recovery was impossible.  Then almost as suddenly he recovered, enabling him to resume his life after a remarkably short convalesence.  This in itself would be reason enough to marvel and for Dr. Alexander to publish a memoir.<br /><br />But there was more.  While he was in the coma Dr. Alexander underwent a richly detailed Near Death Experience (NDE) that caused him to reevaluate his life and his previous conceptions of the nature of conscienceness, the afterlife, and above all God Himself. One result is this fascinating short book, in which Dr. Alexander describes his NDE and the conclusions which he developed in response.<br /><br />Dr. Alexander's life is naturally unique to him, and some of his experiences, such as his adoption as an infant, his reconnection with his birth parents and siblings, and his eminent medical career will not be shared by many of his readers.  However all of us can relate to his emotional response to his NDE and appreciate the efforts he makes to explain what he believes happened to him, using language drawn from both religious and scientific sources.  Nor will those who read this looking for support for orthodox religious views on life after death be entirely satisfied with what they find.<br /><br />Before reading Dr. Alexander's book I had read little about NDEs, tending to take the same position as many of his professional associates that they are caused by poorly understood physical phenomena.  While I am not completely convinced that that view is incorrect, I was moved by Dr. Alexander's descriptions of his experiences and found in them a great deal of comfort. Having lost my own parents and other beloved relatives and friends, I found comfort in his reports of what he felt had happened to him. And I also found great reassurance in the way he speaks of the nature of consciousness, our shared humanity, and the omnipresence of God in our lives.great reassurance in the way he speaks of the nature of consciousness, our shared humanity, and the omnipresence of God in our lives.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Well done, inspriational, sentimental, and a true testament to the way 'real men' record and create music!!!<br /><br />Love it~ So happy I purchased.
B00APJLFEG|2.0|We've been using the Amazon Prime streaming experience for some time now through out DVD player on the Vaio service.  In the last few months we have found that the absolute worst time to stream is on a Saturday night - but isn't that when you want to sit down as a family and watch something together?<br /><br />Every single time we get pauses or pixel & sound issues that ruin the experience.  Sunday morning?  Tuesday evening?  No problem, weekends? just doesn't work out for us.....<br /><br />The kids ended up watching it Sunday morning.  I am thankful the rental lets you have access for 48 hours, but half the family could not enjoy the movie.
B001AW156U|5.0|These trigger extensions certainly helped me in my FPS games, as it helps you shoot and aim faster. It feels more natural to have them on to help play. It feels weird to play FPS games on stock controllers now for me.<br /><br />I would recommend.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|George Martin continues his richly detailed fifth book in the series by filling in the details of the characters not covered in the four book. Just reading about what these people eat makes me gain weight .  I love highly detailed world George creates in his ever expanding story.
B004P91ARE|5.0|Amazing Brubeck. This is by far my favourite CD, and I will be buying future Brubeck compilations. Great purchase. Recommend.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|I would recommend  this book to all my friends. It has  group of characters that makes you not want to not put it down. As a reader you want to know what will happen to them and when they will meet each other again. It is wonderfully intertwined with each of the characters lives while telling about the real history of the world. I can't wait for the third book.
098555780X|5.0|This book is a great book for anyone who wants to work with paracord. Whether a novice or an old hand working with this book is great. Easy to follow instructions make the book a resource for paracord designs that are good for novice, but, challenging for those who are a little more advanced. I cannot wait for J.D. to do volume 2!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Having never played Temple Run I found this game to be a bit difficult. However, I really enjoy playing the game and I do better with each run!
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|It's very funny book.<br /><br />It was the most popular stories of the year.I think it should be able to get it right now
B002ZG976U|5.0|I bught this movie for my daughter and she watches it every weekend.  She loves it so I love it.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I dont know what to say about this show, I didn't think it was going to be quite as engaging. After the first episode I just had to keep going. Right now, im waiting for the second part of the season...days away.
B004H8GLXQ|3.0|Awesome writing but I'm still trying to figure out which sister was telling the tale?????  Members of my Book Club felt the same way.  Book needed more foreshadowing.
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|the cd arrived at my door quickly<br />great price great service<br />accurate description of product<br />thank  u for fast service

B008JMKN4Y|3.0|First, some preamble. I KNOW that Beautiful Disaster is an absolutely despicable representation of what it means to be a) in love and b) in a healthy relationship. I know that Beautiful Disaster showcases every violent and controlling behaviour found in an abusive relationship, and that it romanticizes that behaviour. I also know that the way women are treated in Beautiful Disaster, as mere things that exist solely to please men, is wrong on every possible level. I know that for those reasons, and many more that many other more eloquent reviewers have pointed out, that I should have hated Beautiful Disaster; that I should be appalled and disgusted by everything it represents.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I seem to have developed a case of the Twilights, where regardless of every rational bone in my body, I found myself enjoying a lot of what I should have been repulsed by...<br /><br />Abby was one of the most emotionally confused protagonists I've read about in a long time - and I loved her for it. She made absolutely no sense - it was obvious that she wanted more than friendship from Travis, but she continued to reject his advances at every turn. She went so far as to date someone else - someone who was the polar opposite of Travis - to prove that she could be attracted to the \\"right\\" kind of guy. But while her behaviour was frustrating - just admit your feelings for him already! - I understood that she equated a life with Travis with the life she was trying to leave behind; a life of drinking, violence and cons. I couldn't fault her for trying to make a better life for herself than she had grown up with.<br /><br />I also loved Abby and Travis together, when things we're going well. Their playful banter, their steamy sex scenes, and the tension that rolled off of each of them in waves was thick enough to see at some points. I found myself laughing out loud during some of their more playful moments, fearful for their hearts during some of their more tender moments and slightly teary during some of their more vulnerable moments.<br /><br />What I couldn't stand was Abby and Travis together, when things weren't going so well. Travi's controlling behaviour, demanding that Abby change clothes because he couldn't handle knowing other guys would be looking at her and thinking about sex. Abby's manipulation of Travis' feelings, breaking up with him only to act hurt and above reproach when he tried to move on. BUT, these beyond-annoying frustrating moments made for the kind of read where your eyes stay glued to the pages; I couldn't have put Beautiful Disaster down if I had wanted to, because I was just as caught up in Abby and Travis' relationship as they were.<br /><br />Other than their on-again, off-again relationship, Beautiful Disaster really didn't have much going for it in way of plot - or character - development - literally the entire book is focused on whether or not Abby and Travis would end up together. I kept waiting for Travis' anger to push him too far, for his actions to catch up with him, and for it to cause him to see that he couldn't just punch his way through his problems. Or for Abby to realize that as much as Travis had changed for her, he had a lot of stuff going on that she would never be able to \\"fix.\\" When I realized that neither character was actually going to learn from their experiences with the other, I couldn't help but be angry with myself for hoping for more.<br /><br />Much like I enjoyed Twilight, even though I chastised Bella for being so naive to how unhealthy her obsession with Edward was, I enjoyed Beautiful Disaster even though I kept mentally reprimanding Abby for encouraging Travis' obsessive and controlling nature. I don't know that I'll bother with the sequel, because what I'm really interested in now is seeing life for Abby and Travis, six months later. You know, when she's knocked up, money's tight and Travis has started to come home smelling like whiskey...d slightly teary during some of their more vulnerable moments.<br /><br />What I couldn't stand was Abby and Travis together, when things weren't going so well.

B0031YJFCQ|4.0|The third book in the series picks up right where book #2 finishes.  Which is a good thing because the end of &#34;The Girl Who Played With Fire&#34; is a cliff hanger.  I haven't finished &#34;The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest&#34; yet, but so far it is a page turner.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A lot of unexpected twist and turns since our heroine won the hunger games.  Don't expect to second guess what happens next. You will definitely be surprised.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best game I have ever played and it is so cool how they go different places every time
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was not even done with book one and I knew I had to order books two and three.  I read all three books in eight days - I just couldn't stop!
0452289963|5.0|This book is a little more conversational and far-reaching, as well as more easily readable (it flows a little more like a novel) than The Power of Now.<br /><br />However, I like TPON better because it's more concentrated, to the point, and goes into greater depth. It's more like a text book/manual, compared to the looser ANE.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Great deal on Prime, we plan to watch the whole series, just have to find the time to watch them
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|This is a great album! His song-writing skills have improved, in that there's more connectedness with the lyrics and the emotion of the songs. Of those which are new arrangements of old favorites, it took some time for them to 'grow' on me, but only because I'm so used to hearing them a certain way.<br /> Unlike some who say his voice can sound strained at times, (on this or previous CD's), with this choice of songs, I believe Josh's voice is actually more relaxed on this CD, fully comfortable in his range.<br /> Personally, my favorite is \\"Changing Colors\\" from the expanded Bonus Tracks version.<br /><br />Can't wait for the tour!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I accidently ordered The Hunger Games to my Kindle but became pleasantly surprised as to how much I liked this dystopian novel .given the fact that I'm far from a young adult.  I had to follow up with Mockingjay and once more found this second book of Suzanne Collins trilogy so well-imagined and different from anything I have ever read. my imagination ran wild with some of the people and scenarios she created. Burned the midnight oil on this one.
0938045695|5.0|I bought this book for my dad.  He can't stop raving about it.  Great product, informative pictures and well laid out.  Shipping was also very quick and book arrived in beautiful condition.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awsome I love horses it feels good that you actually  can take care of a horse and if you ever get a real horse you will no how to take care of one
B009UX2YAC|5.0|my friend showed me this game and I'm so happy she did I play it all the time you should get this its fun and free
B00B6SIT0S|5.0|I really like the new, edgy ballad from DM as a lead single.  It's fitting my winter mood.  I'm simply overjoyed that a band I love is still putting out music this far into their career.<br /><br />Warning:  the b-side \\"All That's Mine\\" is available on the deluxe 18 track pre-order, so I wouldn't buy it here unless you can't wait and want to purchase it twice.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's a calculator and it calculates. But that's what calculators are for, right? A+ would definitely recommend to anyone whose device didn't come equipped with one.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Fun game, it would be more fun if the unicorns were not do pricey.... otherwise I enjoyed playing it very much
B00991TCOG|5.0|I first came across this artist on youtube and was blown away by the seemless mixture of the dubstep sensation and the violin with great success. Dubsteppers and classical music listeners unite and Love this cd.I find myself listening to this over and over again. Try it, you WILL like it. Enjoy!
B001NLKT60|3.0|I think this book suffers from Middle Book Syndrome.  The first book was so good, I am hoping the last book is good.  This one is in the middle.  I have only read the first 2 books.  I am reading a different genre to clear my head before I read the 3rd book.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This bag is pretty nice, it has all the space that you need and more.  The side lock for the tripod makes it even better, and for the price  it's unbeatable.    Just ask this little fellow.    [...]
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really love :this game it is so much fun I will play this for a while love love love
0307341550|5.0|This book left me thinking about how I was raised. A fast page turn up until the very last page. Short book, but not lacking in the &#34;story&#34; department. Leaves you very attached to the characters! Would recommend to anyone who loves reading!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The story and characters were great.  The author did a great job in creating a world and giving depth to the characters within the stories.  There were moments that had me smiling and laughing and there were moments that made me cry.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Parts of book really can keep the reader interested. Some of the storyline goes beyond being believable. Hated the ending and made me upset that I read the book in the first place!
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|This book was recommended to me for some reason. I don't know about everyone else but the book is very disturbing and sickening. The plot is so twisted and ugly it's almost impossible to see any light at the end of the tunnel. I liked it until about 300 pages in and then was so mad that I had to continue. I don't know how or why someone could write about a little girl getting sexually abused over and over.<br />The characters are a little far fetched and the story very Hollywood that this could actually happen.<br />Then if that's not enough you have a dramatic murder/suicide that leaves you speechless.<br />This book was just not anything I look for. I want to feel good after reading not feel like I need a shot of whiskey to forget about the plot!!<br />I do not suggest unless you yourself want to feel hopeless and depressed.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|WE ALL LOVE THIS GAME AND PLAY THIS WITH OUR NEIGHBORS. WE HAVE SO MUCH FUN PLAYING THE EXPANSION CITY AND KNIGHTS AFTER YOU LEARN THE SETTLERS THEN PLAY THE CITIES AND KNIGHTS WITH IT YOU WILL WANT TO ALWAYS PLAY IT TRYING TO BEAT WHOEVER WON IT IF YOU DIDN'T WIN . IT IS TRULY A GREAT GAME TO PLAY WITH EVERYONE.
B00B7G3Y4U|1.0|I spent the entire movie waiting for something to happen and they came few and far between. My home security camera is more interesting.
B007ZTLLMK|1.0|Kids game. But it is not appropriate for kids. The picture on the wall is not something you would want a child to see.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE this app!  I take notes all the time (grocery list, directions to something, errands, special numbers that I don't want to forget!)  It's so handy when you don't have paper and pen - wait . . . you don't need that with this app!
B00005ONMJ|4.0|This is a thoroughly 1954 production, prepared for 1954 sensibilities.  It is as prudish as Don Giovanni can be.  The singers look like 1954 men and women, not like 21st century fashion models.  They sing well.  This was an age when opera singers were expected to sing great, not look great.  The sets, props, and costumes have that fabulous grand opera feel so few modern productions are willing to pay for.  Visually, I find this DVD quite acceptable.<br /><br />Yes, the sound does have some minor issues.  This is hardly surprising given the year it was made.  That, and the too slow overture, are what gives this DVD four stars instead of five.  Apart from the overture, the tempi are fine.<br /><br />Cesare Siepi is nearly perfect as the Don, vocally and as an actor.  His commendatore scene is particularly awesome.  He probably sustained a half dozen bruises falling down on the stage -- all while singing perfectly!  I give him ten out of ten for that scene and I doubt I will ever see it sung and acted better.<br /><br />I would buy this DVD again!
B003G4W49C|4.0|A great futuristic book with lots of description and meaty plot that has appeal for all ages. Very stimulating to the imagination, well written, and with moral lessons. Good read.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|A novel that you don't want to put down.  Interesting to the last page and real life, makes one really think.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book kept me interested because I wanted to see what everyone was talking about. It's Ok, mostly because it is actually a love story and I wanted it to have a happy ending
B00683JK9K|1.0|Don't like the fact that it wants to install adobe air after the fact.  Uninstalled immediately.  For a puzzle game, I think not.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love it. Because it's so fun I have it on my iPod touch and I think it is the best thing in the world and and my first time I played it I loved it.so get it!!!!!!!

B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This game is fun, it has lots of pets and I love playing it. The pets are really cute and the game is a hoot.
0893860468|5.0|I will keep this book as a life long treasure.  I loved everything about the book and have found that I pick it over and over again and am inspired each time I read.
B0042GIRYE|4.0|I enjoyed the campy feel of the album, and I really like the REGGAE SONGS....ZBB should try a whole REGGAE ALBUM....the sound seems to break out a new feel in their music.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Though echoes of Pygmalion resound throughout this novel, think of it as an homage to  George Bernard Shaw and enjoy it for its elegant style and contemporary variations on a durable theme. Unlike Eliza Doolittle, who found herself still trapped by the English class system despite her transformation by Henry Higgins, the future of the engaging heroine of Me Before You  seems permanently altered by the education she receives from her mentor; able to take her place in a less rigid society than the one that left Eliza in a social limbo.
B00A4GXJD0|3.0|Not quite the quality of his last two albums....Rock and Roll Jesus is awfully hard to beat.  Overall, this album is not as refined.
B007AJFSJW|5.0|Good book, explains a lot in simple terms. Also very interesting to say what happened in other countries in the past.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I am two-thirds of the way through this second book af the trilogy, and it is hard to put down.  Ken Follett is one of the great writers of our time.  If you have any sense of history, you will enjoy these books. He brings real events home from the viewpoint of people in several parts of the world, and makes one understand the world in a completely different way.<br /><br />After all, history is simply the story of what happened in the past to people. Understanding history properly, one must try to understand the people who lived it.<br /><br />Follett is a master at combining historical events with the fictional people he creates as small cogs in the wheels of time.
B0097JYVAU|4.0|A great read, and an enjoyable one --  spoiled at the end by nate taking a soft line of climate forecasters, and then (presumably to show he's not a lefty) taking a soft line on the Cheney doctrine in defence.  There are a few places where he seems to gloss over some obvious problems with his world view, but i guess the book would have been too hard for retail if he'd taken them on.
1451627297|5.0|I'm not a sci-fi reader, so had never read a Steven King novel.  But I couldn't put this down - a real page-turner.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|really enjoyed family this movie. great family movie .i will buy the dvd. cute characters and amusing for the adults too
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a really fun game!! The horses are really cute and you can buy zebras and unicorns!!! I would defiantly recommend it :)
B006LM6P0K|5.0|I got the movie for a great price. I would recommend it to anyone who love science fiction. It is a great movie and the Seller was very fast on send it to me. Thanks and I would buy from the seller again.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I found this temple run a lot better and way more fun than the original. I have gotten everyone hooked on it. So much fun
B009UX2YAC|3.0|What I thought about the game is that it was fun but I think it can use more than one place to play with like temple run you go all over different places but I think they could add more than five different places. There's my thought. Thank you.
B00846REIS|5.0|Unable to put this book down. The author does a great job in not only the first book but I believe this one was even better! A must read!
B00AYDC5HY|4.0|The family enjoyed watching the movie.  Gave it 4 because the the connection.  Had to restart it once while watching it.  My granddaughter wanted to watch it again!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I absolutely Love this game.  Keeps me entertained for a long time with a great challenge.  Even my children love it.
B00683JK9K|4.0|For the earlier complaints. To rotate pieces you must double tap. Unfortunately the pieces only rotate one direction and can be annoying when you you have to turn multiple pieces in a row 270 degrees.<br /><br />Secondly, if you are missing a piece it is probably under the puzzle. If you double click on a piece but hit the completed part of the puzzle by mistake the program will put the puzzle on top of the piece. Just move the puzzle to the side and drop the piece back in the box.<br /><br />Occasionally the program will not let you pick up a piece in the box. Just come back to it later. Doesn't seem to take away game play to me.<br /><br />This does take away from game play and is why I give it a 4 star and not a 5. The puzzle permanently connects pieces when they are correctly matched. That is great, but it will only connect them if they are rotated the correct direction. Because of this, if you know two pieces go together, you can keep trying to connect them and rotating until you have them the correct direction. The program would be better if you could connect them and then rotate them as a set just like a real puzzle.
B00B7803HO|1.0|I know that this show can be streamed from free from the pbs.org website, but I got tired of the loading breaks, so I purchased it from amazon. STILL has issues! I can't even get it to stream - quite literally getting a streaming error on Amazon. I've tried other shows (hulu is working great) - needless to say I'm quite disappointed with amazon and frustrated that I paid for a free show and had so many issues.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|It's obvious that describing an experience with God is a complicated matter because there are truly no words that could come close to describing it. However, the author makes a great effort at bringing the reader into the Magnificence.
B0095R64AO|4.0|Great movie.  I would recommend it if your looking for a good romantic comedy.  Fresh perspective on modern day romance!
B009UX2YAC|2.0|I got this app and loved it a lot. I was so close to getting a high priced character but then all of the data was gone. I tried to shut down the kindle and closed the app many times but none of that worked. I am trying to get back what I lost but I cant get the character I wanted.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Colin Farrell is fantastic in this action/adventure.  He'll be around for a long time...expect to see him in a lot more movies!!!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|this is a good game it is way better than the original temple run game. but it is hard to control so when I jump or roll it is like I did not so I die. I cant find a way to change it. I could on the original temple run though.it is still ok I guess.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|This was an amazing book. Loved the mystery and suspense. Highly recommended! Going to look for other books by this author.

B009GESJH2|2.0|I didn't care for this CD at all; nothing like his prior hits.  If you are a fan though, try it for yourself.
B000OVLINI|5.0|First read this book a few years ago. Felt it good enough to re read.  Excellent story telling.  Beautiful language. Highly reccommend.
B005T87QCI|5.0|I think that it is a fun and amazing. It is also hilarious to watch robots beat each other up!
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I like it, it's a cool app with cool features but the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because in order to wake up to your personal music you have to buy the full version which costs money!
B004ZMWUCU|1.0|Delightful characters and a lovely tale......despite the horrific orphanage scenes.<br />A truly enjoyable read and one I'd recommend to anyone.
0316067598|4.0|A great read (would have better without so much profanity, but that's just my opinion)!  Marcus and men like him are what makes this country the greatest nation GOD ever created!
B000WTBMBK|5.0|I just listen to this while I'm working.  Very melodic and smooth.  It's like walking down a city street in early winter at 4 in the morning by yourself.  Soulfull and haunting.  Whether you love dubstep or not, this is just great music to get lost in.
B004TSXUWY|5.0|A great novel full of twists and turns. I am really glad an electronic version was available, because I probably wouldn't have bought the Portuguese paper version of this book.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|Billy Pilgram becomes a time traveler after he's abducted by aliens and taken to the planet Tralfamadore. There, Billy is placed in what would be akin to a zoo in America, where the Tralfamadadorians are privy to watch his every move. But Billy doesn't always stay there. He finds himself going back and forward in time, returning to his childhood, jumping forward to when he was a prisoner of war during WWII and kept in a slaughterhouse (Slaughterhouse-Five) in Dresden until its destruction by bombs, and even as far into the future as his own death, then back to Tralfamadore where he is mated with a porn star from America. And all over again.<br /><br />This classic is part fact and part fiction, the factual portion taken from Vonnegut's own experiences as a prisoner of war in Dresden before and after its firebombing. And in its telling, one wonders if this is the only way Vonnegut could relay his experiences as a soldier and subsequent prisoner of war by implanting small bits and pieces among the other experiences of Billy Pilgram. After all, Vonnegut states at the beginning that he had been planning on writing about the war but could never actually get it finished.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|This was a sentimental purchase but I'm glad I have it.  She sings well and does an awesome job with holiday favorties as only she can.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this game is a great very realistic I own five horses and I want to congratulate the person who made this game
B005FVFWOI|5.0|I just purchased this on Amazon and have had the 25th Anniversary edition but this remixing is just fabulous!!! The 1996 version sounded too murky especially on the track \\"Aqualung\\", but now it sounds wonderful and clear and very crisp. The very first issue in the mid 80's was the worst sounding version than even the 1996. I haven't listened to the second disc yet because I just wanted the original album in good sound. I read one bad review on the remixing of this and I'm glad that I didn't listen to him. Bravo, to Mr.Wilson who remixed this!!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Best book ever received December received executive fervent and the romance of the drama and the buddy list of a new comment
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|liked it a lot. awesome graphics with lots of surprises and great story line. hope there is a sequel. will look for more games from this company.
B009YQJ322|5.0|This is the second film in the Judges Series and will not disappoint all those who crave blood&guts and unbridled action in a derelick furure.  Sylvester Stalone plays the part perfectly and now add a female judge, who is psychic.  In this installment, you have what seems to be an uncontrollable series of events, with as many twists and turns as a detective novel featuring Sherlock Holmes.  It will be very interesting to see future installments of this genre.  THE LAW IN THE FUTURE WILL BE DISPENSED BOTH INDIVIDUALLY AND AUTOMATICALLY - JUDGE DREDD!!  NJMJr.
B007MDB71O|5.0|We bought this for our Daughter for Christmas and haven't seen it yet. She says it is a good movie though and we want to watch it with her sometime
B009329ZF2|5.0|One may think that this is the usual genre of 'earth vs alien,' but this film has more twists and turns than a CIA spy novel.  The story line starts with a young man, who has got to be one of the original misfits of his generation.  He gets thrown into the navy and just happens to be in the middle of an international war games exercise in the Pacific with multiple nations.  Who decides to join the fun but, an invasion of aliens from another planet, intent upon conquering the  earth.  Throw in a romance with the Admiral's daughter, knock-down-drag-out fight with the aliens, and the entrance into the fray by the Battleship USS Missouri commanded by our hero, and you have one h--- of a story line, not to mention enough action to keep even the most jaded of gamers, very occupied.  I was very forturnate, to be assigned to the 25th Infantry Division, when the \\"Big Mo\\" arrived in Pearl Harbor.  All active duty and retired personnel were invited to a special tour of this magnificient ship.  You just cannot believe the size, grandeur, and unbelveable  magnificience of this ship.  It is now permanently anchored as a musieum on the other side of USS Arizona Memorial.  If you visit Hawaii, do not miss this!!  This movie deserves a place in your DVD collection.  IT IS AMAZING HOW ONE CAN RISE TO THE OCCASION WHEN LEADERSHIP IS REQUIRED!!  NJMJr.
B001OQCV6K|4.0|It is a movie we ordered as a gift. I hate having to write reviews for each little thing we buy
B001AW156U|3.0|They're nice and all, but if you're looking for something to help your skills in BF3, these may not be the right choice for you....you'd probably be better off just getting a new controller
B005LAIHPY|5.0|Bought this for our daughter. Was a good movie. Where we live, this is our entertainment! So have to make the best of it.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|Fascinated by the back story glimpses we get from time to time.  I have a hunch that's going to be a great story when all the pieces are revealed.  Sometimes the present day narrative inches closer and closer to the style of a soap opera and gushy self-righteousness.  As a fantasy/drama, it is entertaining and the cliff hangers keep me hooked into what's coming next.
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|I bought this dvd after having the privaledge to go to Las Vegas and see her new show. It was Fantastic as well. I wish I could have seed this show live. She is such an inspiration to me.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I read this for book club, and was instantly hooked. I loved how you were never quite sure what time period you were in. I loved the different perspectives. Overall very engrossing book.
B00454U1NS|4.0|I wish I would have ordered the one without the bad language. Didn't think it would be this bad. I must be getting old. Her music is good though and she has a good life story.
0525953728|5.0|Very well written, even for a person that is not familiar with military duties and actions.  Couldn't put it down.  Read it in a day.  It's being passed on and on.
B009HEP41A|5.0|I fell in love with the music from this movie, which I think drives the action and emotion of the film beautifully. The disc has terrific fidelity, and though it must be admitted that how music strikes one is strictly subjective, there are places in this soundtrack that send shivers down my back, I find it so striking. I've played it over and over and bought a couple of extra copies for friends. And I've been to see the film three times, much due to the music.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|This book was great until the end. Kind of ended abruptly. Over all good read. Would say read it if's a good price.
B0028R3NCU|5.0|This is an awesome product. It is super small and portable. I put this right on my keyring so I can carry my data with me wherever i go. I think it is cool cause you can easily swap out the SD card and use different data.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|Take my word its is the worst game ever. I can name 1000 resins its bad. it need to be updated big time . no wonder why its free
B008RTE066|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my brother and he was excited to get it. He really enjoyed watching it.
0345803493|5.0|I love this author and the books that she writes too.  What more could be said other than she writes good books.
B007MG360G|3.0|This game must be the best game I have ever got plus its free.I wish it would keep going but...this game is rated 1-10 is a 100 if you get this please,please please get me back bye.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I have played a WHOLE lot of these type hidden object/puzzle games and this is the best yet! Congrats to G5 Entertainment for superb gameplay!!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas sparks does it every time. It has everything, love,hate,suspense. It's a perfect balance. And very detailed love all his books
B009UX2YAC|5.0|more games like this!!! this is the best game for kids my age and older they need to make more games like this.
1601251556|4.0|I bought this and thought it was awesome for the price, cheap mat to play games on. Don't like the fact that it folds, but for the price totally worth it.
1455527475|5.0|I was a little hesitant to read this book.  For whatever reason, I halfway suspected that this was going to be a sensationalized, bombastic tell-all where the author is right and everyone else is wrong.  Much to my surprise, it turned out the be a thoughtful, well-written book that was both easy to read and very interesting.  My first impression, which was only reinforced throughout the book, was that the author is very down-to-earth, and appreciative of his opportunities, in being able to study and work in the United States, and work for a financial powerhouse.  Although he does not go into great detail about his Stanford University studies, his account of his time at Stanford is positive.  What was really surprising to me, though, was that his accounts of his early years with Goldman Sachs (GS), from the initial interviews to his summer internship, to his first few years, was also very positive.  You get the sense that he genuinely appreciated both his educational opportunities and the chance to work at what he and most other people considered to be the preeminent investment bank in the world.  His reasons for leaving the firm seems to be well thought-out, and very well articulated.  While it is natural to wonder whether or not he is telling the truth, I think that he is, for the following reasons:  His account seems to be a more personalized version of what was going on at GS that I have read in many other books, newspapers, magazines, and other financial publications.  Which is simply this:  Somewhere in the recent financial meltdown, or in response to it, or both, GS went from being a trusted financial intermediary to just another Wall Street firm that would happily rip the customer's face off to make money.  Obviously, GS doesn't like to be portrayed in a less-than-favorable light, so I'm sure that they are not happy with this being made public.  I could go on, but I will close with this thought.  More than any other aspect of this book, I was impressed with how even-handed he was throughout the book.  If you are at all interested in the world of finance, or are an investor, this is a must-read book.  And even if you are not, you should probably read it anyway.  Kudos to Mr. Greg Smith.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is sooooooo addictive and fun!!!!! I play it all the time. I LOVE how every month it has a new subject. And it has extra stuff to buy. But if u want a game where u don't have to spend money on it then this is it game!!!!!! This game is AWESOME!!!!!! It's great for kids too. This is a must have!!!!!
B007TXN4TK|3.0|i was kind of looking for an app that you could just play the piano without having to keep up with the music. this one doesnt have it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|We started watching the Walking Dead on Netflix and it was so good we watched every episode and then started buying the most recent ones here at Amazon. This show is done very well, for some it might be to gory, but I realize it just rubber and fake blood. The show is very suspenseful and you can't wait to get to the next episode.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|this game is very similar to super mario bros. havent played it much yet but its pretty simple and kid friendly. no instructions to read. just play
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Ya my friend trevor he had a lot of upgrades on the game. How do you upgrade it more and great game.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|it is google. i figured that would be enough said. everyone knows about google. and if they don't then know now....its great
B0091REZMW|4.0|It's a good hidden object game, not really challenging. I gave it 4 stars because you need to spend real money to get past some challenges &amp; I hate that.
0920668372|5.0|I can read this book again and again.  It is a beautiful story with some real meaning to it. I am going to give it to several friend's grandbabies.
B00A0R0CG0|5.0|This franchise never gets old. A hilarious, wildly entertaining movie. My wife and I enjoyed it as much as the grandchildren.
B00280LYHS|4.0|This book was really good. I like the last chapter the best. Well and the one before it. This was awesome!
B008XG1X18|5.0|love, love, did I say LOVE!!! PINTEREST! discovered a new passion.. cooking/baking.. crafting and more thank you for creating this awesome site. :)
B00B2V66VS|2.0|First it was great and I played it a lot. but now whenever I open it on my kindle fire it closes on me when its loading and I cant start playing. None of my other apps do this. :( shame this was such a good app
B004UBUNDE|4.0|Good movie, but to tell the truth I thought it would contain more pictures of galaxies and not how this hubble was delivered in space. I fast forwarded this and turned out that the movie is about 1 hour and that is all. Quality is very high whatsoever.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is wonderful for a freebie. Works well - has multiple options: repeat/no repeat, day of week, sound/vibrate/crescendo, etc. It is my preferred backup alarm.
B0086700CM|3.0|Just running - over and over and over again - and nothing new happens.  A great challenge... but at some point you've got to be rewarded for your skill - instead of just dying and starting over again.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game. If you love temple run,you will love this game.My whole family is addicted to this game.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Just finished. Not sure how I feel yet, but happy it's over. The<br /> Whole series definitely gets a person thinking.
1616550414|5.0|This is the best Zelda tome you could ever want to own, by far. Not only does this come in a beautifully made hardbound cover, but it's as complete as you could ever want it to be, and delivers over and above any amount of content you could imagine. Full-color pictures, meticulously translated info, and an incredibly honest, and accurate chronicle of one of the most important videogame franchises of the last 30 years. Expect to either dive this book with a warm cup of java, refer to it when settling detail disputes with friends, or as the greatest piece of toilet literature you would ever need when &#34;sitting on the throne...&#34;<br /><br />I can't thank Nintendo of America enough for choosing to translate this (initially Japan-only) release. It's a beautiful way to top the 25th Anniversary celebration from 2011. Buy it now. Enjoy it forever.
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|Wish there were more songs like the ones from the movies but still good<br />Can't wait for the next movie
B004UG7RQ0|5.0|It does what it says! I've been using this for a little over a month now, and it is working just fine!! Sounds great and clear to me, unlike other reviews I've been seeing, I think its definitely worth the price.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|This is a really fun game but they need to loosen the coins as it is only a game.  I refuse to pay any money to play these games.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I should mention that I saw the movie version before reading the novel.  The cliche is that the novel is always better than the movie version.  In this instance I think the reverse is true.  [think back to &#34;Sideways&#34;]  I marvel at the skill of the adaptation (Russell) who has taken an &#34;okay&#34; novel and turned it into an excellent film.  Compare Pat's father in the novel with how Robert De Niro comes across on the screen.  I believe the one thing that is more powerful in the novel is Pat's obsession with Nikki--its maddening.  A couple of more &#34;problems&#34; with the novel in my view--the mugging, and how Pat finally gives over his assumption that Nikki will take him back.  My advice would be to read the novel before seeing the film.  Together they are a complete workshop on the process of adaptation.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|A series that never stops and keeps you guessing every week. Keep up the great work. I expect to see a Season 10 or 11 with this kind of effort.
B000XUBFE2|2.0|The underlying story of a book-stealing foster girl harboring a Jew in Nazi Germany was certainly interesting.  However, Death's choppy, vague and sometimes nonsensical narration was distracting.
B00683JK9K|5.0|Downloaded and installed on my kindle fire with no problems. I got it to verify if the problems others were having had been resolved. I worked two puzzles with no problems. j noticed on the menu bar there is a button to activate the rotate feature. There is another puzzle app called patchworkz that is similar and if you are a puzzle fan is worth considering. So far Magic Puzzles: Seasons is a keeper for me.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this game is great even fantastic, but their are some consequences I don't know if it is just my kindel but every time I try to get on this game it turns off.
B006ATJXQW|4.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed the whole Maze Runner series but I am left with so many unanswered questions. This series is the \\"Lost\\" of the book world. With every answer comes two questions.<br /><br />Definitely worth the read and time invested.
B003QS9WIE|5.0|Watched it twice!<br />It's originally a book. I'm going to read it. I love twisted deep stories. This is one of those. Christopher Nolan did a grat job on the screen play. Excellent Movie!
B001TODO54|4.0|Kristin Cashore's Graceling is an exciting, suspenseful, and romantic fantasy novel. Protagonist Kasta is born with a Grace; all graced can be recognized by their mismatching colored eyes. A Grace is a magical ability that gives her a unique ability at a specific task; Kasta's grace is killing. Both parent's being deceased, her Uncle Randa King of the Middluns, is Kasta's guardian. He has used Kasta for her ability to hurt anyone who does something against his wishes. As Kasta matures into a teenager she realizes that Randa cannot control her anymore. She does not follow one of his ridiculous orders and is forced to leave the city. Kasta runs off with Prince Po. Prince Po is a Lienid who is trying to figure out why someone kidnapped his grandfather. Kasta having a kind heart and unique fighting ability leaves with Po in search of finding the truth. Po has a very unique Grace too, which gives him enhanced fighting ability. Together they seek information about all kings, and come to the conclusion that beloved King Leck is behind the kidnapping.<br /><br />Cashore creates relationships you can't help but to root for while also rooting for Kasta and Po in their journey for justice. For being a rather lengthy novel (400+ pages) the story never seems to drag on and is a true page-turner with sudden plot-twists and constant action. Watching Kasta mature not only with her Grace, but also as a young lady makes her a relatable character for the teenage audience.<br /><br />The only problem with this novel is maturity level. The writing style, plot, and language are suitable for the 14 and up age category. However, the subtle sex scenes and constant violence may be more than what some parents want their 14-year-old reading. I would recommend this book to any female age 16 and up. Although the violence of the story may appeal to male readers, I believe a female audience will appreciate all aspects of Graceling.
1847879071|4.0|For a statistics book, this is a good book. The author has a sense of humor throughout the text, and there are practice tasks and test to use along with SPSS.
B00005JKZ2|3.0|so i gave it to  to someone for Christmas  it was shipped right to me  no problem  my brother will love it
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Yet another fantastic book by Nicholas Sparks.  I just don't know how he does it. Every time I read one of his books he gets the reader so hooked they can't stop turning the pages.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|this is a free simple straightforward app that includes a variety of sounds ....it has provided me with a variety of good sounds for sleeping and also lovely light musical sounds for helping my granddaughter fall asleep when she visits us. overall great free app!
B002BU0DPE|4.0|Let me start off by saying I'm using this headset on an XBox360.<br /><br />When I bought them, I had had the Turtle Beach's that rest on the ear, and they blocked out a large amount of sound. I bought them because I was living in a dorm at the time, and the ad stated that the headset would eliminate sound. Little did I know, I wouldn't know how loud I was talking, and would often times wake up my roommate.<br /><br />I got the PX21 about 6 months after, and I fell in love. The customization, the sound quality, the playback of your own voice in the headset all led to a great product experience. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the left headset eventually started to fade in sound, being just a little quieter than the right. Not a huge issue, but I hardcore play Call of Duty, and this got me killed numerous times from the left side.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it's a lot better then the other temple run! this one is more exciting and has different places for you to go like in mines!
B002CIMKHO|4.0|No doubt, Clint Eastwood really bloomed in his later roles. Either that, or he just decided to take on only better roles as he got older. Regardless, this is an excellent movie we really liked. The plot was excellent and it does not end as you may expect it to. A nice change from light movies, this explores many points in the course of the plot. Clint Eastwood really sold us on his role and we felt the other actors proved to be quality casting additions.
B00683JK9K|1.0|Why on earth does it need to read my contacts list?<br />No way am I installing it. It doesn't need that info.
B002T3A4KW|4.0|Don't sit down to this movie expecting something remarkable or for you to be amazed by any single angle of the film. However, the quick wit and banter of the script proved enjoyable and the overall storyline was worth watching. A must see romantic comedy of the era.
B0079J26XO|5.0|Jacqueline du Pre's recording of Elgar's Cello Concerto with Sir John Barbirolli conducting the London Symphony Orchestra is widely recognized as the definitive recording of the Elgar, the one against which all others are measured. Du Pre's  career was cut tragically short by Multiple Sclerosis, forcing her to quit performing in 1973.  She died in 1987 at age 42. She was married to the famous conductor/pianist Daniel Barenboim. Du Pre was known for her aggressive playing style and flawless technique. Thanks in large measure to EMI, there are a goodly number of du Pre recordings still in circulation, some of which feature both du Pre and Barenboim.  The EMI Signature Series CD being reviewed here lives up to Du Pre's advance billing as one of the most stunningly gifted musical artists of our time, and it showcases the Elgar, as, indeed it should.  There is a reason this performance is famous.  Du Pre's Elgar is one of those rare performances that you can listen to a thousand times and never tire of it, a truly wonderful listening experience.  Not adding this CD to your library would be a major omission.<br /><br />Frankly, I am not a fan of Dame Janet Baker's \\"Sea Pictures,\\" but since it was included in the original EMI recording of the Elgar for reasons I shall never fathom, it was apparently thought indispensable in the Signature Series reissue.  The Delius Cello Concerto is not considered one of the great cello concertos; but with du Pre in charge, it is nevertheless an enjoyable listening experience which may get better with increasing familiarity.
B000IZXR7U|2.0|There is no doubt that this is a cult classic, and there is plenty of reason for it to stay that way. Overall, it was predictable and somewhat lacking in screen presence. I can't really put my finger on what it is that makes the film worth the purchase, but I will admit that it is an interesting example of Australian movie making in the 70's.<br /><br />The story line is somewhat disturbed and there are significant reasons to not allow children to watch this, and really, there is little reason for me to suggest that anyone not completely bored with other avenues of moviemaking watch it either.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I really liked the way this book was written and the twists and turns were believable and smooth. I hated the way the ending was written & felt the author dropped a bomb to just get the book finished
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|good to pass some time but can get expensive if you wish to buy lots of gems or gold, it is fun
B004UUKDNA|5.0|Rarely do u purchase a CD where u like all the songs - this is one of those rarities. Really upbeat and different.
078322737X|5.0|This multi-layered DVD version of &#34;American Graffiti&#34; is the best trip back to the summer of 1962 Hollywood ever had to offer! The eventful night when freshly graduated high school friends contemplated their futures while immersed in small town America's car-hops, drive-in movies & do-wop music (the soundtrack is one of the best featured in ANY film!), is shown in &#34;real time&#34;.<br /><br />Richard Dreyfuss is perfect as the smart kid, ready to drive off to college the next morning, but wondering if he's doing the right thing. Ron Howard and Cindy Williams get some practice for their soon to follow &#34;Happy Days&#34;, while Charles Martin Smith and Candy Clark are wonderful as the goofus who wants to show a pretty girl a good time.<br /><br />Wolfman Jack plays himself, he plays a very special request going out from Richard Dreyfuss to his dream girl Suzanne Sommers. Look for a pre-teen McKenzie Phillips and a young Harrison Ford in minor roles. This film is a big winner in my book!
B008XNZMOU|2.0|This new adventure of Taylor's is very disappointing. Of course, she sold a lot of them. We were all expecting another great Taylor Swift C.D., but you can tell she wrote the songs along with people who are not Country Music people and it shows big time. I guess that is what she was trying for and she succeeded.  But,  we liked her being Country.
0684808323|5.0|From the author of the best-selling Mafia expos&eacute;, Wiseguy, comes this inside story of the billion-dollar gambling industry and the secretive, dangerous men who ran it. One of the best books about the mob in Las Vegas. It so happens that the complex web surrounding Frank Rosenthal in Las Vegas was one of the most difficult organized crime-related operations in Vegas. Pileggi clearly describes the power struggles between the various players in great detail. Anyone who has any interest in the inner workings of casinos or old Las Vegas should read this!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|The only disappointment is that it took so long for me to see it. In my book it is the greatest movie I have ever seen.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|While not my favorite book of Dan Brown's Robert Langdon series, it was worth the time to read and enjoy! When Langdon’s beloved mentor, Peter Solomon - a prominent Mason and philanthropist—is brutally kidnapped, Langdon realizes his only hope of saving Peter is to accept this mystical invitation and follow wherever it leads him. Langdon is instantly plunged into a clandestine world of Masonic secrets, hidden history, and never-before-seen locations—all of which seem to be dragging him toward a single, inconceivable truth. The twists are never ending, and the story is engaging, but the climax fails to deliver on any momentum. If you've read Dan Brown before then you know what you are getting into, for those who have yet to dabble in his work I suggest starting with Angels & Demons or The Da Vinci Code.
0446554995|3.0|I should have stoped a requiem in the Pendigrast series. This boring after the first 100 pages a pity. Knootz carries his good ideas too far
B0000TG9E2|5.0|For material that does not lend itself very easily to cinema, this is a good adaptation of &#34;Alice in Wonderland&#34; with some enjoyable characters and sequences. It succeeds, at least in a basic way, in capturing part of the manic but imaginative nature of Lewis Carroll's story.<br /><br />Much of the language, poetry, and ideas that make the original story so captivating cannot really be conveyed very easily in a movie, and so it would be nearly impossible for any cinema version of Alice to be completely satisfying to those who love the book. Instead, this version simply tries to make the characters come to life, and to use the animation to recreate the feel, if not the depth, of Alice's experience.<br /><br />The animation drives most of the movie, and at times it is pretty imaginative. Some of the voices work very well, too, with the likes of Ed Wynn and Sterling Holloway fitting the animated characters quite well.<br /><br />Carroll's stories are so enchanting and creative that it is no surprise that there have been so many efforts through the years to capture the magic of the Alice stories on film. None of the cinema versions has yet come close to matching the books, yet the material itself has made most of them worth watching. In this one, the overall production has a definite Disney style to it, which makes it different from the original, but as a movie it works pretty well.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Read it cover to cover in a few days. I was really drawn in. This is not even my usual genre, but it was well written and obviously well researched.
B001TODCII|5.0|Yes, its only an action movie; Yes, the script has more holes than the victims of the main character! Yes, Neeson's rampage in Paris is very implausible; Yes, its not Oscar material... but its a very good movie. I give it a solid 9. I left the movie feeling very satisfied. Its that kind of movie that is fun and thrilling and brainless at the same time. Doesn't get tiresome. When its outrageous its funny... when the action gets going you feel right in it all.<br /><br />When you finish seeing the movie you do wonder why Bond and Bourne aren't as macho or mean. Niam's character<br />Bryan (&#34;B&#34; letter too) beats up baddies way better and he looks more scary and real somehow than those other agents.A great flick for action junkies, or just anyone who wants to spend some time watching bad guys getting what they deserve!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This review comes after reading all 3 books.  While I thought the first half of this book was fairly uneventful (and skipping ahead more than I thought it would), the second half has you on your toes, complete with surprises.
B000069I1C|5.0|My wife and I saw this movie in some eddie murphy flashbacks and decided we needed it for our collection. Great movie and great price.
0545265355|5.0|Loved them!!! Can not wait for the next book and the movies! Past the time quickly. Sucks you right in.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|This was our family movie Friday night, and it was the family's first time watching it together; I love the movie, but the kids just didn't remember watching it. My 17 yr old dd and 18 yr old ds, as well as my husband, laughed out loud throughout the movie, and just really enjoyed the movie as a whole. While it's a bit predictable, the bad guy/bad guy story line gave it a neat twist, and now, we have to buy it!
B000B589JI|5.0|I was verrry pleased at the speed of wich this item arrived here living in an apo area it can be very hard to get items shiped here so thanks
B009M5CJI0|3.0|I was extremely suprised at how small the print was. It is a great story but I could not enjoy the book because of the difficulty I had in focusing on the small print.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This is an interesting book. Whether you are deeply religious or not, this book will make you think. It's a wonderously sad tale. A must read!
B000YMFCS4|5.0|Touching & romantic.  Rachel McAdams never looked better.  It's fun to see Ryan Gosling as a boy.  Great acting.  Guaranteed to exercise your tear ducts.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The story was good and fast moving - a page turner.  Did keep my interest.  However, I wanted more detail than I felt was available.
B0058VW36U|5.0|can spend hours on it. Seems to be kid friendly. Keeps the kid entertained. I wish it had some educational value.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book kept me riveted and could not put it down.  I really loved it!  I would totally recommend, its a great read.
B0021L8V0M|5.0|Jolie did it again.  Story line had you swinging one way and then the other.  Is she a mole or the ultimate &#34;good guy&#34;.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best thing ever never stop playing get coins get boxes get in love with the gam e awesome cool never stop playing best game ever
B004EPYZUS|4.0|One of the best Mission Impossible movies.  Some of the &#34;gimmicks&#34; are difficult to believe; but, it's a movie not a documentary.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|This movie has many of my favorite actors, especially Gary Oldman. I like movies with upbeat endings and you couldn't chose a better Robin. I also enjoyed that it wasn't as dark as many of the previous Batman movies.
B005LAIGRS|5.0|The movie makes one think about what really goes on at the CIA. Who are the good guys and who are the moles!  Thought provoking.
B002KCNVMA|5.0|My grandson was thrilled. That's good enough for me. Great gift, excellent service. Will order Lego on line again. Highly recommend.
B005FISC52|5.0|I have watched and rewatched all the one tree hills. I love them this was a great season sad it was so small!
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I cannot choose which one of the 3 is the best, but this is a very good candidate. Before watching I seriously didn't expect such a nice movie. It's difficult to make 3 nice movies in a row but they did it. Now the problem is that I cannot wait for the next one to be released!
B0086DBE62|5.0|I loved the alice in wonderland remake how dark and creative but this remake bein funny and witty very good movie!<br />A Classic is a classic but new and change can be as good!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I haven't read Grisham in awhile but this was a good one!  I enjoyed the plot, the characters and the weaving of the story.  Definitely recommend this book to this who love criminal suspense novels.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|Enjoyed this book so much. What a wonderful world it would be if all parents and teachers read this!  Even better, perhaps,  would be a condensed version as handbook for classroom teachers, parents, employers, etc such as the guideline at the end of the book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Couldn't put it down...full of mystery..suspense and true passionate love that is pure....gave me a frightful picture of a beaten woman that with love and compassion could overcome her past
B005LHOKFS|4.0|Simple to use and very effective.  Comes in handy and I use it often. I look forward to using it often in the future.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I have not yet completed watching the entire season yet.  I love what I have watched so far.  Some sadness in the story, but it adds to the authenticity of the times.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|. This is the second book in the series about Eva and Gideon and it leaves me wanting more. Can't wait for the sequel! If you like a hot and steamy romance, you will not be disappointed!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Everything is so authentic to the period-beautiful clothes and furnishings.  Great acting with an excellent plot.  I will watch it multiple times!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I enjoy watching Downton not only because of the story line, but for the beautiful surroundings, cultural aspects, costumes and customs. It is a joy to watch this series. I can't wait for Season 4, but I will truly miss Robert.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|The story is silly (I mean, c'mon, she's a genius mash-up-er?), but it still manages to be mostly entertaining.  A little bit like Glee meets Bring it On without quite the same level of smartness to it.  Rush out to see it?  No.  Watch on a rainy day?  Sure.
B005GRTNVE|5.0|I love Il Divo!  I was fortunate to see them in Baltimore.  They have great rapport and harmony.  This production was A-One!
B007JRU2UK|4.0|In lesser hands, this could have been a tired cliche of a movie, but Clooney and company elevate it to something special and enjoyable.  Good story, well-directed, solid acting.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this show and wait anxiously each week for the next episode.  Hope it continues for years to come!  The characters are spectacular.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is so cool all you do is the same moves and its got way more graphic :) :) :) :) :)
B00127RAJY|5.0|I brought this for my friend and she loves it!<br />I worked out with her and I can see why she love this!<br />you can feel the burn as soon as it comes on!<br />it is not difficult to do!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|You're hooked from the first word in this marvelous tale of a family's suffering when their son, their only child, is accused of murdering a local schoolmate. The suspense, tension and involvement make this book difficult to put down.  It's well-written with deft movement through each scene.  There's never been one like this book !
B0008ENIAC|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies!<br />Everything was as it was described.<br />this movie is a great addiction to my movie collection.<br />I have no dislikes for this product. Must buy!
B006O3MU96|4.0|I like it,  i just can't score that high on the game which sucks, but its fun. i was luck to have got the game free.
B001H5X7I4|5.0|Great movie, Great Cast, Overall HILARIOUS movie!<br />I watch this movie all the time and it is still funny to me<br />every time I watch it.<br />CLASSIC!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Great literature ride, combining \\"hopelessness\\" of youth with hopefulness of life... Highly recommended for the young at heart, and hopeless romantics!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|If you are a superhero movie junkie, you need to buy this movie!<br />This movie had a great cast and overall good storyline!<br />the product was brand new, so there were no starches.<br />If you have a girlfriend who doesn't like superhero movies, you should make her watch this one.<br />There are so many gorgeous people in this movie to make her forget that this is a kind of movie she hates. :)
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I highly recommend this game<br /> This game is amazing. I love hidden object games and this is one of the best!
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|Both of the Sherlock Holmes movies are great!<br />Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law are perfect!<br />I put this movie on repeat! I never get bored.<br />Add to your cart NOW!
B00008YLV2|5.0|I know it's an &#34;older movie&#34; but I've been wanting this movie for a long time, and was getting tired of asking to borrow my brothers copy.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|Sherlock Holmes is such a great movie!<br />Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law are perfect!<br />I put this movie on repeat! I never get bored.<br />Add to your cart NOW!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is app is great.  I've used others and deleted them fairly quickly.  There are ads but they are not bothersome. I give it 5 stars because it serves my needs well, and is easy to use.
B004EPZ084|5.0|Movie was HILARIOUS!<br />The movie was great and very funny!<br />There were no damages. Packaging was good.<br />MUST BUY THIS MOVIE!

B003WQT2YY|5.0|Absolutely one of the most beautiful films ever made.  A must see for anyone interesting in classical music or plain great acting!
B007MDB71O|5.0|i recieved my bluray and was in good shape that is it had no damage or breakage<br />a satisfied customer
B00364K6YW|4.0|I am very pleased with this purchase.  It has great picture and sound, came fast in shipping and I would say it is a very good purchase for anyone to make.
B000005H3Z|1.0|I ordered what I believed to be a vinyl record - I received a compact disc instead. It wasn't worth the effort of going through the steps of trying to return it in the mail so I've hung on to it. This has made me default to finding records in brick-and-mortar stores first instead of trying an online method.
0545265355|5.0|This set is exquisite. The cover is beautifully designed, without spelling errors in the content and very enjoyable to read. and I love this set very very much.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|This game boasts nice graphics, but game play is very confusing.  Additionally, this app is constantly asking you to exchange real money to play games in Ponyville or to improve your chances within the game.  Parents beware: enable those parental controls or your child will end up bankrupting you.<br />  Further, I don't like that the game has no educational value whatsoever, and it requires redundant actions to continually build up Ponyville.  And don't even get me started on the annoying &#34;updates&#34; to let you know that some Pony or other misses you...do yourself a favor and miss this game completely.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I enjoyed Subway surfers because its fun and I've played on it before so i thought I'd download it myself. I would definitely recommend it to EVERYONE because it is amazing
B009JNXK88|1.0|Not a fun game but a fun concept.  I didn't like the graphics, and the game play is rigid and difficult to manuever.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a fun, fast game that takes concentration when you are one the run.<br />It keeps me busy in my free time.<br />You can shop,and you can buy different people, boards, and power ups.
B003DNH6DK|5.0|Great movie. Would highly recommend watching this. What a great way to start the supper bowl is why we decided to watch Sunday afternoon.
B005GFPZYK|2.0|I just finished this book days after Chris was brutally taken from us. May he rest in peace. He was a true Man.
B008476HBM|5.0|One of my favorites. This book is a classic and I highly recommend it! Don't be discouraged by the style.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|oh my gosh. all I can say. this book is the story of my life. I will definitely read it over and over.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|it's pretty straight forward; very useful and best of all it's free. you can even adjust it to your location.
B00ARAO720|5.0|Great movie for tweeners.  Exciting without being too violent or vulgar. Makes you feel like your riding through the hectic streets of Manhattan on a fixed wheel bike.  Well done.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Use this app every morning with my devotions and am starting to use it instead of my printed Bible. It has so many features I am still trying to wade through them. A great tool to have and you can't beat the price(free). Glad I got it.
B00787IR2Q|5.0|Great movie to watch &#34;again&#34; with the kids this time!  I would recommend this movie for a family movie night.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I like this app and am amazed that it comes in so well. However, not all local staions are on the site. Appearantly not all stations participate with this application or something. Our nearest staions are not included here. Bummer! But alot of others are and can make up for the loss. Can't get local news because of it. Otherwise am happy with it.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|When I first found Elementary I could'nt resist purchasing all of the shows I'd missed.  I hope they can keep up the good work.
B003TNM2K6|5.0|i gave this 5 stars because my mother never likes to watch scary movies but loved this one.  its not all satanic like crazy killer movies.  its a jump out your seat monster movie.
B001226I7Y|5.0|This is a great live recording, not too much crowd noise. I loved this album when it was first released and I still enjoy it now.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This is by far Brandon Sanderson's best work. I cannot wait for the next book. This will be the best fantasy series since the completion of The Wheel of Time. When will the next book be released? Not soon enough.. This book..simply put is EPIC!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This series of 3 books is the most riveting books I have ever read. Every page of every book made me want to hurry up to find out what happened.  I would love more books like these.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It is useful and handy! Love it! I find out very useful when I need to practice my spelling words! :)
B003O86FMW|5.0|This series of 3 books is the most riveting books I have ever read. Every page of every book made me want to hurry up to find out what happened.  I would love more books like these.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an awesome game. I love playing it on my kindle fire. I would recommend it to all my friends an I post invites on my Facebook account.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This series of 3 books is the most riveting books I have ever read. Every page of every book made me want to hurry up to find out what happened.  I would love more books like these.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|I wanted to like this movie. The original Alien is one of my top 10 favorite movies and set the standard for gritty realism in sci-fi. Why then did Ridley Scott resort to directing a big-budget, cliche-ridden, Hollywood bloatbuster? I was deeply disappointed. Where the characters in the original Alien practiced some semblance of scientific decorum, the crew in Prometheus runs around like buzzed high schoolers, ripping off their helmets in questionable environments, opening secure doors for infected crew members, petting hissing alien snakes, infecting other crew members with alien goo and committing to a suicide mission after a one second explanation from someone who's clearly under duress. In other words, they blindly do the very things likely to get them killed in a gratuitous manner. And these people were supposed to be responsible for a trillion dollar mission.<br /><br />The larger problem with Prometheus is the severely muddled plotline. The \\"Engineers\\" created life on Earth and left clues for our distant ancestors on how to find them, but they seem none too happy to see us when we finally show up. They immediately rip the head off of our best model android. BTW, do all android come with perforation lines around their necks so that all their heads rip off easily like a Bounty select-a-size paper towel? Rumor has it that the first draft of Prometheus, written by John Spaihts adhered more closely to the \\"Alien\\" universe and dealt more with the Xenomorphs, but suffered from pacing problems. So they brought in Damon Lindelof of \\"Lost\\" fame to spiff up the script. Why they thought bringing in a writer who penned and produced an entire television series that made no sense would help, I don't know.<br /><br />One final note. In the transition from Spaihts script to Lindelof's, most of the character played by Charlize Theron (Meredith Vickers)must have been left on the cutting room floor because her character is utterly pointless. She should have been cut from the film entirely and her screen time used to better explain the backstory.
0812984412|1.0|What a waste of time reading this book - the ending was weak and pointless.  The author took what could have been a very creative, impressive story & completely ruined it, partly with diluted plots, but worse, with disturbing, random violence against children & teens suddenly stuck into the story here & there, which didn't have anything at all to do with the plot and added nothing to the plot.  You can't unread it once you do - made me feel sick to my stomach.  I hoped the movie left that out and fixed the huge plot gaps & trailing unfinished story lines, but I couldn't watch it because those scenes would bother me too much if they were included.  One of the plots- with the reporter -turned into an action movie-style plot full of unlikely close calls and attempts at witty one-liners.  All the plots just trailed off and ended - I was expecting some kind of tie-in at the end but instead he introduced more new, shallow characters that answered nothing.  Toward the end I was just glad it was almost done.  This book was hyped.
B00A1EOBJQ|2.0|Sticker on the CD said it included song: Fade into you, but its not on the actualy CD. So very odd with that.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|They did an awesome job on all of these movies. Most of the time any movies they make a number 2 or 3 to are lame and annoying but these seem to get better and better. This was by far my FAVORITE I absolutely loved it and so did the family!!!
B0075MFS9Y|1.0|I expected all the music to be as good as, if not better than, the Ho Hey.  I was extremely disappointed.  I listened to all of the songs, then filed it away, not to be pulled out again.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I really enjoy these movies. I have friends who dont like them but I think they are very entertaining. I do like movies set in the past and i enjoy seeing how life was like.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Followed in my daughters footsteps and ordered the rest of the season.  And glad of it!  I could choose the time I could watch it without interruptions.<br />Again, we were left with a cliffhanger to hold on to until next season.  Sad and  happy.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|This is a very good movie. I was happy that even though it was a sequel that it turned out so well . We all enjoyed it alot
B00B2V66VS|5.0|great game addicting get to mine crat riding fffuuuuunnnnnn i absoeulutly love it awesome<br /> great game makers did well. bye
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|We rented this and we all watched it. It was a little different but I think all in all we liked it. Not one those we have to watch it again movies but entertaining enough for one rental :)
B00APJLX8E|4.0|Very entertaining great family movie.  A must see if you like a lot of funny mixed withy a pinch of scary....
B0086DBE62|5.0|I loved this movie. I thought that it was very well acted. It had to be soooo fun for Roberts to play the wicked step mom. Its not the normal snow white movie but we all still loved it immensely!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love it so much. great game. perfect sequel. Cant wait to see a temple run three. go imangi studios
B009VB7P6G|5.0|We rented this when hubby was out of town. I actually sat there and watched most of it with the girls . They all loved it and now want our own copy. 5 stars!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game ever I never ever seen a game like this one this game is awesome I wish they made a subway surfers two
B007R12TNQ|5.0|My kids wanted to watch this the second they saw it was out on video. We rented it several times and they love it. 5 stars
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I haven't had much trouble with it yet. My kids love playing the game. They feel like they're being responsible.
B0026KX4HS|5.0|The menin black movies are all very enjoyable. WE all love them and would recommend them to anyone who likes sci-fi movies.!
B0051CSI0G|5.0|It is one of the really good vampire movies. Here vampires don't sparkle and they are pretty much a mix of vampire and a zombie. They don't die of sunlight and are quite different from original vampires. The movie has bandits/brotherhoods, 3 types of vampires and survivors. For almost a 2-hour movie, the story didn't get boring and actors were quite good. I will recommend it to both any fans of vampire and zombie movies.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|Okay I am the parent and this is my favorite ice age movie!  They are all great though.  Great price and delivery!
B001EJGQTU|5.0|bob mcnamara was the secretary of defense in the jfk administration. mr. mcnamara recounts his life in interviews in this film. his accounts of his service to jfk are fascinating and very moving. i purchased this film with instant video on amazon prime. i am now watching it on my pc. check this film out. happy shopping. aloha haleiwa jon
B005LAIISA|5.0|We tried this on demand first so see what the kiddo thought and it played 5 times in 24 hours!  So I ordered and it came within two days.  I was so pleased since he was asking about his new movie!  LOVE LOVE this movie.  &#34;My precious&#34;!!!!
B00004RF9B|5.0|Classic file that will forever be rated as GREAT in my books.<br />Please continue the fantastic operation we have all come to adore.
0316228532|1.0|The protagonist is named Fairweather, the daughter of the meth addict antagonist Krystal Wheedon.  Need I say more?  Trying to imitate the sex sells formula works only if there is good characterization and a plot.<br /><br />Why would anyone put themselves through the misery of reading this?  If it weren't the book club selection for this month, I would have put this book down after chapter 2. This book has absolutely no merit. I wish I could ask for the week of evenings I gave up to read this book back.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Grisham's first black lawyer hero and it all starts in prison. Very surprising, interesting twists along the road to the reveal. Grisham is Grisham and at his best in this one.
B005I6EU7U|3.0|Very nice looking cover but does not fit the Fires.  I will keep it but am disappointed!  Beware if u own a Fire!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I'm about half way through this book and already feel compelled to leave a review. This is one of the few books I have read that I actually find hard putting down. As I read this book before bed, the only thing that forces me to stop is my fatigue. I have for the past few mornings awoke with excitement to read more; the book has such a profound effect on me that I am STILL excited about it upon waking. As some other reviewers have pointed out, due to the subject of the book, it doesn't seem like it would have much of an exciting story; that it would become stale, but this couldn't be further from the truth.<br /><br />Andy Weir has really done a lot of research into botany, physics, chemistry, electronics, NASA etc. He has created a very believable and tangible scenario for a near-future astronaut stranded on Mars. I remember reading somewhere that he spent 3 years writing this book and it shows (except with the odd grammatical errors and missing words). Hopefully his next book won't take another 3 years to come out though :P.<br /><br />This will definitely be a favourite of mine and I can't wait to see how it ends!
859037985X|5.0|Essential if you are planning to progam in Lua (5.1 or 5.2).  In my opinion it's worth study even if you don't plan a Lua project just for the programming advice and examples (in the tradition of &#34;Software Tools&#34; by Kernighan and Plauger).
B0091REZMW|5.0|The game has some minor problems but once you get around them it's very addictive. Friends you meet will help you with collections. I really enjoy this game. It's not about hidden objects but is all about collections and missions.
0345803507|5.0|The first book was a quick read; the second and third just as fascinating.  It is a page turner and you do fall in love with the main characters.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|So much I didn't know about Queen Victoria<br />I love the story and the Victorian age and the dress and castles
0345803493|5.0|The first book was a quick read; the second and third just as fascinating.  It is a page turner and you do fall in love with the main characters.
B007Q1GJA6|5.0|This arrived in perfect condition and super fast. Hilarious movie! Love that it finally came out on BluRay, an instant classic for sure.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I bought it because it looked interesting and fun.And because it got good reviews. There are no instructions. I have yet to figure it out!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The perfect balance of tragic and beautiful, this story appeals to all of the emotions. Warning: may become attached to/fall in love with the characters.
B00AL1ONN8|5.0|I love T.I music & this is a great album & if I have to choose  favorite song it will be Sorry w/ Andre 3000
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Hopeless is one of my favorite reads ever! It was captivating and full surprises. I would recommend this book to anyone from 17 to 71!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|If my review's title offended you, than you'll probably be offended by some of the language used in the book. I loved the informality, with all swears, jokes and slang. There are some typos, but not enough to hinder the enjoyment, although I think the use of &#34;in to&#34; and &#34;on to&#34; instead of &#34;in&#34;, &#34;on&#34;, &#34;into&#34;, &#34;onto&#34; or &#34;to&#34; sometimes a bit annoying but not such a big deal either (these are the kind of minor annoyances that one should overlook in self-published books, IMHO).  Great story that kept me interested all the time. It is mostly told through Mark's log entries, who uses a good amount of Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics to solve many of his problems. The Author convinced me about most of the science he mentioned in the book and the story sounded very plausible (I don't know his background, but he probably made some research). Of course, Mark Watney is a kind of &#34;MacGyver&#34; stranded on Mars, but even though, his deeds seemed not so impossible to be achieved.  I tried the sample and bought the book right away and haven't regretted a minute.  One last information, and I want to stress this, since I DO value it (a lot!); &#34;The Martian&#34; IS NOT a book in A SERIES and you'll get at the end of a complete and delightful adventure in this installment. An easy 5 stars and a steal at $0.99!
B000002N3J|5.0|This Album doesn't include Madonna's hit songs, such as Like a Virgin, Borderline, Vogue, Papa Don't Preach, etc etc. If you want those songs, get the Immaculate Collection. This Album offers so much more, even though I'm not a fan of Compilation Album's, this one is simply so amazing.<br />  The album offers Madonna's more lyrical, heart touching, and emotional songs. Even though I'm crazy about her dance music, and everything else, her emotional tracks will always be my favorites. This album includes a few exclusives you can't get on her other albums, such as You'll See, I'll Remember, One More Chance; and it also includes her most lyrical songs from her past albums, like Take a Bow, Live to Tell, and my favorite song from her, Oh Father.<br />  The songs are so amazing, it includes just about every underrated song from her past albums, as well as a few new great track's. I have absolutely no problem with the music, its amazing. The lyrics for each song are so deep and meaningful. My personal favorites from this album are Oh Father, You'll See, One More Chance, and This Used to be my Playground.<br />  If you're a casual Madonna fan, purchase it. If you're a core Madonna fan, you probably already own this and are looking at other review's to see who else has good taste in this world. :), My only issue with this album is I wish it included Till Death Do us Part from Like a Prayer instead of Forbidden Love, but that't not even an issue really. The album is genius, it shows Madonna's more lyrical side, and how underrated she can be. This album is completely genius, and a must own.
B006LSZECO|5.0|So many twists and turns.  Every time you are sure you have it all figured out, the story takes you to another place.
B0083IQFD2|5.0|Azealia Banks has to be one of the greatest rappers up to date. I am so in love with her music! Azealia Banks is completely innovative when it comes to music. Her sound for her music has a real 90's Hip Hop feel, which is my opinion was the greatest time for Hip-Hop, but it also sounds really new. I think Azealia is completely innovative when it comes to sound, she talks a lot of how she explores different types of music to try to create a new sound, and thats exactly what her music does, its new. Each song of the Album has its own creative sound to it, it doesnt sound like you are hearing the same track each time with different lyrics like with most Rappers.<br />  Her rapping is also great, though not everyone seems to like it. I personally think her rapping is great, because it sounds really different. Lil Kim and Queen Latifah had this Hard Core Flow of rapping which sounded great, and Missy Elliott and Nicki Minaj have this comedic way of rapping, but Azeala's rapping is completely new. Even though you dont really understand what shes saying half the time, it sounds so creative, and its never overdone. I really have never heard another rapper sound like this, and this is why I love Azealia so much.<br />  Each track sounds different in its own way:<br />1991: It has a real 90's feel to it (Its intended to sound that way guessing by the music), but it also sounds really new. It's the perfect balance of new and old. I love that Azealia is not afraid to show where her roots are.<br /><br />Van Vogue: My favorite song from this EP. I cant really describe how this track sounds, and that's probably why I like it so much. The track feels like its so ahead of its time. Its indescribable.<br /><br />212: I like this song, but its definitely not my favorite, its not even Azealia's favorite for that matter. Its a good sounding track, and I love it, but its not her best. I also hate that this is the only track people know Azealia by. Sure its a great song, and its catchy, but Azealia has so much more to offer than 212.<br /><br />Liquorice: Sounds a lot like a pop song, and its great. Its catchy, and it doesn't sound like every other Pop Song you would hear on the Radio. I cant help but dance anytime I hear this song.<br /><br />  I think the coolest thing about this EP, its that even though it has 4 songs, none of them get old to me. No other artist has really gave that effect to me. Even though i've heard each track probably like 60 times, it still feels new sometimes when I hear that, and maybe that's because of her style of rapping. Because she rap's so fast, and in such a different way, you sometime's hear different lyrics each time. I think Azealia is not only a good rapper but when it comes to music producing, shes the next best thing for Hip-Hop since Missy Elliott. I cant wait for her debut album!but Azealia has so much more to offer than 212.<br /><br />Liquorice: Sounds a lot like a pop song, and its great.

B0052RDHTM|5.0|You get a great dose of history in  this wonderful family legacy novel.  I can't wait for #3 to come out.
B00B99QTM4|5.0|Could watch this movie over & over & over again and never get tired of it.  It is my husband's & mine must see on Groundhog Day.
B007HACDLK|5.0|The book is well written and keeps you intrested from beginning to end.  If you like espionage it's well worth reading.<br />I would recommend this book.
B00A8KJK7G|1.0|Both my daughters hated the movie. Oldest is 11, youngest 9. Nine year old cryed hystericaly at the end. Huge waste of money
B004J4WN0I|5.0|I love finding a new author whose writing can capture my attention from the opening paragraph. This is definitely a series worth reading.
B00004YRQA|5.0|Great! Worked the first time. No problems using this product.  The first time I put it in the PS2 it worked well.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|My son loved these movies as they came out. Now we can watch the entire series whenever we want and in the time we have to spare.
B009329Y30|3.0|It was predictable story, but that was expected.<br />The only problem was the casting of Taylor, she was not right for the role. A younger more likable personality would have improved this movie a lot. Im 42, she looked like she is my age. (If your offended by that, too bad) There was no chemistry with Zack, who has a likable screen presence,<br />Other than that casting was good.<br />A little hokie but not a bad movie.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|This is the most useful prouct I ever had.<br />Would recomend it to everyone. It does what it claims.<br />I use it on three computers.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I've fallen in love with Once Upon a Time since the first episode! A show about popular stories with a twist! It's romantic, funny, charming, unpredictable and magical. I love that they do flashbacks of their world! I'd recommend buying the seasons on DVD if you love this show so you can watch it as much as you want. Comes with bonus features as well! Great for anyone who loves stories or just OUAT in general :)
B004XXIHS2|5.0|Book was difficult to put down.  No clue who &#34;he&#34; was until nearly half way through, so the mystery was provided.  A very good read.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I could not put this book down! Such a great love story! I would definitely recommend this book to anyone! It was a great read and I can't wait to go on to the next book!
B003B02O3C|2.0|Story was boring, and everything was written in the present tense.  Excitement and tension were left out, and main character seemed like a dope.
B009TZ7WDK|4.0|The Johnsthan & Charlotte collection is kind of amazing when you consider how young these people are.  I wish they had thrown in a few popular tunes.
B00APJLX8E|4.0|I thought this movie was very entertaining for adults and children. I was impressed with the humor in this movie kept our attention, it also kept the attention of our children (which rarely happens)!
B0079R8KO0|4.0|The case protects my kindle and was a great price. It was easy to put on and take off. The only downside is , is when you are charging your kindle you can not close your case. It's not a big deal but the plug is located at the bind of the case.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|I couldn't put the book down! It was cool to see what the people in future generations thought of us.
B0058YZEWW|5.0|I've been running for the last two weeks on the cold and snowy shores of Lake Michigan.  These shoes have performed awesome while keeping my feet warm and dry.
0446547603|5.0|I LOVED this book! I only watched the preview for the movie before reading it, to get an idea of how to imagine things. It was really great.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The best game ever that I play it every day anyone who hating on my swag stop hating. Ok ok
B005LAZIRY|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this album. If you're a fan of Pink Floyd, Led Zepplin, Mastadon, Clutch, then this album will sit well in your collection. The album seems to be a intricate detail of all the times you've heard the quiet and slightly sinister preludes to many of the explosive death metal style riffs in the previous Opeth offerings, yet still breaking into groovalicious jams on a regular basis without all the death metal vocals. Have an Uncle that's a music fan but won;t share your sentiments on the style of music you listen to? Slip him one of these discs and you'll instantly have some common ground.
B009MO5960|5.0|It was ok but I liked the other ones better.Yes I would still recomend this to other people  to buy and watch.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Couldn't wait, bought the pass. Best season ever. Also on PBS.com free after shown on TV.  OH MY what an ending......... Couldn't wait..OH MY!....
B004FRX0MY|4.0|I have been using this download for about a week now and it works great the clairity on my phone is nice and crisp and i was it was easy to download from this app to my phone.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|A rare and amazing example of a 'rebooted' franchise that improves upon the original (in some respects) without sullying the legacy. The cast picks are brilliant, the action is exciting, the story is interesting. This is a great movie and I am excited to see where the series goes from here.<br /><br />Even the most ardent Trekkie will find little quarrel with this movie. It's a credit to the others for sure.
B009AMANBA|3.0|One of the problems with the hype that is generated by film producers and critics alike, is that very often, films simply don't live up to expectations. In short, something described as gold, can often turn out to be merely gold-plated. Such is the case with Lincoln. There is no doubt that the cast do extremely well in their appointed roles, & this is particularly true with Tommy Lee Jones, who plays his role to perfection. The same applies to David Strathairn who is simply outstanding, so much so in fact, that it defies belief that he wasn't nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. That decision just has to be the oversight of the acting year. As for Daniel Day-Lewis, undoubtedly one of the finest actors in the world today, & normally a guarantee of a stellar performance, he failed to impress me as Abe Lincoln. He mumbled through much of his performance, & constantly held that hang-dog look, so symptomatic of someone with constant back & neck pain. OK, I know Lincoln was no spring chicken, but Day-Lewis made him look older that the man really was. For me it was a disappointing performance. As usual, Sally Field produced a very credible performance as Mrs Lincoln, although whether it's deserving of an Oscar, is another matter. There certainly have been better performances from many actresses this year. On the upside though, the cinematography & production design work exceptional & it's great to see that those responsible are now Oscar nominees. They are certainly deserving. Now to directing; Steven Spielberg has brought us some wonderful films during his career as to date, however, on the basis of some of his more recent works, it would not be wrong to suggest that his talents have been somewhat on the wane in recent years. The heady days of ET, Schindler's List, Indiana Jones, The Colour Purple, Close Encounters, Saving Private Ryan & the like, are well & truly past. War Horse, while a great story, performed by a great cast, again featuring great cinematography& production & set work, was lacking in direction, & this was highlighted in the film's conclusion which seemed limp & contrived. After watching Lincoln, I find it so curious that Spielberg would be Oscar nominated for Directing. Particularly when Ben Affleck was overlooked for his stellar work in Argo, which together with Django Unchained & Silver Linings Playbook, are the only real films deserving of the Best Picture Oscar. Overlong & sometimes tedious to watch (a fate shared by Zero Dark Thirty), Lincoln was a huge disappointment for me.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|As was the first book in the Martin series, A Clash of Kings is brilliant. I can't it down. Can't wait to read the next one.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|I hate this game because I played it once then the second time I played it it my kindle wouldent turn on. :-(
0802473156|5.0|A guide that has so much truth and wisdom.<br />It can be a bit scary though will give you all the confidence needed for the future
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|AWESOME!!!  This is so fun to play. Beautiful colors, great puzzles. Easy to play.Fun, fun,fun!!!<br />I would recommend to anyone who loves to play Mahjong!
B001QB5S3G|3.0|Maybe I just expected more of a movie starring Robert De Niro and Liam Neeson, but I was disappointed.  The plot moved slow from the beginning.  The pace never seemed to pick up.  The overall theme of the movie was good, but that, of course, made the ending predictable.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|believable and it is not something that tries to show that you are naive. it is nice and easy to wtch
B0050DIWFC|5.0|The characters emotions are palpable and changing throughout the book which keeps the reader totally engaged.<br />Wonderful, powerful read. Enjoy.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Fast reading  hard to put down and kept you wondering, what next?  Not sure what else you want me to say
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I read the hardcover version of this book, and I have to say that it was one of the best books I have ever read. I normally don't like non fiction books because they're just facts and there's no creativity or super cool stuff (in some books there are though, like this one). This book was one of my favorite books ever. It's a nonfiction book that is still really cool and there are many funny parts. I would definitely recommend this book to anybody!
0345803485|5.0|Had me from the start!  Who could not fall in love with Chritian?  Such the ultimate alpha man!!  His heart needs mending and I like how Ana works to accomplish that.  He must learn to trust!
B00683JK9K|5.0|Works great on my galaxy s3, surprisingly well in fact. Had no issues with solving several of the puzzles. Only drawback is the small board and large pieces, almost too easy, other than that great product.
0345803493|3.0|The sequel moved a little slower than the first book.  Liked some of the issues that arose to keep story moving...found myself skimming a bit at the numerous sexacapes after awhile.. Like it when the plot kicks back in!
B002QBS9KE|5.0|All of the original parts had broken and i thought i was going yo have to buy another bluetooth. I had been looking for months for replacement parts. These parts were a prefect match....saved me at least $100!
0345803507|5.0|Very sexy, stimulating, enthralling...what else can I say?  Loved, loved, loved the epilogue!  I wish there was another one coming!
B0096PYUE2|4.0|I got to the bottom of this! The app a flash player. It is Kindle! This app works for android devices, so do not blame the app. I personally am not buying anymore kindle devices until they get flash player, I enjoy reading,but sometimes I want to play games. And this app store is generic! Make the app store better as well. I give the app 4 stars,but kindle gets 0!
B007FC3AAI|1.0|This movie is crap! Do not buy ! complete waste of time.. Waste of money ... that all i have to say !
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I absolutely love true blood. I can not get enough of it . This was one of the best seasons and got me hooked.  it still holds my attention more than other HBO series.
B004KBSQBA|5.0|I forgot how wonderful this cd is untill i saw a  documentary on public radio. Paul Simon brought somethig great to American music when he made this cd.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Excellent time wasting game. Lovely tiles. I'm off to find more of the same! Great game for us pensioners! Keeps the old grey matter ticking over.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Could not put this book down. By far the most interesting book Ive read in a long time. I highly recommend you adding this to your must read list!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest will change how you view the Internet and how you use any spare time. It's addictive, fun and often funny.
B008BM9L72|3.0|Definitely not as exciting as everyone is raving about. I enjoyed reading the book series but did struggle through some sections. It took me a few months to read this, which is unlike me.
B000R7HY0K|4.0|this is the reason why i got started collecting the old grindhouse  films me being young didn't know much of the til this thank you quenentin and robert you guys are gods
B005EGXTHG|5.0|If you think the hunger games is good, then please ensure you keep reading. Catching Fire is even better than the 1st. Loved every second of it and really struggled to put it down.
B000AM6OQ2|5.0|the fog is an good film a story like i never seen before like all carpenters movies are every time i see tons a fog outside i want to go out in it and see what i can find lol a must have for carpenter fans
6304698755|5.0|The perfect vehicle for Cary Grant? His character is an angel who is charming, suave, witty, good with children and animals and invariably correct with his advice. Grant is the consummate professional. Oh, Loretta Young and David Niven aren't so bad either. It's best viewed in December and almost as good the other eleven months of the year. No disrespect to Denzel, but you can't beat the original.
B000FDECGA|5.0|a classic at its best and dubbed in english but not in a bad way no extra mouth movement as a collector of grindhouse films this is a must have . i wanted this one so bad after i was watching kill bill and they talked about it already being a fan of those types of movies
B006LSZECO|1.0|Was disappointed in this book.  Since it was on the best seller list for so long I was sure it would be good.  I did not find one character in the book I liked and the story line was a trifle unbelievable.  I did finish it because I thought it would have to end well.  Nope.
B001JV5BIA|5.0|the orignal  restored thanks to the remake which is also good this is a classic must have for anyone who collects the grindhouse type films
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I love this book it if full of twist and runs please read it!!!!!<br />I HOPE  YOU LIKE IT TO!!!!<br /><br />-A.<br />*****
B009DH379C|5.0|This dvd of one of the most underrated rock bands in history is a must for Queen Fans! This 90min.film not only features a great concert,It also documents the bands trip behind the long gone Iron Curtain.It was shot in 35mm format and the picture quality is outstanding!The sound also leaves nothing to be desired!There is also an additional 26.50min.documentary titled A Magic Year that is quite informative.I shopped around and found the best price here at amazon and delivery was swift!In closing.I would recomend this dvd to everyone,Queen fan or not!
B004I8WD6E|5.0|This is a great item. I like it because it is clear & you can see the iPhone & it protects it really well.
1401937519|4.0|I think this book is beautifully written and do not deny Mrs. Moorjani had an incredible experience but I was hoping for a more detailed description of the actual near death experience.  It's really only captured in 1 or 2 chapters but her life before the experience was interesting in and of itself.  I don't know if I agree with or believe (and what do I know?) that everything, all of life's existence, is happening all at once.  She describes it as being linear.  To me that would be like watching a movie that's already been made and would definitely negate the existence of free will.  If we have free will, events can change on a dime based on our decisions.  If everything is happening (has happened) already then we're basically just acting out a pre-written play.  Mrs. Moorjani doesn't believe that previous life experiences are possible and that we only live once, in this life.  There is substantiated evidence to the contrary and even Dr. Dyer had a past life regression so I'm curious as to what his thoughts are on this matter.  I think that her healing was miraculous and am glad she made it known there is a life beyond this existence, especially if it allays the fears of non-believers.  It's interesting to note that there have been many near death experiences and most did not return with the absence of illness so this is truly remarkable.  Also, some who've had these experiences have stated they have an option as to whether or not they can return.  If everything is written, we would not get the choice.  Although, it's possible to argue we only think we're getting the choice and God only gives the option to those He knows will choose to return.  There's a lot to think about and this book instigates provocative thought.  I guess I just want more answers like everyone else.  God bless her, her family and her future and I appreciate her sharing this experience.
